Stab wound on his left side.

5
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:22,641
Pulse 150 over 100.

6
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:23,818
He's got excessive bleeding.

7
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:25,019
I suspect he has internal bleeding.

8
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,178
Prepare a blood transfusion.

9
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:27,084
Prepare an MRI as well.

10
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:28,150
Yes.

11
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:32,176
What's going on?

12
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:34,699
Is the investigation taking a long time?

13
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:54,783
Oh Cho-rim.

14
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:05,321
Cho-rim.

15
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:07,448
Don't be surprised and listen carefully.

16
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,898
Detective Choi was in an accident.

17

Officer Choi. Officer Choi.

20
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:55,530
Officer Choi. Wake up.

21
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,415
How is he? How bad is he hurt?

22
00:03:58,415 --> 00:04:00,233
Is his life in danger or something?

23
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:03,337
Cho-rim. Calm down.

24
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:10,235
Cho-rim, come with me.

25
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,595
He lost a lot of blood.

26
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:26,430
They said he's unconscious
because he was in shock.

27
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,642
What happened to him?

28
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:31,946
I think he came face-to-face with the
murderer when he was investigating.

29
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:34,147
"I saw the face of the murderer."

30
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:38,090
He said this one thing,
then he fell into a coma.

31
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,110
Is it that serial killer?

32
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,958
Did he try to kill Officer Choi?

33
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,352
Hey.

34
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,407
Detective Choi saw the culprit's face?

35
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:55,799
What does that mean?

36
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:57,794
Did he really see the culprit's face?

37
00:04:57,794 --> 00:04:58,807
Who is he?

38
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:01,770
We'll find out everything once he wakes up.

39
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,682
Excuse me.

40
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:07,172
Detectives Ki and Yeh.

41
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:10,952
Please go to the crime scene and
find a witness who saw the attack.

42
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:12,454
Yes.

43
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:17,484
Chief, please use all your networks to spread
the news about Officer Choi's attack.

44
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,267
We may be able to find a witness.

45
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:27,368
I want to see Detective Choi's
face just for a moment.

46
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:32,872
Even if all of you were to see him,
this case won't be solved.

47
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:42,907
Lieutenant Yeom is such a
cold-blooded person,

48
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,535
she wouldn't even shed a
drop of blood if she was stabbed.

49
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,593
We were the ones who weren't thinking.

50
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,087
She didn't say anything wrong.

51
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,199
Did I do something wrong?

52
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,260
No.

53
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,896
He has to be okay.

54
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:08,566
Why did he have to get attacked
in the blind spot of all places?

55
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:10,079
We can't see anything.

56
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,913
Do you have any other
surveillance video footage?

57
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,370
No, we don't.

58
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,812
The jerk who stabbed our detective is
a cruel and cold-blooded killer.

59
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,281
Wasn't there anyone suspicious?

60
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,243
Anyone you might suspect?

61
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:27,029
Even Detective Choi said he saw
the face of the killer, so how could you

62
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,501
not have seen his face when
you're keeping watch here?

63
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,889
Why do you sit here?

64
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,625
You should've kept better watch here.

65
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,930
You said the detective who was stabbed
saw the culprit's face.

66
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,487
He's unconscious after his surgery.

67
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,669
That's why we're questioning you.

68
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,504
It's a matter of time before
we catch the culprit.

A golden fish must...

70
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:28,404
A golden fish must...

...meet a hermit.

72
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:32,783
...meet a hermit.

00:07:58,002 --> 00:07:59,495
Yes, Chef.

76

What's wrong? You don't look so well.

77
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,259
What's going on?

78
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,559
Officer Choi is in the hospital.

79
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:13,729
Really... Why?

80
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,171
He was investigating last night and...

81
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:23,165
He came face-to-face with that serial killer.

82
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:26,853
The killer who murdered
Joo Ma-ri and Dr. Chun.

83
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:29,717
Ah... That killer...

84
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,053
Did he see him?

85
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,880
Yes.

86
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:40,716
Then it's possible that they'll
catch the killer soon, right?

87
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:44,885
I'm sure that will happen once he wakes up.

88
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:47,824
But he's still unconscious.

89
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:52,516
That's too bad.

90
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:10,724
By the way... why did the culprit go to
Chun Baek-gyung's storage?

91
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,448
It was dangerous for him...

92
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:16,704
That's probably because there was something
important there, so he went to get it.

93
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,800
Something that can't be found
by someone else?

94
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,837
What would that be?

95
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:22,828
How would I know that?

96
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,711
Something like a black box that has
a picture of the face of the killer?

97
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:28,710
That's right. Something like
that for example...

98
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,055
Something that he wouldn't be able to deny...

99
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:33,373
Dr. Chun was probably a witness.

100
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:37,245
He probably was a witness
who can testify against the culprit.

101
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:39,474
That's why he killed him.

102
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:46,140
The reason the killer broke his 12-month-
serial-murder-cycle rule is

103
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,630
that someone witnessed him
committing the murder.

104
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:58,969
That means our Choi Moo-gak is the
only one who saw the killer's face.

105
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:00,775
A witness...

106
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:08,629
Detective Choi, you're just pretending
because you're scared, aren't you?

107
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:10,645
What are you saying?

108
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:13,521
They say patients can hear until the end.

109
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:15,484
You have to talk to the
patient for a fast recovery.

110
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:18,928
What do you mean "until the end"?

111
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:31,546
But it really looks as though he's listening.

112
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:33,541
They said the surgery went well.

113
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,045
According to the doctor, he should be
able to wake up in two to three days.

114
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:39,082
Let's wait and see.

115
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:41,050
Please get some rest.

116
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,741
I'll stand guard here.

117
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:44,383
No. I'll do it.

118
00:10:44,383 --> 00:10:46,172
You've been here all this time.

119
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:49,221
You should try to get some sleep
even for a little while.

120
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:52,300
He's my team member. I'm fine.

121
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:56,991
Please let me, sir.

122

Hey, if you guys really want to work all
night, you can take over my graveyard shift.

Hey, Detective Ki. Detective Yeh.

124
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,796
Chef, were there lunch box orders?

125
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:46,800
No. I was feeling down because
Officer Choi was hurt, so I was going to

126
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,588
take some lunch boxes and
visit him at the hospital.

127
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:52,012
Would you like to come with me?

128
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,918
Thank you. I'll help, too.

129
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:03,626
By the way, is Detective Choi conscious yet?

130
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:06,368
They're supposed to call me when

131
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:08,557
he's conscious, but I haven't
been contacted yet.

132
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,579
I wasn't sure how many detectives
were at the hospital, so I didn't know

133
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,034
how many lunch boxes to prepare...

134
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:25,019
When I was there yesterday,
I think there were four of them.

135
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,426
Really?

136
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:32,057
I should make delicious food so I can
ask them to take good care of Detective Choi.

137
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:39,199
Hello. Hello.

138
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,568
Cho-rim.

139
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:41,584
I'm so hungry.

140
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,246
I've been waiting for the lunch boxes.

141
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:44,822
You've waited so long. Please eat.

142
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:48,546
Chef Kwon prepared it personally.

143
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:50,340
We'll enjoy it, Chef Kwon.

144
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,098
Thank you.

145
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:55,480
Please eat a lot. I'm going to
go see Detective Choi.

146
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,383
Go ahead.

147
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:58,019
Go ahead.

148
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:44,265
Chef Kwon?

149
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:45,999
Ah, yes.

150
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:48,459
I met you at Joo Ma-ri's autopsy, right?

151
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:53,034
Ah... Lieutenant? Thank you for
all your hard work.

152
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:58,814
It must be hard for you since such horrible
things happened to two people close to you.

153
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:05,887
It'll be helpful if the police
can catch the culprit soon.

154
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:09,897
The people close to the victims usually

155
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:17,532
avoid the police and the cases
altogether, but you're not like that.

156
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:19,874
I try not to avoid difficulties usually.

157
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:22,672
I resolve them by facing them.

158
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:28,713
You really are a chef who's
successful in business.

159
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:33,948
Anyway, thank you for visiting
Detective Choi like this.

160
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,039
I hope Detective Choi
makes a quick recovery.

161
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,218
Thank you.

162

"Oh Cho-rim, your credit card
payment is due today."

163
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,460
Hey, Officer Choi will be fine.

164
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,534
Drink this and calm down.

165
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:29,542
I'm not in the mood to
drink sweet coffee.

166
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:32,793
Just drink it anyway.
You'll feel the effects.

167
00:15:32,793 --> 00:15:35,200
I told you I don't want to.

168
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,989
Hey, this isn't coffee.

169
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,810
You really have a dog's sense of smell.

170
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:53,688
This is soju, isn't it?

171
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:57,198
I bought it at a convenience store
and poured it into the cup.

172
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,368
Drink the soju and stop worrying
about Officer Choi.

173
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:05,608
What about the snacks?

174
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,337
I put them under the paper.

175
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,379
Congratulations on getting discharged.

176
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:07,788
Please be healthy.

177
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:12,072
Don't move.

178
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,278
The plan has failed.

179
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:21,949
He's just a clown who congratulates
a patient getting discharged.

180
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:26,208
The culprit was reading all our movements.

181
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,783
Who ordered you to do this?

182
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,647
Give me your cell phone.

183
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:38,879
Are you sure you didn't see his face?

184
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:41,123
He ordered it over the phone.

185
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:43,674
How am I supposed to see his face?

186
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,159
He's not answering the phone.

187
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,873
It's already turned off.

188
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,696
It's a stolen phone number for sure.

189
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:51,496
He got us good this time.

190
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:55,250
We'll return this to you after
we examine it further.

191
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:59,481
This jerk is really annoying me.

192
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:02,150
I'm so pissed.

193
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:18,996
I'm sorry. The plan was foiled.

194
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:22,400
We lost to the culprit.

195
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,989
We didn't lose.

196
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,929
It's one to one.

197
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:30,805
Just think of it as we took one
and he took one.

198
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:32,241
Excuse me?

199
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:39,701
He has one point since he's sure
the police don't know his face.

200
00:20:39,701 --> 00:20:42,385
What about the point we got?

201
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:45,854
We now know the culprit is close to us.

202
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:47,543
The false information that we spread

203
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:52,798
reached the culprit this fast and
he made a move so quickly.

204
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,364
It's clear proof the culprit is close to us.

205
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,418
That's right.

206
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:07,431
Whatever happened, I'm just glad
nothing happened to you.

207
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:11,370
It was a plan putting your life
on the line to lure the culprit.

208
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:16,858
I should've seen the face of the culprit
when he stabbed me. It's regrettable.

209
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,889
You can just rest for today.

210
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:24,204
I posted an officer outside on guard.

211
00:21:24,204 --> 00:21:26,758
I'm going to go.

212
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:28,354
Thank you.

213
00:21:48,563 --> 00:21:52,052
I guess it's much better you
lied than your actually being sick.

214
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:53,812
Really?

215
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,191
Unconscious?

216
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,760
I actually knew you were just pretending.

217
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,791
I just felt that you weren't unconscious.

218
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,722
It sounded so sad though...

219
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:06,955
What sounded so sad?

220
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:11,235
How is Officer Choi?

221
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:12,744
Just how bad is he hurt?

222
00:22:12,744 --> 00:22:15,577
Is his life in danger?

223
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:27,642
Since you were crying so sadly, I almost gave
up the plan and got up to cry with you.

224
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:30,496
That's because people are
supposed to be sad and cry

225
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:34,949
when you see a neighbor's dog hurting
for instance.

226
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:37,227
Don't you know that?

227
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:39,345
Were you sad?

228
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:44,239
I didn't' think that you were doing
such a dangerous work.

229
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,487
So from now on, please think about
yourself as continue to work.

230
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:48,704
I'm thankful that you weren't any worse.

231
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:51,665
Do you know how shocked I was?

232
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,281
Hey, Oh Cho-rim.

233
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:02,762
Oh Cho-rim!

234
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:04,592
That surprised me.

235
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:08,053
I'm sorry. Were you shocked?

236
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,771
It was really dangerous just now.

237
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:15,403
You are more dangerous to me than the killer.

238
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:19,495
I'll show you what a real danger looks like.

239
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:24,800
This cabbage is good, right?

240
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,623
No. The one next to it looks fresher.

241
00:23:31,503 --> 00:23:33,762
You're using me like a remote controller.

242
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:36,882
If some people saw this,
they might think that I'm your girlfriend.

243
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:37,901
Carrot.

244
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:41,463
What? No thank you.

245
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,997
Get the carrot behind you.

246
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:57,183
Go straight now.

247
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:59,970
This way?

248
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,286
Go right again.

249
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:03,083
Right?

250
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:09,657
Go straight and stop.

251
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:15,011
What's this? I'm back at the same place.

252
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:17,125
I didn't know where the rice cake was.

253
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,227
You could've just told me to buy rice cakes.

254
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:22,459
It's so frustrating.

255
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:24,740
Here they are.

256
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,133
Is that good?

257
00:24:27,305 --> 00:24:28,643
What are you going to use for the soup?

258
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:30,245
Anchovies? Kelp?

259
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:33,041
No. Buy me some MSG.

260
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:33,945
Excuse me?

261
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:36,418
My mom's food tastes like MSG.

262
00:24:36,418 --> 00:24:39,586
It has history and tradition.

263
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:42,232
Take your time but come quickly.

264
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:36,810
Do you know how to cook?

265
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,268
It's really easy.

266
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:40,385
Just wait a moment. I'll make it quickly.

267
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:42,972
You just have to do exactly

268
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:45,673
what I told you so don't get any ideas
and ruin the food.

269
00:25:45,673 --> 00:25:48,643
For crying out loud... Just go rest.

270
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:50,296
Okay.

271
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:10,879
How can this be so spicy and
greasy at the same time?

272
00:26:11,755 --> 00:26:14,082
He can't even taste anything anyway.

273
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:17,515
Officer Choi. It's ready. Come down.

274
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:24,926
Eat up. It's delicious.

275
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,402
It's delicious.

276
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:38,130
You cook well.

277
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:54,543
Eat all of it.

278
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:02,830
When I got sick long time ago,
my mom made this for me.

279
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,987
I just remembered that.

280
00:27:05,144 --> 00:27:07,200
I'm getting my energy back thanks to you.

281
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,964
Even though I don't taste anything, I guess
I still have some feelings in my heart.

282
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:19,846
I only have memories of the past three years.

283
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:25,094
I don't remember anything before then.

284
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:28,961
Because of the car accident at that time?

285
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:37,499
That's why I don't have any memories of
my mom and dad.

286
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:46,474
Even when I look at a picture of
my mom and dad, I don't feel anything.

287
00:27:46,474 --> 00:27:47,782
It's funny, isn't it?

288
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:55,430
Even if I don't remember up here...
I should be able to remember it here.

289
00:27:58,286 --> 00:28:01,684
How could I not feel anything?

290
00:28:01,684 --> 00:28:07,912
Sometimes I'm afraid of myself for
not remembering anything.

291
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:11,921
Then why aren't you trying to
recover your memories?

292
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:17,105
My father doesn't like this when
I talk about the accident.

293
00:28:17,105 --> 00:28:22,184
My head hurts when I think about it and
it makes me feel frustrated.

294
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:28,518
It's only right to skip an unresolvable
problem I just can't find the answer to.

295
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:30,992
That's how I think of it now.

296
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:40,161
Everything will fall into the right place
someday even if you don't force yourself.

297
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:43,085
I guess so.

298
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,143
You have something here, Officer Choi...

299
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:06,414
It's already so late.

300
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:08,483
I'm going to go now.

301
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:10,101
You don't have to come out.

302
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:03,430
Yes, Elena Vasilinasvanova.

303
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,680
I'm opening the package you sent me.

304
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,087
Oh my goodness. What is this?

305
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:11,508
It's my face.

306
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:14,213
You missed me so you drew it?

307
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:17,347
First of all, thank you.

308
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:24,233
Put the big one on my desk and
the medium-sized one in the car?

309
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:28,784
And put the small one in my pocket
and take it around with me?

310
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:33,420
Elena Vasilinasvanova, don't you work?

311
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,906
I'm back.

312
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:43,021
There you go again. You're not
coming here. It's dangerous!

313
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:45,246
I'll come to you right now.

314
00:31:45,246 --> 00:31:47,187
Okay. Hang up.

315
00:31:47,848 --> 00:31:49,739
It's your face, Detective Ki.

316
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:52,885
Isn't it cute?

317
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:56,283
The surveillance video footage of

318
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:58,090
the road near that fishing place
will probably come out tomorrow.

319
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,181
We just need it before the meeting tomorrow.

320
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:03,954
That's right. When is Choi Moo-gak
coming back to work?

321
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:05,700
The day after tomorrow.

322
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:08,770
Work hard. I'm leaving.

323
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,168
Yes. Good night.

324
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,154
According to Detective Choi who faced
the serial killer directly,

325
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:37,812
the culprit is about 178 cm tall,
slim, but with a muscular build.

326
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:40,882
His estimated weight is around 68 kg.

327
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:44,061
He is right-handed, strong and agile.

328
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:46,541
Also when we combine the testimonies of

329
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:50,386
the designated driver from the fishing place
and the hospital event employee,

330
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:53,377
the serial killer has a Seoul dialect
with a calm and soft voice.

331
00:32:53,377 --> 00:32:56,463
His estimated age is between late
20s to mid-30s.

332
00:32:56,463 --> 00:33:02,086
But those aren't enough to
be concrete clues.

333
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:03,990
The surveillance videos
are still not ready yet?

334
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,396
I know. I'll go and find out.

335
00:33:10,352 --> 00:33:11,769
It's not clear.

336
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:28,745
The car is parked in an empty lot

337
00:33:28,745 --> 00:33:33,845
between where the camera is on this road,
and the camera on that road.

338
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:38,775
How could there be no record of
that car passing through here?

339
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:41,590
How baffling.

340
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,432
Since we don't know how the cars
were moved to the crime scene in

341
00:33:44,432 --> 00:33:49,009
Joo Ma-ri's case and Chun Baek-gyung's case,
we can't find a clue in those cases.

342
00:33:51,252 --> 00:33:53,031
What's wrong Detective Ki?

343
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,395
Hey, what's wrong?

344
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:59,486
And what's with that strange-looking doll?

345
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,852
This is Chun Baek-gyung's car.

346
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:21,246
We just have to find a car about this big.

347
00:34:21,608 --> 00:34:25,394
He put the smaller one in there.

348
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:32,951
He put the small car inside
the big car... and moved it.

349
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,519
Rewind that left screen video to
Joo Ma-ri's crime scene.

350
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,959
Zoom in.

351
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:54,704
Rewind the video of the road near the fishing
spot in Chun Baek-gyung's crime scene.

352
00:34:54,704 --> 00:34:56,871
Between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m.

353
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:01,433
It's the same truck.

354
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:04,452
They're the same person.

355
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:12,354
So that creep is the serial killer who
stabbed Detective Choi Moo-gak, right?

356
00:35:51,226 --> 00:35:53,260
I'm sorry for your loss.

357
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,732
May he rest in peace.

358
00:35:56,732 --> 00:35:59,155
Thank you, detectives.

359
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:09,182
Goodbye.

360
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:13,200
Chef Kwon.

361
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:21,030
Did you come by to pay your respects?

362
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,171
Yes.

363
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:23,365
Did you come here to
pay your respects as well?

364
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:26,455
He's the main organizer of this funeral.

365
00:36:26,455 --> 00:36:30,198
We're only able to do this because
Chef Kwon is paying for this.

366
00:36:30,198 --> 00:36:33,297
I wouldn't have been able to
pay for this funeral by myself.

367
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:35,848
Thank you so much, Chef Kwon.

368
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:38,323
Say nothing more.

369
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,933
Then goodbye.

370
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:44,379
Yes, Lt. Yeom. Goodbye.

371
00:36:50,885 --> 00:36:51,616
Please go inside.

372
00:36:51,616 --> 00:36:52,288
Yes.

373
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:58,420
Don't you think Chef Kwon Jae-hee
was a bit strange just now?

374
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,397
Are you talking about how
he doesn't recognize us?

375
00:37:00,397 --> 00:37:06,268
Yes. Our eyes clearly met,
but he just passed by.

376
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:10,634
Maybe he doesn't like the police very much.

377
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:16,511
Since we always look at him with suspicion,
he probably doesn't.

378
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:23,555
When I saw Dr. Chun's picture,
it made me think about many things.

379
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:28,284
What did he want to tell me?

380
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:34,162
I don't think it was to ask you
to believe in his innocence.

381
00:37:34,162 --> 00:37:37,992
That's right. I felt from the
beginning it wasn't that.

382
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:44,458
Why do you think Dr. Chun went to Jeju Island
to look for Choi Eun-seol's medical records?

383
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,305
She was already dead then.

384
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,899
What did he want to know?

385
00:37:50,899 --> 00:37:53,963
We need to find out what
he wanted to know.

386
00:37:53,963 --> 00:37:56,217
If you think about it simply,

387
00:37:56,217 --> 00:38:00,488
he just wanted to find out
about Choi Eun-seol.

388
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,559
But why did he look up Choi Eun-seol
who died three years ago?

389
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:11,099
If he saw that Choi Eun-seol was alive,
he may have wanted to verify.

390
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,501
Even though she was dead on record?

391
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:15,863
There's somewhere you need to go with me.

392
00:38:29,217 --> 00:38:31,624
Hello, sir.

393
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:39,145
I'm Choi Moo-gak from serial murder
special investigation team.

394
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:46,134
I clearly told you I have nothing to say,
so please don't talk to me anymore.

395
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:54,759
Lt. Oh Jae-pyo, as you can see,
we're coming back from a funeral.

396
00:38:57,297 --> 00:38:59,842
There's been another barcode victim.

397
00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:02,553
There have been two more people who were
murdered a month apart from each other.

398
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:10,859
Lieutenant, Choi Eun-seol who died at Baekrok
Hospital in Jeju was my younger sister.

399
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:18,024
Choi Eun-seol, whom the culprit mistook
as the witness and murdered, is my sister.

400
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:21,102
Please let us meet the Choi
Eun-seol who's still alive.

401
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:30,389
Aren't you supposed to be taken off the case
if you have a personal vendetta?

402
00:39:30,756 --> 00:39:34,616
The witness protection program you had
headed was operational at that time.

403
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:37,120
That's why it was possible to report
that Choi Eun-seol was dead.

404
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,339
Once Choi Eun-seol was dead legally,
you terminated the witness

405
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:46,995
protection program and retired
from the police department.

406
00:39:46,995 --> 00:39:49,287
Don't make up stories.

407
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,701
Choi Eun-seol, who was unconscious, died.

408
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:54,242
That's why the witness protection
program was terminated.

409
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:59,774
I retired from the police department because
I didn't like the life of a police officer.

410
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:02,412
Stop harassing me.

411
00:40:02,412 --> 00:40:05,989
What are you hiding Choi Eun-seol?

412
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:11,200
I don't know Choi Eun-seol.

413
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,254
A hermit.

414
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:57,572
What did Chun Baek-gyung want to say?

415
00:41:02,007 --> 00:41:04,119
A golden fish.

416
00:41:51,691 --> 00:41:54,636
The patient who was saved...

417
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:59,273
The patient I saved thanked me and
said I was a lifesaver.

418
00:41:59,273 --> 00:42:02,921
I thought about whether
I deserved to hear those words.

419
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:07,904
I will do my best for the patient
who came to me.

420
00:42:07,904 --> 00:42:15,284
What saves the life of a patient isn't a
doctor, but the fate of the patient.

421
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:42,064
The witness is alive.

422
00:43:00,608 --> 00:43:09,122
The witness is alive.

423
00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:28,161
The witness is alive?

424
00:43:36,816 --> 00:43:39,785
The access was allowed because
his family requested it.

425
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:42,289
I ask that you be quick about it.

426
00:43:44,394 --> 00:43:45,559
Please go inside.

427
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:48,265
You should go in since
you're Dr. Chun's uncle.

428
00:43:48,265 --> 00:43:50,594
Please go inside and find it for me.

429
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:54,442
It's too hard for me.

430
00:43:54,442 --> 00:43:56,679
Yes. I understand.

431
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,597
Choi Eun-seol.

432
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:34,245
Choi Eun-seol... I guess you were still
alive after February 9th.

433
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:40,287
Just like Dr. Chun Baek-gyung said,
the witness is still alive.

434
00:44:57,324 --> 00:45:00,325
Hey. You have two part time jobs.

435
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:02,696
You should pay for your own meals.

436
00:45:02,696 --> 00:45:06,934
That's right. Is Officer Choi
okay after getting hurt?

437
00:45:07,517 --> 00:45:09,403
He's probably fine.

438
00:45:09,403 --> 00:45:13,491
Now that I think about it, you haven't
talked about Officer Choi once today.

439
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:17,725
I don't know. After he did it that day,
he hasn't even texted me a single time.

440
00:45:18,897 --> 00:45:21,860
After he did it?

441
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,654
Did you guys kiss?

442
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,373
He hasn't contacted you yet even
after you guys kissed.

443
00:45:28,373 --> 00:45:29,648
This Officer Choi...

444
00:45:29,648 --> 00:45:32,650
Hey! Just break up!

445
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,530
That's right. You can only break up
if you were dating.

446
00:45:39,414 --> 00:45:40,181
Leave.

447
00:45:40,181 --> 00:45:40,638
Why?

448
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:45,186
Go before you get fired
from your part-time job.

449
00:45:48,923 --> 00:45:49,499
Take care.

450
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:51,215
Goodbye.

451
00:47:05,898 --> 00:47:06,519
You didn't even contact me.

452
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:07,567
What are you doing here?

453
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:09,037
Wait a minute.

454
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:12,373
What are you doing?

455
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:15,343
Who are you looking for?

456
00:47:15,343 --> 00:47:16,478
It's nothing.

457
00:47:16,478 --> 00:47:18,446
Did you eat? Let's eat.

458
00:47:18,446 --> 00:47:21,850
What should I do? I told my dad
we're going to have dinner at home.

459
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,589
Really? Then let's go eat next time.

460
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:27,025
If you were going to come,
you should've called me first.

461
00:47:27,025 --> 00:47:28,919
Has your phone been broken?

462
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:30,961
I'm sorry. I was a bit busy.

463
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:33,826
Go home.

464
00:47:33,826 --> 00:47:35,016
Alright.

465
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,688
I'm going to go.

466
00:47:58,053 --> 00:47:59,616
Dad.

467
00:47:59,616 --> 00:48:01,785
You're home?

468
00:48:01,785 --> 00:48:02,588
What's the baggage for?

469
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,646
Are you going somewhere, Dad?

470
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:10,353
Cho-rim, I got a good position in Gangneung,
so I have to go there tomorrow morning.

471
00:48:10,731 --> 00:48:16,718
I'm used to you leaving suddenly,
but does it have to be tomorrow?

472
00:48:16,718 --> 00:48:17,605
You should be happy if I'm not here.

473
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:20,341
You won't hear any nagging.

474
00:48:20,341 --> 00:48:23,787
I'll come up once in a while,
so take good care of yourself.

475
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:29,044
Dad, make bean paste stew and
season the bean sprouts quickly.

476
00:48:29,044 --> 00:48:32,346
Alright. I'll make it quickly.

477
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:38,219
Cho-rim, how are you doing these days?

478
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,836
It's always the same.

479
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:46,559
Do you still not remember
anything from the past?

480
00:48:47,915 --> 00:48:52,060
I don't. If I try to think about,
it only gives me a headache.

481
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:54,202
Alright.

482
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:58,276
I'm sure you'll remember one day.

483
00:48:58,276 --> 00:49:00,602
Go wash up. I'll prepare the food.

484
00:49:00,602 --> 00:49:01,124
Okay.

[Choi Sang-sik / Yang Mi-yeon]

486
00:49:28,985 --> 00:49:30,553
[Choi Eun-seol]

487
00:49:41,537 --> 00:49:44,561
I definitely killed her in the ER that day.

488
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:46,403
But you're still alive.

489

[Producer Park Jae-joon]

490
00:49:58,104 --> 00:50:00,443
Yes. Mr. Park.

491
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:04,545
What should we cook for tomorrow's show?

492
00:50:05,514 --> 00:50:09,584
I want to cook something simple, not fancy.

493
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:12,583
No, not western food.
I want to cook Korean food.

494
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:19,115
I remembered the perfect menu just now.

495
00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:20,565
Sea-urchin-seaweed soup.

496
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:23,655
A very special sea-urchin-seaweed soup.

497
00:50:23,655 --> 00:50:26,334
I'm going to put the abalone
shell into the soup.

498
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:29,337
I'll bring all the ingredients of course.

499
00:50:29,337 --> 00:50:30,958
Thank you.

500
00:50:40,935 --> 00:50:45,578
She was short when she was young,
but when Eun-seol went to

501
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:48,086
elementary school,
she was tall because she ate well.

502
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,606
Whenever I asked her
what she wanted to eat,

503
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:53,444
she always gave the same answer.

504
00:50:53,444 --> 00:50:54,543
Sea-urchin-seaweed soup.

505
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:55,550
Sea-urchin-seaweed soup.

506
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,625
Sea-urchin-seaweed soup.

507
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,121
She always asked for it.

508
00:51:00,301 --> 00:51:06,007
It wasn't that special, but watching her
enjoy it made it worthwhile.

509
00:51:06,007 --> 00:51:13,178
Though everyone puts in fresh urchin and
good seaweed, I also put in abalone shell.

510
00:51:13,178 --> 00:51:16,145
Eun-seol says it tastes like the sea.

511
00:51:16,145 --> 00:51:20,252
I'm sure she meant it was delicious.

512
00:51:35,436 --> 00:51:36,628
Give it to me, too.

513
00:51:36,628 --> 00:51:40,361
Cho-rim. Here.

514
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,206
Hello, Chef.

515
00:51:42,206 --> 00:51:44,124
Yes. Hello.

516
00:51:44,124 --> 00:51:45,740
Chef.

517
00:51:46,245 --> 00:51:49,373
Good luck today. I'll be off now.

518
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:50,636
Where are you going?

519
00:51:50,636 --> 00:51:54,125
I was going to take some stuff inside,

520
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:57,479
but they took them all in already,
so I have nothing to do.

521
00:51:57,479 --> 00:52:00,213
I brought you to the TV station on purpose.

522
00:52:00,213 --> 00:52:01,691
Come in.

523
00:52:01,691 --> 00:52:05,932
I don't know how to cook, Chef.

524
00:52:05,932 --> 00:52:09,302
There are a lot of good chefs around me.

525
00:52:09,302 --> 00:52:15,864
From what I see, you're talented,
charming and pretty...

526
00:52:15,864 --> 00:52:17,900
You're praising me, right?

527
00:52:18,339 --> 00:52:23,647
I'm sure you can succeed in the troupe
you're in now, but wouldn't it be

528
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:26,812
more effective if you showed
yourself to the public first?

529
00:52:26,812 --> 00:52:32,026
I need a reporter who'll introduce
my dishes in the cooking program.

530
00:52:32,026 --> 00:52:34,954
What do you think about trying out for that?

531
00:52:34,954 --> 00:52:38,266
No, Chef. I'm really not good
enough for something like that.

532
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:40,900
You're praising me too much.

533
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,305
You can just meet some people today
and see what it's like today.

534
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:49,043
Take this and follow me.

535
00:52:49,043 --> 00:52:54,728
Chef. Chef? Chef!

536
00:52:55,275 --> 00:53:00,155
Today, I'll show you how to cook
a delicious seaweed soup.

537
00:53:00,155 --> 00:53:07,416
The important point is this abalone shell.

538
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:13,261
When you make abalone soup or porridge,
you usually throw away the shell.

539
00:53:13,261 --> 00:53:14,510
Yes.

540
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:19,908
But instead, wash the abalone shells clean
and briefly boil them in salt water.

541
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:23,891
Then keep them in the refrigerator.

542
00:53:24,238 --> 00:53:27,270
You can then use the abalone shells
when making the soup.

543
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:33,929
You'll be able to create a delicious soup
that has the taste of the ocean.

544
00:53:34,731 --> 00:53:36,855
You're going get a lot of love for this.

545
00:53:36,855 --> 00:53:39,929
- And that's today's...
- Tip.

546
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:40,995
Tip.

547
00:53:41,345 --> 00:53:43,643
I'll put them in now.

548
00:53:52,373 --> 00:53:54,709
Great job.

549
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,556
Great job, Chef.

550
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:05,988
What did you think?

551
00:54:05,988 --> 00:54:07,932
It was so amazing and fun.

552
00:54:07,932 --> 00:54:09,991
It was especially funny
when there were bloopers.

553
00:54:09,991 --> 00:54:10,889
Really?

554
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:12,618
I'll be right back after changing my clothes.

555
00:54:12,618 --> 00:54:15,029
Chef.

556
00:54:15,029 --> 00:54:17,538
I was curious about something.

557
00:54:17,538 --> 00:54:19,553
Yes. What is it?

558
00:54:19,553 --> 00:54:26,401
What's going to happen to the
food you made today?

559
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:28,292
Do you want to take it?

560
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:29,198
Would that be okay?

561
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:30,977
Of course.

562
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:34,908
Excuse me. My employee will take
what I made today.

563
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:36,669
Yes. I understand.

564
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:38,842
Containers are there, so take it.

565
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,596
Thank you. Great job today.

566
00:54:44,691 --> 00:54:46,327
I can't spill it.

567
00:54:50,669 --> 00:54:52,381
Did you wait long?

568
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:53,153
I ran out of breath.

569
00:54:53,153 --> 00:54:55,036
If you were running late,
you should've just called me.

570
00:54:55,036 --> 00:54:57,740
Why did you run over here?
You could get hurt.

571
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,267
I wanted to give this to you.

572
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:00,544
This is food from Jeju.

573
00:55:00,544 --> 00:55:01,871
Sea-urchin-seaweed soup.

574
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:04,531
Sea-urchin-seaweed soup? Really?

575
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:06,318
You can't even taste anything.

576
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:10,116
I told you I feel it. The feeling of eating
the sea-urchin-seaweed soup.

577
00:55:10,116 --> 00:55:13,407
How long has it been?

578
00:55:14,805 --> 00:55:17,133
Take it and cook it at home.

579
00:55:21,726 --> 00:55:23,097
What's wrong?

580
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,633
I'm still recovering from my surgery.

581
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:31,806
Do you really want me to
take it home and cook it?

582
00:55:31,806 --> 00:55:34,976
That's right. Then what should we do?

583
00:55:34,976 --> 00:55:37,765
Then do you want to come inside
and have a bowl before you go?

584
00:55:37,765 --> 00:55:40,615
Should I?

585
00:55:40,906 --> 00:55:43,539
But you have to go after you eat the soup.

586
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:45,856
I should at least eat
some rice with it first.

587
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:48,907
So just eat the soup with rice
and then go home.

588
00:55:48,907 --> 00:55:50,000
I should drink some water after that,
watch some TV

589
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,051
to digest the food, and
then it will be morning. Okay.

590
00:55:59,082 --> 00:56:00,635
Come here.

591
00:56:00,635 --> 00:56:03,434
Sit here. I'll make the soup quickly.

592
00:56:12,246 --> 00:56:13,533
Are you very hungry?

593
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:15,416
A lot, somewhat or not really?

594
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:16,605
Somewhat.

595
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:22,530
Why are you standing there?
I said have a seat.

596
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,091
Alright.

597
00:56:33,298 --> 00:56:36,104
How was your day?

598
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:40,739
I went to a murder scene and
saw a dismembered body.

599
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:42,239
How was yours?

600
00:56:42,471 --> 00:56:44,100
I went to a TV station today.

601
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:49,109
Chef Kwon made this soup on the TV show.

602
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:50,082
I see.

603
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,876
This food is from Jeju Island so think
about your hometown and eat a lot.

604
00:56:56,876 --> 00:56:57,960
It looks delicious.

605
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,004
I'll enjoy it.

606
00:56:59,004 --> 00:57:00,447
Go ahead.

607
00:57:17,223 --> 00:57:18,377
It's delicious.

608
00:57:34,832 --> 00:57:37,352
Seaweed soup should be from Jeju Island.

609
00:57:48,518 --> 00:57:50,287
What's wrong?

610
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:00,054
What's wrong? What's going on?

611
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:01,762
This...

612
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:20,224
This... I know this taste.

613
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:32,281
Did you remember something?

614
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:37,050
I don't know. What's wrong with me?

615
00:58:46,668 --> 00:58:49,981
I'm remembering someones face.
