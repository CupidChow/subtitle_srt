[Episode 3]

2
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:16,043
These are from tail lights...
and this is from headlights.

3
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:22,724
The reason there are pieces of both
tail lights and headlights here...

4
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:27,512
Is that the car that was driving on
that downslope probably hit

5
00:00:27,512 --> 00:00:30,883
the car that was parked here.

6
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:34,417
Hey, Oh Cho-rim.

7
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:35,300
I think there was a car accident here.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,432
Come here.

9
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:41,335
Why did I ever meet this policeman?

10
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:43,974
And why is he calling me again?

11
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:46,574
What did you say?

12
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:48,062
A car accident?

13
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:51,343
Yes, I think one car was parked here.

14
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,082
And the other car was driving
on that downslope...

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,022
What's wrong?

16
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:08,233
What's the matter?

17
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:16,972
The scent of Joo Ma-ri's
perfume is behind you...

18
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:36,082
Are you sure?

19
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:37,415
Is it Joo Ma-ri's perfume?

20
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:41,385
I'm positive. It's her perfume.

21
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:44,388
The scent is very strong and
it's coming from the ground.

22
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:46,873
It's flowing down that way.

23
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,519
That way...

24
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,730
Down there...

25
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:15,960
What was that cracking sound?

26
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:21,411
My sunglasses!

27
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:24,617
Geez!

28
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:26,107
My sunglasses!

29
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:27,111
They're crushed!

30
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:28,125
What did you just do?

31
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,036
Why did you do that?

32
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:30,632
These are my favorite sunglasses!

33
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:32,889
They're crushed!

34
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:36,993
If I hadn't grabbed you,
you would've been crushed down there!

35
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:39,671
Thank you for that at least.

36
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:41,460
Now's not the time to worry about these.

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,741
Where is Joo Ma-ri's scent going?

38
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:50,724
I'm asking where her scent has gone.

39
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,705
It's headed toward the river.

40
00:02:57,705 --> 00:02:59,235
The river?

41
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:15,423
Attention, please!

42
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:17,391
Pay attention as you keep looking!

43
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,719
Oh my God!

44
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,756
Why did you just do that?

45
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:25,600
- Attention!
- For crying out loud!

46
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:35,376
I know you're tired,
but let's hustle a bit more!

47
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:40,875
The missing person is definitely
on this mountain somewhere.

48
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,352
We must find something, even
if it's only her nails!

49
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:49,319
Let's hustle! Keep the steam up!

50
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,534
Keep the steam up!

51
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:58,468
What was that?

52
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,753
Is he deaf?

53
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:05,172
Hey, I can't hear you. Just wait.

54
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:05,904
Detective Yeh!

55
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:06,943
Sang-gil!

56
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:07,510
Answer this phone.

57
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,533
Yes.

58
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:12,802
What are you doing?

59
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,110
It's the middle one.

60
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,039
This is the old model!

61
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,613
I'm not used to this.

62
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:19,844
Say that again, Choi Moo-gak!

63
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:21,759
What?

64
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:25,359
Boss, she's found.

65
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:27,161
Joo Ma-ri has been found.

66
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:42,944
Slowly...

67
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:45,517
Be careful.

68
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:49,116
Like Moo-gak said, she's been in the river!

69
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:52,765
Slowly!

70
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,621
Stop!

71
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,750
Detective Tak, check inside.

72
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:15,138
It's definitely Joo Ma-ri.

73
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:23,152
Call the forensics team
and ask for reinforcement.

74
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:24,291
Have them take over the crime scene.

75
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,907
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:44,301
Excuse me.

77
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,106
Don't open the door.

78
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:46,328
I need to check something.

79
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:47,198
What are you doing?

80
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:50,388
I said you can't touch it!

81
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:53,244
I think you've taken enough pictures.

82
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,980
Is this also another case of
the barcode chain murders?

83
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,137
Yes, it seems like it so far.

84
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,908
Are you the one who found the car?

85
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:37,160
Yes, I did.

86
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,461
How did you know she was in the river?

87
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:43,529
How did you find her all by yourself?

88
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:56,844
Let us work.

89
00:06:56,844 --> 00:06:59,726
Give us some space.

90
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,504
Attention!

91
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:12,698
Salute!

92
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:19,050
Lieutenant Yeom.

93
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,834
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,716
There's a good chance this is another
case of barcode chain murders.

95
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,084
Inspector Kang?

96
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:24,936
Yes, sir.

97
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:29,566
Start a special investigation team
within our police station.

98
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,979
Yes, sir.

99
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:38,805
The special investigation
team will be led by...

100
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:43,432
Lt. Yeom, who's been investigating
these murder cases for the past two years.

101
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:44,894
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:51,226
Hey...

103
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:01,124
The special investigation team will include
all members of the homicide department...

104
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:03,540
We'll also ask for support from
the investigations department.

105
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,349
Good. So there will be you and four
detectives from the homicide department?

106
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:13,059
I'd like to add one more person.

107
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:15,889
Officer Choi.

108
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,247
Yes?

109
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:22,995
Join the special investigation team.

110
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:28,630
Why Choi Moo-gak?

111
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,400
Yes, ma'am.

112
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:38,115
Hi, Dad!

113
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:44,003
Are you going to work?

114
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:47,286
You left very early in the morning.

115
00:08:47,286 --> 00:08:49,690
Where did you go?

116
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,632
You have the night shift this week.

117
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,985
But you're leaving quite early!

118
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:55,019
I have some errands to run.

119
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,421
Where did you go this morning?

120
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,271
I had something to
take care of at the troupe.

121
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:03,537
You have seven months left with
that whole acting business.

122
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:06,346
You're quitting in seven months, okay?

123
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,412
Don't forget what you promised me.

124
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:10,738
I know.

125
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,423
Ta-da!

126
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:20,042
Your favorite steamed buns from Yangpyeong.

127
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:23,422
Did you just come back from Yangpyeong?

128
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:25,359
What did you do in Yangpyeong?

129
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:30,464
The troupe is planning to
have a show in Yangpyeong.

130
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:33,567
Take them! You must hurry and go.

131
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,897
Have a good day, Dad.

132
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:38,005
Hurry!

133
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:41,600
Thanks, Cho-rim.

134
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,773
Promise me that you'll share them
with your coworkers, okay?

135
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:50,051
Okay.

136
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:51,686
Bye!

137
00:09:51,686 --> 00:09:53,696
Bye!

138

Hello!

00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:20,147
Hello.

140
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:23,515
It's been a year.

141
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:25,267
How have you been?

142
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:29,991
Let's go somewhere else.

143
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:45,980
Another case of the barcode
chain murders occurred today.

144
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:53,147
A 27-year-old young lady lost her life
to some maniac's murder games.

145
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:58,325
This is the fifth murder
with 6 victims so far.

146
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,623
As you can see, I'm no longer a cop.

147
00:11:01,623 --> 00:11:03,383
I just work security at this building.

148
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:05,293
I'm looking for the witness.

149
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:09,102
You know the daughter of the diver couple
who got murdered 3 years ago is alive...

150
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:14,670
You know where she lives...

151
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,247
Why do you think I know?

152
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:20,398
And look at the police records.

153
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:24,012
There's no evidence that their
daughter witnessed the crime.

154
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:27,538
On top of that, the daughter is dead.

155
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:30,337
How am I supposed to know where she is
if she's dead already?

156
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:33,162
You're well aware...

157
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:38,293
that many important witnesses are registered
as dead under the Witness Protection Program.

158
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:42,537
I'm convinced their daughter is a witness.

159
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,621
Why are you hiding this?

160
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,839
Where is she?

161
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,472
I'm not hiding anything!

162
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:51,872
She never woke up from her coma
and died shortly thereafter.

163
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:54,173
I don't believe that.

164
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,078
And that's why I keep coming to see you.

165
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:00,020
Please help me so we can catch the murderer.

166
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,706
I said there's nothing I can do.

167
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:17,171
I'll be back soon.

00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:52,526
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

171
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:56,028
From the police station?

172
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:03,650
I'll be right there.

173
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,195
[Temporarily closed]

174
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:33,099
We met in front of the modeling agency.

175
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:35,943
I'm Choi Moo-gak from the
southern police precinct.

176
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,594
My mind is somewhere else these days.

177
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:45,843
My sincere condolences.
I don't know what to say.

178
00:13:45,843 --> 00:13:51,063
I'm sorry we had to deliver
the news of Ms. Joo's death.

179
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,897
Please sit down.

180
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,559
There'll be an autopsy
the day after tomorrow.

181
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,200
Would you like to see her before that?

182
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,866
Yes, I'd like to.

183
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:14,414
Does Ms. Joo have any close relatives?

184
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:18,872
I never heard her talk about her family.

185
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:22,486
Then how about the funeral...

186
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:27,929
I'm going to take care of it.

187
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:29,394
I see.

188
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:38,005
Do you know Dr. Chun Baek-gyung,
a pain control specialist?

189
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:39,707
Yes, I know him.

190
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:40,803
Why?

191
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:42,845
He's one of our suspects.

192
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:45,333
Please tell us everything about him.

193
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:50,487
Are you saying that I'm a
suspect of Ma-ri's murder?

194
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:01,832
This is Dr. Chun Baek-gyung.

195
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:05,070
He's from the police station, Dr. Chun.

196
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:08,917
Choi Moo-gak of the southern police precinct.

197
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,608
I'm Chun Baek-gyung.

198
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:15,774
Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

199
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:19,073
That must be why the cops
came when I was absent.

200
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:21,669
May I ask some questions somewhere else?

201
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:24,587
I'm fine here if you're okay.

202
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:28,414
Sure, I don't mind.

203
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:45,381
You're the last person whom
Ms. Joo called from her cell phone.

204
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:48,709
There are also a lot of previous
call records between you two.

205
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:52,580
Isn't that obvious because
she was my patient?

206
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:59,249
I introduced Ma-ri to Dr. Chun.

207
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,557
She was suffering from depression
after her spinal surgery.

208
00:16:02,557 --> 00:16:07,817
She became very close to Dr. Chun.

209
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:12,719
From the 16th until two days ago, you
closed your office for four days.

210
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,891
Where were you?

211
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:18,837
I was in Jeju Island for four days.
I, took a TJ flight.

212
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:22,616
I stayed at Jeju Daeyang Hotel for four days.

213
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:27,449
What made you go to Jeju?

214
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:30,385
Detective...

215
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:31,615
Dr. Chun is...

216
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,362
Okay.

217
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:40,699
I'll be in touch.

218
00:16:53,394 --> 00:16:56,244
Please don't be upset, Dr. Chun.

219
00:16:56,244 --> 00:17:00,325
I think it's just a routine
police investigation.

220
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:02,116
I'm fine.

221
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:05,159
You should take care of yourself, Mr. Kwon.

222
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:19,567
My sunglasses!

223
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:22,293
Oh no! My sunglasses!

224
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:24,433
They're crushed!

225
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,258
Do you have the same pair as these?

226
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:38,146
Do you mind if I take a look?

227
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:44,921
Sorry... but where did you buy these?

228
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:46,497
What's the matter?

229
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:49,121
These are fakes.

230
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:50,735
Would you take a look
at the genuine ones?

231
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,076
Do you mean they're replicas?

232
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:55,889
They're very low-quality replicas.

233
00:17:57,204 --> 00:18:02,307
So she caused all that ruckus because I had
broken some low-quality fake sunglasses...

234
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:07,110
Give me a genuine pair.

235
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,737
I'm Mapo Nuclear Bomb!

236
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:12,175
What can we do?

237
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,098
He's Mapo seafood stew!

238
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:16,413
Mapo seafood stew is here.

239
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:17,966
What brings you here, Mr. Mapo seafood stew?

240
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:20,916
Not "seafood stew." I said, "nuclear bomb"!

241
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:24,438
If you make me angry, you'll all be dead!

242
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,802
So if you get angry,
we'll all be like octopus?

243
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:28,448
No...

244
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:55,401
Oh Cho-rim...

245
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,530
Excuse me, sir.

246
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,910
That's not the exit, sir!

247
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:09,710
Well...

248
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:16,151
What brings you here?

249
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:17,168
I think I have seen him somewhere before.

250
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:26,131
Where did I see him?

251
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:32,777
I think I can see a hospital
scent from his trace.

252
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:33,781
Hospital?

253
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:40,207
But why didn't you come earlier?

254
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,983
Why didn't you come to practice our skit?

255
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:46,320
It's the hospital scent for sure.

256
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:56,378
What are you doing here, Oh Cho-rim?

257
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:58,427
Sir.

258
00:19:58,427 --> 00:20:00,613
Why are you so distracted all the time?

259
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:01,550
The show is going on right now.

260
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,033
What are you doing here?

261
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:07,360
I was thirsty, so I came to get some water.

262
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,065
If you're thirsty,
why are you staring at the ground?

263
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:10,738
Is there something on the ground?

264
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:14,299
And where is your partner, Officer Choi?

265
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,744
You're not even practicing.

266
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:19,417
Is Officer Choi really your partner?

267
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,648
He isn't, is he?

268
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:25,941
You just brought him once to
deceive me that time, didn't you?

269
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:26,720
That's not it.

270
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,387
Officer Choi is my partner.

271
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:30,231
The show is almost over.

272
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:31,648
Go inside.

273
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:43,576
Today's show was the best!

274
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,939
Let's go drink!

275
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:45,840
See you tomorrow!

276
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,296
Bye.

277
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:56,457
This is Officer Choi's scent.

278
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:11,586
Is the show over?

279
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:13,834
Do you know how much I
got scolded from my boss?

280
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:17,672
He was asking where you were,
and why we aren't practicing.

281
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:21,766
He asked me if I had brought you
only that one time to deceive him.

282
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:26,266
I may not be physically
abused, but I am mentally!

283
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,778
How can you be like that?

284
00:21:27,778 --> 00:21:29,310
We promised to help each other.

285
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,008
You must keep your promise.

286
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,431
You're not trustworthy! Tsk, tsk, tsk.

287
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:35,996
You'll get hungry if you talk too much.

288
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:38,495
Never mind that!

289
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:49,839
Oh my... It's past my dinnertime.

290
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,271
I'm going to get dinner.

291
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:53,674
So if you still want to rant, come with me.

292
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:59,069
He's so annoying!

293
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:04,412
What are you going to eat?

294
00:22:05,386 --> 00:22:07,820
Officer Choi!

295
00:22:29,977 --> 00:22:32,212
Are you always this selfish?

296
00:22:32,212 --> 00:22:33,834
What?

297
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:39,675
Do you always put yourself before others?

298
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:40,461
That's what it seems like.

299
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:42,917
I helped your search even
though I'm not a police officer.

300
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:44,725
But you never came to the theater.

301
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:49,597
And now I'm grilling the meat
and all you're doing is eating!

302
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:52,297
I haven't eaten a single piece!

303
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:53,701
Eat then.

304
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:55,136
There's nothing to eat!

305
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:58,061
You just ate three servings by yourself!

306
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:01,305
Seriously...

307
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:05,913
How frustrating!

308
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:13,332
Three more servings of meat, please.

309
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:14,846
What is this?

310
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:21,632
What are these?

311
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:26,097
Are you making fun of me
after breaking my sunglasses?

312
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:29,319
Oh, why did these come out?

313
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:47,121
I'm sorry for breaking your sunglasses.

314
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:51,533
And thanks to you, I became a
detective at the southern precinct.

315
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:58,585
It's difficult for someone at my rank
to join a special investigation team.

316
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:04,039
That's good. You made it.

317
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:09,424
But you somehow managed to find
the same pair as the broken ones!

318
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:11,265
The broken ones were fakes.

319
00:24:11,265 --> 00:24:13,304
Oh my!

320
00:24:13,304 --> 00:24:15,141
So these are genuine?

321
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:16,841
They must be very expensive!

322
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:19,420
I don't know if I should accept them.

323
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,461
Bring out the meat now, please.

324
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:26,294
Coming!

325
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:31,556
Anyway, you made it and became a
detective, so I want to make it, too.

326
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:35,269
You must stay as my partner
until the audition, okay?

327
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:43,470
I'm sorry.

328
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,350
That was scary.

329
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:05,156
So when are you free to practice?

330
00:25:05,156 --> 00:25:06,855
What's up, little one?

331
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:09,165
She's a monster, Mom!

332
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:13,073
Look at her eye! Like a monster!

333
00:25:25,112 --> 00:25:27,956
Where is my lens?

334
00:25:27,956 --> 00:25:30,139
She has a green eye!

335
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:34,967
She must be an alien!

336
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:52,234
Oh Cho-rim!

337
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:56,855
Don't run away.

338
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,106
This is nothing to run away from.

339
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:00,880
I'm sorry. I must go.

340
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,890
You don't have to run away
because people think you're weird.

341
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,547
I'm just like you.

342
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:12,014
I'm a monster and alien, too.

343
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:24,261
I had a younger sister.

344
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:27,241
I had one...

345
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:28,940
Not anymore.

346
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:38,526
Choi Eun-seol...

347
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:41,511
Is there a doctor or nurse?

348
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:44,086
Somebody?

349
00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:53,549
She died three years ago.

350
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:59,987
Someone slit her throat at the hospital...

351
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:10,958
Bring me Eun-seol's killer!

352
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:17,940
Why can't you catch the murderer?

353
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,256
I'm going to kill him!

354
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:21,713
Bring me the murderer!

355
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:24,340
My Eun-seol...

356
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,662
What are the police good for?

357
00:27:28,142 --> 00:27:34,215
The police couldn't find a clue for
two months after my sister had died.

358
00:27:34,215 --> 00:27:38,216
Who killed my sister cruelly
and for what reason?

359
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:40,604
I was frustrated.

360
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:47,789
I started to have this
pain inside of my body.

361
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:51,622
It felt as though someone was
squeezing everything inside me.

362
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:55,377
I was frustrated and in pain.

363
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:57,667
So I couldn't sleep for days.

364
00:27:58,306 --> 00:28:02,468
Then... I fainted.

365
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:10,208
I was working at the aquarium that day.

366
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:13,454
I didn't know how many
sleepless nights had gone by.

367
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:16,650
I fainted right as I entered the tank.

368
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,855
We performed CPR on the way here,
but he's still not breathing.

369
00:28:56,884 --> 00:29:01,980
Apparently, I was already clinically
dead when I got to the hospital.

370
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:06,040
But for some odd reason...

371
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,085
I woke up after ten days.

372
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:14,048
I regained consciousness after ten days...

373
00:29:14,957 --> 00:29:18,881
It may be hard to believe,
but I lost my senses.

374
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,787
It doesn't hurt when my forehead is cut.

375
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:24,923
I can't smell.

376
00:29:24,923 --> 00:29:28,080
I can't taste food either.

377
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:36,938
Anyway, my senses are practically gone.

378
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,174
It may be hard to believe...

379
00:29:40,174 --> 00:29:42,267
I believe you.

380
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:45,008
I'm also a similar case.

381
00:29:45,008 --> 00:29:47,853
My case may even be worse.

382
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:54,654
I was nearly killed in a car accident,
then woke up from a coma after 193 days.

383
00:29:54,654 --> 00:30:01,563
When I woke up, one eye had changed
in color, like that of a monster.

384
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:13,394
And I could see scents with this eye.

385
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:20,542
So your heavy appetite started then, too?

386
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:22,402
Yes, it started then.

387
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:24,252
I don't eat food because it's delicious.

388
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:28,338
My body feels empty, so I'm just filling it.

389
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:29,613
Well...

390
00:30:29,613 --> 00:30:35,749
Perhaps it's not your body
that's empty, but your heart.

391
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:42,361
It's pretty tough for me, too,
but I feel bad for you nonetheless.

392
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:46,566
So it doesn't hurt at all?

393
00:30:46,566 --> 00:30:47,878
Can I hit you?

394
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:56,617
The audition is tomorrow.

395
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:58,336
Have you practiced or not?

396
00:30:58,336 --> 00:31:00,906
I did.

397
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:02,556
Of course.

398
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:04,935
You've achieved your goal.

399
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:07,951
I want to achieve mine, too.

400
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,432
Okay.

401
00:31:10,425 --> 00:31:11,284
Let's go.

402
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:30,322
We've been too polite so far.

403
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,820
We need to be rougher.

404
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:38,914
It's self-service here, Oh Cho-rim.

405
00:31:38,914 --> 00:31:40,334
Why do I have to bring these out for you?

406
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:43,056
Thanks. You can go now, Ae-ri.

407
00:31:45,132 --> 00:31:47,435
Aren't you a police officer?

408
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:48,903
Do you have two jobs?

409
00:31:48,903 --> 00:31:49,403
Never mind that.

410
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:50,930
You should go, Ae-ri.

411
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,570
Fine. I'm leaving.

412
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:58,955
This is good.

413
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:02,634
You want me to put this on?

414
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,444
Look.

415
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:19,109
See? You're laughing.

416
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:21,341
Your nostrils are widening, too!

417
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:24,028
I'm just staying still.

418
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:25,948
Just put it on.

419
00:32:25,948 --> 00:32:28,083
What are you doing?

420
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,920
Can you just put it on, Mr. Detective?

421
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,047
Help me to achieve my goal, okay?

422
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,644
Just like that...

423
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,381
It's good.

424
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,048
Let's start our skit.

425
00:32:49,476 --> 00:32:52,663
What brings you to Seoul?

426
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:57,245
I want to live in Seoul like you!

427
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,021
Listen to me carefully.

428
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:05,242
They charge for parking in this city.

429
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:07,420
Say what?

430
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:15,896
Can't I park my car anywhere as long as
others have enough space to pass?

431
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:18,082
If you do that, your car will be gone!

432
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:20,235
Listen to me carefully.

433
00:33:20,235 --> 00:33:24,593
Dogs in Seoul chew gum and go to cafes.

434
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:27,201
But do you know what's even more shocking?

435
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:31,695
Dogs actually wear clothes in Seoul!

436
00:33:31,695 --> 00:33:34,092
What?

437
00:33:56,068 --> 00:34:01,010
I really need to do well at this audition.

438
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,347
I think this is my last chance.

439
00:34:03,347 --> 00:34:06,107
My father doesn't like that
I'm in a comedy troupe.

440
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:09,905
So if I don't make it on stage
this time, I'll have to quit.

441
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:15,085
So please help me. I beg you.

442
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:18,109
I'll do my best since you helped me, too.

443
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:19,429
Thank you.

444
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:25,178
When you make that sound,
I want you to look more stupid.

445
00:34:25,178 --> 00:34:27,808
That sound is the main point of the skit.

446
00:34:27,808 --> 00:34:29,354
Okay?

447
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,809
Put it back on...

448
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:36,018
Like that.

449
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:37,284
Start!

450
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:43,146
[National Forensic Service]

451
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:44,527
Please pay attention to
every part of the corpse.

452
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:46,270
It is my sincere request.

453
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:10,628
So, the murderer put Joo Ma-ri's
corpse in a car and left it here.

454
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:11,693
Here.

455
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:19,527
Once we analyze these, we'll find out
whether it was from Ms. Joo's car.

456
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:21,128
Send it to the forensics team.

457
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,685
But another car hit Joo Ma-ri's car
from the back...

458
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:32,980
And that pushed Joo Ma-ri's car
off the cliff and into the river?

459
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,011
That's my guess.

460
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:39,327
Hey, where is Detective Ki? Didn't he go to
the local police station? Why isn't he back?

461
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:40,930
Let's hurry up and go back to Seoul.

462
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:45,787
We can't do anything until
these pieces are analyzed.

463
00:36:47,517 --> 00:36:49,434
That's Detective Ki's car.

464
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:56,233
You can get out now.

465
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,965
Who are they?

466
00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:03,828
They turned themselves in
at the local police station.

467
00:37:03,828 --> 00:37:08,765
Their car hit Joo Ma-ri's car.

468
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:17,774
I secured video from their vehicle's black
box of the accident.

469
00:37:17,774 --> 00:37:20,238
I'll bring a laptop.

470
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:34,074
The license plate number shown here
is the same as Joo Ma-ri's car.

471
00:37:34,074 --> 00:37:35,886
When did this happen?

472
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,442
Three days ago.

473
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:40,977
Are you sure that it was here?

474
00:37:40,977 --> 00:37:42,735
I'm positive.

475
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:47,010
I was on that downslope when I hit the car.

476
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,764
I heard you lifted the
car out of the river...

477
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:52,494
And that someone died...

478
00:37:52,494 --> 00:37:54,368
What's going to happen to us?

479
00:37:54,368 --> 00:37:57,830
You should've reported
the accident right away!

480
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:02,057
She didn't die because of you, but we'll
have to ask you some more questions.

481
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:03,017
Get back in the car.

482
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:04,399
We're going back to the police station.

483
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:12,693
Who are you?

484
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,888
Are you a ghost?

485
00:38:13,888 --> 00:38:15,739
Did you see the accident?

486
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,139
Somehow...

487
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:22,617
Anyway, it's become clear that this is
another case of the barcode chain murders.

488
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:25,167
Let's move.

489
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:47,478
Look how impatient she is.

490
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:51,890
Her impatience will make the autopsy
results come out any faster!

491
00:38:55,863 --> 00:38:59,389
Great! $3!

492
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:03,037
Getting the results today is
already very fast, isn't it?

493
00:39:03,037 --> 00:39:04,004
That's right.

494
00:39:04,004 --> 00:39:05,515
Okay! $5!

495
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:08,003
Apparently, she kept pestering
the autopsy team.

496
00:39:08,003 --> 00:39:09,538
Yes! $1!

497
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:11,098
She also pestered everyone at
Yangpyeong Police Station...

498
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:15,878
to make them analyze the surveillance
videos of Joo Ma-ri's car.

499
00:39:15,878 --> 00:39:20,288
We can only start our investigation
once we have those results.

500
00:39:20,288 --> 00:39:23,445
So we have to be patient.

501
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:27,316
The key to investigation is perseverance!

502
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:29,991
The free option is still there, right?

503
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:37,039
Great...

504
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,578
$50.

505
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:39,361
Darn it...

506
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:41,599
I guess I'm paying for lunch today.

507
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:46,605
Officer Choi gets the free one automatically.

508
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:48,737
Could he really be a ghost?

509
00:39:48,737 --> 00:39:52,520
Where is he anyway?

510
00:40:58,619 --> 00:40:59,893
She was suffocated to death.

511
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:00,910
A homicide.

512
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,178
She was discovered under water,
but she didn't drown.

513
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:07,255
As there are no strap marks on her neck,
we believe she suffocated to death

514
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:11,966
because of respiratory blockage
when either asleep or anesthetized.

515
00:41:11,966 --> 00:41:13,036
Time of death?

516
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:16,642
We suspect it was three days
before the discovery of her body.

517
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:21,709
But something unique came out
during the autopsy.

518
00:41:24,512 --> 00:41:26,883
That's a key.

519
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:29,549
You mean, it's not from her personal
belongings, but from the autopsy?

520
00:41:29,549 --> 00:41:31,923
It came from the victim's stomach.

521
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,735
Whether this belongs to Joo Ma-ri...

522
00:41:33,735 --> 00:41:36,196
Whether she swallowed this before she died...

523
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:38,819
Whether the murderer forced
her to eat this...

524
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:42,958
We can't answer these questions yet.

525
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:53,641
What if that key necklace
is her dying message?

526
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:56,744
Something like a message while dying.

527
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,310
The results of the surveillance
video analysis has just come in.

528
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:08,810
This is where Joo Ma-ri's
car was first parked.

529
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:15,528
In order for the car to get there,
it has to drive through either here or here.

530
00:42:15,528 --> 00:42:17,218
These are the only ways in.

531
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:22,410
And we have surveillance
cameras here and here.

532
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,936
They record passing cars 24/7.

533
00:42:24,936 --> 00:42:26,601
There's absolutely no other way around them.

534
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:31,646
However... there's no record of Joo Ma-ri's
car having passed those points.

535
00:42:31,646 --> 00:42:34,282
How does that make any sense?

536
00:42:34,282 --> 00:42:36,400
Did the team look at the videos properly?

537
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,891
They looked at all the footage from the day
before Joo Ma-ri was reported missing

538
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:41,455
until the day her car was
found from the water.

539
00:42:41,455 --> 00:42:47,895
During that 9-day period, there's no record
of her car passing through these roads.

540
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:53,416
HITW!

541
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:56,487
It stands for "How In The World."

542
00:42:57,746 --> 00:43:01,635
Detective Tak, secure the original
surveillance footage of the car.

543
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,014
And about the key necklace...

544
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:06,157
I'm taking Detective Yeh with me.

545
00:43:06,157 --> 00:43:07,149
Come on.

546
00:43:11,145 --> 00:43:12,411
Detective Choi.

547
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:16,180
Get a hold of Joo Ma-ri's
medical records from Dr. Chun.

548
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,595
Yes, ma'am.

549
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,333
I'm forced to give them to you
because you have a warrant.

550
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:28,469
Medical records are confidential.

551
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:31,398
Do you need anything else?

552
00:43:31,398 --> 00:43:35,285
About your alibi...

553
00:43:35,285 --> 00:43:38,513
Ms. Joo was murdered the day
after you left for Jeju.

554
00:43:38,513 --> 00:43:45,250
And you returned to Seoul the day after
her body was left on that cliffside.

555
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,611
If anything, that makes my alibi perfect.

556
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:53,591
An alibi means that I was
somewhere else, doesn't it?

557
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:58,761
Don't you think it fits too perfectly?

558
00:44:05,006 --> 00:44:07,975
A patient is waiting right now.

559
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,556
Thank you for your cooperation.

560
00:44:32,762 --> 00:44:35,317
Hello? Where are you, Officer Choi?

561
00:44:35,317 --> 00:44:36,963
Why aren't you coming?

562
00:44:36,963 --> 00:44:38,839
I'm leaving right now.

563
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:40,718
Hurry up!

564
00:44:40,718 --> 00:44:42,997
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

565
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:51,738
It's a real key.

566
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:54,118
For this box.

567
00:44:54,118 --> 00:44:55,878
Something important must be inside?

568
00:44:55,878 --> 00:44:57,058
Her diary.

569
00:44:57,058 --> 00:45:02,096
She would write in her diary daily,
and then lock it inside here.

570
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,259
We'll open it.

571
00:45:04,259 --> 00:45:05,466
Open it.

572
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,261
It's not here.

573
00:45:11,261 --> 00:45:12,534
There's nothing here.

574
00:45:12,534 --> 00:45:14,775
I remember seeing them a month ago.

575
00:45:14,775 --> 00:45:17,304
It seemed as if there were
more than 10 diaries.

576
00:45:17,304 --> 00:45:19,043
Why aren't they here?

577
00:45:19,043 --> 00:45:22,353
Do you know if anyone else
came into this apartment?

578
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:26,654
Yes, Ma-ri's boyfriend,
Kwon Jae-hee, the celebrity chef.

579
00:45:26,654 --> 00:45:30,589
He was already here before we came back.

580
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:55,408
I'm almost there.

581
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:56,746
This is Lieutenant Yeom.

582
00:45:56,746 --> 00:45:59,157
Yes, Lieutenant.

583
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:00,677
Yes...

584
00:46:02,925 --> 00:46:04,511
Yes, okay.

585
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:12,562
Audition day has come.

586
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,936
As I told you before,
the result of this audition

587
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:17,694
will be the sole criterion of
deciding who'll go on stage.

588
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:19,287
So I'm sure you'll do your best.

589
00:46:19,287 --> 00:46:20,042
Let's do our best!

590
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:20,745
Bring it on!

591
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:22,607
Bring it on!

592
00:46:25,755 --> 00:46:28,963
The first team. The title is "Love Balls."

593
00:46:39,621 --> 00:46:41,253
Wait!

594
00:46:41,253 --> 00:46:42,663
Don't burn them!

595
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:51,178
Detective Choi...

596
00:46:51,178 --> 00:46:53,546
What are you burning?

597
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:57,445
They're Ma-ri's clothes.

598
00:46:57,445 --> 00:47:02,875
I saw them when I went to her house
to discuss funeral arrangements.

599
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:08,087
We got into fights every time she wore this.

600
00:47:08,087 --> 00:47:11,292
May I ask what brings you here?

601
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:13,702
I've been told that Ms. Joo used
to write in diaries.

602
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:15,563
Did you ever see them?

603
00:47:15,563 --> 00:47:18,097
Yes, I never got to read them.

604
00:47:18,097 --> 00:47:19,985
But I've seen the actual diaries.

605
00:47:19,985 --> 00:47:22,403
I also knew that she wrote in them every day.

606
00:47:22,403 --> 00:47:24,764
Did you bring anything else from her place?

607
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:26,629
Nothing else other than these clothes.

608
00:47:26,629 --> 00:47:29,799
Why are you asking about the diaries?

609
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:34,279
I'm afraid I was mistaken. I'm sorry.

610
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:45,724
The next contestant is number 5.

611
00:47:45,724 --> 00:47:46,526
The skit is called "The Moon of Seoul."

612
00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:50,076
It'll be done by Oh Cho-rim and Officer Choi.

613
00:47:54,562 --> 00:47:57,112
Why are you alone? Where is Officer Choi?

614
00:47:57,112 --> 00:47:58,574
I'll do it by myself.

615
00:47:58,574 --> 00:47:59,941
What? Your partner didn't come?

616
00:47:59,941 --> 00:48:03,277
I'm sorry, but I can do it by myself.

617
00:48:03,277 --> 00:48:05,580
I'll begin now.

618
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:10,203
So what brings you to Seoul?

619
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:15,913
I want to live in Seoul like you!

620
00:48:15,913 --> 00:48:20,161
You're still a country boy who wants
to hang out in the mountains.

621
00:48:20,161 --> 00:48:22,199
How will you be able to live in Seoul?

622
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,086
You can't. Go back.

623
00:48:23,086 --> 00:48:25,204
Hold on. Stop.

624
00:48:25,204 --> 00:48:28,940
What are you doing
in front of our judges?

625
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,964
Are you playing with us?

626
00:48:29,964 --> 00:48:33,150
I can do the rest by myself, too.

627
00:48:33,615 --> 00:48:35,270
Life is the same everywhere.

628
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,287
It can't be that different in Seoul!

629
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:39,448
Listen to me carefully.

630
00:48:39,448 --> 00:48:43,591
They charge for parking in this city.

631
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:44,318
Excuse me?

632
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:45,455
I said stop!

633
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,315
Get down! What kind of skit
doesn't have a partner?

634
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:50,420
Besides, you won't be able to do
anything with that mindset.

635
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,576
I don't need a comedian like that
no matter how good you may be.

636
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:54,460
Get down.

637
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,937
I said, get down!

638
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:58,142
I'm sorry.

639
00:48:58,142 --> 00:49:02,254
The next team is Uh Woo-yah
and Cho In-bae...

640
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:23,952
Congratulations on getting first place!

641
00:49:23,952 --> 00:49:27,755
You should've picked the right
partner from the beginning!

642
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:30,207
You're right. Bottoms up!

643
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:36,842
Attention! Good job today, everyone.

644
00:49:36,842 --> 00:49:38,673
And thank you for your hard work.

645
00:49:38,673 --> 00:49:44,315
Let's wrap up dinner and
move onto a bar!

646
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,512
Hold on.

647
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:51,686
Why is this person here?

648
00:49:51,686 --> 00:49:53,515
She's not part of our troupe.

649
00:49:53,515 --> 00:49:55,613
Sir...

650
00:49:55,613 --> 00:50:00,696
With all due respect, don't
concern yourself with our troupe.

651
00:50:00,696 --> 00:50:02,268
Everyone, listen carefully.

652
00:50:02,268 --> 00:50:05,720
Don't ever get her involved.

653
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,629
I've made myself clear.

654
00:50:41,735 --> 00:50:43,342
Officer Choi?

655
00:50:43,342 --> 00:50:45,870
Why did you miss the audition?

656
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,675
You're too late!

657
00:50:47,675 --> 00:50:49,079
Well...

658
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,578
Looking for Cho-rim?

659
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:55,255
She's not here. She's over there... alone.

660
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:56,447
Why is she alone?

661
00:50:56,447 --> 00:50:59,050
Because of you, Officer Choi.

662
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:04,364
I'm going to explain everything.

663
00:51:08,726 --> 00:51:11,338
Woo-yah...

664
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:13,007
Have a drink. Well done!

665
00:51:13,007 --> 00:51:17,197
Congratulations on first place! Cheers!

666
00:51:20,469 --> 00:51:23,502
Take a drink, Cho In-bae!

667
00:51:23,502 --> 00:51:26,914
Such a petty man!

668
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:30,836
Hey, Mr. Wang...

669
00:51:30,836 --> 00:51:35,428
I've been paying attention
to you for a while...

670
00:51:35,428 --> 00:51:37,831
But you talk too much!

671
00:51:38,293 --> 00:51:43,903
Anyway, bottoms up!

672
00:51:51,973 --> 00:51:54,673
Officer Choi is here.

673
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,816
I'm so sorry.

674
00:52:01,816 --> 00:52:04,356
An investigative situation popped up.

675
00:52:05,307 --> 00:52:06,854
I'm so sorry.

676
00:52:10,258 --> 00:52:12,682
Come here, Officer Choi.

677
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:18,235
Have a drink with me.

678
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:22,064
You're drunk. Let's go.

679
00:52:22,064 --> 00:52:25,740
Don't be like that. Just stay.

680
00:52:29,236 --> 00:52:35,255
Here.
Have a drink.

681
00:52:40,788 --> 00:52:42,878
Hey, Oh Cho-rim...

682
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:57,672
Drink this, Oh Cho-rim.

683
00:53:01,148 --> 00:53:04,668
Hey, Officer Choi.

684
00:53:04,668 --> 00:53:06,186
Turn this.

685
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:07,361
What?

686
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:11,827
What are you doing? Just turn this.

687
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:17,094
It's not my problem if you get dizzy,
okay?

688
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:18,492
Okay.

689
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:27,924
This is fun!

690
00:53:34,408 --> 00:53:39,085
What should I do now?

691
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:49,690
What should I do now?

692
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:57,771
Wake up!

693
00:54:03,008 --> 00:54:07,913
Forget it. I can go by myself.

694
00:54:07,913 --> 00:54:10,622
You're very drunk. You can't.

695
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,214
Hey.

696
00:54:13,214 --> 00:54:18,152
Just worry about yourself. Bye!

697
00:54:18,152 --> 00:54:20,821
Would you please go, Mr. Driver?

698
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:22,785
Choo, choo!

699
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:26,428
She's very drunk, so please take
good care of her.

700
00:54:38,872 --> 00:54:43,377
Oh Cho-rim! Get up!

701
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,645
Are we home already?

702
00:54:49,281 --> 00:54:50,491
Stand up.

703
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:59,961
Where is it? Where should I go?

704
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:04,530
Make a left...

705
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:16,806
I said make a left...

706
00:55:25,746 --> 00:55:29,890
Where is it from here, Oh Cho-rim?

707
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:34,198
Where is it?

708
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:40,594
You just keep going straight
if I don't say anything!

709
00:55:40,594 --> 00:55:42,134
Go straight...

710
00:55:47,741 --> 00:55:49,508
Hey, Oh Cho-rim...

711
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:51,331
Take a good look.

712
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:53,848
Where is it from here?

713
00:55:53,848 --> 00:55:55,816
Do I keep going straight?

714
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:58,119
Make a U-turn!

715
00:56:04,425 --> 00:56:05,980
How many times did we
come to this spot already?

716
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,292
Where is your place?

717
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:14,423
How many times have we gone back and forth?

718
00:56:14,824 --> 00:56:16,958
Going back...

719
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,902
And forth...

720
00:56:19,902 --> 00:56:24,098
Went back and forth...

721
00:56:46,934 --> 00:56:47,854
Lieutenant...

722
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:50,537
What brings you here at this hour?

723
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:52,336
About the Dr. Chun's alibi...

724
00:56:52,336 --> 00:56:54,532
He said he was in Jeju for four days.

725
00:56:54,532 --> 00:56:58,091
But what if he had left the island,
and then went back again?

726
00:56:58,091 --> 00:56:59,762
What are you talking about?

727
00:56:59,762 --> 00:57:03,122
He could have left Jeju Island,
murdered Joo Ma-ri

728
00:57:03,122 --> 00:57:08,151
left the body at Yangpyeong,
then gone back to Jeju.

729
00:57:08,151 --> 00:57:12,134
That's a possibility, if there's evidence.

730
00:57:12,134 --> 00:57:14,195
I'll find the evidence.

731
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:16,644
Officer Choi!

732
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:25,708
Lieutenant...

733
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,364
Wait...
