[Episode 12]

2
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:08,013
Choi Eun-seol...

3
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:11,520
You know me, don't you?

4
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:23,962
You've seen me before, right?

5
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,691
Officer Choi.

6
00:02:57,366 --> 00:03:00,333
No. Please don't do it.

7
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:09,015
I'm begging you. Please don't do it.

8
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:12,400
You're going to become a murderer like he is.

9
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:30,302
I better go find my dad first.

10
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:48,976
Dad. Dad. Dad!

11
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:11,818
Dad...

12
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:36,347
Oh Cho-rim.

13
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:41,645
Oh Cho-rim. Are you alright?

14
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:44,205
Cho-rim. Wake up.

15
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:45,687
Oh Cho-rim.

16
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,482
What's going on?

17
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:01,739
What's wrong with Cho-rim?

18
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:04,913
I think she's in shock.
I'm going to go to the hospital.

19
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:08,448
Kwon Jae-hee is unconscious on
the porch because I struck him.

20
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:11,120
You didn't kill him, right?

21
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,613
- Just go to the hospital first.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:40,808
We keep seeing each other these days.

23
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,584
What brings you here this late at night?

24
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:45,040
We received a missing persons report.

25
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,808
It's a man named Oh Jae-pyo and his cell
phone signal came from near your house.

26
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,710
Oh Jae-pyo is inside your house, isn't he?

27
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,879
Yes. He is.

28
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,760
Excuse me?

29
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,688
Oh Jae-pyo is inside your house?

30
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:05,379
Yes. He had a glass of wine with
me earlier and got drunk.

31
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:09,956
Now he's sleeping in my room.

32
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:13,588
Let me go confirm.

33
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:15,100
I can go inside and bring him out here.

34
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,973
Why are you trying to get
inside someone's house?

35
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:24,548
Just wait here for a moment.
I'll bring him out.

36
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:49,886
Message delete.

37
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:03,596
Chef Kwon.

38
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:13,571
You're awake.

39
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:15,876
Have you sobered up a bit?

40
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:19,084
I got completely drunk all of a sudden.

41
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:20,764
Please excuse my behavior.

42
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:21,947
That's alright.

43
00:07:21,947 --> 00:07:23,868
You should have something to eat first.

44
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:27,899
I dropped it here of all places.

45
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,081
That's alright. I'll eat when I get home.

46
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:32,987
I see.

47
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:37,924
By the way, you have guests outside.

48
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,187
Excuse me? Guests?

49
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:42,541
Yes.

50
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:49,844
Do you think he's telling the truth
about Oh Jae-pyo sleeping inside?

51
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,492
If he's lying, we'll immediately...

52
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:55,531
Should we just go inside?

53
00:07:55,531 --> 00:08:00,531
We should get him before he runs away.

54
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:04,828
One, two, three...

55
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:12,466
This is Oh Jae-pyo.

56
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:13,875
Y-yes.

57
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,924
It appears my daughter reported me
missing, but nothing's wrong.

58
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:20,844
She couldn't reach me because
I got drunk during the day.

59
00:08:20,844 --> 00:08:23,219
Yes.

60
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,989
Then I'll be going.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

61
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:29,379
Yes. Be careful on your way home.

62
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,368
- I'll be leaving first.
- Yes.

63
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:43,271
Are you curious about anything else?

64
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,975
No.

65
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:21,611
How's your breathing?

66
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:23,516
It's much better now.

67
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:25,307
What about your nausea?

68
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:27,661
It's much better after I vomited earlier.

69
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:31,167
Call me right away if you're dizzy
or have difficulty breathing.

70
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,904
Yes.

71
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:38,462
She's stable now. I think she fainted
because she was in shock.

72
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:40,841
Yes. Thank you.

73
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:01,779
I just received a call saying
that your father is at home.

74
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:04,284
Okay.

75
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,229
Don't worry.

76
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:07,652
Do you need anything?

77
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:09,524
I'm alright.

78
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:10,869
Rather than that, I need to hear about

79
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:14,075
what happened when I went to
Chef Kwon's house earlier.

80
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:17,938
I'll tell you tomorrow. Just rest for today.

81
00:10:17,938 --> 00:10:22,260
If you need anything, just call me.
I'll be outside.

82
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,005
He called me Choi Eun-seol.

83
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:33,357
That man, Kwon Jae-hee...

84
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:38,159
He called me Choi Eun-seol and
asked me if I remembered him.

85
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:52,800
He really is the serial killer, isn't he?

86
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,696
I'm certain.

87
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:02,846
That man Kwon Jae-hee...

88
00:11:02,846 --> 00:11:05,563
Was he trying to kill me?

89
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:15,015
Anyway... that could've
been really dangerous.

90
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:23,214
Actually I have a condition that prohibits
me from recognizing people's faces.

91
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:26,166
You've heard about
prosopagnosia, haven't you?

92
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,946
It's not that uncommon.

93
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:33,134
Kwon Jae-hee can't recognize people's faces.

94
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:35,909
He has prosopagnosia.

95
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:37,437
Are you sure about that?

96
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:42,981
Yes. He can't tell who it is if he
doesn't hear the person's voice first.

97
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:44,309
He recognizes someone by hearing

98
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:49,117
that person's voice and recalling
various memories about that person.

99
00:11:49,117 --> 00:11:54,269
Then are you saying that he didn't
recognize you when you saw him earlier?

100
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,468
He didn't recognize me.

101
00:11:56,468 --> 00:12:00,725
That's why I didn't say anything
on purpose and stayed quiet.

102
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:05,725
You did well.
That really could've been dangerous.

103
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:10,813
It would've been dangerous
if you hadn't been there.

104
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,357
Thank you.

105
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,584
Don't wear those clothes again.

106
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:22,151
He can recognize you by your clothes.

107
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,814
I won't.

108
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:38,200
I have something to say.

109
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,403
I have something to say, too.

110
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:56,303
I know that I'm the witness.

111
00:12:56,303 --> 00:13:02,100
I also know that my name is Choi Eun-seol.

112
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:14,798
I guess you already knew that.

113
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:18,327
Yeah.

114
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:23,268
I should've realized as soon as
I found out that my name is

115
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:33,835
Choi Eun-seol, but I found out a little late.

116
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:42,965
Because I was the witness and
that my name is Choi Eun-seol...

117
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:53,850
Because of me...

118
00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:04,897
Your sister died because of me.
I'm so sorry.

119
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:10,212
No. She didn't die because of you.

120
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:14,018
It doesn't change anything
even if you say it's not.

121
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:16,113
She died instead of me.

122
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:21,664
No. That creep killed my sister.

123
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:25,570
It has nothing to do with you.
Don't think that way.

124
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,906
I can't do that.

125
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:36,547
I realized just a little while ago that you
wanted break up with me for that reason.

126
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:44,159
That reason is ridiculous,
so I can't accept it.

127
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:52,650
Cho-rim, don't think about anything
else and just leave it to me.

128
00:14:52,650 --> 00:15:02,064
I'll be the one to love
you, so just accept it.

129
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:08,086
Just stay with me. Don't go anywhere.

130
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:12,761
I can't.

131
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:18,954
I just can't do that because
I feel so guilty.

132
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:54,993
Why did you hide the fact that Cho-rim
is the witness to the serial murder?

133
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:59,523
I felt sympathy for Cho-rim who lost
her parents in such a cruel manner.

134
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:03,696
I didn't want to see a child who doesn't
remember anything get dragged around

135
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:13,712
from place to place struggling to
remember painful memories.

136
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:16,871
And I was planning to catch the culprit

137
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:23,519
with my own hands once Cho-rim's
memories came back.

138
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:30,981
Did you hear about the investigation
from the captain?

139
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:34,022
Yes.

140
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:36,914
And that's why you approached
Kwon Jae-hee on purpose.

141
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:42,967
But I think I failed.

142
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:48,192
Now that Kwon Jae-hee knows
that your daughter is the witness,

143
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:53,464
I think it'd be best if Cho-rim
lives separately from you.

144
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:59,848
We'll find a place for you to stay.

145
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:05,544
Please take good care of Cho-rim.

146
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:07,044
Please don't worry.

147
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:13,980
Then where are you off to now?

148
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,341
I'll call you once I get there.

149
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:19,660
By the way, are you really alright now?

150
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,931
Of course! I'm your daughter so
I get energized right away.

151
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:28,893
I'm sorry I can't stay with you.

152
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:32,860
Just trust the people from the
investigation team and listen to them.

153
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,398
Yes, Dad. Thank you so much.

154
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:43,399
What are you thanking me for?

155
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:44,922
I'm going.

156
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:06,480
Please take good care of my daughter.

157
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,539
Please take care.

158
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,884
I'll take you home.

159
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:28,012
That's okay.

160
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:29,721
Don't be like that. Let me take you.

161
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:33,069
It's daytime and there will be a lot
of people on the road to my house.

162
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:36,971
It's okay. I can go home by myself.

163
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:40,259
Fine. Call me when you get home.

164
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:48,670
Oh Cho-rim.

165
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:56,040
Are you alright?

166
00:20:10,563 --> 00:20:12,507
Stay right here for a moment.

167
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,039
Are you alright?

168
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:54,963
Just what's going on?

169
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,628
Drink this. You'll feel better.

170
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:14,703
Thank you.

171
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:22,894
I have to check and see if
Kwon Jae-hee or a robber was here.

172
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:25,343
Let's check and see if there
is anything missing.

173
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:38,206
Check thoroughly.

174
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:44,953
I don't think anything special is missing.

175
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:47,088
Look carefully.

176
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:04,602
A picture that was here is missing.

177
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:06,429
A picture?

178
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:11,807
It's Kwon Jae-hee.

179
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:15,033
Kwon Jae-hee was here. I'm certain.

180
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:20,234
Seeing that a picture is missing,
it's clear that he didn't recognize me.

181
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:25,936
Let's go.

182
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:26,992
Where?

183
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,457
It's dangerous.

184
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:30,649
It will be dangerous if you stay here.

185
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:36,210
I'm not saying this because
you're Oh Cho-rim.

186
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,739
You're a victim who's being
pursued by the culprit.

187
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:44,037
You don't need anything from
here, so just come with me.

188
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:43,360
Just stay here for awhile until
we can find you a place to stay.

189
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,478
I have a place to stay nearby,
so don't worry about me.

190
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:51,728
I'm taking your place away
from you all of a sudden.

191
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:52,826
No.

192
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:57,632
I have a key also.

193
00:23:57,632 --> 00:24:00,208
When you're at home, lock the additional lock

194
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,698
also so that you can't open the
door even with the key.

195
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:04,498
Don't open the door to anyone other than me.

196
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:07,016
Always call me first before you go out.

197
00:24:07,016 --> 00:24:11,424
And you can't tell anyone
that you're staying here.

198
00:24:11,424 --> 00:24:12,872
Not even your dad...

199
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:15,464
Yes.

200
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:17,998
I'll always be just 3 minutes away from here.

201
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,894
So you can feel at ease.

202
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:22,414
It's probably not going to be as

203
00:24:22,414 --> 00:24:25,654
comfortable as your house,
but make yourself comfortable.

204
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:27,998
Do you have anything to ask me?

205
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:30,231
Are you sure you have a place to stay?

206
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:34,560
Yes. I have a friend who
lives across the street.

207
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,287
I'm going to go. Make yourself at home...

208
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:39,882
Okay.

209
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,077
Be comfortable.

210
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:54,662
Yes.

211
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:12,614
Why are you standing around? Sit down.

212
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:14,710
Be comfortable. Sit down.

213
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:20,636
If you there's something else you need,
take your time packing.

214
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:23,656
No. I don't have anything to take.
Make yourself at home.

215
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:47,617
I forgot to tell you something.

216
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:49,785
Don't open the windows and look outside.

217
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:53,481
Don't even get near the windows.
They can see you from the outside.

218
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:55,073
I got it.

219
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:58,236
I'm really leaving. Make yourself at home.

220
00:26:27,634 --> 00:26:29,075
Hello.

221
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:30,203
Yes.

222
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:33,467
I told you not to stand near the window.

223
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,803
You can see me?

224
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,399
I can see everything.

225
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:38,799
Where are you?

226
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,703
I told you not to stand by the window.

227
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:43,167
I got it.

228
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,065
I'm hanging up

229
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:46,143
Your friend wouldn't let you wash up
so you came home to wash up?

230
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:47,396
That's what I said.

231
00:27:47,396 --> 00:27:49,859
He really tries to keep his water bill low.

232
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:52,861
I thought you said he bought you
dinner and let you sleep over.

233
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:54,549
But he wouldn't let you wash up?

234
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,693
Isn't it funny?

235
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:58,029
He's a strange guy.

236
00:27:58,029 --> 00:27:59,869
I'm going to be late for work.

237
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:02,321
I thought you said you're going to
be late for your appointment.

238
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:09,118
Officer Choi.

239
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:11,709
Hurry up and come. Elevator is here.

240
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:21,270
A lot of newlyweds live here.

241
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,132
You guys look good together.

242
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:25,012
You're going to have a happy life.

243
00:28:25,012 --> 00:28:26,109
Well...

244
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:28,000
Yes. Thank you.

245
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,867
Where do you have to go? I'll take you there.

246
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:45,052
I thought you're going to be late, too.

247
00:28:45,052 --> 00:28:46,947
That's alright.

248
00:28:46,947 --> 00:28:48,339
Okay. Just make sure to go where

249
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:49,891
a lot of people are and
call me when you go home.

250
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:51,395
Do you understand?

251
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:54,962
Yes. Don't worry.

252
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:56,569
Okay. I'll get going then.

253
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,521
See you later.

254
00:29:13,163 --> 00:29:17,042
This is the only quiet place here.
Is this okay?

255
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:19,122
Yes, it's fine.

256
00:29:19,122 --> 00:29:22,902
I came to ask you something.

257
00:29:22,902 --> 00:29:24,518
Go ahead.

258
00:29:24,518 --> 00:29:26,656
It's what I spoke to you about before.

259
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:30,703
Have you thought about using
me to catch the culprit?

260
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,488
Cho-rim, that's too dangerous.

261
00:29:33,488 --> 00:29:36,607
Kwon Jae-hee came to your house
yesterday and took your picture.

262
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:39,637
That's more serious than we think.

263
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:42,816
He can figure you out as the
witness with that picture.

264
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:46,449
But he has no idea that I'm the witness.

265
00:29:46,449 --> 00:29:51,585
So I'll give it a try.
I'll bring that picture back.

266
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:58,554
What are you talking about?

267
00:29:58,554 --> 00:30:03,192
You searched the house thoroughly, but
you didn't find a single piece of evidence?

268
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:08,122
They couldn't find fingerprints,
footprints or any other traces.

269
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:11,682
It's impossible to get a warrant
for Kwon Jae-hee right now.

270
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:16,178
That's because we got rejected the last
time when we faked Moo-gak as a witness.

271
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:20,010
So far, we don't have any proof
or the witness' memory.

272
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,339
Therefore, we can't even
call her as a witness.

273
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:26,427
I'm certain that Kwon Jae-hee
is the barcode serial killer.

274
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:31,345
I know. It's certain, but
we don't have any evidence.

275
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:34,714
All this time, Kwon Jae-hee's alibi on
the day of the murders has been solid.

276
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:39,682
This is so frustrating.

277
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:45,018
Anyway, shouldn't we move
Oh Cho-rim to a safe house at least?

278
00:30:45,018 --> 00:30:50,722
I know. It'll be all over if he comes after
her using that stolen picture.

279
00:30:50,722 --> 00:30:56,219
Oh Cho-rim volunteered to bring that
picture back from Kwon Jae-hee herself.

280
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:58,992
What are you talking about?
Oh Cho-rim said that?

281
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:04,626
Oh Cho-rim, what's going on in your mind?

282
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:09,442
You know that Chef Kwon
isn't suspicious of me right now.

283
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:12,962
So, I'm the safest when I stay as Oh Cho-rim.

284
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:16,314
That may be true, but not like this.
It's too dangerous!

285
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:20,026
I'm not doing this for anyone else.
I'm trying to protect myself.

286
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:22,732
I'm trying to bring back my picture.

287
00:31:22,732 --> 00:31:24,515
It's clear that Cho-rim is the only person

288
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,539
who can enter Kwon Jae-hee's
house in this situation.

289
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:28,946
We have to bring back that picture

290
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:33,651
before Kwon Jae-hee shows
that picture to someone.

291
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:37,170
There's a TV show taping at
Chef Kwon's house today.

292
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,703
Today is the only chance we have.

293
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:46,410
A lot of crew members are around during the
taping, so there's nothing to worry about.

294
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,114
Fine. Everything sounds good,
but you have to do exactly as I say.

295
00:31:50,114 --> 00:31:51,290
Do you understand?

296
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,946
If you promise me that, I'll let you go.

297
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,258
Alright.

298
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:57,330
I'll stand ready nearby.

299
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,210
We're going to give you
a two-way radio as well.

300
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,051
You have to follow my orders.

301
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:03,546
If I think that it's dangerous and
tell you to stop,

302
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,154
you have to stop immediately.

303
00:32:06,154 --> 00:32:08,013
Alright.

304
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:16,859
It's a secret camera shaped like a book.

305
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:21,250
Here. Do you see the lens?

306
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,826
Switch is right here.

307
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:26,761
These are the wireless
two-way radio earphones.

308
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:28,760
If you put this in your ear,
you'll be connected

309
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,454
to us immediately, so you can
talk to us and hear us also.

310
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:35,809
Here.

311
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:38,930
Try pressing it.

312
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:49,145
You just have to press this

313
00:32:49,145 --> 00:32:57,328
if you're discovered by Kwon Jae-hee
and can't say anything.

314
00:32:57,328 --> 00:33:01,864
They're simple to use, but
are you able to do it?

315
00:33:01,864 --> 00:33:02,905
If you can't do it...

316
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:05,249
I can do it.

317
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,033
Since Chef Kwon spends
a lot of time in his library,

318
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:10,560
we chose a camera in the form of a book.

319
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,960
I see.

320
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,303
It's almost time for the taping.

321
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:24,627
Yes. I can do it. Don't worry.

322
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:36,096
Hello.

323
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:55,896
Chef Kwon. I'm here.

324
00:33:55,896 --> 00:33:59,694
Cho-rim, you're here.
Your dress looks nice today.

325
00:33:59,694 --> 00:34:00,695
Thank you.

326
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:02,638
They told me that they came up
with a show called

327
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:04,534
"Some Man, Some Woman and Some Cook"

328
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:07,141
for us to start on next week.

329
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:10,569
Together with Chef Kwon? It's a real honor.

330
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:12,545
Let's do our best.

331
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:13,612
Thank you.

332
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:17,907
Chef Kwon. Please check today's
ingredients and the cooking tools.

333
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,514
- Today's theme is 5-minute cooking.
- Right.

334
00:34:24,514 --> 00:34:28,761
The viewers these days are quite sharp,
so we have to show them for real.

335
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:34,432
While you're cooking,
the timer will be on as well.

336
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:36,920
What happens if I can't finish
cooking in 5 minutes?

337
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,905
It's making me quite nervous.

338
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:42,018
Then it'll be a blooper.

339
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:48,098
I understand. I don't want to make
a mistake because of this.

340
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:51,025
Cho-rim.

341
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:52,202
Yes.

342
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:56,632
Would you cheer me on so that
I don't make a mistake?

343
00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:59,672
Chef Kwon, you can do it.

344
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:01,616
Then should we go over it?

345
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:05,028
First, let's check in real time.
It's exactly 5 minutes.

346
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:06,039
Yes.

347
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,372
I'm starting now.

348
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:17,201
Today's 5 minute meal is wonton-skin
pizza and tofu salad.

349
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:18,471
I'm sure there are some of you asking,

350
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:21,177
“How can you cook two dishes in 5 minutes?”

351
00:35:21,177 --> 00:35:23,951
I'll start now.

352
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:39,335
Can you hear me?

353
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:43,204
Yes. I can hear you.

354
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:45,693
I have exactly 5 minutes starting now.

355
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:48,205
Go down to the library. I'll watch the timer.

356
00:35:48,205 --> 00:35:49,694
Yes.

357
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:56,628
On a well-heated frying pan,

358
00:35:56,628 --> 00:36:01,282
pour the olive oil generously
and put in the wonton skins.

359
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:09,548
Make sure to fry the wonton skins
golden brown and flip them over.

360
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:13,962
Among food smells,
the smell of oil is the best.

361
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:36,804
Now if you cook it in the oven for
1 minute and 30 seconds,

362
00:36:36,804 --> 00:36:39,717
a delicious pizza will come out.

363
00:36:45,388 --> 00:36:46,932
How much time do I have left?

364
00:36:46,932 --> 00:36:49,556
There are two minutes left.

365
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:53,859
I'll try to make a tofu salad
during that time.

366
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:56,243
You can really make them in 5 minutes.

367
00:36:56,243 --> 00:36:58,997
You can make the tofu salad
when we actually record it.

368
00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:00,099
Should I then?

369
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:04,523
Then let's shoot Oh Cho-rim's
"Cook Room Era" first.

370
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,096
Cho-rim.

371
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:09,331
Oh Cho-rim.

372
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:24,147
What's going on?

373
00:37:24,147 --> 00:37:25,726
What should I do?

374
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:28,423
It's alright.

375
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:34,733
Calm down.

376
00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:37,870
There is still 2 minutes left,
so you can calm down.

377
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,308
The camera's on.

378
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:44,859
How is the location?

379
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:46,425
Yes. It's fine.

380
00:37:46,425 --> 00:37:47,895
Hurry up and get out of there.

381
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,883
Cho-rim.

382
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:52,859
Have you seen Cho-rim?

383
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:54,347
No, I haven't.

384
00:37:54,347 --> 00:37:58,091
Where did she go? Cho-rim.

385
00:38:22,872 --> 00:38:25,208
Oh my. I'm sorry.

386
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:27,268
I'm the one who should be sorry, Chef Kwon.

387
00:38:27,268 --> 00:38:29,067
My stocking is...

388
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:32,492
There are so many male crew
members in the bathroom.

389
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:34,030
They're going to start taping soon.

390
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,370
Yes. I'll get ready quickly.

391
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,807
Cho-rim.

392
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,374
Leave your wallet in the bathroom,

393
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,109
so that you can get retrieve the camera.

394
00:39:27,674 --> 00:39:30,361
Good job.

395
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,319
Did I do everything right?

396
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:39,368
Do you have water?

397
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:41,772
Water. Here.

398
00:39:52,594 --> 00:39:54,394
You don't like pork skin restaurants?

399
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:57,172
I do. It totally suits my taste.

400
00:39:57,172 --> 00:39:58,544
That's good.

401
00:39:58,544 --> 00:40:02,162
After I became a police officer and went
to the crime scene for the first time,

402
00:40:02,162 --> 00:40:05,322
my colleague bought me pork skin.

403
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:08,602
You're saying that it was my first time
being on a crime scene, right?

404
00:40:08,602 --> 00:40:11,826
Yes. But do you know why he took
me to a pork skin restaurant?

405
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,040
I'm not sure.

406
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,872
Look at it.

407
00:40:19,538 --> 00:40:22,873
I still don't know.

408
00:40:22,873 --> 00:40:28,306
Here. You can see that it's shrinking, right?

409
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:29,393
Because you were so nervous,

410
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,857
you shrank when you went to
your first crime scene?

411
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:34,081
Yeah. If you eat pig skin

412
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:37,133
you won't shrink the next time
you go to a crime scene.

413
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:41,144
Then I'm going to eat it quickly.
I was so nervous earlier.

414
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:42,745
Wait a minute.

415
00:40:43,893 --> 00:40:45,806
This one is cooked well.

416
00:40:52,522 --> 00:40:54,224
It's hot.

417
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,640
You became a detective
because of your sister.

418
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,285
How do you like it?

419
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:10,134
What do you mean?

420
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:14,449
You were originally supposed to be
with the fish in an aquarium.

421
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:18,463
Do you like being a detective?

422
00:41:18,463 --> 00:41:24,078
I'm not sure if I like it, but I know
it's what I'm supposed be.

423
00:41:24,078 --> 00:41:30,044
You're supposed to be on stage being funny,
but you're here at a dangerous crime scene.

424
00:41:30,044 --> 00:41:33,812
Don't you want to go back to on stage?

425
00:41:33,812 --> 00:41:39,030
I'm sure I can go back soon. What about you?

426
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,069
I don't know. Will I be able to go back?

427
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:45,284
What are you saying?

428
00:41:45,284 --> 00:41:48,162
Of course you can go back.

429
00:41:48,162 --> 00:41:52,018
Once this case is closed,
I want to go back...

430
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:55,296
to the aquarium where I
used to be with the fish...

431
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:58,698
and to the house where I can
see the Jeju Island ocean...

432
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:08,929
When I go back after everything's done,
will you go back with me?

433
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:21,588
I'm going to keep begging
you to go back with me.

434
00:42:21,588 --> 00:42:23,004
Be prepared.

435
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:48,054
When you go see your sister,
please take me with you.

436
00:42:48,054 --> 00:42:53,059
I really want to tell her that I'm sorry.

437
00:43:10,427 --> 00:43:16,587
Alright. Let's go together.

438
00:43:16,587 --> 00:43:20,588
Eun-seol, you can tell Eun-seol.

439
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:56,499
What's this.. Is the screen frozen?

440
00:43:56,499 --> 00:44:01,491
Oh my! That surprised me.

441
00:44:01,491 --> 00:44:06,299
You're finally here, Kwon Jae-hee.

442
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:09,611
It's recording well.

443
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:12,778
Kwon Jae-hee.

444
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:16,032
Don't just look at the book,
but do something.

445
00:44:22,986 --> 00:44:26,480
Is that the picture he stole?

446
00:44:55,997 --> 00:45:00,693
Yes. I'm looking for someone.

447
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:04,445
She lived in Jeju three years ago.
Her name is Choi Eun-seol.

448
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:08,180
But she probably has a different name now.

449
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,877
I'll give you the picture
when I see you tomorrow.

450
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:15,286
Yes, tomorrow at 4 p.m. is good.

451
00:45:18,157 --> 00:45:20,888
Okay. Good.

452
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:50,141
You must be tired.
I'll go first, so get some rest.

453
00:45:50,141 --> 00:45:52,172
Are you going to sleep over
at your friend's house again?

454
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:55,157
Yes.

455
00:45:55,157 --> 00:45:57,492
Then I guess you'll be back to
wash in the morning again.

456
00:45:57,492 --> 00:45:59,860
That's right.

457
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,557
Be careful on your way there.

458
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:02,837
It's just right in front.

459
00:46:02,837 --> 00:46:06,469
Lock the door and sleep well
until I come back in the morning.

460
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:07,460
Yes.

461
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,152
I'm leaving.

462
00:46:10,386 --> 00:46:12,299
Make yourself at home.

463
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,029
How did you know I was here?

464
00:46:52,029 --> 00:46:54,984
Is this your friend's house?

465
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:02,133
Were you here by yourself
all night long last night?

466
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:06,349
I do stakeouts for a living anyway.

467
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:07,612
Go inside.

468
00:47:07,612 --> 00:47:11,029
I can't do that. Then where will you go?

469
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:13,989
Let's go inside together.

470
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:15,389
Really?

471
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:29,173
Then I should buy another pair of slippers.

472
00:47:29,173 --> 00:47:34,933
And we're out of drinking water, too.
We need to buy toothpaste as well.

473
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:38,708
Then I guess I should go grocery shopping.

474
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:41,226
Write down what you're going to buy.

475
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,302
Are you sleepy?

476
00:47:49,302 --> 00:47:51,822
Go to sleep if you're sleepy.

477
00:47:51,822 --> 00:47:53,285
No. I'm fine.

478
00:47:53,285 --> 00:47:55,328
If you're sleepy, then go to sleep first.

479
00:47:55,328 --> 00:47:58,601
No. I'll go to sleep once you fall asleep.

480
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:03,065
I'm not that sleepy.

481
00:48:03,065 --> 00:48:05,501
Me neither.

482
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,879
We received the image file
of the picture that

483
00:48:16,879 --> 00:48:19,501
Kwon Jae-hee stole and uploaded here.

484
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:21,159
Shall we start?

485
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:22,590
Yes, sir.

486
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:31,111
Why do we have to go through the
trouble of blending these pictures?

487
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:35,350
We just have to steal back the picture
Kwon Jae-hee took and rip it up.

488
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:36,655
Then he'll steal another picture

489
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:40,655
or try to find Cho-rim using different means.

490
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:43,064
Since Kwon Jae-hee can't
recognize people's faces,

491
00:48:43,064 --> 00:48:45,566
he doesn't know whose picture it
is even if he looks at a picture.

492
00:48:45,566 --> 00:48:47,739
Kwon Jae-hee won't try to find her himself.

493
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:50,947
Since he's going to give the picture
to someone else to find the witness,

494
00:48:50,947 --> 00:48:54,914
he'll never be able to find her
if the picture is of some other woman.

495
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:56,915
Now that I hear it, that's right.

496
00:48:56,915 --> 00:48:58,355
How come I'm the only one who doesn't know?

497
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:01,178
You're just pretending that you don't know...

498
00:49:01,178 --> 00:49:05,393
By the way, she looks completely
different from Cho-rim.

499
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:09,297
What do you think? Would this be enough?

500
00:49:09,297 --> 00:49:12,129
Yes. It's very good.

501
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:14,456
I guess every man has his own trade.

502
00:49:14,456 --> 00:49:18,120
I heard you still type with just two fingers.

503
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,375
Like this...

504
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:24,069
Then now we just have to print
this picture in the same size as the

505
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:29,622
other one and switch it with the
one in Kwon Jae-hee's wallet.

506
00:49:29,622 --> 00:49:32,927
Then I'll deliver this picture to Oh Cho-rim.

507
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:44,549
The picture came out.

508
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:48,048
It's a completely different face from mine.

509
00:49:48,048 --> 00:49:49,025
Who is it?

510
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:49,961
It's a fake.

511
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:51,600
There's no one who has that face.

512
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,832
It's a 100% blended picture.

513
00:49:54,832 --> 00:50:02,259
It's a relief knowing that
no one has that face.

514
00:50:02,259 --> 00:50:05,704
Your picture is inside Kwon Jae-hee's wallet.

515
00:50:05,704 --> 00:50:07,535
Will you be able to switch it?

516
00:50:07,535 --> 00:50:08,934
I can do it.

517
00:50:08,934 --> 00:50:10,287
Kwon Jae-hee is scheduled to

518
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:12,582
meet the person who finds
missing persons at 4 p.m. today.

519
00:50:12,582 --> 00:50:14,942
He's going to leave the restaurant by 3 p.m.

520
00:50:14,942 --> 00:50:17,558
You have to switch the pictures before then.

521
00:50:17,558 --> 00:50:18,966
I got it. I'll get going then.

522
00:50:18,966 --> 00:50:22,918
Do you have the emergency alarm?

523
00:50:22,918 --> 00:50:24,340
Here.

524
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,492
I'm going to leave soon also.

525
00:50:26,492 --> 00:50:29,840
I'm always near you, so don't be afraid.

526
00:50:56,736 --> 00:50:58,356
Why is the food coming out so slowly?

527
00:50:58,356 --> 00:50:59,835
The customers are waiting.

528
00:50:59,835 --> 00:51:00,820
I'm sorry.

529
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:03,836
There was an error with the orders,
so the service got all messed up.

530
00:51:03,836 --> 00:51:04,900
What's the menu?

531
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,462
It's stir-fried curry crab.

532
00:51:06,462 --> 00:51:08,086
I'll do it.

533
00:51:16,777 --> 00:51:18,025
What are you doing? It's busy.

534
00:51:18,025 --> 00:51:19,243
You should go clean the table.

535
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,822
Yes, I'm going.

536
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:18,662
Chef Kwon.

537
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:20,430
I have something to tell you.

538
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,695
Yes. What is it?

539
00:52:21,695 --> 00:52:26,313
I think I left my wallet at your house
yesterday after the taping yesterday.

540
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:27,080
I see.

541
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,496
Then you should go get it right away.

542
00:52:28,496 --> 00:52:29,918
It's inconvenient if you don't have it.

543
00:52:29,918 --> 00:52:31,807
Yes. A little bit.

544
00:52:31,807 --> 00:52:37,447
But I have an appointment elsewhere
so you'll have to go get it yourself.

545
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:40,414
Give it back to me tomorrow.
I can just use the secret code.

546
00:52:40,414 --> 00:52:42,947
I apologize for the inconvenience.

547
00:52:42,947 --> 00:52:44,475
That's alright. I'll see you tomorrow.

548
00:52:44,475 --> 00:52:45,732
Yes. Goodbye.

549
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:47,062
Yes.

550
00:52:56,201 --> 00:52:57,671
Officer Choi. It's me.

551
00:52:57,671 --> 00:52:59,341
How did it go? Are you alright?

552
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:02,110
Yes. I switched the pictures.

553
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,973
Good. What about Kwon Jae-hee?

554
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:06,694
Chef Kwon left for his appointment just now.

555
00:53:06,694 --> 00:53:08,364
Then you have to retrieve the camera now.

556
00:53:08,364 --> 00:53:10,061
Head over to Kwon Jae-hee's house right now.

557
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,029
I got it.

558
00:53:11,029 --> 00:53:11,822
Move quickly.

559
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:14,249
I'm near Kwon Jae-hee's house right now.

560
00:53:18,277 --> 00:53:20,693
Oh Cho-rim, take this over to the storage.

561
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:22,342
Yes. I got it.

562
00:53:42,323 --> 00:53:43,844
Yes. Hello.

563
00:53:43,844 --> 00:53:46,234
Yes. I'm supposed to meet you today.

564
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:48,074
Yes. I'm on my way.

565
00:53:48,074 --> 00:53:53,288
Is the person you're looking for
related to a crime perhaps?

566
00:53:53,288 --> 00:53:54,699
Why do you ask?

567
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,984
I came to our meeting place early

568
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,281
and noticed that there are
detectives all over the place.

569
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,248
It looks as if you've been found out.

570
00:54:01,248 --> 00:54:03,891
You should be careful and
not hurt anyone else.

571
00:54:54,946 --> 00:54:57,240
Why is Kwon Jae-hee here at this time?

572
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:00,081
Please answer.

573
00:56:35,866 --> 00:56:38,346
Oh Cho-rim. Oh Cho-rim. Can you hear me?

574
00:56:38,346 --> 00:56:40,543
Don't you have the earphones on?

575
00:56:50,946 --> 00:56:53,898
Why?

576
00:56:53,898 --> 00:56:56,517
What are you so curious about?

577
00:56:57,945 --> 00:57:00,917
Cho-rim. Get out immediately.

578
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,580
Oh Cho-rim. Get out immediately!
