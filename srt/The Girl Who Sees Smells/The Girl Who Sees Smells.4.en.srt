00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,503
[Episode 4]

2
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:24,729
Lieutenant.

3
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:27,289
What brings you here at this hour?

4
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:29,168
It's about Dr. Chun's alibi.

5
00:00:29,168 --> 00:00:31,249
He said he was in
Jeju Island for four days.

6
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:34,944
But what if he had left the island,
and then went back again?

7
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:36,809
What do you mean?

8
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,242
He could've left Jeju Island in the middle of
his trip and gone to the kidnapping location.

9
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,314
I'm saying he could've killed Joo Ma-ri,

10
00:00:42,314 --> 00:00:45,267
left her body in Yangpyeong
and returned to Jeju Island.

11
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:48,947
That's a possibility, if there's evidence.

12
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:50,796
I'll find the evidence.

13
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:52,866
Officer Choi.

14
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:58,264
Officer Choi.

15
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:03,448
Lieutenant.

16
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:05,204
Wait a minute.

17
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,586
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:21,626
I shouldn't have brought someone in here.

19
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,704
Officer Choi.

20
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,381
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,345
Oh Cho-rim, come to your senses.

22
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:43,275
This won't do, Oh Cho-rim.

23
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:45,737
Sit here quietly until you're sober.

24
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:50,741
Oh Cho-rim, sit down.

25
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:03,566
Officer Choi.

26
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:09,691
This person's name is...

27
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:11,291
Her name is Oh Cho-rim.

28
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:15,131
She's a friend. She's kind of
in a weird condition right now.

29
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:19,162
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:20,297
Really?

31
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:21,889
I know I shouldn't bring someone
into the investigation office.

32
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:25,018
I'm really sorry. I'll take her
outside right away.

33
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:27,316
Come here quickly.

34
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:35,120
I think she'll need
to rest a little more.

35
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:41,825
Try to crack Dr. Chun's alibi.

36
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:44,321
Are you going home?

37
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:47,885
It's almost time to start work.
I'll see you later.

38
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:50,634
Good night.

39
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:22,606
Oh Cho-rim, drink this.

40
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,301
You're really something.

41
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:04,775
Good job.

42
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:08,748
The weather is so nice.

43
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,409
Who are you?

44
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:34,951
And who are you?

45
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:39,104
- No... Where am I?
- Where am I?

46
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:40,494
Who am I?

47
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:42,878
Miss, who are you?

48
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:44,799
What are you doing here?

49
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,304
She's intoxicated...

50
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,834
If she's intoxicated, they should've
sent her somewhere else.

51
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,846
Why are you here?

52
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:55,267
She's my friend.

53
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:58,509
She was quite drunk so
I had to bring her here.

54
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:03,287
You should only drink what you can handle.

55
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:09,254
If you wake up the next day embarrassed,
then you drank too much.

56
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:12,935
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

57
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:15,445
Have a good day. I'm sorry.

58
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:21,463
Did she leave this?

59
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:23,565
I'll give this to her
and come right back.

60
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,675
Why is this person here?
She's not part of our troupe.

61
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,874
Oh Cho-rim. Oh Cho-rim.

62
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:55,913
You forgot this.

63
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:00,775
Why did you bring me
to the police station?

64
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:03,030
Are you getting angry with me?

65
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,887
It's because you were so drunk
that you couldn't find your house.

66
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:08,647
Do you know what kind of harm you caused?

67
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:12,398
I was kicked out of my troupe.

68
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,438
Didn't you say yesterday that
it was okay and you understand?

69
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:18,095
I don't understand and I'm not okay.

70
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:20,311
My life is over.

71
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:27,807
I almost let it go yesterday because I was
drunk, but I have to let it all out now.

72
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:30,623
Go ahead. Let it all out.

73
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:42,582
Ah, that hurt.

74
00:07:46,426 --> 00:07:51,911
Oh, that's right. You don't even feel pain.

75
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:56,023
I'm so mad because I was
kicked out of my troupe.

76
00:07:56,023 --> 00:07:58,926
I'm so disappointed and heartbroken...

77
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:01,280
I'm the only one who's hurting.

78
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,256
I'm ruined because of you.

79
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:10,896
I guess we won't ever
have to meet again.

80
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:20,310
Hey, Oh Cho-rim.
Oh Cho-rim!

81
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:38,307
I'm ruined because of you.

82
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:41,131
I guess we won't ever
have to meet again.

83
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:47,086
Officer Choi, you were here.

84
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:49,759
Yes, I was thinking about something.

85
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,151
We should go to Dr. Chun's hospital.

86
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:54,103
No, no. We just have to verify the truth.

87
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:55,783
I'll just go by myself.

88
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:57,902
Would that be okay, Detective Tak?

89
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:01,063
Keep on thinking. I'll be back.

90
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:02,965
Thank you.

91
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:14,040
Yes.

92
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,099
Hello. I'm Detective Tak Jae-seok
from the southern precinct.

93
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:27,117
Officer Choi must've
gone somewhere today.

94
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:41,882
Oh my... What brings you here?

95
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:46,074
Sir. Oh Cho-rim blew her
audition all because of me.

96
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:51,059
Please give her one more chance.

97
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:53,299
But we're done with her.

98
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:58,803
It's all my fault. Please take
her back. I'm begging you.

99
00:09:58,803 --> 00:10:01,810
If it's all your fault,
you should take responsibility.

100
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,554
How are you going to
take responsibility?

101
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:05,315
Do you have a plan?

102
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:07,074
I'll do anything.

103
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,459
Oh, really?

104
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,729
Then try making me laugh.

105
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:18,363
Make you laugh... right here?

106
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:22,995
If you make me laugh,
I'll think it over.

107
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,018
I want it to be just us two for this.

108
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:35,099
Just us two?

109
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:37,845
It'll be more difficult if
it's just us two...

110
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:40,418
It's so obvious how it'll turn out
even if we don't see it, right?

111
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:41,547
Do you think that's even possible?

112
00:10:41,547 --> 00:10:44,226
So far, no one's succeeded
in making him laugh.

113
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,683
Then Oh Cho-rim won't ever
be able to come back.

114
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:51,271
In a minute, we'll hear the
troupe leader's angry screams.

115
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:54,920
What is that sound?

116
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:07,400
You're really funny.

117
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,160
Don't look at me.
He's such a funny guy.

118
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:40,934
It hurts...

119
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:49,433
Yes, sir. This is Oh Cho-rim.

120
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:50,689
Excuse me?

121
00:11:56,314 --> 00:12:03,794
Up to now, you haven't done a single thing
well. You did everything wrong.

122
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:07,881
But you succeeded in just one thing.

123
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:13,003
You chose your partner well.
Officer Choi.

124
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,818
Yes...

125
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,442
Try again with Officer Choi.

126
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:18,754
If you do well, I'll give another chance.

127
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:22,282
But you must do it with Officer Choi.

128
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:25,804
Do you understand what I'm saying?
It has to be with Officer Choi.

129
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:32,202
I'm ruined because of you.

130
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,632
I guess I won't ever
have to see you again.

131
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:42,161
I spoke way too soon.

132
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,379
What am I going to do?

133
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:08,797
Hello, detective.

134
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:10,998
I'm really sorry about this morning.

135
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:16,167
Who are you? Ah, the drunkard!

136
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:18,359
I guess you washed your
face before you came.

137
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:20,414
I almost didn't recognize you.

138
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:22,394
I'm sure you're tired.
Please drink this.

139
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:24,275
They say it gives you
energy when you're tired.

140
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:27,714
You didn't have to do this.

141
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:33,794
Now that you're sober,
you have such good manners.

142
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:35,107
Thank you.

143
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,775
Hello, detective. Please drink this
and feel energetic.

144
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:41,417
I really don't like things like
this, but I'll try to enjoy it.

145
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,067
Oh, you must be having a
hard time raising a baby.

146
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:52,423
You look very tired. Take two of these.

147
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:53,882
Why are you saying this to a bachelor?

148
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,345
Thank you.

149
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:56,902
Why'd you skip me?

150
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,543
Because I was heading this way.
I'll give you one, too.

151
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:01,696
Keep your energy high. Keep up the good work!

152
00:14:01,696 --> 00:14:03,304
You, too!

153
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:11,267
Officer Choi, I was quite rude to
you this morning. Please drink this.

154
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:18,678
Thank you.

155
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:24,011
We need to talk about...

156
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:28,404
Yes, this is Officer Choi Moo-gak
from the southern precinct.

157
00:14:28,404 --> 00:14:30,443
Ah, the Youngchun bus case...

158
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:35,163
Yes, I requested the surveillance
video to verify the passengers.

159
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:37,709
Yes, please send me a copy right away.

160
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,186
Hello, Detective.

161
00:14:59,186 --> 00:15:00,683
You haven't left yet?

162
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:04,891
That's right. I'm curious about
something. Could I ask you about it?

163
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:07,492
If you're curious about something,
then you should ask.

164
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:09,102
Well...

165
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:19,793
Really?

166
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,894
Everyone pay attention.

167
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:26,462
This woman is aspiring to be a comedienne.

168
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:29,924
And she wants to do a skit
about our precinct.

169
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:31,486
Make us laugh.

170
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,787
What do you think you're
doing at a police precinct?

171
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:42,285
You pass out energy drinks
and make people laugh.

172
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:44,445
I can't even show my appreciation?

173
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:48,077
Then you should've just dropped off
the drinks and left right away.

174
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:51,341
Am I being scolded right now?

175
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,021
Why did you come to the precinct?

176
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:56,341
I told you. I came to show my appreciation.

177
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:57,438
To whom?

178
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:58,724
To the detectives.

179
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,415
Which detective? To how many of them?

180
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:04,456
To everyone. I'm thankful to everyone.

181
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:05,294
About what?

182
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:07,877
They let me spend the night at the precinct.

183
00:16:07,877 --> 00:16:09,397
I was the one who let you.

184
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:13,719
That's what I'm saying.
I'm thankful to everyone.

185
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,471
I thought you're ruined because of me?

186
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:17,054
I thought you said there was
no reason for us to see each other?

187
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:19,878
It hasn't been that long since
you said that this morning.

188
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,935
Yes.

189
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:30,461
I think I was out of line because
I wasn't sober enough this morning.

190
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:34,741
So?

191
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:37,388
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:40,136
Can't you make your apology longer?

193
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:49,037
I'm sorry for speaking out of
line and making you angry.

194
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:51,683
Okay. I understand.

195
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:54,666
I have to ask him to work with me again.

196
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,306
What should I do?

197
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,307
I can't practice the skit with you tomorrow.

198
00:16:58,307 --> 00:17:01,169
Excuse me? The skit?

199
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:03,178
How did he know I was going
to bring up the skit?

200
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:05,499
If we can't do it tomorrow, when can you?

201
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:06,871
Officer Choi!

202
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,660
Please eat.

203
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,313
The owner doesn't look happy.

204
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:24,466
Should I stop eating?

205
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,606
It's all you can eat, so what's the problem?

206
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:31,660
Since you practiced hard on the skit,
I'm treating you, so eat up.

207
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:39,165
But I thought "The Moon of Seoul" from
last time was funnier than today's skit.

208
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:42,827
You should just leave the skit to me...

209
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:47,821
That's spicy. It's so spicy!

210
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:53,125
You really can't taste anything?

211
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,646
I don't know what it tastes like.

212
00:17:55,646 --> 00:18:00,124
Are you saying that you can't taste
if it's spicy, salty, sweet or bland?

213
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:01,702
That's right.

214
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,212
Yes. This is Choi Moo-gak.

215
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:06,814
Just a second.

216
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,979
That's strange.

217
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:13,731
Let's see if he really can't taste anything.

218
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:18,723
Even though he says that, he should
notice if it's very spicy.

219
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,161
Yes.

220
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:36,518
Yes. Did you say you sent
the surveillance footage?

221
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:39,976
Yes, I'll contact you once I verify it.

222
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:53,015
Let's eat the tuna.

223
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:54,103
Can you me give the shrimp?

224
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:55,575
Shrimp...

225
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:19,209
Eat.

226
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,038
Oh no!

227
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:19,439
Lieutenant, what do you think this is?

228
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,896
You got here quickly, Detective Tak.

229
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:24,648
I pass by here on my way to work.
I came as soon as I got the call.

230
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:44,740
I'm sorry for being late.

231
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,799
- I'll go first.
- Go ahead.

232
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,860
Lieutenant, I received the call
from the situation room.

233
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,517
Is it true?

234
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,375
Let's confirm.

235
00:21:48,147 --> 00:21:50,371
Hello.

236
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:53,394
Oh! The police skit.

237
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,491
What brings you here?

238
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:59,195
You shouldn't cross the police line.

239
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:01,800
Hello. Hello.

240
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:12,296
I heard it's another barcode murder.

241
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:28,714
What could this be?

242
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,425
It hasn't even been a month since
Joo Ma-ri's murder. Just what is this?

243
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:35,369
Is he breaking the 12-month-murder cycle,
Lieutenant Yeom?

244
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:39,793
There's no evidence that
this is a barcode murder.

245
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:41,649
Excuse me?

246
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:44,713
But the arm...

247
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:47,601
If it's not a barcode murder when
the barcode is carved on the arm,

248
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:50,361
then is it a line-carving murder?

249
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:54,417
Then what other evidence has
there been evidence till now?

250
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,921
There were only barcodes
drawn on the murder victims.

251
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:58,662
That's right.

252
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:19,033
Let's identify the victim first.

253
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:37,381
Hwang Ki-soo. 26 years old.
Gym trainer.

254
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:41,181
His body was discovered this morning
around 6 a.m. at Il-song Park in Seoul.

255
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:44,284
Estimated time of murder
was within 36 hours.

256
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:45,901
The victim is presumed to have
been suffocated to death

257
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:48,892
from evidence of
strangulation on his neck.

258
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:54,653
The barcode-like cuts are on his left arm.

259
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:56,597
That's all.

260
00:23:56,597 --> 00:23:59,669
On the 5th, the victim's cell phone
was turned off in Mapo district.

261
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:02,188
It wasn't turned on again after that.

262
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:06,429
When his body was discovered,
his cell phone wasn't on him.

263
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:09,309
This is a barcode serial murder.

264
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:13,637
Check the previous 5 days of suspect Chun
Baek-gyung's alibi in 30-minute increments.

265
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:17,037
Yes, sir.

266
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:19,541
This may not be a
barcode serial murder.

267
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,851
Please investigate the victim's whereabouts
before the murder took place.

268
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:29,070
Do you have evidence to the contrary?

269
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,156
I'm saying that we shouldn't
assume that it's a serial murder.

270
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:34,300
What are you going to do if it is?

271
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,541
Are you going to take responsibility?

272
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,947
What are you doing?

273
00:24:45,654 --> 00:24:48,728
Then, I'll investigate the
victim's whereabouts.

274
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:05,483
There is something strange.

275
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:08,387
What's strange?

276
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:12,607
It's when I saw the victim
in the park this morning.

277
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:23,851
His track jacket and pants had completely
different scents from each other.

278
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:25,985
Can't they be different?

279
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:29,515
Normally, the scent from the top
and bottom is the same.

280
00:25:29,515 --> 00:25:36,027
For example, Inspector Kang, a smoker, has a
cigarette smell from both the top and bottom.

281
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:38,827
And Detective Tak has a baby scent.

282
00:25:38,827 --> 00:25:40,387
Detective Yeh has a perfume scent.

283
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:45,790
Detective Ki has an exotic scent. These
scents come from both the top and bottom.

284
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:54,238
The victim's pants had a beer and soju scent,
and also a scent of ice cream,

285
00:25:54,238 --> 00:25:57,550
But it didn't have a scent of charcoal
grilled meat at all.

286
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,710
His top really smelled of
charcoal grilled meat.

287
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,845
Charcoal grill?

288
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:07,052
That means the scent is recent.
It hasn't been over two days.

289
00:26:07,052 --> 00:26:10,360
They said the murder took place
within the past 36 hours.

290
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:17,954
He was here the day before yesterday.

291
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:19,816
That's right. The day before yesterday.

292
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:21,216
He was here?

293
00:26:21,216 --> 00:26:22,648
You're saying he was
here two days ago, right?

294
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,558
That's right.

295
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,566
The people who wear these tracksuits
are from the 2K Gym over there.

296
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:32,023
They come here sometimes.

297
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,584
Then did this person come
by here by chance?

298
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:38,399
Hmmm. I don't know.

299
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:47,084
I don't know who came, but 6 people came
here in these tracksuits and ate a lot.

300
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:50,184
Since there were 6 of them,
we had to combine two tables.

301
00:26:50,184 --> 00:26:52,469
You're saying
6 people came by, right?

302
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:53,737
Got it.

303
00:27:08,308 --> 00:27:10,294
We don't have time for this.

304
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:12,972
We can't focus if we're hungry.

305
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:19,101
Let's eat quickly and go.

306
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:20,955
Hold on a second.

307
00:27:20,955 --> 00:27:24,567
Can you wait until I eat five
pieces of meat first?

308
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:36,271
One, two, three, four, five.

309
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:43,690
By the way, how did you
know that this was the place?

310
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,985
The victim's top had a scent of both
bamboo charcoal and pine needles.

311
00:27:48,985 --> 00:27:54,999
Look. [Main Menu: bamboo charcoal pork ribs;
pine needle pork ribs]

312
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:59,094
You're saying no other restaurant
has those two scents combined, right?

313
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,624
Right.

314
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:30,233
There were 6 people including me who went
to eat at the pork rib restaurant 2 days ago.

315
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:33,753
We ate out since we
increased our membership.

316
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,719
Do all the trainers wear
the same uniform?

317
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,737
There are three colors,
so we rotate them.

318
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:42,050
So if we wear gray today, we'll wear
blue tomorrow, and black after that.

319
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:46,822
If it's in that order, you should've
worn the blue two days ago, right?

320
00:28:46,822 --> 00:28:47,999
Yes. That's right.

321
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:52,461
Since it was two days ago,
blue is correct.

322
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:56,478
Then Mr. Han Ki-soo was not at
the restaurant two days ago, right?

323
00:28:56,478 --> 00:29:00,330
That's right. It's been a month
since Ki-soo quit.

324
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,138
He wouldn't dare come to this neighborhood.

325
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:07,600
There isn't a single person here
who didn't lend Ki-soo money.

326
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,127
Did Han Ki-soo cause trouble again?

327
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:15,307
He was murdered two days ago.

328
00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:20,680
Excuse me!
Please do something.

329
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,121
Andy, help that member out.

330
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:24,495
Yes.

331
00:29:29,657 --> 00:29:33,118
Oh, my head. Oh, my back.

332
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:36,192
I almost died. Thank you.

333
00:29:38,184 --> 00:29:39,820
Yay! I got 3 free gym passes.

334
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,652
The trainer Andy seems very kind
and is so handsome.

335
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:46,381
I'm going to try it out just 3 times.
Then if I like it, I'll sign up.

336
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:47,988
Free passes...

337
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:49,797
You're eating their bait.

338
00:29:49,797 --> 00:29:52,076
Do you want to eat again?

339
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:55,044
I said bait.

340
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:59,162
Then I'll go with rice cake since
I ate rice with meat earlier.

341
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:03,831
What's wrong? Then we can just have rice.

342
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:19,323
Why do the bottom and top
have different scents?

343
00:30:19,323 --> 00:30:20,859
Why do the clothes of the victim
who was murdered two days ago...

344
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:28,025
have the same scent as the restaurant
that his coworkers went to two days ago?

345
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:33,119
This is driving me crazy.

346
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:45,363
How many part-time jobs have you had so far?
Stop getting fired and do it right.

347
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:49,019
Hey, I'm the one who's changing
bosses because I don't like them.

348
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:51,787
You're talking nonsense
just like Officer Choi does.

349
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:55,079
If I don't like the boss again
this time, I'm going to quit.

350
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,727
Hey, take this.

351
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,612
This wasabi brings back memories.

352
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:07,012
Because of Officer Choi, do you know
just how spicy the food I ate was?

353
00:31:07,012 --> 00:31:09,867
Hey. You like Officer Choi, don't you?

354
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,251
What did you say?

355
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:13,835
You must've gone crazy because you're
changing your bosses constantly.

356
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:14,731
Are you crazy?

357
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:18,875
All you talk about is Officer Choi.

358
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:22,151
Whatever you start talking about
just ends with Officer Choi.

359
00:31:22,151 --> 00:31:25,371
Shut up. I'm hungry so give me
something that will fill me up.

360
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:27,811
Give me something expensive.

361
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:29,331
It's Officer Choi.
Officer Choi.

362
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:32,627
Hello. Hello.

363
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:40,478
You're dead, you little...

364
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:44,650
You seem too obvious. Be careful, you dummy.

365
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,858
I lost my appetite. I'm going to go.

366
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:50,408
I'll give you some food.

367
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,212
You eat.

368
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:54,929
Bring some customers with you next time.

369
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:58,400
Who does she think I like?

370
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,674
It's so cute.

371
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:04,250
She thinks I like Officer Choi?

372
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,162
I'm too obvious?

373
00:32:05,162 --> 00:32:07,230
That idiot girl...

374
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:14,031
Are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere?

375
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:20,676
Oh my...

376
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:25,656
I'm really sorry. Are you alright?

377
00:32:25,656 --> 00:32:28,992
You're Chef Kwon Jae-hee, right?

378
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:31,416
Yes. That's right.

379
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:35,352
I was trying to catch my puppy because
I let go of the leash. I messed up.

380
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:37,384
Are you talking about a
puppy with a blue strap?

381
00:32:37,384 --> 00:32:38,776
Yes, that's right.

382
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:40,504
Then you should go and
find your puppy quickly.

383
00:32:40,504 --> 00:32:44,304
You're going to lose your dog.
Hurry up and go.

384
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:50,250
But it looks as if you're hurt. We should
go to the hospital first.

385
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,844
I think I'm alright.

386
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:57,200
It does hurt a bit.

387
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:00,492
Here, too.

388
00:33:06,908 --> 00:33:08,884
Does it hurt a lot?

389
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:11,516
Yes, a bit.

390
00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:16,566
Dr. Chun, she got hurt because of me
so please take good care of her.

391
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:20,206
Don't you have to go look for
Moong-chi, Chef Kwon?

392
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,958
That's right. I lost my mind.

393
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,422
Then please stay and get treated.

394
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:25,748
I'll find Moong-chi and
come right back.

395
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:27,090
Yes.

396
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:32,462
I guess the puppy's name is Moong-chi.

397
00:33:32,462 --> 00:33:34,926
Is it alright if I check this arm also?

398
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:37,230
You could have injured it when you fell.

399
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,008
Yes. Of course.

400
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,596
It seems as though you've
had fracture surgery.

401
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:57,094
Are you alright?

402
00:33:57,094 --> 00:34:00,422
Yes, I think I'm fine on this side.

403
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:02,182
Anywhere else?

404
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:07,374
I think I hurt my hip when I fell.

405
00:34:07,374 --> 00:34:10,238
Let's take an X-ray.
Shall we go?

406
00:34:14,662 --> 00:34:16,806
Miss Oh Cho-rim.

407
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,262
Yes.

408
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:26,086
There's no big problem.

409
00:34:26,086 --> 00:34:29,939
We'll just have to treat the
wrist you sprained today.

410
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:37,142
Are you looking for a pen?

411
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,460
I have a pen. Just a moment.

412
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,902
Here it is.

413
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:45,305
Here.

414
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:46,925
You can use it.

415
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:59,230
From the looks of your fracture surgery...
you were probably in a bad accident.

416
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,240
I was in a bad car accident three years ago.

417
00:35:09,134 --> 00:35:13,046
By the way, Chef Kwon Jae-hee
must not have found his puppy yet.

418
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:14,966
Why isn't he coming back?

419
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:48,422
So if this isn't a barcode murder case,

420
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:54,515
who could have known about the
barcode and carved it the same way?

421
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:57,014
Until this gym trainer case is revealed to
the press, the fact that the victim had

422
00:35:57,014 --> 00:36:03,166
a barcode has only been revealed
inside the police precinct.

423
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:06,846
It's so mysterious.

424
00:36:06,846 --> 00:36:09,546
Detective Ki pointed out
an important point.

425
00:36:09,546 --> 00:36:14,456
So does that mean the
culprit is a police officer?

426
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:15,760
No way.

427
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,200
What kind of investigation is this?

428
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:28,000
Hey, you guys are also suspects
in the gym trainer case.

429
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,568
So be careful.

430
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:32,984
Inspector Kang, there's no way.

431
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:35,041
How can police officers be suspects?

432
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:38,432
Inspector Kang, please catch
the murderer quickly.

433
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:41,664
It's so unfair that we're
considered suspects.

434
00:36:41,664 --> 00:36:43,434
Eat up.

435
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:53,960
Hey, Moo-gak...

436
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:00,557
May I sit here?

437
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:09,347
Come here.

438
00:37:09,347 --> 00:37:10,943
Yes.

439
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,164
Lieutenant. I have something
to tell you in private.

440
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:28,672
I think we should investigate this case

441
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:32,920
considering Hwang Ki-soo's
former coworkers as suspects.

442
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,216
On what grounds?

443
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:39,520
That's why I'm telling you...

444
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:11,695
[Jeju Baekrok Hospital / Choi Eun-seol.]

445
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,709
It is Choi Eun-seol.

446
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:42,698
Choi Eun-seol was here.

447
00:38:45,337 --> 00:38:47,258
Locker keys?

448
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,113
Of course. People often lose them.

449
00:38:50,113 --> 00:38:52,666
What about the locker keys?

450
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,465
We just received a tip from a homeless man

451
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:58,489
who was Il-song Park that
he witnessed the crime.

452
00:38:58,489 --> 00:38:59,849
Really?

453
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:02,731
This is what the homeless person saw.

454
00:39:03,097 --> 00:39:04,553
According to the homeless man,

455
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:08,500
he saw a man carrying another man
in a tracksuit that night.

456
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,244
He just thought a man was carrying
someone who was drunk.

457
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:14,476
But they dropped something.

458
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:18,604
He thought it was coins, but it was a key.

459
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:22,208
So he just threw that key into the bush.

460
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:29,812
But the next morning a man wearing
that tracksuit was found dead.

461
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:33,292
Then are you saying that it was
one of our gym keys?

462
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:34,420
I'm not sure.

463
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,652
We'll know after we gather the police
and find that key tomorrow morning.

464
00:39:38,652 --> 00:39:40,740
Once we find it, please verify it for us.

465
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,492
Yes, of course.

466
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:44,022
Thank you.

467
00:39:44,972 --> 00:39:46,558
Thank you.

468
00:39:49,548 --> 00:39:53,292
Tomorrow, we will search for the key that
the homeless man reported.

469
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:56,068
If the culprit realized he
had lost his key,

470
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:58,282
then he'll return to the scene of the
crime to search for it.

471
00:39:58,282 --> 00:40:00,026
We will go undercover and
stake out the place.

472
00:40:00,026 --> 00:40:04,362
If the culprit returns to find
the key, we'll arrest him.

473
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:06,868
I'll assign your stakeout positions.

474
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:55,037
Moong-chi, you brat.
You sure did go far.

475
00:41:28,493 --> 00:41:30,215
Hi.

476
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,947
Reporting from my position.
Nothing to report.

477
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:41,861
The escape route has been secured.
Nothing to report.

478
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:45,578
Officers near the entrance of the
park should use extra caution.

479
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:59,171
Park entrance. Nothing to report.

480
00:42:08,701 --> 00:42:12,101
I always get a call from home
when I'm on a stakeout.

481
00:42:12,101 --> 00:42:15,717
Your nephew is handsome.
He could be a general someday.

482
00:42:15,717 --> 00:42:17,239
It's a girl.

483
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:35,667
Awesome.

484
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:48,578
I have to give Moong-chi a snack.

485
00:42:48,578 --> 00:42:50,770
I'll do it.

486
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,000
Moong-chi.

487
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,904
Moong-chi, come here.

488
00:42:55,904 --> 00:42:58,896
Are you hungry?

489
00:42:58,896 --> 00:43:03,880
Chef Kwon is very grateful that
you found Moong-chi.

490
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,816
The dog was a gift from
Joo Ma-ri to Chef Kwon.

491
00:43:07,816 --> 00:43:10,798
I see.

492
00:43:13,528 --> 00:43:16,728
On my way back from picking him
up from the animal hospital,

493
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:20,064
I almost lost him because
the leash came off.

494
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,748
I'll be forever grateful.

495
00:43:22,748 --> 00:43:27,224
No, I'm the one who's grateful for your
inviting me over for dinner like this.

496
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,736
Yes, Elena Vashilvnishivanova.

497
00:43:40,736 --> 00:43:48,432
Where do you think this is? You can't come
here, Elena Vashilvnishivanova.

498
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:54,091
Are you crying? Are you... I guess not.

499
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:59,055
I'll call you back. Alright. Good night.
And good night.

500
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:08,497
Nothing to report.

501
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:18,653
There is nothing strange.

502
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:25,555
Nothing to report.

503
00:44:27,105 --> 00:44:29,105
What your niece's name?

504
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:30,815
Ji-ah.

505
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:35,255
Tak Ji-ah. She has a pretty name.

506
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,543
Ji-ah is a pretty name for a girl.

507
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:40,383
That's enough. I'm already offended.

508
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:58,311
She's someone you've met before, Dr. Chun?

509
00:44:58,311 --> 00:45:03,718
Yes. I really wanted to meet her before,
but I guess I was able to here.

510
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:10,630
But you didn't tell her that
while you were examining her?

511
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:13,177
I'm sure there will be another opportunity.

512
00:45:17,462 --> 00:45:19,422
Moong-chi.

513
00:45:19,422 --> 00:45:20,654
What in the world...

514
00:45:20,654 --> 00:45:22,230
The bathroom is so nice.

515
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,861
It seems nicer than one
at a five-star hotel.

516
00:45:24,861 --> 00:45:27,182
Not that I've ever been to one before...

517
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,670
Please enjoy.

518
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,452
I'll enjoy it.

519
00:45:35,518 --> 00:45:38,000
Moong-chi, be quiet.

520
00:45:39,758 --> 00:45:42,366
Isn't it because he wants to go inside there?

521
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:44,368
What's inside?

522
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:45,648
It's a door that leads to
the storage basement.

523
00:45:45,648 --> 00:45:48,486
Wine and food are stored down there.

524
00:45:51,728 --> 00:45:56,058
Moong-chi.
Moong-chi. Be quiet.

525
00:45:57,773 --> 00:45:59,109
Be quiet.

526
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,093
Oh my goodness.

527
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:07,485
What in the world...
The food is so delicious.

528
00:46:07,485 --> 00:46:09,661
I've never tasted anything like this.

529
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:11,515
I'm going to eat a lot.

530
00:46:14,669 --> 00:46:17,909
Oh, my back.

531
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,144
Lieutenant.

532
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:36,877
No one appeared?

533
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:42,657
It may be a cliché, but not
even a single ant came by.

534
00:46:58,365 --> 00:47:00,301
So... There was no key from the beginning,

535
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:04,709
and you even fabricated the
story about the homeless man?

536
00:47:04,709 --> 00:47:09,909
To lure them in, you even
deceived our detectives?

537
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:11,013
I'm sorry.

538
00:47:11,013 --> 00:47:15,229
This is why the investigation
keeps missing the mark.

539
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:24,503
Are you still thinking that
this isn't a serial murder case?

540
00:47:26,008 --> 00:47:28,166
There's something here!

541
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:44,269
It's something too expensive to throw away.

542
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:46,273
Hey, check for fingerprints
and identify the owner.

543
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:47,273
Yes, sir.

544
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:11,760
What are you doing?

545
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,939
Let's go to the police station and talk.

546
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,778
Wait a second! Let's go together.

547
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,060
Thank you.

548
00:48:28,168 --> 00:48:30,662
- Hello.
- Hello.

549
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,695
Hello.

550
00:48:42,695 --> 00:48:44,345
Hello.

551
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:11,727
Are you confident that you can place
him under arrest in 48 hours?

552
00:49:11,727 --> 00:49:15,149
Yes. I'm confident, sir.

553
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:21,031
Lieutenant Yeom.

554
00:49:21,031 --> 00:49:29,015
Remove yourself from the trainer barcode
case and return to the investigation unit.

555
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:31,009
Yes, I will.

556
00:49:34,919 --> 00:49:35,927
Inspector Kang.

557
00:49:35,927 --> 00:49:36,753
Yes.

558
00:49:36,753 --> 00:49:39,031
With the full authority
over this investigation,

559
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:43,207
make sure to arrest him
within 48 hours.

560
00:49:43,207 --> 00:49:45,223
Yes, I will.

561
00:49:50,575 --> 00:49:58,141
Lt. Yeom, hand over the files for
the barcode serial murder case, too.

562
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:08,591
Only your fingerprints were
found on this pen.

563
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:13,740
This is a pen that I lost at the hospital.

564
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:18,866
You know what this picture is without
my having to telling you, right?

565
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:22,372
Are you saying that I killed him?

566
00:50:22,372 --> 00:50:32,462
Explain why your pen was found in
the bush where the body was found.

567
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:55,420
I'm sorry. I caused you trouble
because of my misjudgment.

568
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:01,436
But I'm still convinced that the
suspect is among the trainers.

569
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:06,385
I also think that this isn't
a serial murder case.

570
00:51:06,385 --> 00:51:09,365
Someone who knows a lot about the
barcode case mimicked the barcode

571
00:51:09,365 --> 00:51:14,972
on the victim's arm, but
it's not the real one.

572
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:22,340
The suspect is someone who knows
a lot about the barcode serial murder.

573
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:27,365
Do you believe the culprit is
within the police department?

574
00:51:27,365 --> 00:51:29,685
I'm looking at it that way...

575
00:51:29,685 --> 00:51:31,956
What kind of connection do you
think there is between

576
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:35,206
the gym trainers you're suspecting
and the police?

577
00:51:45,573 --> 00:51:47,892
[Oh Cho-rim]

578
00:51:49,652 --> 00:51:51,290
Hello.

579
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,332
You know the trainer Andy here.

580
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:15,444
I got on the elevator with Andy today
and there was a familiar scent.

581
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:21,316
When I thought about it, it's the
same scent that Detective Tak has.

582
00:52:21,316 --> 00:52:23,092
It was that baby scent.

583
00:52:23,092 --> 00:52:25,256
Maybe there's an ointment that's used
for a baby's skin or something.

584
00:52:25,256 --> 00:52:29,864
The ointment scent and the
baby scent were the same.

585
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,616
Andy. Detective Tak Ji-seok's younger
brother, Tak Min-seok.

586
00:52:54,616 --> 00:52:57,064
Ji-ah's father.

587
00:52:57,064 --> 00:53:00,093
Why did you kill Hwang Ki-soo?

588
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:04,256
While you were fighting with Hwang Ki-soo,
you choked him to death.

589
00:53:04,256 --> 00:53:06,602
And you called your brother
when you got scared.

590
00:53:06,602 --> 00:53:09,530
Your brother Detective Tak
arrived at the murder scene.

591
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,730
And he took care of the rest.

592
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,674
Your blood got on Hwang Ki-soo's track
suit. So to get rid of the evidence,

593
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:19,178
he took the same tracksuit you also
have and put it on him.

594
00:53:19,178 --> 00:53:22,386
He carved the barcode on the arm
and moved the body to the park.

595
00:53:22,386 --> 00:53:24,266
He disguised it as the
barcode serial murder.

596
00:53:24,266 --> 00:53:25,906
It was easy to fabricate
the evidence.

597
00:53:25,906 --> 00:53:28,128
There is something here.

598
00:53:45,634 --> 00:53:47,394
Min-seok.

599
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:50,768
Min-seok.

600
00:53:54,594 --> 00:53:56,658
You idiot.

601
00:53:56,658 --> 00:53:58,570
You should've denied it.

602
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:02,082
You should've said you didn't know anything.

603
00:54:02,082 --> 00:54:04,154
Ji-seok.

604
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:09,201
I did everything. I killed him.

605
00:54:09,201 --> 00:54:13,237
You should've said that you
didn't know anything, you idiot.

606
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:18,562
What are you going to do about your wife?

607
00:54:18,562 --> 00:54:20,658
What are you going to do about your baby?

608
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:25,128
You should've said that
I did everything, you idiot.

609
00:54:57,525 --> 00:54:58,526
Hello.

610
00:54:58,526 --> 00:55:00,556
Sit where you want.

611
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,995
It's Officer Choi.

612
00:55:07,995 --> 00:55:09,985
What's going on?

613
00:55:21,491 --> 00:55:25,835
Your honey Officer Choi is at our restaurant.

614
00:55:25,835 --> 00:55:30,515
I'm sorry, but I just received
an urgent text, so I have to go.

615
00:55:30,515 --> 00:55:31,667
You're leaving?

616
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:34,451
Don't you know where I'm taking you?

617
00:55:34,451 --> 00:55:38,907
It's a hotel buffet.
You were so grateful and happy.

618
00:55:38,907 --> 00:55:40,948
Do you even know how much
it costs for two people?

619
00:55:40,948 --> 00:55:44,788
My great aunt suddenly passed away.

620
00:55:44,788 --> 00:55:47,420
Really? Then what can you do?
Hurry up and go.

621
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,868
Can I borrow your lip gloss?

622
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:51,390
This?

623
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:01,396
I thought you were going to go mourn.

624
00:56:01,396 --> 00:56:02,524
This is because...

625
00:56:02,524 --> 00:56:05,340
I would feel bad if I go
there looking too pale.

626
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,244
This color is so pretty.

627
00:56:07,244 --> 00:56:09,146
Thank you for letting me use it.

628
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:10,586
Thank you.

629
00:56:10,586 --> 00:56:12,160
Hey.

630
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:29,524
Have you waited long?

631
00:56:29,524 --> 00:56:31,194
No, Lieutenant.

632
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,413
I'm sorry for making you wait
when you solve the case and

633
00:56:36,413 --> 00:56:39,132
allowed me to return to my post.

634
00:56:39,132 --> 00:56:40,949
It's nothing.

635
00:56:40,949 --> 00:56:43,733
To show you my gratitude,
I'll treat you today.

636
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,669
It's really nothing. I didn't do much.

637
00:56:49,644 --> 00:56:53,077
Actually, I was late because of this.

638
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,204
What is this?

639
00:56:54,204 --> 00:56:55,261
Officer Choi...

640
00:56:55,261 --> 00:56:59,388
You've been approved to access the National
Police Agency database for special cases.

641
00:56:59,388 --> 00:57:02,951
From now on, you should be able to
log in using the ID and password there.

642
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:04,684
Is that true, Lieutenant?

643
00:57:04,684 --> 00:57:07,381
Can I really access the
special cases database?

644
00:57:07,381 --> 00:57:10,805
I can really look at the
files I want to find?

645
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:16,204
I'm sure there are level restrictions,
but you should be able to see most files.

646
00:57:16,204 --> 00:57:17,972
Thank you.

647
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:20,476
I sincerely thank you.

648
00:57:23,262 --> 00:57:25,869
Are you that happy?

649
00:57:25,869 --> 00:57:31,197
It's because now I can finally see the files
that I really wanted to find.
