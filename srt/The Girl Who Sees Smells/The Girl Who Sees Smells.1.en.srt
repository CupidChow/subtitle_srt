We tried to contact her parents in vain.

I was so surprised

Three weird things happened to me.

107
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:40,448
The first one is the fact that
I woke up against all odds.

108
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:45,320
The doctor told me that nobody expected
me to wake up from the coma.

109

But, like a miracle,
I woke up after 193 days.

The doctors said there's no medical
explanation why my left eye turned blue.

113

The second weird thing is that
I don't remember anything.

Why I was in a hospital bed for 193 days...

No matter how hard
I tried to remember, I can't.

Right, Cho-rim.

135
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:10,536
I got this lens from Dr. Kim,
the ophthalmologist.

136
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,438
He said it'll improve your daily life.

Check for sinkholes on the ground.

I have my ID cards and
the photo of my late father in there...

169
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,160
Did I drop it on the street?

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,990
The scent of cresol alcohol comes
from inside of the cap...

171
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,519
And the citron scent!

Would you please contact me
if you find it?

I work at the internal medicine office
right by the intersection.

Officer Choi eats so much!

00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:36,953
Is he forcing himself to eat to
not blow his cover?

181
00:20:36,953 --> 00:20:39,057
I wonder why he's like that.

182
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:44,978
I really don't understand why a low-ranking
officer is volunteering to go undercover.

183
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:49,042
Detective Yeh, I really don't understand.

184

Why you go undercover in a suit that should
be worn only at a fancy banquet!

185

Detective Ki, fashion is
all about self-satisfaction.

A promotion?

You're saying that all
he's after is some glory?

Don't come any closer!

333
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:59,928
No need to be so surprised.

334
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:02,186
Detective Ki!

335
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:13,649
Stop right there, Kang Sang-moon!

336
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,211
Detective Ki!

337
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,976
Detective Yeh!

338
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,804
Sir?

339
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:37,721
Mr. Policeman!

340
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:42,140
You can't do this here! Sir?

341
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:45,015
Why is he sleeping
while eating a fishcake?

342
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:48,986
Hello, is this the police?

343
00:30:48,986 --> 00:30:52,068
There's an unconscious officer here.

344
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:56,269
No, not an accident. He's sleeping.

345
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:59,385
He's snoring!

346
00:30:59,385 --> 00:31:03,653
He's not drunk. It's a long story!

347
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:08,764
He just fell asleep all of a sudden!

348
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:21,495
Hello, Inspector Kang!

349
00:31:21,495 --> 00:31:24,012
Good morning!

350
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:28,834
Why is your face even bigger today?

351
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:32,109
Did something good happen overnight?

352
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:34,016
You little...

353
00:31:34,016 --> 00:31:39,019
I heard your men lost Kang Sang-moon
right in front of their eyes.

354
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:41,617
I only found out from the newspaper!

355
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,838
I wonder what happened.

356
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:49,744
Hasn't your son Si Bong gone missing?

357
00:31:49,744 --> 00:31:52,429
He ran away from your home
three days ago, right?

358
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:54,995
How do you know that?

359
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:59,111
Hey, guys what are you doing?

360
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:00,467
Do everything you can to find

361
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:06,988
your boss's son who's going through
a tough adolescence!

362
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:12,627
If you really can't find him,
request some help from me.

363
00:32:12,627 --> 00:32:14,326
Have a nice one.

364
00:32:15,152 --> 00:32:18,637
He's getting on my nerves!

365
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:19,734
This is Detective Nam.

366
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:21,403
Send the men out to find a boy.

367
00:32:21,403 --> 00:32:24,405
His name is Sa Si-bong. Not c'est si bon!

368
00:32:24,405 --> 00:32:26,914
His age? He's in 7th grade.

369
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:29,781
I'll pay you $3,000 if you find him!

370
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,854
Hey! Forget about my son.

371
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:36,682
Try to find out his weak spot.

372
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:41,022
What about Choi Moo-gak?

373
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:43,951
He's here, as you requested.

374
00:32:49,497 --> 00:32:53,102
So did you have a good time sleeping on
the floor of a convenience store?

375
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:55,799
Why don’t you just stay there
for a few nights?

376
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,772
What a freak!

377
00:32:57,772 --> 00:33:01,200
All you're thinking about is catching the
criminal by yourself to get promoted!

378
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,344
You've lost your mind because of your greed!

379
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:05,547
You work in a police box.

380
00:33:05,547 --> 00:33:10,256
Why do you chase these cases?

381
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,347
There must be a special reason you
became a policeman, Choi Moo-gak.

382
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:22,337
No reason, sir.

383
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:24,494
Don’t lie.

384
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:29,993
What's your special reason that
forced you to become a policeman?

385
00:33:29,993 --> 00:33:32,307
I want to protect our citizens...

386
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:33,796
Don’t lie.

387
00:33:33,796 --> 00:33:36,652
Are you messing with me?

388
00:33:36,652 --> 00:33:38,185
Why do you want a promotion so badly?

389
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:39,516
I want to join the Homicide Department.

390
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:40,782
You want to work for me?

391
00:33:40,782 --> 00:33:41,335
Yes, sir.

392
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:44,968
You want to join my department,
but you're not qualified.

393
00:33:44,968 --> 00:33:48,594
So you think you can get in
by catching criminals.

394
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:51,078
That's fine by me.

395
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:53,270
What do you want to do in my department?

396
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,095
I want to be on murder cases.

397
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:01,768
Listen carefully with your ears wide open.

398
00:34:01,768 --> 00:34:08,897
If you ever interfere with my men again,
I'm going to break your legs.

399
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:13,114
If you don't believe me, try it.

400
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:16,983
Murder cases?

401
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:18,820
Ridiculous.

402
00:34:30,256 --> 00:34:32,600
What's going on, Eun-seol?

403
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,868
My bus got into an accident, Moo-gak.

404
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,144
A high school girl who was in a car
accident just came in on an ambulance.

405
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,910
Choi Eun-seol.

406
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:45,212
Eun-seol!

407
00:34:46,716 --> 00:34:48,404
Choi Eun-seol.

408
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,781
Eun-seol! Here!

409
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:54,591
Wake up, Eun-seol!

410
00:35:21,504 --> 00:35:22,995
Enjoy.

411
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,443
Okay.

412
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:24,774
Thank you.

413
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:33,162
Enjoy!

414
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:34,672
Thanks!

415
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:39,360
You too. Enjoy.

416
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,939
Oh Cho-rim!

417
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,418
I'm thirsty.

418
00:35:42,418 --> 00:35:44,366
Where's my drink?
You should do it right.

419
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:46,361
Here you go.

420
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,912
Do it right. I'm sorry.

421
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:56,618
Enjoy.

422
00:35:56,618 --> 00:35:57,314
Do it right.

423
00:35:57,314 --> 00:36:01,013
I am sorry.

424
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:04,997
This too...

425
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:33,253
I already ordered. So be quick.

426
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:36,679
I'm treating everyone because
I got booked on a tv show!

427
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,983
Do I have to drive?

428
00:36:37,983 --> 00:36:40,372
The food is for 30 people.

429
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:41,674
How will you bring it back otherwise?

430
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:44,431
Think before you speak.

431
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:49,966
What is it? You can't drive?

432
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:52,741
Of course I can!

433
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:55,498
I'm hungry, so hurry up.

434
00:37:21,455 --> 00:37:24,496
Why is it not moving?

435
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:26,817
Why is it here?

436
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:35,915
Oh my goodness!

437
00:37:35,915 --> 00:37:37,779
Oh my goodness!

438
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:44,890
I'm so sorry!

439
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,129
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

440
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:51,834
Blood! There!

441
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,601
I think your arm is dislocated!

442
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:56,413
I'm so sorry! Everything is my fault!

443
00:37:56,413 --> 00:38:00,675
We must go to the hospital! I'll bring you!

444
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:01,529
Where is it?

445
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,864
We must go now!

446
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:31,039
What... My butt...

447
00:38:31,558 --> 00:38:36,217
Excuse me? What are you doing?

448
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:41,991
Hello? Why are you getting in this car?

449
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:49,330
Stop the car? What are you doing?

450
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,183
This is not even your car!

451
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:26,701
You little brat! Stop the car!

452
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:29,261
Stop the car right now!

453
00:39:37,786 --> 00:39:39,081
What? Police?

454
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:40,024
We’re chasing after the criminal.

455
00:39:40,024 --> 00:39:41,644
I ask for your cooperation on this arrest.

456
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:42,944
A criminal?

457
00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:48,436
If I lose that suspect, I'll charge you with
obstruction of justice and negligent driving.

458
00:39:49,674 --> 00:39:51,974
What are you doing? You might lose him!

459
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:56,858
He's going right there! Faster!

460
00:40:19,108 --> 00:40:22,381
By the way, what did he do?

461
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:24,816
Fraud? Theft? Assault?

462
00:40:24,816 --> 00:40:25,796
Perhaps murder?

463
00:40:25,796 --> 00:40:27,114
Robbery.

464
00:40:40,593 --> 00:40:43,692
What kind of smell is this?

465
00:41:10,028 --> 00:41:13,087
That way.

466
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:14,402
Quickly!

467
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:19,541
Hurry up!

468
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:21,053
Hurry!

469
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:42,452
The suspect took that elevator.

470
00:41:42,452 --> 00:41:44,035
I'll contact you by searching
your license plate.

471
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,237
So leave.

472
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:50,909
By any chance, did he rob a beauty salon?

473
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:53,784
He did, didn't he?

474
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:29,043
Are you okay? Please calm down.

475
00:43:13,684 --> 00:43:15,590
He robbed a beauty salon, didn't he?

476
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:18,586
He did.

477
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:12,951
Don't take that one.

478
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:14,905
We must take this one.

479
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:36,771
He went to the fourth floor?

480
00:44:36,771 --> 00:44:38,005
Trust me.

481
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:40,041
I guessed the beauty salon, didn't I?

482
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:04,232
This public bath is very crowded!

483
00:45:04,232 --> 00:45:06,836
I didn't even see his face
because of his helmet.

484
00:45:06,836 --> 00:45:08,837
Everyone here is wearing the same thing.

485
00:45:08,837 --> 00:45:10,768
I won't be able to catch him here.

486
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:13,276
I'm certain he came to the fourth floor.

487
00:45:13,276 --> 00:45:16,164
I agree with you.

488
00:45:16,164 --> 00:45:19,684
I'd come here if I were the criminal.

489
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:22,826
I guess we've lost him. Let's go.

490
00:45:22,826 --> 00:45:24,944
Aren't you going to catch him?

491
00:45:24,944 --> 00:45:30,539
How can I catch him among all these people
when I don't even know his face?

492
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:34,762
It's game over once he steals
someone's clothes and sneaks out.

493
00:45:34,762 --> 00:45:40,158
It's game over once he washes
his hair and hands.

494
00:45:40,158 --> 00:45:43,972
If the scent of his hand left any trace...

495
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:47,873
that'd be inside the locker room.

496
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:51,354
Take off your clothes for a second.

497
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:00,922
Hey...

498
00:46:20,574 --> 00:46:22,977
What do you think you're doing?

499
00:46:22,977 --> 00:46:25,307
Let's leave, okay?

500
00:46:29,778 --> 00:46:31,327
This is insane!

501
00:46:33,515 --> 00:46:34,949
What are you doing?

502
00:46:39,962 --> 00:46:42,070
It's been so long, dude!

503
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,885
How have you been?

504
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,908
You still like baggy clothes?

505
00:46:45,908 --> 00:46:47,602
Why don't you wait outside?

506
00:46:47,602 --> 00:46:49,461
Let's go for a drink.

507
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,509
Seriously, what are you doing?

508
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:54,053
Let's go...

509
00:46:54,053 --> 00:46:55,513
Hold on.

510
00:47:06,363 --> 00:47:10,527
This is the one.

511
00:47:11,398 --> 00:47:15,271
This is the robber's locker.

512
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:22,940
I'll wait outside.

513
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:29,314
I'm serious, Woo-yah!

514
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:33,535
I'm here to catch a robber
with some policeman!

515
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,942
Okay, Woo-yah. I'll shut up and come back.

516
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:02,108
Excuse me.

517
00:48:02,108 --> 00:48:03,344
What is it?

518
00:48:03,344 --> 00:48:07,348
Did you just visit a beauty salon?

519
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:09,728
What?

520
00:48:09,728 --> 00:48:14,101
I'm asking if you just robbed a beauty salon.

521
00:48:34,101 --> 00:48:35,910
What?

522
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,977
Here they are!

523
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:46,847
Get up.

524
00:48:47,464 --> 00:48:48,990
Thanks for trying to run away.

525
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,761
I didn't even know your face.

526
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,594
Geez...

527
00:49:24,014 --> 00:49:25,501
Come with me!

528
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:37,119
Get in, you little brat.

529
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,146
His knife is back in the beauty salon.

530
00:49:45,146 --> 00:49:47,014
We got it after getting the call.

531
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:49,489
It'll be a certain piece of evidence
after a fingerprint check.

532
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,753
We'll take over from here.

533
00:49:51,753 --> 00:49:52,953
So stay out of this.

534
00:49:52,953 --> 00:49:54,562
I can interrogate him, too.

535
00:49:54,562 --> 00:49:57,249
I'll come with you.

536
00:49:59,384 --> 00:50:01,354
I think you should go to the hospital first.

537
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:36,941
This car and this person
are in a similar state.

538
00:50:39,163 --> 00:50:40,970
Let's go to the hospital.

539
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:51,736
We should go to
an orthopedic office, right?

540
00:50:51,736 --> 00:50:53,087
I don't need to see a doctor...

541
00:50:53,087 --> 00:50:54,482
You must!

542
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:55,775
You know how many people

543
00:50:55,775 --> 00:50:57,988
would come up to me later with
a lawsuit in this case?

544
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:01,661
I'm sure you know very well
since you're a cop!

545
00:51:05,988 --> 00:51:07,915
Hurry!

546
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:31,586
What did the doctor say?

547
00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:33,090
He said I'm okay.

548
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,968
The doctor would like to
see his family, ma'am.

549
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:37,923
Me?

550
00:51:37,923 --> 00:51:39,175
Yes.

551
00:51:40,618 --> 00:51:41,057
What's going on?

552
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:43,107
I'm not his family.

553
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:45,405
Could it be something serious?

554
00:51:45,848 --> 00:51:47,161
But why do I have to see the doctor?

555
00:51:47,161 --> 00:51:49,933
I'm not his family, just an offender.

556
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:54,767
The patient just received
15 stitches on his head.

557
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:58,918
And his shoulder got dislocated.

558
00:51:58,918 --> 00:52:04,562
The only thing a normal person can
do in that state is scream in pain.

559
00:52:04,562 --> 00:52:06,996
He was very quiet.

560
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:09,890
He must've been in a lot of pain.

561
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,611
Not at all.

562
00:52:13,427 --> 00:52:17,354
As expected, it's analgesia.

563
00:52:17,354 --> 00:52:17,928
I beg your pardon?

564
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:22,869
It's the loss of the ability to
feel pain while conscious.

565
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:25,439
Is there such a disease?

566
00:52:25,439 --> 00:52:26,715
I knew something was weird.

567
00:52:26,715 --> 00:52:28,790
We also run a pain clinic here.

568
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,136
He should see our pain specialist.

569
00:52:30,136 --> 00:52:33,571
What? Why are you telling me this?

570
00:52:33,571 --> 00:52:35,802
You should tell the patient directly.

571
00:52:35,802 --> 00:52:38,729
The patient doesn't seem to
have any desire to cure it.

572
00:52:38,729 --> 00:52:40,364
So I wanted to talk to his family...

573
00:52:40,364 --> 00:52:43,324
Honestly, I'm also an offender.

574
00:52:43,324 --> 00:52:46,013
So I think it'd be best for him to
cut his hospital visits short.

575
00:52:46,013 --> 00:52:48,798
Thank you. Goodbye.

576
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:54,536
Hey.

577
00:52:54,536 --> 00:52:56,539
I'll take care of the bill.

578
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:58,312
Why don't you go ahead?

579
00:52:58,312 --> 00:52:59,113
Sure.

580
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:00,431
Okay.

581
00:53:02,464 --> 00:53:04,935
Where do I check out?

582
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,921
Hello.

583
00:53:32,995 --> 00:53:37,906
Consulting fee... Shot administration fee...

584
00:53:37,906 --> 00:53:43,382
I guess anesthesia gets charged separately.

585
00:53:43,382 --> 00:53:45,553
Why are there so many items?

586
00:53:57,622 --> 00:54:00,561
Here you go.

587
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:02,035
Who is that?

588
00:54:02,748 --> 00:54:03,732
A cop.

589
00:54:03,732 --> 00:54:05,907
What?

590
00:54:07,673 --> 00:54:09,582
Are you in trouble?

591
00:54:09,582 --> 00:54:10,821
Yes.

592
00:54:10,821 --> 00:54:15,380
I crushed his head and
disjointed his shoulder.

593
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,810
Go.

594
00:54:31,257 --> 00:54:36,771
If your wound gets infected or something
goes wrong with your shoulder...

595
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:39,758
I'll cover your hospital bill.

596
00:54:39,758 --> 00:54:41,142
Again, I'm so sorry.

597
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:42,828
And...

598
00:54:42,828 --> 00:54:44,936
My contact information.

599
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,407
Please let me know how much it is
once you get your car fixed.

600
00:54:49,407 --> 00:54:50,693
Okay.
[Choi Moo-gak]

601
00:54:53,955 --> 00:54:57,316
So, the robber...

602
00:54:57,316 --> 00:55:01,062
How did you know he robbed a beauty salon?

603
00:55:02,263 --> 00:55:09,704
So that... Just, I read about several
beauty salon robbers online.

604
00:55:09,704 --> 00:55:12,088
Then how did you know
he got on that elevator?

605
00:55:12,088 --> 00:55:13,704
And that he got off on the fourth floor?

606
00:55:13,704 --> 00:55:15,922
How did you know these things?

607
00:55:15,922 --> 00:55:17,888
Just my intuition.

608
00:55:17,888 --> 00:55:20,281
People do say I have good intuition.

609
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:22,442
Just like you detectives!

610
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:26,753
That sort of intuition tells you the
robber's locker number is 139?

611
00:55:26,753 --> 00:55:30,391
Is such a thing even possible?

612
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:32,368
It doesn't make much sense.

613
00:55:33,884 --> 00:55:38,666
Well... That's because I always
liked the number 139.

614
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:41,998
I just had a feeling that was it for today.

615
00:55:41,998 --> 00:55:45,101
You caught the robber and
that's what matters!

616
00:55:47,142 --> 00:55:49,878
Oops! The coffee is ready.

617
00:55:56,672 --> 00:55:59,163
Calm yourself, Oh Cho-rim.

618
00:55:59,163 --> 00:56:00,786
Did you have to do all that?

619
00:56:00,786 --> 00:56:03,124
Including barging into a men's locker room?

620
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,582
Thank you for the coffee.

621
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:19,302
Thank you very much for
all your help in this arrest.

622
00:56:19,302 --> 00:56:21,639
Don't mention it.

623
00:56:29,582 --> 00:56:33,627
Hot!

624
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:38,365
You should've told me this is so hot!

625
00:57:00,945 --> 00:57:04,475
Please text me the car damage estimate and
your wire transfer information...

626
00:57:04,475 --> 00:57:05,656
Once your car is fixed.

627
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:09,290
Okay. Good night.

628
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:15,787
Choi Eun-seol! Oh my!

629
00:57:15,787 --> 00:57:17,000
You're Choi Eun-seol, right?

630
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,978
You don't remember me? I'm Song Hyun-ji!

631
00:57:20,978 --> 00:57:23,745
You don't remember me?

632
00:57:24,085 --> 00:57:25,709
I don't know you.

633
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:27,410
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

634
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,076
I'm so sorry.

635
00:57:30,076 --> 00:57:32,068
You look exactly like one of my classmates.

636
00:57:32,068 --> 00:57:33,123
Don't worry.

637
00:57:33,123 --> 00:57:35,196
It happens all the time.

638
00:57:35,196 --> 00:57:36,751
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

639
00:57:36,751 --> 00:57:38,019
Yes.
