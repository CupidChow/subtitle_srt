[Episode 2]

2
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:14,599
Then once you get the
estimate for the car repair,

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,303
text me the cost and your
account number right away.

4
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:19,734
Yes. Goodbye.

5
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:26,565
Choi Eun-seol. Oh my!
You're Choi Eun-seol, right?

6
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:29,437
Hey Choi Eun-seol.
Don't you know me?

7
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:31,736
I'm Song Hyun-ji.

00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:45,970
[Certificate of Merit - Grand Prize]

9
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:54,799
I love you.

10
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:04,859
Eun-seol.

11
00:01:04,926 --> 00:01:06,541
Moo-gak.

12
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,846
Come here.
Oh my goodness.

13
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:12,173
My sister won the grand prize.

14
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:15,197
You did so well.
You're the best.

15
00:01:15,197 --> 00:01:19,501
I'm so proud of you.
My baby.

16
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:25,174
You always call me your baby.
Am I your daughter or something?

17
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:27,910
What woman will marry you
when you're like this?

18
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,654
Of course you're my daughter.

19
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:33,460
There are only two of us in this world
so of course you're my daughter.

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,302
I'm going to get you married and then
think about getting married or not...

21
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:40,806
Oh my.

22
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:44,741
Your mind is like
that of a grandfather.

23
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,397
That's right.

24
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,981
What delicious food should
I buy my Eun-seol?

25
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:50,718
Pork belly?

26
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:53,605
Meat noodles?

27
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:54,893
Meat noodles.

28
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:57,070
- Are you sure?
- Let's do it.

29
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,167
Choi Eun-seol won the grand prize.

30
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,407
I think you have the wrong person.

31
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:11,519
Oh my. I'm sorry.
You look so much like my classmate.

32
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,811
That's alright.
Anyone can make a mistake.

33
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:15,579
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

34
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,197
Yes.

35
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:33,802
You haven't left yet?

36
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,602
Your name is...

37
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:43,931
Ah. I just gave you my phone number
but I forgot to give you my name.

38
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:47,172
You're very detailed with personal
information since you're a police officer.

39
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:49,355
My name is Oh Cho-rim.

40
00:02:49,355 --> 00:02:53,322
If you give me that paper,
I'll write down my name for you.

41
00:02:58,027 --> 00:02:59,530
Here it is.

42
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:05,863
My name is Cho as in
yangcho and Rim as in geurim.

43
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:09,139
Oh Cho-rim.

44
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,662
Here it is.

45
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:17,932
She called you
Choi Eun-seol earlier.

46
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,483
Did you hear that?

47
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:24,394
I think she mistook me
for her friend.

48
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:30,500
Then I'll be going.

49
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:10,222
Eun-seol.

50
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,109
Choi Eun-seol.

51
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:15,942
Eun-seol.

52
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:18,133
Someone! Someone!

53
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,944
Eun-seol. Wake up.

54
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:25,812
Eun-seol...

55
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:39,652
The bastard who killed my Eun-seol...
I'll definitely kill you with my hands.

56
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:00,141
What kind of a detective
dresses like this?

57
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:01,517
Are you going to go on the stage
at a nightclub or something?

58
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:04,286
I'm going to go later tonight.

59
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:07,014
Oh, look who it is!

60
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:09,781
A police officer who
caught a robber is here.

61
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:13,517
Look at him showing off just because
he caught the hair salon robber.

62
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:17,213
Why are you here instead reporting
to your police substation?

63
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,381
I'm here to see the head of homicide.

64
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:22,413
Did you make an appointment?

65
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,309
That's not funny.

66
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:26,173
How can it be funny every time?

67
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,000
Go inside.

68
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,961
I clearly told you not
to get near a homicide case

69
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,696
and that I was going to
break your legs if you do.

70
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:44,156
But you went and arrested a hair salon
robber right after I told you?

71
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:47,741
Hey. Do my words seem funny to you?

72
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,042
As if that wasn't bad enough,

73
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:58,002
now you're asking me to make you
a homicide detective all of a sudden?

74
00:05:58,002 --> 00:05:59,475
If I become a homicide detective,

75
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:01,507
I'll make sure to increase
the culprit arrest rate.

76
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:03,499
You must be joking.

77
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:05,787
Do you think you can become a

78
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:09,396
homicide detective by randomly
catching a robber?

79
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:10,675
Do you think that?

80
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:12,753
I'm confident that
I'll catch the culprit.

81
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:15,075
Please make me a
homicide detective.

82
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:25,172
Fine.

83
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,601
This is a case file.

84
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,185
I'm going to give you just 10 days.

85
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:38,505
Arrest the culprit in 10 days
and bring him to me.

86
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:42,042
Then you'll become
a homicide detective.

87
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:43,370
I'll arrest him no matter what
and bring him to you.

88
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:50,709
But if you don't catch him, let's not
discuss this ever again. Okay?

89
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:00,608
How can you eat after
you destroyed my car?

90
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:02,913
You should be at the repair shop.
Why are you here?

91
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:04,305
I wasn't able to go yet because

92
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:06,425
I was busy bringing
lunch to all the seniors.

93
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,033
I'm really sorry.

94
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,638
Even though you destroyed my car?

95
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,781
I won't be able to calm down
even if I eat you alive.

96
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,366
I'll take it to the
repair shop right now.

97
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:18,574
Make sure to make it new.
Change the engine oil, too.

98
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:19,824
Yes.

99
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:24,706
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

100
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,270
Youngest one.

101
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,678
Hello.

102
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:31,267
Where are you going
instead of practicing?

103
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,119
I have to go the repair shop.

104
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,312
Repair shop?

105
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:36,815
Aren't you practicing
for the audition?

106
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,263
Why are you coming
out to the troupe?

107
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:39,574
Are you happy with just running errands

108
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:43,471
for the senior members and
cleaning the theater?

109
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:45,922
Do you have something
prepared for the audition?

110
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:50,099
If you don't have anything prepared,
there's no need for you to come out.

111
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,206
I'm preparing a comedy skit.

112
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,110
A comedy skit?

113
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,634
Who's your partner?
I didn't hear anything about it?

114
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:01,188
Who's your partner?

115
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:03,109
He's not part of the troupe.

116
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,868
Not part of the troupe?
Who is it?

117
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:09,604
He's new so you probably
don't know him.

118
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:10,875
Really?

119
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:15,832
Then bring your partner later
and show me the act.

120
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:16,912
Today?

121
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:19,233
Yeah. What?

122
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,676
Were you just lying
because you were desperate?

123
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:28,204
No. My partner is out of town right now so
it will be impossible to show you today.

124
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:33,151
Then bring your partner
tomorrow and show me the act.

125
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:36,523
If you can't do it that
means you lied to me.

126
00:08:36,523 --> 00:08:39,060
So you don't have to come
out starting tomorrow.

127
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:46,000
What should I do?

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,032
I don't have a partner
for my act right now.

129
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:56,527
I'm so stupid.
Stupid. Idiot.

130
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:05,472
Hey Choi Moo-gak.

131
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:08,242
The desk is going to break.
Stop that.

132
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,091
Moo-gak.

133
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:18,494
How do you think you're
going to solve this case?

134
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:21,685
He's just telling you that
you can't join homicide.

135
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:24,850
Is it that difficult of a case?

136
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,277
Have some coffee.

137
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:28,667
You know this case, too.

138
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,878
The internet cafe murder
from 10 years ago.

139
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:31,283
Three murders were committed in

140
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:34,110
three different internet cafes in
one night within our district.

141
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,540
Is it that case?

142
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,419
How do you catch the
culprit after all this time?

143
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:39,700
They mobilized the entire
homicide department

144
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,093
but they couldn't even find one clue.

145
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:43,731
And because of this case,

146
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:46,972
the Minister of Interior at that time was
replaced and the police chief resigned.

147
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:50,915
Moo-gak, I guess you won't be going
to the homicide department that easily.

148
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:06,761
Here's the estimate.

149
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:09,130
I gave you a good estimate.

150
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,569
It's about this much even
for just one fender.

151
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:17,130
Excuse me for asking you
this even though we just met.

152
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,480
But would you like to do a
comedy skit with me by chance?

153
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,424
I'm going to hold myself back
because you're a customer.

154
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,311
Come back after two
days to pick up the car.

155
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,661
This is Oh Cho-rim
from the car accident.

156
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:43,460
I have the estimate for the repair.

157
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,366
Bumper replacement and fender
repair came out to be $450.

158
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:52,503
Wow, it's been such a long time.
How have you been?

159
00:10:52,503 --> 00:10:55,832
You still dress like this.

160
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:59,598
Wait for me outside.
I'll get changed and come right now.

161
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:01,659
Let's go get a drink.

162
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:08,192
That police officer was
pretty good at acting.

163
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:20,149
This is Oh Cho-rim.

164
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:24,072
Would it be okay for us to meet
and discuss about the car repair cost?

165
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:30,318
I have to join homicide
no matter what.

166
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:52,010
I have to join homicide and catch
my sister's murderer with my own hands.

167
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,804
The repair cost came out to be
a lot more than I thought.

168
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:56,518
Please contact me.

169
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:09,242
If I want to catch Eun-seol's murderer,
I must join homicide.

170
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:11,841
I have to find Eun-seol's case file.

171
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:28,331
I'm going to report you as
a hit-and-run culprit.

172
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,777
If you don't answer my text,

173
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm going to accept it
as your not wanting to pay.

174
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:14,854
He can even do slapstick.
He's perfect.

175
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:19,144
I'm sorry. A customer spilled
some caramel macchiato.

176
00:13:19,144 --> 00:13:21,109
Are you alright?

177
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:22,623
Yes.

178
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,409
I-I'm sorry.

179
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,127
You came?

180
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:35,807
I was waiting for a long time.
You should've come sooner.

181
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:39,728
It took so long because
you ate so much.

182
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:45,949
Black bean noodles,
sweet and sour pork,

183
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:48,675
seafood noodles...

184
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:51,580
You ate them all. You eat like a horse.

185
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:03,682
Just how much was the repair
that you're acting like this?

186
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:08,689
The repair shop said that it's
estimated to be very expensive.

187
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:10,273
It's estimated to be?

188
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:16,999
But if you do well, you can end this
without paying a cent for the repair.

189
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,369
Do you like comedy skits?

190
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:23,135
What? Skit what?

191
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:25,380
A comedy skit.

192
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,086
I'm not sure if you know of the
late Jang So-pal and Go Chung-ja.

193
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:33,285
Oh my, it's been a while,
Mr. Jang So-pal.

194
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:36,811
You've become even more handsome.
Where are you going?

195
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:39,612
I'm getting married. A-ha ha ha ha!

196
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,981
You've become even more
beautiful, Ms. Go Chung-ja.

197
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,716
Where are you going?

198
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,335
I'm going to marry you.

199
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,619
Oh, I'm crying.

200
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,028
If you do the comedy skit with me,

201
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:10,903
I won't ask you for
a penny for the repair.

202
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:13,517
Where is the repair shop?

203
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:19,468
I'll get the estimate, so give me
the number to the repair shop.

204
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:22,421
Oh no, I forgot to bring the business card.

205
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,332
Anyway, it's just an
audition at my job.

206
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:27,100
Be my partner for this comedy skit,
just this one time.

207
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,148
And don't worry about the repair cost.

208
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:32,227
You were born to act!

209
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:36,709
You were acting so well when
I saw you catch the culprit.

210
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,772
Why don't you just do
the comedy skit with me?

211
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,780
Just what are you trying to do?

212
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,923
You're really being
comical right now.

213
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:46,411
What? Comedy skit?

214
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:50,866
Go. Just go.

215
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,112
Why are you yelling?

216
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:55,294
You're talking nonsense.

217
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:57,111
Just send me the estimate, then
I'll send you the money.

218
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,612
Go.

219
00:15:59,612 --> 00:16:01,323
Do you think the comedy skit is a joke?

220
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:03,901
It's serious and precious to me.

221
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:05,390
What's with you?
You're yelling for no reason.

222
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,469
I can't believe this!

223
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:16,343
I can't believe this either.

224
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:21,136
I don't have time to be thinking
about something like that, woman.

225
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:27,107
Inspector Kang...

226
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:28,636
The internet cafe murder case from

227
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:31,393
10 years ago is too
difficult for me to solve.

228
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:36,672
He looks so inconsiderate
and so rude!

229
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:53,419
Why isn't he answering my text?

230
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,339
Inspector Kang...

231
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:57,222
The internet cafe murder case from

232
00:16:57,222 --> 00:17:00,264
10 years ago is too difficult
for me to solve.

233
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:04,632
If you give me a different case,
I'll arrest the culprit for sure.

234
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:05,974
My life is on the line.

235
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:09,694
Stop it. I sent it to
the wrong person.

236
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:13,488
It's because you sent
me three texts earlier.

237
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:16,598
I just got confused.

238
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,678
What's the internet cafe murder
case from 10 years ago?

239
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:22,183
Don't worry about it.
Please delete the text.

240
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:24,894
Let me hear about the case first.

241
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:27,382
I think I might be able
to catch the culprit...

242
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:31,389
Who caught the hair salon robber?
I caught him, right?

243
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:37,945
I can catch the culprit.

244
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:44,393
Just with my senses,
I can find the culprit...

245
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:49,520
If you become my comedy skit partner,
I'll be your investigation partner.

246
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,361
Then it'll be good for the both of us.

247
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,828
Yes. It's Kwon Jae-hee.

248
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:09,657
What about Ma-ri?

249
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:19,099
You still haven't heard from her?

250
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,921
Yes. I understand.

251
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:26,950
No. I just arrived.
I'll call you back.

252
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:49,174
How did you know where the
hair salon robber was hiding?

253
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:50,852
How could you know that I ate black
bean noodles, seafood noodles,

254
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:54,828
fried rice and sweet and sour pork in
one sitting at the Chinese restaurant?

255
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:57,285
It's impossible to guess it
right just with your senses.

256
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:59,574
There's clearly...

257
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:01,833
You have some kind
of a secret, don't you?

258
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:06,590
Don't you think you're too close?

259
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:21,426
If we're going to be partners,
shouldn't we trust each other?

260
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,482
We're definitely going to be partners.

261
00:19:24,482 --> 00:19:26,085
Correct.

262
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,475
I know it by smell.

263
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:35,146
Smell?

264
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:39,225
The hair salon robber had a strong
perm solution smell on his hands.

265
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:44,374
And you had four different food
scents on your face and clothing.

266
00:19:56,937 --> 00:20:01,591
You're saying that you have
a keen sense of smell, right?

267
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:05,097
I'd say... probably better
than a police dog.

268
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:16,951
I'll go out and hide. After
5 minutes, come find me.

269
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:23,968
Officer Choi, we don't have
to do that kind of useless test.

270
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,767
Leave after 5 minutes.

271
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:38,310
He stepped on the
caramel macchiato again.

272
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:43,129
Caramel macchiato.

273
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:23,421
Oh boy...

274
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:39,992
So she can smell like
that dog over there.

275
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:41,557
Oh my...

276
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:51,617
She's following the path I walked
on without making a mistake.

277
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:53,450
How can she do that?

278
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:03,757
I saw you.
Come down.

279
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:17,256
You're really like a dog.

280
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:38,531
Can you trust me
as your partner now?

281
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:40,563
But...

282
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:45,515
You weren't sniffing like a dog...

283
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:48,546
You still can't believe me?

284
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:51,029
Of course.

285
00:22:54,963 --> 00:23:00,686
For me, this is not my nose, but this is.

286
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:08,673
Let's stop.

287
00:23:08,673 --> 00:23:10,345
Did you get those from the
Chinese restaurant?

288
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:13,611
The mints. They're in your pocket.

289
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,128
Hold those and follow me.

290
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:25,139
I'll have you confirm
if it's my eyes or my nose.

291
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:52,480
The mint scent is coming up from there.

292
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:31,856
Five?

293
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:44,681
It's impossible to smell with
her nose plugged from outside.

294
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:47,852
Can she really see it with her eyes?

295
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:06,703
This kid can really see smells.

296
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:22,986
This is the comedy skit notebook I made.

297
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:27,440
Choose the one that you like and
memorize the man's lines by tomorrow.

298
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,064
- Memorize it? - Yeah!

299
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:32,669
You have to memorize it so
that you can banter with me.

300
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:35,622
I already memorized
everything in there.

301
00:26:35,622 --> 00:26:38,509
I got it.
I just have to memorize it, right?

302
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:41,036
By the way...

303
00:26:41,036 --> 00:26:44,496
Did you already decide
to speak informally to me?

304
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:50,458
Ah... I speak informally
to people I work with.

305
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,059
I understand, Officer Choi.

306
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:53,825
You have to memorize it by tomorrow.

307
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:57,564
You made a contract with me, so
don't even think about breaching.

308
00:26:59,902 --> 00:27:01,603
I'm going to head out first.

309
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,259
My goodness.

310
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:38,832
Officer Choi.

311
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:42,076
What is it?
You didn't leave yet?

312
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:45,523
I forgot something very
important, so I came back.

313
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:46,564
What is it?

314
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:54,365
The thing about me seeing smells...
Please keep it a secret.

315
00:27:54,365 --> 00:27:56,772
Yes. Of course.

316
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:59,740
Since you're a police officer,
I can trust you, right?

317
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,188
Of course. Trust me.

318
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:04,299
Thank you.
Bye.

319
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,432
Bye!

320
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,794
Please save me!

321
00:28:27,794 --> 00:28:29,610
I'll do whatever you tell me!

322
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,529
Please save me!

323
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:37,049
Please save me.

324
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:25,428
Is the meeting prepared?

325
00:29:25,428 --> 00:29:29,255
Yes. Everyone from the homicide
department is in the meeting room.

326
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,143
Lieutenant, please let me hold the bag.

327
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,292
Park Seung-chul. 25-year-old male.

328
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:44,554
Hotel Bellboy.

329
00:29:44,554 --> 00:29:48,370
He's been missing for 5 days.

330
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,202
Joo Ma-ri.
27-year-old female.

331
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:54,458
She's a famous fashion model.
She's been missing for 4 days.

332
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,922
These two missing persons cases...

333
00:29:55,922 --> 00:30:00,909
are what I'm tracking amongst
the cases under your watch.

334
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:08,722
Do you know how many reports...
of missing persons we get everyday?

335
00:30:08,722 --> 00:30:10,850
I don't think these are cases that the

336
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,898
Metropolitan Investigation Unit
should interfere with.

337
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:17,394
Of course, there are many missing
persons cases all over the country.

338
00:30:17,394 --> 00:30:20,583
I'll explain the reason why
I'm focused on these cases.

339
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:24,601
Four years ago, the murder case
of a professor in his 60s

340
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:29,058
who was discovered in Yeoncheon.

341
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:30,946
Three years ago, the murder case
of a diver couple in their 40s

342
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:34,730
which happened on Jeju Island.

343
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,034
Two years ago, the murder case of
a famous mountaineer in his 40s

344
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,649
who was discovered in Seoul.

345
00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:41,114
A year ago, the murder case
of an exorcist in her 50s

346
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:44,458
who was discovered in Cheongju,
north Chungcheong Province.

347
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,969
The four cases I showed you involve
victims who vary in age and occupation,

348
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:51,451
but they occurred around
this time of the year.

349
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:53,393
One common factor of all these cases...

350
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,386
is that they all started as
a missing persons case.

351
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:58,722
Another common factor is that...

352
00:30:58,722 --> 00:31:01,979
they were all discovered on the
seventh day of being missing.

353
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:04,081
Another common factor is that...

354
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:09,020
their murders were on the sixth day of being
missing according to the autopsy reports.

355
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,452
The cause of all their
deaths was asphyxiation.

356
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:18,404
Looking at the consistency of the cases,
it's clearly a serial murder case.

357
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:25,467
Sir. That's what she's
been saying all this time.

358
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,091
It's not like you're
stupid or something.

359
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:29,372
Please continue.

360
00:31:29,372 --> 00:31:32,891
Nothing could be clearer that
this is a serial murder case.

361
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:43,069
What do those cuts
on their wrists mean?

362
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,891
Don't those look like barcodes?

363
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:46,950
The ones you scan at the
market cash register.

364
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,307
That's right. They're barcodes.

365
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,944
Would you turn on the lights?

366
00:31:54,347 --> 00:32:00,836
Our serial murder task force decided to do a
public investigation on the barcode murders.

367
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,789
The serial killer is killing every 12 months.

368
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:06,588
This is the 12th month.

369
00:32:06,588 --> 00:32:09,964
And the reason why we're focusing
on the hotel bellboy and

370
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:12,116
the fashion model is that their jobs and ages

371
00:32:12,116 --> 00:32:18,749
are different from those of past victims.

372
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:21,923
Please remember.
It starts with missing persons.

373
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:24,820
And he kills the victim on the
sixth day of being missing.

374
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,543
Park Seung-chul and Joo Ma-ri.

375
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:31,875
I hope these two people can
come back home safely.

376
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:36,491
The chances are slim, but please consider
that they may have been abducted by

377
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:40,476
the barcode murderer while
you conduct your searches.

378
00:32:40,476 --> 00:32:44,750
Do you have any questions?

379
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,918
The barcodes left by the culprit...
where are they used?

380
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:50,895
Are they actual working barcodes?

381
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:58,966
Hey you. Why are you in here?

382
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:00,333
I'm sorry.

383
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,246
What is with him?

384
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:14,765
We'll take the male Park Seung-chul,
so you take the female Joo Ma-ri.

385
00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:15,814
Agreed.

386
00:33:15,814 --> 00:33:19,677
You should know your place.

387
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:23,799
Why do you keep upsetting him?

388
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:29,452
Sir, how can I solve the internet cafe
murder case from over 10 years ago?

389
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,070
I'll find the missing fashion
model Joo Ma-ri instead.

390
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,886
Please let me work on this.

391
00:33:39,886 --> 00:33:42,958
Didn't I catch the hair salon robber?

392
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:46,102
You must be joking.

393
00:33:46,102 --> 00:33:49,250
- Sir.
- Yes.

394
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,397
Joo Ma-ri's cell phone communications
have been verified.

395
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,454
The last phone call she
made was to the hospital.

396
00:33:54,454 --> 00:33:57,557
She made many calls to the hospital.

397
00:33:57,557 --> 00:34:00,190
Go the hospital directly and verify.

398
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:09,102
Would it be okay if I take Officer
Choi Moo-gak since we're shorthanded?

399
00:34:09,102 --> 00:34:13,341
You're going to get fired the moment
you interfere with the investigation.

400
00:34:16,635 --> 00:34:17,930
Let's go.

401
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,473
We'll be back.

402
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:29,298
What is this?
Is it this hospital?

403
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:30,945
What are you doing, Officer Choi?

404
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,226
Yes. I'm coming.

405
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:38,943
This is Director Chun Baek-gyung's number.

406
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,198
Would be possible to meet Director

407
00:34:40,198 --> 00:34:42,888
Chun Baek-gyung of the Pain
Management Department today?

408
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:45,072
He's not seeing patients for
4 days starting today.

409
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:47,199
He's not seeing patients?

410
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,510
Then do you know this
person by any chance?

411
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,838
She's his patient. She's a fashion model.

412
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,534
Can we have his cell phone number?

413
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:04,686
He doesn't have one. He doesn't use it.

414
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,758
There's someone who doesn't
use a cell phone these days?

415
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:09,780
Why is he not seeing patients?

416
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,621
He has many days off.

417
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:15,029
It seems as if he travels to a lot of places.

418
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:19,538
But didn't you come to our hospital recently?

419
00:35:19,538 --> 00:35:21,306
That's right.

420
00:35:21,306 --> 00:35:22,803
Did you come here before?

421
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:25,840
Yes, because I was curious, too.

422
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,840
It's a comedy skit show.
Please take this ticket coupon.

423
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,776
Thank you.

424
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:34,216
Please take this coupon.

425
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,593
Please come see the concert. Thank you.

426
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,806
Please come see the concert.

427
00:35:58,728 --> 00:36:01,030
Hello, Officer Choi.

428
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,366
Why are you late?

429
00:36:02,366 --> 00:36:04,570
I came as fast I could.

430
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:08,719
What's with the sunglasses?

431
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:11,808
This is because there was some
foul smell on the way here.

432
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:15,135
I saw the article online about

433
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:18,393
fashion model Joo Ma-ri's missing
persons case on the way here.

434
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,050
Let's go inside.

435
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm a police officer.

436
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,936
We're investigating Joo Ma-ri's
missing persons case.

437
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:33,437
Please excuse me.

438
00:36:35,352 --> 00:36:36,974
Please excuse us.

439
00:36:36,974 --> 00:36:38,150
How are you related to her?

440
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,795
We're her friends who also modeled with her.

441
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:43,336
We just have to sniff
around before we go.

442
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:45,937
Would it okay for us to see some
clothes that Joo Ma-ri often wore?

443
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,410
Her clothes? You're going to sniff?

444
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,872
What are you going to sniff?

445
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:55,487
I meant that we're going
to sniff around for clues.

446
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:13,676
I can smell a unique perfume
smell from the clothes.

447
00:37:18,134 --> 00:37:19,783
This is the perfume.

448
00:37:19,783 --> 00:37:20,974
Would it be okay for me to use it?

449
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:22,721
Yes. Go ahead.

450
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,900
Using vanilla scent as a base...
this is a custom perfume layered

451
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,607
with an orange scent and a rose
scent mixed at a 7 to 3 ratio.

452
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:44,517
Yes. That's it exactly.
Ma-ri always mixes it that way.

453
00:37:44,517 --> 00:37:48,832
We call that Scent of Ma-ri.
Ma-ri will be okay, right?

454
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:53,886
Please find her quickly.

455
00:37:53,886 --> 00:37:55,303
Please don't worry.

456
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:56,898
Thank you.

457
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:01,235
This is Joo Ma-ri's agency office.

458
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:05,452
The last place she was seen is
this building's parking lot.

459
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:08,072
Let's go to the parking lot.

460
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:10,160
Which comedy skit did you choose?

461
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,144
Comedy skit?

462
00:38:12,144 --> 00:38:15,184
What did you pick from
the notebook I gave you?

463
00:38:15,184 --> 00:38:16,257
"Green Light."

464
00:38:16,257 --> 00:38:18,992
Right? That's the funniest, right?

465
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,872
You really know which one to pick.

466
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:22,432
I chose the right partner.

467
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:24,447
That was the shortest.

468
00:38:24,447 --> 00:38:26,864
You memorized the lines, right?

469
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:28,989
Is this the time to be talking
about that right now?

470
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:30,446
Come quickly.

471
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:53,891
That's Joo Ma-ri's
custom perfume scent.

472
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,628
I'm sure of it!

473
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:04,721
Joo Ma-ri's scent is coming from that man.

474
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:06,264
Are you sure?

475
00:39:10,672 --> 00:39:12,031
Excuse me.

476
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:20,382
Where is Joo Ma-ri?

477
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:21,455
Why did you come here?

478
00:39:21,455 --> 00:39:26,287
Hurry up and talk?
Where is Joo Ma-ri right now?

479
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:28,224
Oh my. It's Chef Kwon Jae-hee.

480
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:33,905
That idiot. Hey!

481
00:39:38,015 --> 00:39:40,740
It looks as if a patrol officer
has made another mistake.

482
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,302
I'm so sorry.

483
00:39:42,302 --> 00:39:44,444
This person is definitely related to
Joo Ma-ri. Please investigate him.

484
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:46,706
Of course he's related!

485
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:50,034
He came directly to the police station
to tell us that he's Joo Ma-ri's boyfriend.

486
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:52,699
We all came by her office to investigate.

487
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:56,864
He was in the U.S. for business for a week
and just came off the flight yesterday.

488
00:39:56,864 --> 00:40:00,129
Is there a better alibi than that?

489
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:05,279
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

490
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:11,607
It's alright. I'm fine, so please find Ma-ri.

491
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:13,836
I request this of you.

492
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,142
By the way, it's probably the first time

493
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:24,803
you've seen me, so how did you
know that I was related to Ma-ri?

494
00:41:02,265 --> 00:41:04,065
After disappearing without a word,

495
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:11,376
how could you just send me a text
saying that you're waiting here?

496
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:16,693
It's amazing that Kwon Jae-hee
and Joo Ma-ri were dating.

497
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:21,880
By the way...

498
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,441
Try saying the lines you memorized.

499
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:28,800
That man named Kwon Jae-hee...
Is he that famous?

500
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,600
Of course! He's very popular
among women these days.

501
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,183
I said to start saying the
lines from Green Light.

502
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:37,041
We have to perform it in front
of the leader in an hour.

503
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,520
Whether we do it well or not,

504
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,111
we have to at least deliver
the content somehow.

505
00:41:41,111 --> 00:41:44,455
There was a conflict between Joo Ma-ri
and the CEO of her agency.

506
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:49,199
They said she probably went into hiding
after cancelling her fashion show appearance.

507
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,626
Officer Choi. aren't you going to do it?

508
00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:55,106
Then I can't go on the
investigation tomorrow either.

509
00:41:55,106 --> 00:41:58,020
The investigation might take a little longer.

510
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,341
Here.

511
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:06,689
What's this?

512
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:09,752
Did you rip this out of
the notebook I gave you?

513
00:42:09,752 --> 00:42:12,727
I couldn't help it since I was
memorizing the lines while working.

514
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:14,101
Do you know how precious this is to me?

515
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:17,135
How could you rip this out?
You're driving me crazy.

516
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,431
You should've told me
not to rip it out.

517
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:23,863
It's natural that
you shouldn't rip it.

518
00:42:23,863 --> 00:42:33,245
Anyway, we don't have time, so
let's hurry and start Green Light.

519
00:42:33,245 --> 00:42:39,250
"Hey. Listen to me. This is
Green Light, isn't it?"

520
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,913
Start over.

521
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:47,277
"Hey. Listen to me. This is
Green Light, isn't it?"

522
00:43:13,745 --> 00:43:16,108
What are you doing? Start.

523
00:43:20,025 --> 00:43:24,522
Hey. Listen to me. This is
Green Light, isn't it?

524
00:43:24,522 --> 00:43:25,997
What is it? What is it?

525
00:43:25,997 --> 00:43:28,058
I went to an ice cream shop, but

526
00:43:28,058 --> 00:43:31,951
the female server gave me
double that of other customers.

527
00:43:31,951 --> 00:43:34,584
That was just buy one and
get one free promotion.

528
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:39,048
- Really?
- Yes, really.

529
00:43:39,048 --> 00:43:42,607
Hey. Listen to me.
This is Green Light, isn't it?

530
00:43:42,607 --> 00:43:44,136
What is it? What is it?

531
00:43:44,136 --> 00:43:49,046
I was walking on the road to my house
when a woman who works at a store in

532
00:43:49,046 --> 00:43:51,830
town started running as soon as she saw me.

533
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,544
That's... Why did she do that?

534
00:43:54,544 --> 00:43:58,173
When I went home,
my room was completely clean.

535
00:43:58,173 --> 00:44:00,448
That's because your mom
came by that afternoon.

536
00:44:00,448 --> 00:44:03,696
- Really?
- Yes, really.

537
00:44:03,696 --> 00:44:06,848
Hey. This is Green Light, isn't it?

538
00:44:06,848 --> 00:44:08,864
What is it? What is it?

539
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:11,096
Stop.

540
00:44:11,096 --> 00:44:13,728
What's your name?

541
00:44:13,728 --> 00:44:17,193
Just call me Officer Choi.

542
00:44:17,193 --> 00:44:18,424
You're a policeman?

543
00:44:18,424 --> 00:44:24,908
Your stage name is good.
You should carry a handcuff.

544
00:44:24,908 --> 00:44:26,771
You're a wacko, aren't you?

545
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:27,820
Oh Cho-rim.

546
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,947
Yes, sir.

547
00:44:28,947 --> 00:44:32,049
I did confirm that you're
practicing with a partner.

548
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:33,578
But if your performance is at this level,

549
00:44:33,578 --> 00:44:36,546
you'll finish in last place
and get kicked out.

550
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:39,621
Yes sir. I'll try harder.

551
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:41,508
Officer Choi.

552
00:44:41,508 --> 00:44:45,967
You're pretty decent at acting.
I really thought you were an idiot.

553
00:44:51,562 --> 00:44:58,556
Officer Choi, you'll have to get more
serious about practicing, okay?

554
00:44:58,556 --> 00:45:01,003
I just thought of this.

555
00:45:01,003 --> 00:45:04,685
Why did Joo Ma-ri keep her
boyfriend a secret from everyone?

556
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,895
Let's go.

557
00:45:15,392 --> 00:45:18,625
Joo Ma-ri has been missing for 7 days.

558
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,232
Is this the right road?

559
00:45:22,232 --> 00:45:24,641
It's so dark that I can't
tell where we're going.

560
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:28,425
Hey, we have a GPS,
so what are you worried about?

561
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,169
We're almost there.

562
00:45:31,169 --> 00:45:34,800
I want to get there fast and make some ramen.

563
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,999
Alright. I'll make it for
you when we get there.

564
00:45:39,618 --> 00:45:41,789
What's that? What's going on?

565
00:45:49,457 --> 00:45:52,641
Fashion model Joo Ma-ri has
been missing for 8 days.

566
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:55,545
Until now, on the 7th day, the serial killer
would leave the corpses

567
00:45:55,545 --> 00:46:00,137
where they could easily be found,
but Joo Ma-ri is still missing.

568
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:02,064
Since it doesn't seem as though
she's a victim of a serial murderer,

569
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:05,438
- we'll stop working on the Joo Ma-ri case.
- Okay.

570
00:46:05,438 --> 00:46:07,358
Thank you, sir.

571
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:13,670
Yes. I found out that she had a lot of debt
and had intense conflict with her agency.

572
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:18,578
It's clear that she went into hiding.
Well then, thank you for everything.

573
00:46:18,578 --> 00:46:20,270
Thank you.

574
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:22,903
Sir, Joo Ma-ri's credit card was used.

575
00:46:22,903 --> 00:46:24,575
Where?

576
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:26,475
In Yangpyeong. It was used at a motel.

577
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:27,761
Since you pay for the motel in advance,

578
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:29,842
we should catch the culprit
before he comes out.

579
00:46:29,842 --> 00:46:32,128
No, no. It could be Joo Ma-ri herself.

580
00:46:32,128 --> 00:46:34,083
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and go to Yangpyeong.

581
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,517
Yes. We'll get going.

582
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:38,099
We'll be back.

583
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:38,956
Detective Tak.

584
00:46:38,956 --> 00:46:40,099
Request assistance from Yangpyung police.

585
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:41,814
Yes, sir.

586
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:44,579
Where are you going?

587
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:45,712
We're leaving.

588
00:46:45,712 --> 00:46:47,617
Hurry up and get in.

589
00:46:53,465 --> 00:46:55,840
I must be losing my mind.

590
00:47:00,337 --> 00:47:02,392
The young guy should drive.

591
00:47:02,392 --> 00:47:04,335
Of course.

592
00:47:06,851 --> 00:47:08,922
- Oh my.
- What?

593
00:47:08,922 --> 00:47:10,538
You shocked me.

594
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:11,739
When did you get in?

595
00:47:11,739 --> 00:47:12,986
Get off.

596
00:47:12,986 --> 00:47:14,907
Just go. We're in a hurry.

597
00:47:14,907 --> 00:47:17,936
We'll just throw him out on the way.

598
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:19,949
That guy is driving me crazy.

599
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:27,249
What are you doing?
Let go of me and we'll talk.

600
00:47:27,249 --> 00:47:28,609
Come here.

601
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:30,449
Do you have a warrant?

602
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:32,309
Are you allowed to drag
someone away like this?

603
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:33,709
Do you have common sense?

604
00:47:33,709 --> 00:47:35,508
Be quiet.
They're running a business.

605
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:37,253
Wait. Wait.

606
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:39,010
Let go of me.

607
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:42,019
Are you putting handcuffs on me?

608
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:44,332
You're driving me crazy.

609
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:48,403
What are you going to do? This bastard...

610
00:48:10,285 --> 00:48:12,140
Face on the ID matches.

611
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,916
Your name is Yang Tae-soo.

612
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:16,285
The name on the credit card is Joo Ma-ri.

613
00:48:16,285 --> 00:48:18,244
This is not your credit card.

614
00:48:18,244 --> 00:48:21,292
I picked it up on the street!

615
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:22,813
You're putting handcuffs on me for

616
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:27,580
just using a credit card
I picked up off the street?

617
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,052
You were just arrested for kidnapping.

618
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:35,863
Tell me. Where is Joo Ma-ri?

619
00:48:46,746 --> 00:48:48,459
Where is it?

620
00:49:16,082 --> 00:49:17,194
Is this it?

621
00:49:17,194 --> 00:49:19,561
That's the wallet that had
Joo Ma-ri's credit card, right?

622
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:20,193
Yes.

623
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:21,527
Where was the wallet originally?

624
00:49:21,527 --> 00:49:23,935
It was there from the beginning.

625
00:49:23,935 --> 00:49:28,480
Detective. I was walking by
and saw that there was a wallet.

626
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,047
Who would just walk by after seeing a wallet?

627
00:49:31,047 --> 00:49:34,264
Officer Choi, take this to Seoul right
now and run it through forensics.

628
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:36,037
Yes, sir.

629
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:54,047
Since it's a leather wallet, the
leather smell is the strongest.

630
00:49:54,047 --> 00:49:55,112
Since it was found in the mountain,

631
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:57,622
it seems as though she's
in the mountains somewhere.

632
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,063
It's not the mountains, but near water.

633
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,376
It's not the mountains, but water?

634
00:50:07,279 --> 00:50:09,207
It has a strong smell of waste water.

635
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:12,879
Like smell from a river or lake...

636
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:15,815
It smells a lot like water.

637
00:50:15,815 --> 00:50:19,168
The wallet was found in the village
community center by the hill.

638
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:21,112
Why does it smell like water?

639
00:50:21,112 --> 00:50:22,543
It's a dog smell.

640
00:50:22,543 --> 00:50:24,799
Dog smell?

641
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:29,592
I don't think Joo Ma-ri raised
a dog in her house.

642
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:31,033
Dog...

643
00:50:35,552 --> 00:50:37,279
Dog...

644
00:50:43,144 --> 00:50:47,720
Based on the fact that Joo Ma-ri's
belonging was found at a great distance,

645
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,080
we'll shift the investigation direction

646
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,973
toward kidnapping instead of missing persons.

647
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:59,457
And starting tomorrow morning,
we'll gather more people

648
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:05,711
and expand our search zone to
2 km instead of 1 km.

649
00:51:05,711 --> 00:51:09,838
I have something to tell you, sir.

650
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:11,623
It's not the mountains, but a river.

651
00:51:11,623 --> 00:51:14,118
We need to search around the river.

652
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:22,845
What are you doing, Detective Ki?

653
00:51:22,845 --> 00:51:25,760
Officer Choi, continue.

654
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:32,541
We need to assume that Joo Ma-ri's
wallet that was found today was

655
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:35,336
originally from a river about 1 km
away from the village community center.

656
00:51:35,336 --> 00:51:39,441
We need to search there.

657
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:41,331
What's the reason?

658
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:45,083
This wallet was in the river and the reason
it was discovered by the community center

659
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:52,499
was that a dog bit the wallet and
brought it near the community center.

660
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:54,442
Don't laugh.

661
00:51:57,548 --> 00:52:03,244
So you're saying that the wallet was
in the river and a dog bit it

662
00:52:03,244 --> 00:52:08,732
and ran 1 km to the village community
center where it could easily be found?

663
00:52:08,732 --> 00:52:10,382
That's right.

664
00:52:14,371 --> 00:52:15,723
Get out.

665
00:52:15,723 --> 00:52:17,461
Sir.

666
00:52:18,436 --> 00:52:23,186
Don't ever come near homicide department.

667
00:52:23,186 --> 00:52:27,641
What nonsense are you saying?

668
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:31,058
Do you know how serious this case is?

669
00:52:31,058 --> 00:52:32,658
Get out. Disappear from here.

670
00:52:32,658 --> 00:52:34,317
Get out!

671
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,328
Detective Tak, take him out.

672
00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:41,955
Don't laugh.

673
00:52:43,978 --> 00:52:47,570
Where did you find your comedy
skit partner Officer Choi?

674
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,770
I just met him on the street.

675
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,513
You're lying.

676
00:52:51,513 --> 00:52:57,190
You just met him on the street and
asked him to be your partner?

677
00:53:03,729 --> 00:53:10,490
Huh? I saw that somewhere?

678
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:14,338
Woo-yah, is that a popular wallet these days?

679
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:15,874
You don't you know what this is?

680
00:53:15,874 --> 00:53:18,557
It looks like leather, right?
It's made with fabric.

681
00:53:18,557 --> 00:53:22,814
It's not leather?

682
00:53:22,814 --> 00:53:25,925
It's true. It doesn't smell
like leather at all.

683
00:53:25,925 --> 00:53:31,880
This wallet designer is an animal rights
activist, so he doesn't use leather or fur.

684
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,016
He treats the fabric with a special
treatment to make it look like leather.

685
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:36,786
Isn't it pretty?

686
00:53:46,253 --> 00:53:47,469
Hello.

687
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:49,077
We have to find the leather smell.

688
00:53:49,077 --> 00:53:51,931
We have to find the leather smell
that comes from Joo Ma-ri's wallet.

689
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:54,044
Find the leather smell?
What are you talking about?

690
00:53:54,044 --> 00:53:56,052
That wallet is not made of leather.

691
00:53:56,052 --> 00:53:58,172
It was from fabric with a coating on it.

692
00:53:58,172 --> 00:54:00,989
That's why it shouldn't have a leather smell.

693
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:06,710
But Joo Ma-ri's leather had
a very strong leather smell.

694
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,696
Then you're saying the wallet
got a leather smell somehow?

695
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:29,680
The leather smell from Joo Ma-ri's
house is everywhere here.

696
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,842
But there was an even stronger
smell from Joo Ma-ri's wallet.

697
00:54:33,842 --> 00:54:35,329
According to the factory manager,

698
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:37,323
their water treatment unit was
broken a couple of nights ago.

699
00:54:37,323 --> 00:54:40,234
So their waste water went straight
into the river for an hour.

700
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:42,026
So?

701
00:54:42,026 --> 00:54:47,608
The wallet that was floating down the
river got soaked with that waste water.

702
00:54:47,608 --> 00:54:53,320
That's why it smelled like
leather and waste water.

703
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,633
It became more certain that we need

704
00:54:54,633 --> 00:54:57,799
to search around this river
if we want to find Joo Ma-ri.

705
00:54:57,799 --> 00:54:59,322
Let's go.

706
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:21,920
Go up the mountain.

707
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,448
Let's search everywhere.

708
00:55:25,448 --> 00:55:28,416
Hey! Toward the mountain!

709
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:30,111
Toward the mountain!

710
00:55:45,648 --> 00:55:47,552
Should we take a break?

711
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:52,391
Can't we call other police officers?

712
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:55,455
The other police officers
don't believe me.

713
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:58,505
If we find a clue this time,
then they'll believe me.

714
00:55:58,505 --> 00:56:00,232
But it's too much for us to
continue this way.

715
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:04,576
It's too hard.

716
00:56:04,576 --> 00:56:06,888
Did you find another
comedy skit partner then?

717
00:56:06,888 --> 00:56:09,528
That's so cheap.

718
00:56:09,528 --> 00:56:13,551
We'll continue the search after
resting for 10 minutes.

719
00:56:13,551 --> 00:56:16,744
How did I end up without a partner?

720
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:20,005
I'm just being threatened like that.

721
00:56:25,127 --> 00:56:28,183
The view is great.

722
00:56:28,183 --> 00:56:29,982
Was there a car accident?

723
00:56:34,368 --> 00:56:40,130
This looks like a broken tail light
and this looks like a broken headlight.

724
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:49,215
The reason why there are pieces
of taillight and headlight.

725
00:56:49,215 --> 00:56:55,996
Does it mean that a car coming down
the hill hit a car that was parked here?

726
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,136
Oh Cho-rim.

727
00:56:59,136 --> 00:57:02,855
I think there was a car accident. Come here.

728
00:57:02,855 --> 00:57:06,159
How did I meet a police officer in my life?

729
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:09,311
Why is he calling me now?

730
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:11,360
What is it?

731
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,328
There was a car accident here?

732
00:57:13,328 --> 00:57:15,968
Yeah. It looks as though a
car was parked here before

733
00:57:15,968 --> 00:57:19,113
and a different car came down the hill...

734
00:57:24,785 --> 00:57:26,268
What's wrong?

735
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,057
What seems wrong?

736
00:57:35,057 --> 00:57:37,592
Behind you...

737
00:57:40,826 --> 00:57:43,969
Joo Ma-ri's scent is coming from behind you.
