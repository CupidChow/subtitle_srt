[Final Episode]

2
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:13,897
Cho-rim is gone.

3
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:15,867
The bride is gone!

4
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:22,111
Oh Cho-rim!

5
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:28,854
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:31,342
The bride disappeared?

7
00:00:31,342 --> 00:00:33,207
I'll check the outside of the building.

8
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:35,736
I'll check the inside of the building.

9
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,107
Let's go.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,568
Hello. Please wake up.

11
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:50,003
Are you alright?

12
00:00:58,154 --> 00:01:00,667
Cho-rim!

13
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:08,587
Cho-rim! Cho-rim!

14
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,720
Kwon Jae-hee was alive.

15
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:07,185
Kwon Jae-hee.

16
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:38,328
I just gave an order to mobilize

17
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:42,431
everyone for search and inspection
of vehicles that passed nearby.

18
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:46,771
I'd like to help with
this investigation also.

19
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:51,007
Yes, of course.

20
00:02:53,063 --> 00:03:05,902
I know saying this probably won't help,
but I'm sure Cho-rim will be safe.

21
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:34,039
I also volunteered to help
with this investigation.

22
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,981
So don't try to do this on your own
and work together with the police.

23
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,783
You know what I'm saying, don't you?

24
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:44,779
The analysis of the surveillance
video has been released.

25
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,718
Kwon Jae-hee's ambulance has entered Paju.

26
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:47,853
Everyone was dispatched to Paju.

27
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:48,769
Paju?

28
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,122
I'll request Paju Police Station to
search for Kwon Jae-hee.

29
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,087
They've figured out the last
location of the ambulance.

30
00:03:58,087 --> 00:04:01,344
Let's head over there, too.

31
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,604
What are you trying to do with this?

32
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:26,522
Don't worry.

33
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:31,459
I'm not going to use it on you. I'm
going to use it on Choi Moo-gak.

34
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:36,311
Just what are you planning to do?

35
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,256
Stop asking me questions.

36
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:42,402
You'll find out soon enough.

37
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:23,360
The license plate number of this ambulance
is the one we saw Kwon Jae-hee get on.

38
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,270
It seems he's already changed locations.

39
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,219
Let's intensify the search before
he goes farther away. Now!

40
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,053
Cho-rim...

41
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:47,683
That's Cho-rim's?

42
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:53,732
She probably didn't realize she had
dropped it as they changed vehicles.

43
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,589
I think she dropped it on purpose.

44
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:04,575
We need to ask for help from forensics.

45
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,354
Kwon Jae-hee hasn't made any movement yet?

46
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:12,488
Correct.

47
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:16,379
Purposefully showing his face on
the surveillance video indicates

48
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,935
that this is a completely different pattern
from his other kidnappings.

49
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:22,621
It means his purpose isn't the kidnapping.

50
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:27,088
He will contact us to inform
us of another purpose.

51
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:31,986
Anyway, I'm so worried because the search
range to find Kwon Jae-hee is wide.

52
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:37,542
I will check to see if the surveillance
video analysis is finished and come back.

53
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,115
Do not enter.

54
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:01,040
This is...

55
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:05,679
I saw that you decorated your
newlywed interior the same as here...

56
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:08,867
Have you been watching us?

57
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:11,295
Just what do you want from us?

58
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,604
It's simple.

59
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:17,025
We're going to decide who lives and who dies.

60
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:21,367
What basis do you have to
decide who lives or dies?

61
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,601
Stop asking questions.

62
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:35,586
Let me ask you a final question.
Why did you kill my parents?

63
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,022
Did you get your memories back?

64
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:42,441
I remember every crazy thing you
did that day, you murderer!

65
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:47,578
You're never going to be forgiven.

66
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:55,909
It's a different feeling
hearing this from you.

67
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:14,724
Hello.

68
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:17,887
You must've stayed up all night.
You sound tired.

69
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:21,696
Cho-rim... is safe, right?

70
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:30,578
Of course she's safe because the person I
want is not Oh Cho-rim, but Choi Moo-gak.

71
00:09:31,022 --> 00:09:34,246
From now on, go the place I tell you.

72
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:36,754
Give me proof that Cho-rim is safe.

73
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:41,293
Don't give me orders. I'm about
to be in bad mood.

74
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:47,334
I will send it to you when I feel like it.

75
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:53,324
Go to Oh Cho-rim's old house
and wait for my call.

76
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:58,318
It was still an empty house when I went.

77
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,220
Fine. I'm heading over there now.

78
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,547
Oh Cho-rim better be safe.

79
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:15,583
If you bring the police with you,

80
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,891
I'm going to send a picture
of your dead bride right away.

81
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:24,716
Once you arrive, take a picture and
send it to me.

82
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:52,511
Cho-rim.

83
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:56,640
Cho-rim, are you alright?

84
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,840
Wait just a little bit. I'll be home soon.

85
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,888
Just relax.

86
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,077
Choi Moo-gak.

87
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,352
Don't even take one step from there.
If you move, Oh Cho-rim is dead.

88
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:17,249
What are you trying to do,
you crazy scumbag?

89
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,665
I'd like for you to stop cursing.

90
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:24,331
Nothing good can come from
getting me agitated.

91
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,450
Let's be calm.

92
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,356
Let's calm down. Calm down.

93
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:53,935
Is this the key to your newlywed home?

94
00:12:57,442 --> 00:13:00,836
I must be right.

95
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:08,662
Do you know what this is?

96
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:19,478
This is a bomb.

97
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:23,210
It was very difficult to get this.

98
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,564
The moment Choi Moo-gak goes
in the house to save you...

99
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:36,383
and he steps on this, he'll explode.
That will be the end for him.

100
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:41,294
That's right. It's alright. It's alright.

101
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:45,488
Then it'll be your turn next.

102
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:40,993
Anyway, the reason Moo-gak didn't tell

103
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:47,331
us is that he wanted to save Cho-rim
so badly. Let's try to understand.

104
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:52,143
We'll pursue his cell phone location,
so when Choi Moo-gak moves, we'll move also.

105
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:55,004
Choi Moo-gak is continuing
to stay at Cho-rim's house.

106
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:56,408
Kwon Jae-hee...

107
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:59,397
Just what is he planning?

108
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:06,532
It seems he's trying to buy more time.

109
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:22,894
Why is he keeping me at an empty house?

110
00:16:55,924 --> 00:17:00,648
In exactly one hour, at 3 p.m.,
come here to your house.

111
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:03,129
And I'll let Oh Cho-rim go.

112
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:05,454
I'll head over there right away.

113
00:17:05,454 --> 00:17:12,077
Keep your promise. When I go there,
you have to let Oh Cho-rim go.

114
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:38,236
Choi Moo-gak is moving.

115
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:41,446
Where is he going?

116
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:49,503
The main ingredient of the substance
on Cho-rim's ring is potassium nitrate.

117
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:54,418
If it's potassium nitrate... Isn't that what
you use to make bombs?

118
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:56,483
I think it's a homemade bomb.

119
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:59,171
I think Cho-rim left it on purpose.

120
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:03,118
Choi Moo-gak is in real danger.

121
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:58,859
You're curious about what happened, right?

122
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:03,751
Choi Moo-gak died just now.

123
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:07,666
His body was shattered into pieces probably.

124
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:13,247
He probably didn't know he
would die like that.

125
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:20,208
Don't worry.

126
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,541
I won't kill you in a cruel manner
like I did with Choi Moo-gak.

127
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:28,652
I'll just kill you swiftly.

128
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:45,003
Are you alright?

129
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,536
Officer Choi.

130
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,379
Just wait a little bit. Lt. Yeom
will be here soon.

131
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,834
Wait!

132
00:21:57,106 --> 00:22:00,315
Don't kill me.

133
00:22:00,315 --> 00:22:03,268
Save me.

134
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:07,411
You're afraid to die?

135
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:11,758
You're afraid to lose your life?

136
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:15,273
Cowardly jerk.

137
00:22:15,273 --> 00:22:18,983
You have to die.

138
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:26,885
Do you think anything will be solved
just because you kill me?

139
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:32,924
No. It won't.

140
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:40,898
I'm not even afraid of
getting my hands dirty.

141
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:45,532
You deserve to die a hundred times,
do you know that?

142
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:54,310
But there is the law,
so I should abide by it.

143
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,604
You're going to be judged by the law.

144
00:22:58,604 --> 00:23:04,478
Kneel down and put your hands behind you.

145
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:22,416
Cho-rim! Cho-rim.

146
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,970
Officer Choi just went after the culprit.

147
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,550
I'm so glad you're safe.

148
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,391
Let's go together.

149
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:18,405
How did you know to go to the model
home instead of your new home?

150
00:25:18,405 --> 00:25:25,201
I figured it out when I saw the video of
Cho-rim that Kwon Jae-hee had sent me.

151
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:44,649
The picture frame isn't there.

152
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:48,951
Here?

153
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:53,223
You're pretty sharp.

154
00:25:53,223 --> 00:25:53,715
That's amazing.

155
00:25:57,884 --> 00:26:04,800
It's all thanks to Cho-rim that we found out
about the bomb at your house.

156
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,531
When we sent it for component analysis,
they said it was an explosive.

157
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:13,319
So we deployed the bomb squad immediately.

158
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:19,577
To have Kwon Jae-hee believe that the
bomb went off, we broke the windows

159
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:22,477
on purpose and blew up a fake bomb
with a strong blast and smoke.

160
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:29,661
We received the call from Officer
Choi and set if off at 3 p.m.

161
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:37,543
Now with this, the barcode-serial-murder
case is officially closed.

162
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:41,854
Now it's really the end.

163
00:26:41,854 --> 00:26:51,023
By the way... did the two of you...
get married or not?

164
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:56,256
Since I haven't officiated the wedding yet,
they're not married.

165
00:26:56,256 --> 00:27:00,348
We didn't get married. I didn't even get
a chance to enter the wedding hall.

166
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:03,544
Since you wore the wedding dress,
we did get married.

167
00:27:03,544 --> 00:27:05,406
Are you trying to get away with that?

168
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:09,820
Our newlywed home was ruined, so we
don't even have money to get married.

169
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,617
We should at least wrap up the case.

170
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:12,998
Let's go out to eat!

171
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,575
We should go eat some pork.

172
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:17,132
You always want pork. Beef this time!

173
00:27:17,132 --> 00:27:20,013
Beef! Beef!

174
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,174
Why are you guys saying pork or beef?

175
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,525
Green onion pancake should be fine.

176
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:25,524
Let's go have some green onion pancake.

177
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:29,126
Did you just hit me?

178
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:38,043
Kwon Jae-hee is gone forever from this world.

179
00:27:41,053 --> 00:27:41,875
Over there.

180
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:44,533
Over here?

181
00:27:50,414 --> 00:27:51,588
How about this?

182
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,173
Should we move it next to that stand?

183
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,643
So it can face this one.

184
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,239
Like this?

185
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,660
More this way. More this way.

186
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,275
Like this?

187
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:14,728
If all five of them are the
same, it's not fun.

188
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:19,070
Like this. Like this.

189
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,120
This is mine.

190
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,362
Okay.

191
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:25,175
Here.

192
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:29,290
This is little bigger so it's mine.

193
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,036
Here.

194
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,349
Father, please don't worry about
Cho-rim any longer.

195
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:50,929
We'll be happy together.

196
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,754
Yes. Thank you.

197
00:28:54,754 --> 00:29:03,144
Cho-rim, you need to start using your
real name again... as Choi Eun-seol.

198
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:05,961
No, Dad. I'm your daughter.

199
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:09,409
I'm going to take good care of my mom

200
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:12,021
and dad who passed away,
but I'm also going to take good care of you.

201
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:14,700
I'm your daughter Oh Cho-rim.

202
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,404
Thank you.

203
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:22,372
I decided to go live down on Jeju Island.

204
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:28,045
Really? Then you're going to live in
our hometown. That's great.

205
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:34,574
We're so happy knowing that you'll be in
our hometown when we visit.

206
00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:44,378
I'm so proud of you for overcoming
such difficult events.

207
00:29:44,378 --> 00:29:50,938
You two will be happy from now on.

208
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:55,231
You're right.

209
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,950
Here.

210
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,103
I'm so nervous.

211
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:01,994
We're going to be a married
couple if I just sign here?

212
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:06,825
That's right. Hurry up and sign.

213
00:30:06,825 --> 00:30:11,750
By the way, who are you going to ask to be
a witness for our marriage registration?

214
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,083
I was planning to ask your
confidant to be a witness.

215
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:19,646
I was also planning to ask your
confidant to be our witness.

216
00:30:19,646 --> 00:30:20,747
Who is it?

217
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:21,528
I don't know.

218
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,099
I don't know either.

219
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,239
You're going to be like that, huh?

220
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,084
Did you finish?

221
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:32,141
Ta-da.

222
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:38,796
This is a special delivery
from an acquaintance.

223
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,926
Please enjoy.

224
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:44,223
Drink up.

225
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:49,653
This is our marriage registration.
I want to ask you to be a witness.

226
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:52,215
Hey. Should I be the witness for you?

227
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:53,975
You haven't left yet?

228
00:30:53,975 --> 00:30:59,022
Do you think I'd ask just
anyone to be a witness?

229
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:03,322
Since I'm next to Lt. Yeom,
I look so pitiful.

230
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:08,099
Then I'll bow out now.

231
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:21,871
But Cho-rim, are you sure I can do this?

232
00:31:21,871 --> 00:31:24,963
Officer Choi considers you as his confidant.

233
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:26,314
That's why I'm asking you.

234
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:28,709
You'll do it, won't you?

235
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,427
Of course.

236
00:31:30,427 --> 00:31:34,505
Detective Choi Moo-gak is my confidant, too.

237
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:37,849
When I look at Officer Choi and you,

238
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:39,780
I can feel this kind of
friendship between you.

239
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,946
I get envious sometimes.

240
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:43,046
Hearing that makes me happy.

241
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:47,625
When I see how much Detective Choi
loves you, it puts me in a great mood.

242
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:50,547
That's why I like the two of you.

243
00:31:50,547 --> 00:31:52,538
Thank you.

244
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:54,371
Cho-rim, you're so cute, too.

245
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,042
What are you talking about?

246
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:59,264
If I were a man, I would've
already hit on you!

247
00:31:59,264 --> 00:32:01,677
I have an occupational illness.

248
00:32:01,677 --> 00:32:04,621
When I meet a guy, I start profiling him.

249
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:08,430
What he's thinking, what his habits
are and what his traumas are...

250
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,327
Then the guy slowly starts to back away.

251
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:14,395
Back away?

252
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:17,079
Those guys are no good.

253
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:19,288
It's better that you're not seeing them.

254
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:22,410
Cheers.

255
00:32:27,327 --> 00:32:31,643
A witness to your marriage registration? Me?

256
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:34,004
Yes. Cho-rim considers you as her

257
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:36,681
confidant, so I came to ask
you to be a witness.

258
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:39,606
Really?

259
00:32:39,606 --> 00:32:41,331
I'm really jealous.

260
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:45,014
Do you know how much he thinks of Cho-rim?

261
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:50,220
I get so jealous when he scolds
her and worries about her.

262
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,404
It makes me want to get scolded, too.

263
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,289
Congratulations on your
real broadcasting debut.

264
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:56,986
Thank you!

265
00:32:56,986 --> 00:33:00,719
Please know that I'm going to
be a top celebrity soon.

266
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:01,700
Let's go to the shoot.

267
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,045
We should go to the shoot.

268
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:09,993
Officer Choi. Be happy together!

269
00:33:09,993 --> 00:33:13,965
I'm not going to just stand by if
you treat Cho-rim badly.

270
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:18,009
Yes. Good luck!

271
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:24,887
I'm so happy that Woo-yah
has become successful.

272
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:27,959
She had a tough time getting here.

273
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:31,479
I've known her since she was young.

274
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,121
Do I just sign here?

275
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:37,594
Yes. Thank you, sir.

276
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:50,892
Moo-gak. I'm not that educated or smart.

277
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:55,751
But there's something I've learned
while making others laugh.

278
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:59,103
I'm not better than that person.
I'm lower than that person.

279
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:02,465
When I think that way, I was able
to make that person laugh.

280
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:07,801
A fool is funny. Falling is funny.
Talking nonsense is funny.

281
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:10,127
I think that's the reason why.

282
00:34:10,127 --> 00:34:11,635
Yes.

283
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:16,509
Have Cho-rim laugh throughout her life.

284
00:34:16,509 --> 00:34:20,810
Yes. I'll keep that in mind.

285
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:24,726
Thank you.

286
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:29,332
Seo Joo-ahn. Age 63.

287
00:34:29,332 --> 00:34:34,048
He lived here alone and he owns
nine shops near this area.

288
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:37,348
He lived very modestly.

289
00:34:37,348 --> 00:34:39,740
He was well known as a tightwad.

290
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,544
He's estimated to have died within 12 hours.

291
00:34:43,544 --> 00:34:48,228
When I watched the forensics team, there
doesn't seem to be any clues.

292
00:34:48,228 --> 00:34:50,083
This investigation is going to be difficult.

293
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:53,196
We might not be able to see anything
with our eyes,

294
00:34:53,196 --> 00:34:55,625
but the scents might still be left behind.

295
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:58,341
I know, right?

296
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:01,937
If we just had Moo-gak and Cho-rim here...

297
00:35:01,937 --> 00:35:07,532
They're leaving on their honeymoon tomorrow.

298
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:13,860
They're not leaving today, but tomorrow?

299
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:19,196
This is the first time we're coming home
together after registering our marriage.

300
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:22,309
Let's sit.

301
00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:28,415
Then this is the first time sitting together
on the sofa as a married couple.

302
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:32,437
This is our first kiss.

303
00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:39,378
Then I'm going to take my first shower
after becoming a married couple.

304
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:57,012
Who is it?

305
00:35:59,351 --> 00:36:02,422
Inspector Kang, please come in.

306
00:36:02,422 --> 00:36:05,114
Cho-rim. Hi!

307
00:36:05,114 --> 00:36:07,430
What brings you here?

308
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:13,132
Well, I just wanted to see if you two were
doing well since I officiated your wedding.

309
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:15,363
How's married life? It's hard, isn't it?

310
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:17,528
I really don't know since it's only
been a week since we got married.

311
00:36:17,528 --> 00:36:18,488
I'll know after some time.

312
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:20,946
Officer Choi is in the bathroom washing up.

313
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:26,704
Is that right? Then let him wash up.

314
00:36:26,704 --> 00:36:33,738
Actually, I came here to ask you for a favor.

315
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:40,223
My life and my future hang
on the line with this.

316
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:46,210
Cho-rim.

317
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,456
Oh Cho-rim.

318
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:58,858
I'm going somewhere with Inspector Kang.

319
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:01,727
Why?

320
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:03,959
There really is no clue here.

321
00:37:03,959 --> 00:37:07,312
Move aside. Move aside.

322
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:08,488
Madam Cho-rim.

323
00:37:08,488 --> 00:37:09,657
You're here, Madam Cho-rim.

324
00:37:09,657 --> 00:37:11,008
You're both working hard.

325
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:16,870
Cho-rim, just relax and take
a look around once.

326
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:21,623
I'm not even a police officer, so I'm not
sure if I can even investigate like this.

327
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:23,778
What are you talking about?

328
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:25,737
If you want, I can make you into
a police officer any time.

329
00:37:25,737 --> 00:37:30,600
Do you want to?

330
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:43,068
I can see seafood smells over there...
sea squirt, squid and sea cucumber.

331
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:45,565
Detective Yeh.

332
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,516
It's a button.

333
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:01,734
Just as I expected...

334
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:03,927
Seeing that the button doesn't have

335
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:06,347
much dust on it, the button
came off not so long ago.

336
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:08,277
It looks like a woman's button, doesn't it?

337
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:09,626
I have a hunch about a place.

338
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,751
We'll be right back.

339
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:11,589
Alright.

340
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,782
Let's go, Detective Yeh.

341
00:38:12,782 --> 00:38:14,815
Yes. We'll be back.

342
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:18,966
Cho-rim. That's enough. I'll
drive you back, so let's go.

343
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:25,428
Moo-gak even took a shower, so I
don't want him to wait too long.

344
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,118
Should we go?

345
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:30,983
Yes. Let's go.

346
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,592
Sea squirt, squid and sea cucumber...

347
00:38:43,592 --> 00:38:45,908
It's exactly what Cho-rim said.

348
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:47,466
It's Madam Cho-rim now.

349
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:49,142
That's right Madam Cho-rim.

350
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:53,135
We're not open yet.

351
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,397
We're from the southern police precinct.

352
00:39:00,397 --> 00:39:06,852
You know the building owner
Seo Jung-ahn, don't you?

353
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:10,332
This is the same button.

354
00:39:10,332 --> 00:39:17,288
Ma'am. Did you know that a
button came off your clothes?

355
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:21,892
It's this one.

356
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:24,412
We heard that you argued with the

357
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:26,352
building owner several times because
he kept trying to raise the rent.

358
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:29,329
Is that why you killed him?

359
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,633
I'm sorry.

360
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:37,779
Ma'am, I'm putting you under
arrest as a murder suspect.

361
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:42,783
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.

362
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:47,244
I was wrong! I'm sorry!

363
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:58,900
Inspector!

364
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,911
We found it in the garden near the murder
scene just as the lady had confessed.

365
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:06,337
Okay! Great!

366
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,998
Detective Ki, get the fingerprints off of it.

367
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:09,567
Yes, sir.

368
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:12,230
You're too obvious about being happy.

369
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,320
This is all thanks to Madam Cho-rim.

370
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,304
We should treat Madam Cho-rim.

371
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:18,681
Make a reservation for dinner tomorrow.

372
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:21,760
She's leaving on her honeymoon
tomorrow. Let's make it for next time.

373
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,237
That's right.

374
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:27,546
That reminds me of my honeymoon.

375
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:33,818
You have seven children. Aren't you
on your honeymoon all the time?

376
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:40,908
Officer Choi. Officer Choi.

377
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:44,831
Don't copy me.

378
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:48,795
Should I take this bikini or this one piece?

379
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:51,204
Why don't you take both of them?

380
00:40:51,204 --> 00:40:54,602
Both of them?

381
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:58,337
By the way, why are you acting like that?
Are you mad about something?

382
00:40:58,337 --> 00:41:01,942
You went to investigate
all by yourself, right?

383
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:07,976
It wasn't to investigate. I only went
because Inspector Kang made me go.

384
00:41:07,976 --> 00:41:10,836
So did you investigate or not?

385
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,913
I'm not sure if I did.

386
00:41:13,913 --> 00:41:19,072
Did I investigate a little bit?

387
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:24,870
Officer Choi.

388
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:29,751
Don't be mad. You look cute.

389
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:32,199
Really...

390
00:41:32,578 --> 00:41:36,221
You know that I can't investigate
anything without you.

391
00:41:36,221 --> 00:41:38,479
So don't be mean, okay?

392
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,768
What? I'm being mean?

393
00:41:40,768 --> 00:41:42,948
What is it now?

394
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:46,321
I'll show you what being mean looks like.

395
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:47,534
Don't do it. Don't do it.

396
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:51,469
Don't tickle me.

397
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:52,420
Don't!

398
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,284
Okay.

399
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:59,365
Don't do it!

400
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:08,344
After we park the car at the airport,
we'll be on the plane.

401
00:42:08,344 --> 00:42:16,143
After 6 hours, we'll be on our
heavenly honeymoon on a tropical beach.

402
00:42:19,636 --> 00:42:21,438
What is this?

403
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,625
Why is police car following us?

404
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,637
Were you speeding?

405
00:42:25,637 --> 00:42:28,460
No.

406
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,494
Car 519! Stop the car!

407
00:42:31,494 --> 00:42:36,398
Car 519! Stop the car!

408
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:43,993
What is it?

409
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:51,346
Oh my, Detective Ki! Detective Yeh!

410
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:53,881
Madam Cho-rim.

411
00:42:53,881 --> 00:42:59,349
That lady wasn't the murderer!

412
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:01,162
That lady wasn't the murderer?

413
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:04,344
You made a wrong guess about the murderer!

414
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:06,524
I thought she confessed.

415
00:43:06,524 --> 00:43:13,034
That lady's son turned himself in
as the murderer this morning!

416
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:15,765
What is it then? Are you saying that

417
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:17,843
the lady and her son are both
saying that they did it?

418
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:20,252
I think so.

419
00:43:20,252 --> 00:43:22,428
I feel bad for both of them.

420
00:43:22,428 --> 00:43:23,977
What should we do?

421
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:27,884
Then who's the murderer?

422
00:43:36,345 --> 00:43:44,263
Ma'am. I know this is hard,
but I'm going to ask you a few questions.

423
00:43:44,263 --> 00:43:48,046
Your son was with you then, wasn't he?

424
00:43:48,046 --> 00:43:51,478
No. My son wasn't there.

425
00:43:51,478 --> 00:43:54,299
I did it on my own.

426
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,863
Yes. You're right.

427
00:43:55,863 --> 00:43:58,955
You did go there by yourself.

428
00:43:58,955 --> 00:44:05,116
When you went, the building owner was already
dead from a knife stab to his abdomen.

429
00:44:05,116 --> 00:44:08,895
You saw the knife and realized
that your son had done it.

430
00:44:08,895 --> 00:44:13,557
So you took the knife
and threw it in the garden.

431
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:21,570
Ma'am. Your son has to confess to
get a lighter sentence.

432
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:26,461
No! Why are you saying that my son
did it when I'm the one who did it?

433
00:44:26,461 --> 00:44:29,057
I killed him.

434
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:32,070
The answer will be the same no matter
how many times you ask me.

435
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,855
I did it!

436
00:44:36,337 --> 00:44:43,945
I'm sure it's difficult, but I'm going
to ask you a few questions.

437
00:44:43,945 --> 00:44:46,138
Your mother was with you, wasn't she?

438
00:44:46,138 --> 00:44:49,766
No! My mother wasn't there.

439
00:44:49,766 --> 00:44:53,968
My mother made a false confession for me.

440
00:44:53,968 --> 00:44:58,165
The murder weapon is a work knife
used when transporting seafood.

441
00:44:58,165 --> 00:44:59,018
Yes.

442
00:44:59,018 --> 00:45:00,906
Where did you throw away that knife?

443
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:04,495
I don't know. I don't remember.

444
00:45:04,495 --> 00:45:11,038
Who would be in his right mind
after killing someone?

445
00:45:30,383 --> 00:45:35,337
Officer Choi. Detective Choi.

446
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:39,558
Do you want me to call him?

447
00:45:49,508 --> 00:45:52,073
Please wait a moment.

448
00:46:03,478 --> 00:46:04,668
What is it?

449
00:46:04,668 --> 00:46:08,409
Now that I think about it, there was
something strange at the murder scene.

450
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:11,401
Something strange? What was?

451
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,912
There were some strange footprints.

452
00:46:14,912 --> 00:46:16,880
There were sneaker footprints.

453
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,942
But the scent from each
footprint was different.

454
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,439
The scent from the right footprint
I saw was fish scent.

455
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:25,968
The scent from the left footprint
was a strong herbal scent.

456
00:46:25,968 --> 00:46:29,810
The right one had a fish scent and
the left one had an herbal scent?

457
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:32,847
Yes. The right was fish
and the left was herbal.

458
00:46:32,847 --> 00:46:34,932
The right one had a fish scent
and the left one had an herbal scent.

459
00:46:34,932 --> 00:46:41,143
But I can see the herbal scent and the
fish scent from the son's shoes also.

460
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:46,013
What? Then the son is the real murderer.

461
00:46:46,013 --> 00:46:50,835
But the left and right are different.

462
00:46:50,835 --> 00:46:52,541
His left and right are different?

463
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:57,577
That son has an herbal scent on his right
and a fish scent on his left.

464
00:46:57,577 --> 00:47:02,190
So they're completely opposite from the
footprints from the murder scene.

465
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,478
Song Ki-shik, listen to me carefully.

466
00:47:16,478 --> 00:47:18,978
You are not the murderer.

467
00:47:18,978 --> 00:47:20,281
I'm the murderer.

468
00:47:20,281 --> 00:47:21,909
My mom isn't the one.

469
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:25,636
I'm trying to save both you
and your mom right now.

470
00:47:25,636 --> 00:47:32,781
Do you have anyone near you who wears
the same shoes you're wearing now?

471
00:47:32,781 --> 00:47:40,445
Hyun-soo who lived at my house a
little while ago... Kim Hyun-soo.

472
00:47:40,445 --> 00:47:42,887
My mom bought us the same shoes.

473
00:47:42,887 --> 00:47:44,635
Where is Kim Hyun-soo right now?

474
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:51,139
He should be working at an
herbal shop right now.

475
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:58,568
I'll go check.

476
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:01,938
Where is the herbal shop?

477
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:13,201
Medicinal Herb Shop.

478
00:48:13,201 --> 00:48:15,625
Excuse me.

479
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:17,715
Are you Kim Hyun-soo perhaps?

480
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:22,119
Yes, I am.

481
00:48:24,931 --> 00:48:27,986
Please sit down here.

482
00:48:27,986 --> 00:48:31,586
I brought him.

483
00:48:31,586 --> 00:48:36,927
Of the two of you, who is the murderer?

484
00:48:41,977 --> 00:48:48,058
You're under arrest for the suspicion
of murdering Seo Joon-ahn.

485
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:52,541
What evidence do you have to accuse
me as the murderer?

486
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:55,174
Do you have any evidence?

487
00:48:55,174 --> 00:48:57,822
How could my friend be the murderer?

488
00:48:57,822 --> 00:49:01,697
The evidence is that the two of you
are wearing the same sneakers.

489
00:49:01,697 --> 00:49:03,134
What are you talking about?

490
00:49:03,134 --> 00:49:06,456
The sneakers?

491
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:14,970
Here are the cash and gold bars reported
missing from the building owner's house.

492
00:49:19,738 --> 00:49:25,457
Whose house did we get this from?

493
00:49:25,457 --> 00:49:33,889
Here. They were in Kim Hyun-soo's
personal locker at the herbal shop.

494
00:49:38,138 --> 00:49:41,384
Kim Hyun-soo, you were robbing the
building owner's house and came

495
00:49:41,384 --> 00:49:43,310
face-to-face with the owner who had
come back sooner than expected.

496
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:46,656
What are you going? Who are you?

497
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:50,240
You stabbed him with your friend's

498
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,069
knife you had brought from the seafood
restaurant and ran away.

499
00:49:59,071 --> 00:50:01,507
After that, your friend's mother came

500
00:50:01,507 --> 00:50:04,270
to pay the rent and saw the building
owner was stabbed.

501
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:08,523
His mother saw the knife and thought
that her son did it.

502
00:50:08,523 --> 00:50:12,565
The building owner and her son
argued about the rent before.

503
00:50:12,565 --> 00:50:14,650
So she took the knife and threw the

504
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,418
button from her clothing on the
floor to save her son.

505
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:23,810
Kim Hyun-soo, you already made a big mistake
when you went to the building owner's house.

506
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,851
When you were leaving the house,

507
00:50:25,851 --> 00:50:28,255
you made a mistake and put on
your friend's right shoe.

508
00:50:28,255 --> 00:50:32,170
But because you wore the wrong shoe on
your right foot, your left shoe has the

509
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:35,722
scent of herbs and your right foot
has the scent of fish.

510
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:38,568
Your shoes have the same scent even now.

511
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,815
Please show us.

512
00:50:41,815 --> 00:50:43,051
Your left foot.

513
00:50:43,051 --> 00:50:46,016
Your right foot.

514
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:55,608
This evidence shows you are the murderer.
And this is what Inspector Kang thinks.

515
00:50:57,796 --> 00:51:02,299
Arrest him immediately!

516
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:18,505
Mr. Detective, thank you.
Thank you so much.

517
00:51:18,505 --> 00:51:19,899
Thank you.

518
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:21,580
It was nothing.

519
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,296
Come to our restaurant anytime.

520
00:51:23,296 --> 00:51:25,187
We'll treat you.

521
00:51:25,187 --> 00:51:29,638
I heard you saved us. Thank you so much.

522
00:51:29,638 --> 00:51:30,994
It's nothing.

523
00:51:30,994 --> 00:51:35,014
We just couldn't go on our honeymoon.

524
00:51:36,512 --> 00:51:37,533
Let's go.

525
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:38,922
Goodbye.

526
00:51:38,922 --> 00:51:42,915
Thank you.

527
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:51,130
I heard you solved the case, so it
was a good thing.

528
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,414
It was nothing.

529
00:51:52,414 --> 00:51:56,489
Detective Choi Moo-gak, don't you
want to come to our department?

530
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,999
I'll swap you for these two guys instead.

531
00:51:57,999 --> 00:52:00,899
Inspector, are you saying that you're
going to abandon us?

532
00:52:00,899 --> 00:52:05,231
Inspector, where are you
telling us to go now?

533
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:08,391
Let go!

534
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,591
Just go!

535
00:52:10,591 --> 00:52:13,945
I want to be by myself.

536
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,591
Inspector!

537
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:21,990
Let's go.

538
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:24,730
I'm hungry.

539
00:52:25,093 --> 00:52:27,518
This is enough so come and sit down.

540
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:28,586
Let's eat together.

541
00:52:28,586 --> 00:52:31,352
I ate two portions worth while I was cooking.

542
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:33,340
Go ahead and eat a lot.

543
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,961
The fishcake is delicious.
Where did you buy it?

544
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:37,657
The lady from upstairs gave it to me.

545
00:52:37,657 --> 00:52:40,941
I found her car keys in the mailbox for her.

546
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:42,859
The potatoes are so delicious.

547
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:45,302
The lady from downstairs gave it to me.

548
00:52:45,302 --> 00:52:46,981
I caught the college student who

549
00:52:46,981 --> 00:52:48,792
kept littering cigarette butts in front
of the front entrance for her.

550
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,285
The cooked beans are so delicious.

551
00:52:50,285 --> 00:52:52,690
That's from the president of
the women's association.

552
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:53,775
There was a man who kept throwing

553
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:56,197
away his trash illegally and I
caught him for her.

554
00:52:56,197 --> 00:52:59,465
It was a man who lives alone in the
building across from here.

555
00:52:59,465 --> 00:53:01,437
I caught him with the scent of an electronic
cigarette on his garbage bag.

556
00:53:01,437 --> 00:53:04,457
Who gave you the rest of the
side dishes? They're so tasteless!

557
00:53:04,457 --> 00:53:05,970
Everything else was made by me.

558
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,378
Are they really that tasteless?

559
00:53:09,378 --> 00:53:14,450
Cho-rim, we're going on our
honeymoon tomorrow, right?

560
00:53:15,871 --> 00:53:18,218
Inspector Kang.

561
00:53:18,218 --> 00:53:20,614
Why is Inspector Kang calling at this hour?

562
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,885
Is it another case?

563
00:53:21,885 --> 00:53:23,641
Don't answer it. Don't answer it.

564
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:26,946
You're on your vacation anyway.

565
00:53:26,946 --> 00:53:28,887
That's right. I'm on my vacation.

566
00:53:28,887 --> 00:53:32,849
Let's not answer it.

567
00:53:33,283 --> 00:53:34,258
Detective Ki.

568
00:53:34,258 --> 00:53:37,299
Turn off your phone.

569
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,091
What should we do if they find out that

570
00:53:41,091 --> 00:53:43,112
we're going to Thailand for our
honeymoon and come looking for us?

571
00:53:43,112 --> 00:53:44,684
We definitely have to go this time.

572
00:53:44,684 --> 00:53:47,504
Even if they're unreasonable, they
wouldn't go that far, right?

573
00:53:47,504 --> 00:53:51,404
Right? They wouldn't go that far.

574
00:53:51,404 --> 00:53:55,342
Let's pray.

575
00:53:57,552 --> 00:54:00,312
Do we have to go this far?

576
00:54:00,312 --> 00:54:02,122
They're on their honeymoon...

577
00:54:02,122 --> 00:54:07,196
Hey, these innocent people are causing a
ruckus asking us to solve their cases!

578
00:54:07,196 --> 00:54:08,242
Who are we?

579
00:54:08,242 --> 00:54:10,716
Shouldn't we solve their cases for them?

580
00:54:10,716 --> 00:54:13,696
Of course. They can go on
their honeymoon anytime.

581
00:54:13,696 --> 00:54:14,917
That's right!

582
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:16,732
Hey. Let's do this! Let's go!

583
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:24,141
Yes. Both of their phones are turned off.

584
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:27,353
I saw their electricity meter and it
seems no one's home.

585
00:54:27,353 --> 00:54:33,548
It looks as though Choi Moo-gak and Oh
Cho-rim left for the airport already.

586
00:54:33,548 --> 00:54:37,909
I knew they would do that, so I've been
at the airport since early in the

587
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:41,370
morning, but their names are not
on the passenger list.

588
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:46,181
Inspector, I think our
information was leaked.

589
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:51,424
I don't think they're going to
come to the airport!

590
00:54:51,424 --> 00:54:55,187
What? Then are you saying that we don't know
where Choi Moo-gak and Oh Cho-rim are?

591
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:56,873
No!

592
00:54:56,873 --> 00:54:59,608
Arrest the two of them right away...

593
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:04,113
Bring the two of them no matter what!

594
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:08,720
How do you plan to bring them back like that?

595
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,806
Lieutenant Yeom.

596
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,289
Starting today, a special case unit will

597
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:14,324
be established here at the southern
police precinct.

598
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:16,288
A special case unit?

599
00:55:16,288 --> 00:55:21,265
I'm Yeom Mi, the leader of this unit.

600
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:35,139
It's nice to ride a bicycle to
our honeymoon like this.

601
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:38,934
But, I'm a little disappointed that I
didn't get to see you in your swimsuit.

602
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:43,826
That's why I'm bringing this up
because I like bikinis much better.

603
00:55:43,826 --> 00:55:47,733
I'm actually wearing one
under this right now.

604
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:50,990
Really? You're wearing it right now?

605
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:52,507
Let me see.

606
00:55:52,507 --> 00:55:54,119
What are you saying?

607
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,412
What's wrong? We're a married
couple. Let me see.

608
00:55:56,412 --> 00:55:58,144
Right now isn't a good time.

609
00:55:58,144 --> 00:56:00,557
This won't do. Should we ride
our bicycle to Thailand?

610
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,963
What are you talking about?

611
00:56:01,963 --> 00:56:03,690
We're on our way to Thailand...

612
00:56:12,692 --> 00:56:16,483
It's nice.

613
00:56:16,483 --> 00:56:20,223
This moment that I'm with you...

614
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:25,058
This air, this scenery...

615
00:56:25,058 --> 00:56:29,147
I won't forget them for the rest of my life.

616
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,121
Yeah.

617
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:38,451
But why am I crying?

618
00:56:38,451 --> 00:56:41,861
It must be because of the wind.

619
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,713
It's because you're a crybaby.

620
00:56:50,252 --> 00:56:58,126
By the way, you need to call me
something other than Officer Choi.

621
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:07,948
Then choose between honey,
darling or sweetheart.

622
00:57:07,948 --> 00:57:11,839
I love you, honey.

623
00:57:13,147 --> 00:57:16,677
I love you, darling.

624
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:33,857
[Lt. Yeom]

625
00:57:42,021 --> 00:57:44,346
Should we just go and solve the case?

626
00:57:44,346 --> 00:57:45,621
The case?

627
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,212
You told me not to answer the phone.

628
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:52,593
Whose call did you answer?

629
00:57:52,593 --> 00:57:53,526
Who was it from?

630
00:57:53,526 --> 00:57:54,796
Detective Yeh? Detective Ki?

631
00:57:54,796 --> 00:57:56,249
If not, Inspector?

632
00:57:56,249 --> 00:57:57,430
Lieutenant Yeom.

633
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,978
Lieutenant Yeom?

634
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:01,540
A special case unit was established.

635
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:07,615
It's a case about 9 people from a village in
Gangwon province who disappeared all at once.

636
00:58:07,615 --> 00:58:09,548
What in the world?
That doesn't make sense at all.

637
00:58:09,548 --> 00:58:11,704
I know. That makes no sense.

638
00:58:11,704 --> 00:58:15,037
That's nonsense. How can 9 people
disappear from one village?

639
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:16,019
And all at once!

640
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:18,059
I know. I'm really not curious at all.

641
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:20,000
I'm not curious about it at all.

642
00:58:24,695 --> 00:58:28,440
I'm going to turn around.

643
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:31,282
Let's go.

644
00:58:31,282 --> 00:58:33,757
Start.
