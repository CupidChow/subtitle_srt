00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,054
[Officer Choi Moo-gak]

3
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,113
Hello?

4
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:35,137
It's me.

5
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,249
Where are you?

6
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:37,776
Why?

7
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:38,713
Come out.

8
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:39,681
I'm in your neighborhood.

9
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:42,313
Do you know where I am now?
What makes you think that I'm home?

10
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:44,689
Right now, you're eating ramen at home.

11
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:46,776
I can hear the TV sound, too.

12
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:49,545
Come out now.

13
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,659
Is your place far from here?

14
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,155
Did you have to cross
rivers and climb mountains?

15
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:18,971
What's wrong with you?

16
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:24,139
I stopped eating ramen and
came right away because of you!

17
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,523
Why are you looking at me like that?

18
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:35,580
How could you be wasting time like that?

19
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,443
What?

20
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:39,667
What don't you like now?

21
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,723
Aren't we practicing your skit?

22
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:45,667
Didn't you say this is your last chance?

23
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,427
So you're here to practice?

24
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:50,387
Why? You don't want to do it?

25
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:52,071
I can go if you're busy.

26
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,667
It's not that...

27
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:59,491
Since you came all the way here,
we should practice at least.

28
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:00,795
Where should we practice?

29
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:02,187
There?

30
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:03,123
Or there?

31
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:08,515
Didn't you say you had been
eating ramen? Follow me.

32
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:13,963
He always walks away first.

33
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:16,339
Wait for me!

34
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:24,289
So what brings you to Seoul?

35
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:28,705
I brought $20,000 to live in Seoul
like you do!

36
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:34,531
I want to get a place with a
lot of sunlight with this $20,000!

37
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:37,769
I will live in Seoul!

38
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:40,465
Now don't be shocked when I tell you this.

39
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:49,409
With $20,000, you can only get
places that are dark inside!

40
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,201
You must be lying!

41
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:55,425
Everyone here knows that except you!

42
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:57,561
How will you be able
to live in Seoul like that?

43
00:03:57,561 --> 00:04:04,393
I will live in Seoul... no matter what!

44
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,457
Ring me up, please.

45
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:26,009
Someone has already paid for your bill.

46
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:26,993
Pardon?

47
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:32,401
He wanted me to tell you it's okay to live in
the countryside and to keep your head up.

48
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:52,993
I sincerely apologize for being
a burden on the team.

49
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:57,833
I'll pay for my sins.

50
00:04:58,193 --> 00:05:07,337
I thank you for your kindness and
generosity during my time here.

51
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:10,553
I'm really sorry!

52
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:28,209
Detective Choi, thanks for
catching me so quickly.

53
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:31,897
I might have committed
more crimes if you hadn't.

54
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,433
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:41,249
Our time together wasn't long,
but I liked spending time with you.

56
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:44,249
I liked our time, too.

57
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:50,137
May I shake your hand?

58
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:34,945
[Police Identification] [Tak Jae-suk]

59
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:38,276
- Clean up everything.
- Okay.

60
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,142
The personal trainer
murder case is now closed.

61
00:06:46,142 --> 00:06:48,150
It was a copycat crime of
the barcode chain murders

62
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,286
that caused a great deal of
confusion in our investigation.

63
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:56,230
We shall resume the investigation
of the barcode chain murders.

64
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:01,702
Please focus on gathering
evidence for the Joo Ma-ri case.

65
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,462
Let's get moving.

66
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:15,542
This may sound trite, but if you prick her,
not even a drop of blood will come out.

67
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:19,806
I really want to quit right now...

68
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:25,006
but I have to survive until my retirement.

69
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:27,438
Let's move!

70
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:29,164
You got a new car today. Didn't you say
that you'll treat us to lunch?

71
00:07:29,164 --> 00:07:33,748
Hey. Even my Elena Vashilivashivanova
hasn't been in it yet.

72
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:37,540
Let's move then.

73
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,484
You're on the white line.

74
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:52,900
I think you should go more to the right.

75
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,517
Just like that. Straight.

76
00:07:58,517 --> 00:07:59,565
Stop!

77
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:01,613
Okay!

78
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:02,693
Is it okay?

79
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:03,781
Yes.

80
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:07,045
Should I go more to the left?

81
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:08,941
What if others dent my car?

82
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:10,525
This is brand new!

83
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:12,805
Let's be honest. This isn't brand new.

84
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:15,485
You just bought a car
that has 60,000 miles on it.

85
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:16,317
Shall we?

86
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:17,469
Wait!

87
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:18,997
Let me go more to the left.

88
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,581
That's enough, Detective Ki!

89
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:21,365
I heard you!

90
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:22,301
Hey! Don't open the door!

91
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,429
Only open it once I turn off the engine!

92
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:35,965
What is this?

93
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:37,653
The roof!

94
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:40,677
There's a man on the roof!

95
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:44,501
Cordon off this area, Detective Yeh!

96
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:46,813
[10 minutes ago]

97
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:49,477
Thank you for coming. Thank you, come in.

98
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:52,789
Thanks for your invitation, Chef.

99
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:54,909
Welcome. Did you find the place easily?

100
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,749
Of course, thanks to your directions.

101
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:01,005
I was as fast as the wind!

102
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:04,989
What is it, Chef?

103
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:07,973
As fast as the wind...

104
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,189
Please come in.

105
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:11,781
Yes.

106
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:13,997
It's probably going to be so delicious!

107
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:22,837
You can sit here.

108
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:25,886
We don't have much time.

109
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,270
Why isn't our food coming yet?

110
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,470
Please wait here, Cho-rim.

111
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,166
I need to check on the kitchen.

112
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,910
Sure.

113
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:43,326
What are you doing? The guests are waiting.
Why aren't the dishes going out?

114
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:44,862
I haven't received confirmation.

115
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:47,390
Where's your boss? Where is
Chef Hong right now?

116
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,446
He went to the rooftop to get some spices,
but he hasn't come back yet.

117
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:57,574
This isn't my restaurant, but since you're
busy, there's no choice.

118
00:09:57,574 --> 00:10:01,638
Redo these dishes, and these are
fine to go out to the guests.

119
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:04,846
Yes, Chef.

120
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:08,950
Is Chef Hong out of his mind?

121
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,078
Chef Hong!

122
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,934
What are you doing here?

123
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:41,134
Chef Hong!

124
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:03,950
Well... This is...

125
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,238
No one else is here.

126
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:10,750
You've been caught red-handed.
You're under arrest.

127
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,118
W-wait. Listen to me.

128
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,534
That's not how it happened.

129
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:17,856
This area is closed off.
No one gets in or out.

130
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:19,648
This is a murder case. We ask
for your cooperation.

131
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:21,680
Please clear the way! Please!

132
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,792
Chef Kwon!

133
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:30,512
Let's go.

134
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:31,944
Excuse me!

135
00:11:31,944 --> 00:11:35,912
The area is closed off.

136
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:38,232
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:42,562
- It's fine.
- Thank you for your cooperation.

138
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:46,186
Do you know him?

139
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:50,586
Yes. He used to work for me.

140
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,754
He just left my restaurant
and opened his own.

141
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,906
Why did you kill him?

142
00:11:56,906 --> 00:11:58,506
There are marks on his neck.

143
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:04,962
Did you suffocate him and
then push him off the roof?

144
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,170
I refuse to answer.

145
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,050
I need my lawyer.

146
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,402
Okay.

147
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,706
You can call your lawyer
from the police station.

148
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:19,794
Detective Choi.

149
00:12:19,794 --> 00:12:22,482
Yes.

150
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:32,109
I'm so sad.

151
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:48,141
Chef Kwon didn't have
any scent on his hands.

152
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:51,768
So he couldn't have suffocated the victim.

153
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:55,040
It's okay.

154
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:58,552
That's the same scent!

155
00:12:58,552 --> 00:13:01,472
He's the murderer!

156
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,607
Kwon Jae-hee is indeed rich!

157
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:13,224
He told his lawyer to bring
him a change of clothes.

158
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:17,544
I really like his style!

159
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:22,592
I should ask him where he got his
jacket during the interrogation.

160
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,872
Do you think they'll issue
an arrest warrant for him?

161
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,831
Of course they will.

162
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:32,671
He was alone on the rooftop from
which a suffocated corpse fell.

163
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:37,688
A search warrant will be
issued tomorrow morning.

164
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:44,488
I need to see you, Officer Choi.

165
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,568
I was just on the rooftop, Officer Choi.

166
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:57,840
The spices the victim grew
didn't have that scent.

167
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,504
And that scent wasn't on
Chef Kwon's hands either.

168
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:02,975
The scent on the victim's neck
was something very strong.

169
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,234
And I saw the man who had
that scent on his hands!

170
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:07,713
I saw him, too.

171
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:15,473
I clearly saw Chef Kwon's face
staring down on the fallen corpse.

172
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:17,345
This is frustrating!

173
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:19,897
I'm telling you that
Chef Kwon didn't kill him!

174
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:22,874
Chef Kwon's hands
didn't have any scent! None!

175
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,618
He was the only one on the
rooftop when the corpse fell.

176
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:27,049
The evidence is very clear.

177
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:28,353
He really didn't kill him!

178
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:29,706
It's impossible!

179
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:31,529
Just think about it.

180
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:34,815
There was only Chef Kwon
and the victim on the rooftop.

181
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:39,535
As they were arguing, Chef Kwon pushed the
victim toward the edge while choking him.

182
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:43,551
And as the victim lost strength
from being choked,

183
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,495
he couldn't help but fall from the building.

184
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:47,167
That's not it, Officer Choi.

185
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:50,335
Anyway, Chef Kwon is clearly the murderer.

186
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:53,463
So say nothing more about this case.

187
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:54,847
Seriously.

188
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:59,406
I won't tell you more anyway even
if you come back begging!

189
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,486
Another interrogation?

190
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:11,855
Drink it. It's from Oh Cho-rim.

191
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:15,815
From Cho-rim?

192
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:24,799
She told me to take good care of
you since she knows you're innocent.

193
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:31,319
If we don't find anything during the search
of your house tomorrow morning...

194
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:34,662
they won't issue a warrant for your arrest.

195
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:39,215
Please let me know if
there's anything you need.

196
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:44,703
Sure. Thank you, Officer Choi.

197
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:47,447
Right.

198
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,439
Oh Cho-rim was worried about your dog.

199
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:54,111
She's worried about it being alone at home.

200
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,887
Ah, Moongchi...

201
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:27,086
Hey, Moongchi!

202
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:39,119
Long time no see. How have you been?
Do you want to come home with me?

203
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:46,231
This scent is...

204
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:50,527
The scent of Joo Ma-ri's perfume...

205
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:53,815
Right, she was Chef Kwon's girlfriend.

206
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:56,750
I guess it's her souvenirs.

207
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,079
Let's go, Moongchi.

208
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,541
Let's go, Moongchi!

209
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,261
Oh, my!

210
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:11,093
I'm sorry, Cho-rim. Did I startle you?

211
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:12,997
No, it's okay.

212
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:15,077
Are you here for Chef Kwon?

213
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,637
Yes, I heard you're taking Moongchi.

214
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,997
Yes...

215
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,226
Please take good care of Moongchi.

216
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:24,562
I think I'll be here for a while.

217
00:17:24,562 --> 00:17:29,674
I see. Good night then.

218
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:50,181
Dr. Chun...

219
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:55,389
This is very embarrassing, but I
don't have any other choice.

220
00:17:55,389 --> 00:18:00,421
It's okay. Tell me whatever you need.

221
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:11,437
I went a bit overboard while
expanding my business.

222
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:18,861
There are financial statements in my home
that will damage me once the cops see them.

223
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:23,973
Please do me a favor keep them with you.

224
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:36,237
There are three wine boxes next to the sofa.

225
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:42,597
The middle one has the financial reports.

226
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:06,541
Joo Ma-ri's diary.

227
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:12,685
According to her friends, she used this
company's notebooks to write her diary.

228
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,749
Please note this as
you search for the diaries.

229
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:22,181
Before her death, Ms. Joo swallowed
the key to the box that had her diaries.

230
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:25,677
That means she wrote down
the killer's name in her diary.

231
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:29,029
I think we'll find her diaries if
we search Dr. Chun's place.

232
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,286
I don't understand why we
can't get the search warrant.

233
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,166
Because there's no evidence against him.

234
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,966
We must find something first.

235
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,862
When Joo Ma-ri's diaries went missing...

236
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:46,518
people automatically thought
the murderer took them.

237
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,022
Detective, we have the search
warrant for Kwon Jae-hee.

238
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,790
Okay. You can leave it here.

239
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,182
So the person who took the
diaries must be the murderer.

240
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:57,798
We should leave now.

241
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:58,878
There's a designated timeframe.

242
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:04,686
I get it, dude! Now...

243
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:09,295
Let's comb through everything
in Kwon Jae-hee's house.

244
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,615
Let's go.

245
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:31,854
The scent was something like mugwort.

246
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:34,494
But this isn't it either.

247
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,750
Hot, hot, hot!

248
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:48,278
Would you please add more mugwort?

249
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,510
Hello, ma'am.

250
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,086
Hello.

251
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:04,630
That mugwort has a great scent!

252
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:17,470
Geez...it's so heavy.

253
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,454
I've been to every
place that has mugwort,

254
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:22,222
but I can't find that guy.

255
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:26,158
My whole body is aching!

256
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,958
That man...

257
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,310
That man!

258
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:18,672
Who are you?

259
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:51,783
Save me, Officer Choi.

260
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:56,304
I'm being chased by a murderer.

261
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:08,192
Why are you following me around?

262
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:12,479
Do you want to die?

263
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:49,032
Oh Cho-rim! Where are you?

264
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:50,904
It's Officer Choi!

265
00:24:50,904 --> 00:24:52,120
Oh Cho-rim!

266
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,168
Oh Cho-rim!

267
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:15,344
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

268
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:20,009
Let's get out of here.

269
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,064
It's okay.

270
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:40,848
What are you so proud of?

271
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:47,019
This is a job done by trained
policemen and detectives!

272
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:52,747
Do you know how dangerous
it is to chase a suspect?

273
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:57,131
Are you really out of your mind?

274
00:26:57,131 --> 00:27:00,203
According to you, he's a murderer.

275
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:01,915
But you just chased him alone?

276
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:03,147
Are you out of your mind?

277
00:27:03,147 --> 00:27:04,867
He's the murderer!

278
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:07,291
That's why it was even more
dangerous! He killed a man!

279
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,987
Chef Kwon is under arrest for
a crime he didn't commit.

280
00:27:09,987 --> 00:27:11,552
So it was urgent for
me to catch the culprit!

281
00:27:11,552 --> 00:27:17,840
Shouldn't the innocent be
freed as soon as possible?

282
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,856
We're still conducting the investigation.
He'll be free once his innocence is proven.

283
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:35,240
No, thanks. I just ate.

284
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,480
It's mugwort rice cake.

285
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,912
I know what mugwort rice cake is!
But I'm full.

286
00:27:39,912 --> 00:27:46,496
The neck of the victim, Chef Hong,
had the scent of mugwort.

287
00:27:46,952 --> 00:27:48,888
This scent?

288
00:27:48,888 --> 00:27:52,304
It was a scent 20 times
stronger than that right now.

289
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:56,528
The criminal's hands also had the same scent.

290
00:27:56,528 --> 00:28:01,648
So you were following
around the mugwort scent?

291
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:03,704
Don't even get me started.

292
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:05,232
I was at stores that sell
mugwort rice cakes...

293
00:28:05,232 --> 00:28:07,760
Clinics that do mugwort moxibustion...
Mugwort steam baths...

294
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,584
Health stores that sell mugworts...

295
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:12,576
I went to every place that has
some kind of mugwort.

296
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:15,136
But nowhere had a scent that strong.

297
00:28:15,136 --> 00:28:20,782
Okay, enough about mugworts. You can't
just chase after anyone from now on.

298
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,038
Why is he just anyone?
He's the culprit!

299
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,270
I need to go back to the station.
Goodbye.

300
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,308
What? We're in the middle of a conversation.
How can you just leave like that?

301
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:35,540
Don't be too meddling.

302
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,716
What? Meddling?

303
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:44,228
Dang it! This is infuriating!

304
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:49,036
Why am I doing this anyway?
For what glory?

305
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:52,236
Wait a minute.

306
00:28:53,684 --> 00:29:00,076
Rose, lily, freesia, baby's
breath, chrysanthemum...

307
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:04,164
Why are there so many
flower scents on this?

308
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:08,500
Flower shops don't sell mugwort...

309
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:15,724
What? He left already?

310
00:29:15,724 --> 00:29:18,164
Oh Cho-rim!

311
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,644
Look.

312
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:24,956
Here, here, here, and here.
It's all flower scents.

313
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:26,316
What are you talking about?

314
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:29,604
When the criminal held me,
these scents got on my jacket.

315
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:31,308
They were of all kinds of flowers, too.

316
00:29:31,308 --> 00:29:32,636
Got it.

317
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:36,132
Here.

318
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:42,164
Shouldn't you see a
doctor for your wound?

319
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:45,300
Well... It's not that serious.

320
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,996
I think some ointment will suffice.

321
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,814
You think so? That's a relief.

322
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,430
Oh Cho-rim.

323
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,440
Listen carefully.

324
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,638

This is an important case, too. But
what happened with Dr. Chun's alibi?

Dr. Chun Baek-gyung has no family.

He got married 4 years ago, but his wife died
2 1/2 years ago from heart disease.

one of the best hospitals in Korea.

Are you suspicious of something because
Dr. Chun's alibi is in Jeju right now?

357
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,342
Perhaps he went to Jeju to
reminisce about his past?

00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:01,152
The suspect in Joo Ma-ri's
murder case was looking for

483
00:43:01,152 --> 00:43:03,448
the medical records of
the divers' daughter...

484
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:06,216
That murder occurred three years ago.

485
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:12,184
So why was he looking at the
daughter's medical records now?

486
00:43:13,984 --> 00:43:18,256
Choi Eun-seol came up as deceased
when I ran a search with her ID number.

487
00:43:18,256 --> 00:43:23,624
Then why is he looking at
her medical records now?

488
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:31,880
I think we're one piece of
evidence away from arresting Dr. Chun.

489
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:46,413
I thought we wouldn't be able to eat this
because I've been at the police station...

490
00:43:46,413 --> 00:43:48,461
But it still looks pretty fresh.

491
00:43:48,461 --> 00:43:49,541
You're right!

492
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:50,149
Cho-rim?

493
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:51,317
Yes?

494
00:43:51,317 --> 00:43:52,461
Are you okay with steak?

495
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:55,733
Of course! I love steak!

496
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:59,005
I bought these directly from the farm.

497
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:00,781
I'll cook you some incredible steaks.

498
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:02,837
Okay.

499
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:06,445
I heard you believed I was innocent
and worked hard for my release.

500
00:44:06,445 --> 00:44:09,357
Don't mention it.
I didn't do much.

501
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:10,773
Do you need help with this?

502
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,237
No, it's okay.

503
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:12,981
I can do it.

504
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:14,629
You can sit down.

505
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:22,067
I wish Officer Choi could join us.
I guess he's out of luck.

506
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:24,707
I'll take my steak rare.

507
00:44:24,707 --> 00:44:28,043
You want them rare. Okay.

508
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:49,619
[Jeju Baekrok Hospital Murder Case]

509
00:45:02,686 --> 00:45:05,670
Why is it the same name?

510
00:45:08,094 --> 00:45:10,374
Why?

511
00:45:15,258 --> 00:45:21,282
Detective Choi, please put that
case on the big screen.

512
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:25,098
This is my personal file.

513
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:27,994
Please put it up.

514
00:45:39,057 --> 00:45:43,817
Killed from a slit to her throat...

515
00:45:43,817 --> 00:45:45,505
Jeju Island...

516
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:48,466
Her name is Choi Eun-seol,
the same name.

517
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:53,488
Who is she?

518
00:45:53,488 --> 00:45:56,256
She's my younger sister.

519
00:45:59,728 --> 00:46:05,248
I'm sorry. I should've told you earlier.

520
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:08,992
There's something I haven't told you.

521
00:46:08,992 --> 00:46:12,231
Choi Eun-seol, the daughter of
the diver couple,

522
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:17,407
is the only surviving
witness of the serial killer.

523
00:46:22,623 --> 00:46:25,504
I'm so full! I can't eat anymore.

524
00:46:25,504 --> 00:46:26,856
Look at it!

525
00:46:26,856 --> 00:46:27,992
I've brought some desserts.

526
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:29,800
Are you really full?

527
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,136
I'm ashamed of saying this, but women
have a separate stomach for sweets!

528
00:46:35,136 --> 00:46:37,904
Thank you!

529
00:46:38,936 --> 00:46:41,136
Let me see.

530
00:46:44,688 --> 00:46:48,944
This is so delicious! Just my style!

531
00:46:48,944 --> 00:46:50,208
How's your work in the troupe going?

532
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:52,096
Is it fun?

533
00:46:52,096 --> 00:46:54,472
Of course. I can't do it if it's not fun.

534
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:57,816
It's tiring, but it's not like
I make a lot of money.

535
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:00,624
I guess you have a second job then?

536
00:47:00,624 --> 00:47:06,456
Normally I should, but my hours at the troupe
change so often that it's hard to schedule.

537
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:11,448
No employer would be kind
enough to understand.

538
00:47:11,448 --> 00:47:15,400
Would you like to work at my restaurant then?

539
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,128
I'll try to be that nice employer
who's kind enough to understand.

540
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,528
Really?

541
00:47:21,528 --> 00:47:23,152
Yes.

542
00:47:23,152 --> 00:47:26,552
But if you don't work hard,
I'll yell at you.

543
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:31,608
You'll no longer be just a guest.

544
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:35,728
Thank you, boss!

545
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:50,408
So the daughter witnessed the murderer
kidnapping her parents.

546
00:47:50,408 --> 00:47:54,312
The murderer chased after
the girl who ran away...

547
00:47:54,312 --> 00:47:58,120
and she got into a car accident.

548
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,528
After the murderer found out her name
from her belongings back at home,

549
00:48:02,528 --> 00:48:05,744
he went to the emergency
room where the girl was.

550
00:48:05,744 --> 00:48:17,712
And there, he saw the name Choi Eun-seol...

551
00:48:18,288 --> 00:48:22,296
and cruelly slit her throat.

552
00:48:24,088 --> 00:48:30,248
So the murderer mistook
your sister as the witness...

553
00:48:30,248 --> 00:48:33,024
Chun Baek-gyung...

554
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:38,208
Detective Choi!

555
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:45,936
You killed my sister because you
thought she was the witness!

556
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:49,728
Take a good look at my sister
whom you killed, you creep!

557
00:48:49,728 --> 00:48:51,800
She isn't the witness!

558
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,640
She isn't!

559
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,448
Stop it, Detective Choi!

560
00:49:11,645 --> 00:49:12,957
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

561
00:49:12,957 --> 00:49:18,909
The rule that prohibits detectives from
working on cases involving their families...

562
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:22,445
You're the one who mentioned it first.

563
00:49:22,445 --> 00:49:26,173
I really want to solve this case.

564
00:49:26,173 --> 00:49:31,637
So I don't want anything to happen that'll
cause me to lose investigative authority.

565
00:49:32,077 --> 00:49:38,973
I've never heard your sister's story before.

566
00:50:12,629 --> 00:50:15,949
That's Officer Choi's scent.

567
00:50:23,301 --> 00:50:25,213
Why are you hanging out so late?

568
00:50:25,213 --> 00:50:26,925
It's not that late.

569
00:50:26,925 --> 00:50:30,221
I was at Chef Kwon's house.

570
00:50:30,221 --> 00:50:31,293
Why?

571
00:50:31,293 --> 00:50:34,717
I brought his dog back,
so he cooked dinner for me.

572
00:50:34,717 --> 00:50:37,493
He also gave me a job.

573
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,621
You've met your Santa Claus!

574
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:42,269
He is Santa Claus, except he's not that old.

575
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:44,821
Do you how popular he is
among women these days?

576
00:50:44,821 --> 00:50:46,915
Is this the time to be talking about that?

577
00:50:46,915 --> 00:50:52,291
Why? Are you here to practice at this hour?

578
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:57,156
You said you quit drinking after
causing all that trouble before, right?

579
00:50:57,156 --> 00:50:59,027
That's right. I quit drinking.

580
00:50:59,027 --> 00:51:01,899
Why?

581
00:51:01,899 --> 00:51:04,307
If you quit, that's fine.

582
00:51:04,307 --> 00:51:06,812
I guess it's bad for your health anyway.

583
00:51:06,812 --> 00:51:09,549
Why? Do you want to drink?

584
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:12,621
Something bad happened, right?

585
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:14,246
Your complexion sucks.

586
00:51:14,246 --> 00:51:16,837
My complexion sucks?

587
00:51:16,837 --> 00:51:21,349
You should learn how to speak properly.

588
00:51:22,717 --> 00:51:25,797
This was a buy-one-get-one-free item.

589
00:51:25,797 --> 00:51:27,550
They just gave me one
more when I got one.

590
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,061
Here.

591
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:34,701
Wow! How cute!

592
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:36,861
I'll have to pay for this doll with drinks.

593
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:39,213
Let's go.

594
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:41,189
I'll pay for drinks.

595
00:51:41,189 --> 00:51:43,821
But will you be okay?

596
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:45,901
Why are you talking so much today?

597
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:48,044
Stop worrying! Let's just go drink.

598
00:51:48,044 --> 00:51:48,788
We'll drink...

599
00:51:48,788 --> 00:51:51,524
Soju.

600
00:51:52,717 --> 00:51:55,388
Sounds good.

601
00:51:55,388 --> 00:51:57,996
Let's go!

602
00:51:57,996 --> 00:52:01,164
I've been craving soju, too!

603
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:29,236
But did something bad really happen?

604
00:52:33,932 --> 00:52:38,532
You drank a lot already, but you want more?

605
00:53:01,538 --> 00:53:05,842
How did the soup get to the top of your head?

606
00:53:08,234 --> 00:53:10,034
One more soju, please!

607
00:53:10,034 --> 00:53:13,346
Okay!

608
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:22,259
I'm stepping out for a bit.

609
00:53:38,722 --> 00:53:39,738
What is it?

610
00:53:39,738 --> 00:53:43,050
Ae-ri, this is the story
of my friend's friend.

611
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,346
A man and a woman are just acquaintances.

612
00:53:45,346 --> 00:53:50,938
They only shared meals 4 times such as pork
ribs, sushi, fried chicken, and potato stew.

613
00:53:50,938 --> 00:53:52,442
Quite the variety.

614
00:53:52,442 --> 00:53:53,186
And?

615
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:56,970
And then the man gave
the woman a doll as a gift.

616
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:59,098
It's apparently a talking doll.

617
00:53:59,098 --> 00:54:01,178
She said it's pretty cute.

618
00:54:01,178 --> 00:54:02,754
Is this a green light?

619
00:54:02,754 --> 00:54:06,274
So Officer Choi bought you a doll?

620
00:54:07,962 --> 00:54:11,194
You little brat.

621
00:54:36,746 --> 00:54:39,970
Officer Choi...

622
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:43,370
I have something to tell you.

623
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:56,938
Can't I go with you on
your next investigation?

624
00:55:00,378 --> 00:55:03,138
Officer Choi?

625
00:55:16,674 --> 00:55:20,338
Officer Choi...

626
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:30,130
I couldn't sleep for days
because of the pain and agony.

627
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:36,314
Then, I suddenly fainted.

628
00:55:49,034 --> 00:55:50,978
Hello, Eun-seol. It's your brother.

629
00:55:50,978 --> 00:55:53,490
How's everything?

630
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:55,970
I don't know why I'm reminded of this...

631
00:55:55,970 --> 00:56:02,402
We should've had those meat
noodles when you were in Seoul.

632
00:56:04,634 --> 00:56:07,762
I had a younger sister.

633
00:56:07,762 --> 00:56:10,834
Not anymore, though.

634
00:56:20,282 --> 00:56:24,074
Excuse me, but he can't sleep here.

635
00:56:24,074 --> 00:56:27,154
I'm sorry. We'll get going.
