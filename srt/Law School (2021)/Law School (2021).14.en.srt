1
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,452
Is that my son?

2
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,624
Man, look. You found my son!

3
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,794
Hey, let me meet him.

4
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,214
He said not to look for him.
He doesn't have a father like you.

5
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,132
What?

6
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,510
Damn. What?

7
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,971
Just be satisfied with that.

8
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,974
What? With this?

9
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,439
How…

10
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,276
But what about our deal?

11
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,237
He's doing well. Isn't that enough?

12
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,532
As of this moment,

13
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,369
we don't know each other. You got that?

14
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,037
No.

15
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,747
I can't… Let go!

16
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,333
Let go! Damn it!

17
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,918
This isn't what you promised!

18
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,628
Just this photo? That's it?

19
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,967
What about Lee Man-ho?

20
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,972
That jerk…

21
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,601
That jerk…

22
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,812
He's insisting he must meet with you, sir.

23
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,314
Me? Why?

24
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,194
No.

25
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,321
Tell me. Say it!

26
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,781
Tell me!

27
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,327
He said he doesn't know
what he'd blurt out if you refused.

28
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,704
Blurt out what?

29
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,748
He said he'd tell you in person, sir.

30
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,833
That psycho.

31
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,421
I can't believe
you're actually relaying this message.

32
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,217
Who cares what that scumbag says?
Must I deal with his bullshit?

33
00:02:59,012 --> 00:02:59,888
Understood, sir.

34
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,600
He's just a piece of trash
that should've been dumped

35
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,852
a long time ago.

36
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,353
Say it. Tell me!

37
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,938
Step aside. Take him to the OR.

38
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:09,856
Just a moment.

39
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,232
-Take him.
-Tell me.

40
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,109
Just a moment.

41
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,444
-Blood type?
-O-negative.

42
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,196
-Since it's rare--
-I have the same blood type.

43
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,244
The first hearing of Jin,
the first prosecutor who was to be tried

44
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,122
for publicizing facts
about a suspected crime,

45
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,665
ended in less than five minutes

46
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,626
as Jin, the defendant in this case,

47
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,129
has requested a constitutional review
questioning the constitutionality

48
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,882
of Article 126 of the Criminal Code.

49
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:36,841
What?

50
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,302
A constitutional review?

51
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,929
What a bummer.

52
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,597
I expected no less from Jin.

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,058
He's questioning
the constitutionality of the law?

54
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,102
It infringes on the public's right
to know?

55
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,897
So Article 126 of the Criminal Code
is unconstitutional?

56
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,900
If the judge accepts his request,
the trial will be put on hold

57
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,444
-until the Constitutional Court decides.
-Correct.

58
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,785
You can read this together.

59
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,495
You'll find it helpful.

60
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,127
It seemed like
you wanted to be tried in court.

61
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,004
You'll be charged, as you wanted.

62
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,716
Officer Cho did a great job writing
the first draft of the criminal complaint.

63
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,843
He deserves a compliment.

64
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,971
-For real?
-Well, it was…

65
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,722
You can definitely count on Ye-bum.

66
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,682
Seung-jae.

67
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,811
Hey, Seung-jae.

68
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,063
I'll go.

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,443
You drafted the criminal complaint
against me?

70
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,029
I wanted to praise you,
but it was quite disappointing.

71
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,448
You passed the exam,
so I had higher expectations.

72
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,701
You worked so hard

73
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,744
for nothing.

74
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,253
My, this is such a bad photocopy.
It looks terrible.

75
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,881
They're used to the ones that I make,
so they can't read this.

76
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,133
I can read it just fine.

77
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,639
He's obviously determined.

78
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,808
APPLICATION FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW

79
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,354
Guys, I told you to return to the office
immediately.

80
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,939
Do you think you can slack off

81
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,691
-because you think I'm a joke?
-Yes.

82
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,318
Who'd take you seriously?

83
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,403
Jeez, let's go.

84
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,571
Goodness.

85
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,780
Hey, about that…

86
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,244
By the way, where's Prof. Yang?

87
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,189
07P 4295

88
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,691
11:25 A.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020,
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

89
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,610
07P 4295

90
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,698
SEO BYUNG-JU

91
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,909
Hello?

92
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,702
This is Yang Jong-hoon.

93
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,745
Give me a second.

94
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,081
Let me call you back.

95
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,126
YANG JONG-HOON

96
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,338
Now that Joon-hwi knows,

97
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,633
Jong-hoon will also find out soon.

98
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,689
YANG JONG-HOON

99
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,488
You're going to turn yourself in?

100
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,410
Don't you think it's too late for that?

101
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,037
Why didn't you do it

102
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,457
right after the accident
if you were going to do it anyway?

103
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,963
You're right.

104
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:12,014
Then you didn't have to accept my argument
that I was feeble-minded.

105
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,893
But thanks to that,
you became a chief prosecutor.

106
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,853
And the bribes…

107
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,565
I mean, you received that "gift" as well.

108
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,858
Oh, dear.

109
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,656
Right, the reason I wanted
the chief prosecutor title…

110
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,077
I had totally forgotten about it.

111
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,836
I wanted to make sure
shameless scumbags like you

112
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,754
would never be able to disgrace the law.

113
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,339
But look at this.

114
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,511
I should've made you rot in jail forever,
but just to cover up what I did,

115
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,515
I let you stand right before me now.

116
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,190
What about Assemblyman Ko?

117
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,162
Mr. Lee, can you hear me?

118
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,374
Oh, please don't get up.

119
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,375
Doctor!

120
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,587
ECG, SPO2

121
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,797
-It's an arrest.
-Epinephrine, 2ml.

122
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,382
-And the defibrillator.
-Got it.

123
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,675
Undress him. Quick!

124
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,093
Charge to 120 joules.

125
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,137
Cleared. Shock!

126
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,973
Charge to 200 joules.

127
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,850
Cleared. Shock!

128
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,561
One more time. Charge to 200 joules.

129
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,313
Cleared. Shock!

130
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,612
ECG, SPO2

131
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,418
Hurry up, will you? Jeez.

132
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,298
What the hell? What happened?
Who did this?

133
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,635
Crap! I just got my car washed yesterday.

134
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,845
This car should be scrapped, not washed.

135
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,515
He decided to represent Lee Man-ho
knowing the risks

136
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,809
just to put his name on the map
as a lawyer.

137
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,852
So I'm sure he expected this much.

138
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,896
They'd better remember my name after this.

139
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,650
Who's calling? Goodness.

140
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,695
Hello, Lawyer Park Geun-tae speaking.

141
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,321
Yes, speaking.

142
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,031
What?

143
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,914
The disciplinary committee will make
the final decision tomorrow.

144
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,001
You're under investigation
by the prosecution,

145
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,628
so they're leaning toward expulsion.

146
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,008
But I'm going to push
for permanent exclusion.

147
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:58,764
I'm sure you know the difference
between expulsion and permanent exclusion.

148
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,020
It means you can never apply
for law school again.

149
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,151
Right.

150
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:14,405
The fact that you were the culprit
behind such unethical hacking

151
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,492
means that you are not qualified
to work in law.

152
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:20,661
Right.

153
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,332
All right.

154
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,587
You can resent me all you want
for not asking the school for leniency,

155
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,341
but let's keep in touch.

156
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,105
JU-YEONG

157
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,025
Shouldn't you pick it up?

158
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,903
MISSED CALLS

159
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,034
Permanent exclusion
will be deemed excessively harsh,

160
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,788
so it'll be a mitigating factor that could
get you probation instead of jail time.

161
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,250
Prof. Kim used to be a judge,
so she knows the drill.

162
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,044
I guess she was really fond of you.

163
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,758
I came to ask what will happen with me.

164
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,427
My results will also come out tomorrow.

165
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,679
You'll be fine.

166
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,348
I'm not sure.

167
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,435
Unlike you, the professors aren't really
fond of me. So who knows?

168
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,313
I'm off.

169
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,202
STAFF ONLY

170
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,671
You're here.

171
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,922
Because of Lee Man-ho?

172
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,174
He died.

173
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,843
Lee Man-ho is dead?

174
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,136
Who stabbed him?

175
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,721
Ki Du-seong, the guy who stabbed you.

176
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,975
He's also being treated
at this hospital now.

177
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,936
But he said it happened
while he was trying to defend himself

178
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,897
from Lee's attack.
He's insisting he acted in self-defense…

179
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,068
Was he always like that?
Hold grudges and all?

180
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,361
Well, we accused him of murder.

181
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,072
Do you want to see Ki?
You can't, if you go alone.

182
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,617
Lee Man-ho is…

183
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,494
dead?

184
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,710
This is all your fault, Prosecutor Yang.

185
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,463
Because you wanted to know
who ordered me to kill you.

186
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,632
Lee Man-ho was the one
who ordered you to kill me?

187
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,677
That scumbag attacked me
as soon as he arrived in jail

188
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,054
to get back at me for betraying him.

189
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,766
You should've made sure
he would be kept away from me.

190
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,186
That asshole stabbed me,
and I nearly died.

191
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,437
He died.

192
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,108
Lee Man-ho is dead.

193
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,445
Well…

194
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,198
I didn't think he'd even die.

195
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,826
So what?

196
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,120
I felt like he was going to kill me.

197
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,372
He brought it upon himself.

198
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,713
Have you checked whether that's true?

199
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,133
Yes, it is true that Lee
had a knife on him.

200
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,052
Even the last time he was in jail,

201
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,179
he secretly kept a knife
to protect himself.

202
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,181
Although he never attacked anyone then.

203
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,184
He got arrested again
because Ki ratted him out,

204
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,270
so it's understandable
that he had a grudge against Ki…

205
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,364
What? He's dead?

206
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,117
-What about the trial?
-Oh, it ended hours ago.

207
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,078
I guess you didn't see my text yet.

208
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,998
Prosecutor Jin has requested
a constitutional review.

209
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,792
The kids are flipping out.

210
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,211
-But it'll likely be rejected.
-It'll be accepted.

211
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,505
What? It'll be accepted?

212
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,423
Yes, if it's Judge Oh Jun-hyeop.

213
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,341
Goodness.

214
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,345
There you are. I was wondering
why you weren't at the trial.

215
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,515
Sounds like you heard about how it went.

216
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,725
I heard Lee Man-ho is dead.

217
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,185
Go speak with Ki first.

218
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,688
I heard he almost got stabbed first.

219
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,607
If Lee had planned to stab Ki
to get back at him,

220
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,694
then why did he call me right before that
and ask me to visit him?

221
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,611
He did?

222
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,989
He said he'd tell me
who ordered him to kill Seo.

223
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,490
He was ordered to do it?

224
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,160
You've clearly lost your touch
as a prosecutor.

225
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,289
He obviously said that
hoping to get his sentence reduced--

226
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,166
He waged a knife fight
when he wanted a lighter sentence?

227
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,626
In the heat of the moment--

228
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,587
You said the same thing about me.

229
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,966
Don't trust your gut
as it has proved unreliable.

230
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,676
Investigate thoroughly.

231
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,804
Will do.

232
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,348
Ki's room is that way.

233
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,019
Do not miss anything.

234
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,440
It's possible that someone put
both Ki and Lee up to it.

235
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,277
Look, we dropped the charges against you.
Just go teach your students.

236
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,654
-Don't let anyone toy with you.
-Enough.

237
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,947
Don't be like me.

238
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,535
Someone's toying with me now.

239
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,516
Prof. Yang.

240
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,602
I heard Lee Man-ho died.

241
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,979
-Who did this?
-Ki Du-seong.

242
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,233
-Ki Du-seong?
-He claims that Lee tried to kill him.

243
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,569
Why would Lee try to kill him?

244
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,906
According to Ki, Lee was the one
who had ordered him to kill me,

245
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:53,243
but he ratted Lee out.
That's why Lee wanted him dead.

246
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,496
Jeez, I don't believe that.

247
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,707
Ki Du-seong lies every time
he opens his mouth.

248
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,335
That sly jerk has even tried to manipulate
his attorney.

249
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,753
What?

250
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,214
I'm being bashed for representing Lee,

251
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,549
but Ki's become a hero.

252
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,718
I heard you visited Lee in prison.

253
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,430
Yes, once. But…

254
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,765
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

255
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,267
About that… Hey, Sol.

256
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,228
Tell him about our visit.

257
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,646
This is an important call.

258
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,273
Park Geun-tae speaking.

259
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,610
He's not at the academy?

260
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,487
Right.

261
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,199
Are you relieved now that
you don't have to defend a criminal?

262
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,831
People are petitioning the Blue House

263
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,126
for the legitimacy
of my self-defense argument, I hear.

264
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,337
Because I gave Lee Man-ho the punishment
he deserved,

265
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,840
which the law had failed to do.

266
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,883
Are you sure he attacked you first?

267
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:54,930
Jeez, can you not gauge the situation?
Public opinion is already on my side.

268
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,934
Don't waste your time checking the facts.

269
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:03,105
Just admit that I acted in self-defense
so we can be heroes together.

270
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,482
You're the one
who can't gauge the situation.

271
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,319
If you're going to pull this on me,
I must dig and check the facts.

272
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,490
It's no fun to be toyed around with
in the court of public opinion.

273
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,128
Is Prosecutor Jin just lucky or what?

274
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,088
Judge Oh's doctoral thesis.

275
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,339
OH JUN-HYEOP

276
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,008
DOCTORAL THESIS

277
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,386
"The law on publication of facts
of suspected crime should be abolished."

278
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,972
It's almost identical
to Prosecutor Jin's argument.

279
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,685
-Can't we request a new judge?
-It's not related to the case.

280
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,855
It's just the judge's opinion,
so the request won't be accepted.

281
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,649
Then what now?

282
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,737
Prosecutor Jin's request will probably
be accepted since they agree on this.

283
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,782
Then the trial will be put on hold
until the Constitutional Court

284
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,033
makes its decision.

285
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,035
That's right.

286
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,745
Talk about a string of bad luck.

287
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,084
-And the thesis advisor was…
-Prof. Kang Ju-man.

288
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,295
It was my dad.

289
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,654
He asked me if I was relieved now
that I don't have to defend a criminal.

290
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,302
You should've snapped at him and asked,
"Must you make me feel even worse?"

291
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,429
I thought I'd be relieved.

292
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,809
I am relieved.
He never repented, even post-release.

293
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,771
What's with that conflicted look?

294
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:12,192
Shouldn't we tell his son?
I mean, his father died.

295
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,611
His son?

296
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,281
He was looking for his son.

297
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,575
That's why he moved to my area.

298
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,493
I thought you were looking for your son.

299
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,287
And you wanted him to see this?

300
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,371
My gosh!

301
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,383
Why don't you just bring me the photo?

302
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,302
Photo?

303
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,305
-What photo?
-Let me use your phone.

304
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,183
You know phones aren't allowed in here.

305
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,601
-Darn it.
-Oh, right.

306
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,312
They knew we were visiting you,
so they were extra strict.

307
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,731
They're usually not like this
with attorneys.

308
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,982
Who do you need to call?

309
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,526
Choi Jae-cheol?

310
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,279
He got out on bail.

311
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,032
His big shot lawyers
showcased his repentance

312
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,992
and his contribution to catching you.

313
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,410
Damn it!

314
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,330
Let me make a quick call.
Hand me your phone!

315
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,956
We don't have our phones now!

316
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,874
No.

317
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,085
That scumbag.

318
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,004
Bastard…

319
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,924
Get me the photo.

320
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,508
Now.

321
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,720
The photo of my son.

322
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,972
-Photo of his son?
-Yes.

323
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,933
I think it was a recent photo.

324
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,686
That means the person who gave it to him
knows where his son is now.

325
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,814
Right, the person who gave him the photo
must know.

326
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,028
Guys, did you hear?

327
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,240
Lee Man-ho. He's dead.
It's all over the Internet.

328
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,700
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

329
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,538
Professor, about Lee Man-ho…

330
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,332
Even if Ki had betrayed him,

331
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,960
he would've never caused
such trouble in jail.

332
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:08,976
SON

333
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,311
This is his son.

334
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,564
I found it at his place.

335
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,317
Look at the date on it.
It was taken recently.

336
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,528
He would've behaved himself for his son.

337
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,197
If anything,
he would've begged you to help him

338
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,491
get his sentence reduced
like you did with Ki.

339
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,076
I wonder who gave him this.

340
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,037
There's something strange.
I called Detective Oh on my way here.

341
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,832
He said they didn't find the photo
when searching his home.

342
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,919
The person who gave him this photo
must be very thorough.

343
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:40,507
I got the impression that he wanted
to call the person who gave him the photo.

344
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,802
The moment I saw this photo,
I realized my hunch was wrong.

345
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:47,556
I think he killed my uncle
and tried to kill you as well

346
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,309
because someone put him up to it.

347
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,810
Someone ordered him to do it.

348
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,646
And you think Lee's son was the reason
why he did it?

349
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,774
What if the person who gave him the photo
used his son to--

350
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,359
To instigate him?

351
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,610
-I think so.
-I think so.

352
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,656
Who would've been most shocked
had your uncle turned himself in?

353
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,657
Me.

354
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,034
And you.

355
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,994
Who would've taken the biggest hit?

356
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,621
The person who used Lee's son…

357
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,040
To instigate Lee.

358
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,584
Then got rid of Lee,
who could pose a threat later on.

359
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,377
-Who could it be?
-Who could it be?

360
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,508
07P 4295

361
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,974
07P 4295

362
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,730
07P 4295

363
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,368
The kid didn't die on the spot.
He was still alive after the accident.

364
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,370
From the standpoint
of criminal psychology,

365
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:56,500
don't you think he would've instinctively
got out of the car and checked the boy?

366
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,168
Right, that's true.

367
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,670
Most people would get out and check first.

368
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,549
How did I miss that?

369
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,633
Hey, it's me.

370
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,510
It's me.

371
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,012
Joon-hwi.

372
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,931
You scared me!

373
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,518
What's going on? What are you doing here?

374
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,397
I was hoping to find clues.

375
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,191
Have you found anything?

376
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,192
No, nothing.

377
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,029
What about you? What are you doing here?

378
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,948
What? Oh…

379
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,409
Don't tell me you're here for the photo
of Lee's son,

380
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,452
which even the cops have failed to find.

381
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,288
Of course not.

382
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,373
I was looking for you.

383
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,084
To ask you something.

384
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,255
Me? This late? You knew I was here?

385
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,549
You even have the flashlight on.

386
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,844
The fact that someone took the photo
after giving it to him

387
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,430
means that the person
doesn't want to be exposed.

388
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:37,142
If this person had something to do
with the hit-and-run as well,

389
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,436
maybe this person was in the car too.

390
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,608
Someone who would've taken the biggest hit
had my uncle turned himself in.

391
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,694
Do you know if someone else
was in the car with him?

392
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,531
If we know where Prof. Seo was
before the accident…

393
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,909
Fellow passenger.

394
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,369
Why did you do that?

395
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,212
I was on my way back from a funeral.

396
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,006
The funeral.

397
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,301
Why didn't I think of that?

398
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,936
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

399
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,145
Is everything okay?

400
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,521
SEORIN INC.

401
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,151
My uncle hated people who drink and drive.

402
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,570
There must've been a reason
why he drove that night.

403
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,530
Maybe he had to give someone a ride.

404
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,782
IPG KOREA CEO KIM TAE-EON

405
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,625
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

406
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,835
"Let me leave this hell."

407
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,088
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

408
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,131
"Let me"?

409
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,010
How come it's not "I want to"
or "I will leave this hell"?

410
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,805
Let me leave this room.

411
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,848
Then what about me?

412
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,393
Someone else was in the car.

413
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,228
Another passenger…

414
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,900
M, A, T, E

415
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,194
"M, A, T, E." Ko Hyeong-su, perhaps?

416
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,572
The accident occurred
in Jurae-dong, right?

417
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,949
That's his district.

ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

420
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,877
KO HYEONG-SU

421
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,593
What brings you here at this hour?

422
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:41,182
I heard you almost got attacked
by Lee Man-ho.

423
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,268
Why do you think he died?

424
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,229
Lee Man-ho?

425
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,898
He got the punishment he deserved.

426
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,068
He killed my dear mate

427
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,779
and even tried to frame you
for the murder.

428
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,699
But now that he's been busted--

429
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,119
Do you know that he was looking
for his son?

430
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,372
Let go! Damn it!
This isn't what you promised!

431
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,709
Are you interrogating me now?

432
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,545
For thinking you were the killer?

433
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,756
Apparently, someone else was in the car

434
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,425
with your dear mate on the night

435
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,553
the Jurae-dong hit-and-run accident
took place.

436
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,183
Someone else was in the car?

437
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,396
What?

438
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,482
Are you hoping it was me?

439
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,195
You're barking up the wrong tree.

440
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,991
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I have an important meeting.

441
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,290
You see, the Seo Byung-ju I knew

442
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,170
would've never driven off like that
after hitting a kid with his car.

443
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:56,091
55J 5757

444
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,677
He certainly would not have
just fled the scene

445
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,722
if he got out to check and saw
that the boy was still alive.

446
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,183
So what's your point?

447
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,937
55J 5757

448
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,442
Unless someone in the car
told him not to get out.

449
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,532
Right.

450
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,034
So don't waste your time here.

451
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,579
Go catch that person.

452
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,581
Okay?

453
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,636
So you believe someone else
was in the car with him.

454
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,388
Are you sure though?

455
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,029
HAN JOON-HWI

456
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,124
I'm sorry, sir.

457
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,001
MAY 7, 2020, 5 MONTHS BEFORE THE INCIDENT

458
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,085
What's your problem?

459
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,757
55J 5757

460
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,758
Who are you?

461
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:25,680
I'm Lee Man-ho,
Prof. Seo Byung-ju's new driver.

462
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:32,020
I'd like to speak with you
regarding the hit-and-run case.

463
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,191
I'll take you to your destination
safe and sound.

464
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,737
It's okay.

465
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,405
Just call it a day.

466
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,242
55J 5757

467
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:01,216
I couldn't steal the original file,
so I made a copy in secret.

468
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,887
It's the dashcam footage
of the Jurae-dong hit-and-run.

469
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,599
He scrapped the car,

470
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,521
but has secretly kept the footage
for some reason.

471
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,648
What hit-and-run?

472
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,361
You know that Mr. Seo caused a hit-and-run

473
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,780
in Jurae-dong a while back.

474
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,410
I know that you know about the accident.

475
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,789
It's all recorded in that footage.

476
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,086
What do you want?

477
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,103
If someone else was in the car,
find out who--

478
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,523
Did you attend a funeral
on September 10th, 2008?

479
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,024
How many years ago was that?

480
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,568
How would I remember?

481
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,112
Are you afraid it'd raise suspicion
if you remembered?

482
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,029
What?

483
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,074
This nutjob.

484
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:12,287
If someone else was in the car with him,
I want to know who it was!

485
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,980
I asked you all to gather at the scene
of Prof. Seo's murder

486
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,232
so we can take one step closer
to the truth

487
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,777
behind the death of Lee Man-ho
as well as the hit-and-run case.

488
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,906
Prof. Seo was the driver
in the hit-and-run.

489
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,491
But someone else was in the car with him.

490
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,161
Lee Man-ho was the only person
who knew about it,

491
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,122
and he had some kind of deal
with that person.

492
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,708
Then they had a falling-out
for some reason,

493
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,461
and if that person ordered
the murder of Lee Man-ho…

494
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,171
Sounds like we're speculating here.

495
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,797
Do we have evidence?

496
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,341
-Let's find it.
-Let's find it.

497
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,551
Jinx! You guys… Sorry.

498
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,095
If someone else was in the car with him,

499
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,765
then the hit-and-run is still
an unsolved case. Solve it.

500
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,106
If Prof. Seo was on his way home
from a funeral,

501
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,859
they must've gone to the funeral together
or met there.

502
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,403
A funeral.
Then shouldn't there be a guest book?

503
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,988
That's right!

504
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,491
The person's name must be
in the guest book.

505
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,285
-Nice one, Ye-seul.
-You're right.

506
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,455
-Going through the names in it--
-But whose funeral?

507
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,083
SHIN WOO-SEOP

508
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,128
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, SHIN WOO-SEOP

509
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,338
SHIN WOO-SEOP

510
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,924
DECEASED SEPTEMBER 9, 2008

511
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,259
An endocrinologist
at Hankuk University Hospital.

512
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,261
It was his middle school friend's funeral.

513
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,389
Right, Ko went to the same middle school.

514
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,641
If they signed the guest book
on the same day…

515
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,018
Then I'd say it's highly likely.

516
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,357
Detective Oh, I have a favor to ask
regarding the hit-and-run case.

517
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,659
Yes, they're after
the funeral guest book now.

518
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,621
If both of them signed the guest book
on the same day…

519
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,208
Guest book? Whose funeral?

520
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,670
I'll call you back.

521
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:37,557
I hear that Yang Jong-hoon is suspicious
of Lee Man-ho's death?

522
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,268
He mentioned the possibility that

523
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,062
both Lee and Ki were ordered to do
what they did.

524
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,440
He said the person behind it
is toying with him.

525
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,816
"Toying with him"?

526
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,443
That nutjob.

527
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,822
He's digging into the hit-and-run again
with his students.

528
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,616
They're trying to find out if someone else

529
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,910
was in the car with Seo that night.

530
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,455
What's with that tone?
Do you think I was with him?

531
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,043
You're a presidential candidate.

532
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,128
If you aided and abetted
a DUI hit-and-run…

533
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,756
I went to the funeral
the day before the accident.

534
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:15,720
Yang Jong-hoon, that nutjob.
He still thinks he's a prosecutor.

535
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,722
How dare he try to sound me out?

536
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,808
There's no way someone else
was in the car.

537
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,935
I'm having a hard time believing

538
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,606
that Byung-ju committed a DUI.
And he was giving someone a ride? No way.

539
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,610
Just accept Ki's claim

540
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,031
that he acted in self-defense
and close the case.

541
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,116
Self-defense? That's--

542
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,285
Just give the public what they want.

543
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,415
Earn their support now
so you can be better prepared

544
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,502
when you get into politics down the road.

545
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,134
Right, that reminds me.

546
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,763
I'll make sure your request gets accepted

547
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,058
so you can defend yourself
in the Constitutional Court soon.

548
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,768
Just be prepared.

549
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,523
I also plan to propose the bill to abolish
the law on publication of suspected crime.

550
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,609
Thank you, sir.

551
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,612
Don't mention it.
That's what friends are for.

552
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,618
55J 5757

553
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,789
It's me.

554
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,709
Remember Shin Woo-seop,
my friend who died in 2008?

555
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,211
Call his wife.

556
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:39,095
OFFICER CHO YE-BUM

557
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,860
Life feels so futile.

558
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,572
He was a doctor.
Who knew he'd be the first one to die?

559
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:04,245
Gosh, they had such strong liquors
at the funeral.

560
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,504
We should've called a driver.

561
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,508
I told you that I couldn't wait for one.

562
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,552
This is my district.
I know this area well.

563
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,721
They never look for drunk drivers
on this road.

564
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:25,558
-I don't want to see you again.
-Goodness. Why are you so on edge?

565
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,896
This meeting is very important.
I can't be late.

566
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,231
Help me out just this once.

567
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,155
Yeah, I'm on my way!

568
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,284
07P 4295

569
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,707
If we get stopped, I'll deal with it.
Just hit the gas.

570
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,667
07P 4295

571
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,307
07P 4295

572
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,322
Let's just go.

573
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,076
Go. Now!

574
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,955
You don't want to ruin your life, do you?
Go. Just go!

575
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,298
07P 4295

576
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,639
This area is being redeveloped,

577
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,099
so there are no cameras here.

578
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,560
That was not caught on camera.

579
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,440
Hey, have you gone mad?

580
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,859
We should go back.

581
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,696
-Let go!
-Hey, no! Don't!

582
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,739
-Let go!
-Hey, listen to me!

583
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,701
We can't go back there now!

584
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,830
Byung-ju!

585
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,003
07P 4295

586
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,509
Byung-ju, get it together.

587
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,472
I must go back there.

588
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,016
You drank and drove.

589
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,311
And if that kid is dead,
you'll go to jail.

590
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,104
Do you want to die?

591
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,441
Prosecutors who end up in jail
get tortured by inmates.

592
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,032
What about your family?
What will happen to them?

593
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,337
Get out.

594
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,213
I'll drive.

595
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,883
You didn't see anything, okay?

596
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,801
Get out. Now!

597
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,386
07P 4295

598
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,515
07P 4295

599
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,025
Sir, should I take you home?

600
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,735
No.

601
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,404
I'll go to the hospital
to see Yeong-chang.

602
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,739
Yes, sir.

603
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,621
-Jeon Ye-seul!
-Answer my question.

604
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,541
Did your dad order you
to make me lie in court?

605
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,752
Don't drag my dad into this.

606
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,046
Soon, he'll have command
over the entire country.

607
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:42,963
Is that why

608
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,591
he tried to control me as well?

609
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,844
Come to your senses, will you?

610
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,472
You're a nobody.
Who cares that he tried to control--

611
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,598
Take care.

612
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,894
Hey.

613
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,146
Hey! Damn it!

614
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,189
God damn it!

615
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:15,204
The disciplinary committee
just made its final decision.

616
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:21,544
Winning the dissertation contest
did not affect your admission.

617
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,380
And it happened before you were admitted,

618
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,509
so the school has decided not to take
disciplinary action against you.

619
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,846
But Mr. Kang feels responsible
for what happened

620
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,682
and keeps insisting that he should resign.

621
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,601
I don't think I can stop him.

622
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,692
DOCTORAL THESIS

623
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,902
JUNE 2018 OH JUN-HYEOP

624
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,364
You haven't published this, have you?

625
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,323
KANG JU-MAN

626
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,159
No, why do you ask?

627
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,203
Can Sol use this?

628
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,873
For the Asia Human Rights
Dissertation Contest.

629
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,708
Don't touch my laptop.

630
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,752
-She should write it on her own.
-She doesn't have time.

631
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,130
She has a lot to do
to prepare for law school.

632
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,047
Then don't bother.

633
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,216
You can't even do that for your daughter?

634
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,051
-Honey.
-Forget it, Mom.

635
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,179
I don't agree with Dad anyway.

636
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:18,309
I don't think Article 126
of the Criminal Code is unconstitutional.

637
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,438
I was wondering
why you weren't publishing it.

638
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,777
PUBLICIZING CRIMINAL CHARGES
AND THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW

639
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,863
Looks like you let your student use it.

640
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:31,822
No.

641
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,075
Judge Oh Jun-hyeop

642
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,077
wrote it on his own.

643
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,038
I was his advisor.

644
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,540
So it'll go to the Constitutional Court.

645
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,173
DECISION

646
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,674
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

647
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,551
CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW REQUEST ACCEPTED

648
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,386
I'm going to help Ji-ho.

649
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,307
I'll prove that it's constitutional.

650
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:05,272
You were his advisor,
so you'll argue it's unconstitutional.

651
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,445
If I win,

652
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,367
think about why you must do this
and reconsider your decision.

653
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,788
-Sol.
-If I lose, I'll do the same,

654
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,499
and think about why you must do this.

655
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,934
About Judge Oh Jun-hyeop…

656
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,396
He and I share the exact same view
on Article 126.

657
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,231
The similarity is truly striking.

658
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,899
Look at this.

659
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,944
This sentence is exactly the same
as what I wrote.

660
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:52,945
Happy now?

661
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,072
Me?

662
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,578
The trial has been put on hold,
but it doesn't mean I won.

663
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,164
First, I shall skillfully handle
the Constitutional Court.

664
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,961
But I am excited.

665
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,716
Thanks to this,
I may end up writing a new history

666
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,552
of the Criminal Procedure Act
and the Criminal Code.

667
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,638
"A new history"?

668
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,350
Someone died because of the info
you had leaked.

669
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,185
Your dad? That wasn't my fault.

670
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,897
Toxic chemicals in toys
pose a serious threat to kids' health.

671
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,359
When I heard that cancer-causing chemicals
were found in the toy,

672
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,695
I had to inform the public
before its launch.

673
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,282
What about the truth? You said he died
without knowing the truth.

674
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,827
Because of I-bit CEO Cho Tae-yeong
and Ko Hyeong-su,

675
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,706
you didn't verify whether it was true
even though you were a prosecutor.

676
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,417
-If you'd done--
-What's the use of talking about it now?

677
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:53,005
If it's ruled unconstitutional,
all of that is pointless.

678
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,471
A new history…

679
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,141
You will write one.

680
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,979
I'll make you become the first prosecutor
to be charged

681
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,358
and punished for publicizing
a suspected crime.

682
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,527
And you'll have to live with that
until you die.

683
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,286
You know, Prof. Kang Ju-man who testified.

684
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,288
The renowned constitutional law scholar.

685
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,666
I think he supports my argument.

686
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,085
Tell him I'll visit him soon.

687
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:38,133
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

688
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,936
I met with Shin Woo-seop's wife.
She lost the guest book while moving.

689
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,063
But she remembered

690
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:54,316
that Prosecutor Seo and Assemblyman Ko
didn't come on the same day.

691
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,401
Really?

692
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,362
She remembers that?
It was over a decade ago.

693
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,156
It was her husband's funeral, after all.

694
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,575
Can you see if you can find
my uncle's friends

695
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,371
who were at the funeral that day
and also knows Assemblyman Ko?

696
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,582
It's not easy to track down the guests
without the guest book.

697
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,168
We jumped through hoops
to track down a few.

698
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,505
Three of Seo's friends
who were at the funeral with him.

699
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,465
But they're giving doubtful answers.

700
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,552
JURAE-DONG HIT-AND-RUN CASE

701
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,429
2008-GD3912

702
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,763
I asked him to join.

703
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,723
We owe you one anyway.

704
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,935
Not anymore.
I testified against Prosecutor Jin.

705
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,438
Prosecutor Jin, that man…

706
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:37,359
Who knew he'd try
to get the law itself abolished? Jeez.

707
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,820
Darn it.
What if they have it out for me now?

708
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,573
Let's hear the "doubtful" answers.

709
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,744
Well, they all went
to middle school together.

710
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,706
Two of them said they only saw Seo
at the funeral,

711
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:55,752
but one of them said Seo and Ko
drank together that day.

712
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,171
They drank together?

713
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,673
He has early-stage Alzheimer's.

714
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:04,052
But the thing is, the two who said
they only saw Seo that day

715
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:08,182
are both saying Ko came the day before
as if they've signed a pact.

716
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,186
They also said Seo and Ko
weren't even that close.

717
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,523
I wonder how they remember something
from over a decade ago so vividly.

718
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,110
They didn't even hesitate
and sounded very sure.

719
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,613
Maybe Assemblyman Ko contacted them
before you did.

720
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,574
All his friends who saw him
and my uncle that day.

721
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:30,245
If he did, that means
he knew what we were up to.

722
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,207
What? So even Ko Hyeong-su
has it out for me now?

723
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,422
COMPLAINT
JEON YE-SEUL

724
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,673
Could you submit this?

725
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,889
"Bodily harm, sexual assault,
unlawful surveillance"?

726
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,225
You'll file charges against Yeong-chang?

727
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,685
Even for incitement to perjury?

728
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:57,231
But you didn't actually commit perjury.

729
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:01,026
But it can be punished if the attempt
reached commencement stage.

730
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:04,655
No, that does not apply to perjury.

731
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,534
Oh, how about coercion?
She was coerced into perjuring herself.

732
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,619
That and attempted perjury.

733
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,580
What was the article number?

734
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,042
Joon-hwi and Ji-ho would know it by heart.

735
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,253
They have all articles and sections
memorized.

736
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,754
So do I.

737
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,881
Coercion,
Article 234 of the Criminal Code.

738
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,216
It's 324.

739
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,304
Well, anyway, we may be able to get him
charged with attempted coercion.

740
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,806
I'll look into it.

741
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,684
I want to get Assemblyman Ko too,
for inciting coercion.

742
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:36,937
Assemblyman Ko?

743
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:43,110
Do you have to do that?

744
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:49,825
Enjoy.

745
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,326
Let's eat.

746
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,371
I heard you never eat with your students.

747
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,540
You're no longer one, as of today.

748
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,750
Right.

749
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,503
I've been permanently excluded.

750
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,380
Mix it.

751
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,844
-One jjamppong, please.
-Sure.

752
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,017
You should ask him too.

753
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,935
REQUEST FOR SPECIAL DEFENSE COUNSEL

754
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,813
Prosecutor Jin wants me to testify.

755
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,273
Really?

756
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,902
Right, you don't deserve an attorney.

757
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:27,863
You're on your own.

758
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,781
Be prepared for the witness examination.

759
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,243
My answers may help you or be used
against you depending on your questions.

760
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,162
Yes, sir.

761
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,337
I'll eat this because
Seung-jae ordered it for us,

762
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,881
but I feel bad knowing he got expelled.

763
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,341
Don't want it? I'll eat it.

764
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:51,011
-Let me try the jjajangmyeon.
-Hey, I never said I didn't want it.

765
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,180
Nice.

766
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,142
The guest book info got leaked.

767
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,062
Who leaked it?

768
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,064
Oh, where's mine?

769
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,691
I want lots of pickled radish.

770
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,986
What's going on?

771
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,529
There's a rat among us.

772
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,530
A rat?

773
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,742
Just confess. Let's not waste time.

774
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,869
"Confess"? Come on.

775
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,579
That's not necessary.

776
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,415
As long as the person switches sides now.

777
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,627
Everyone here will be in this together
until the very end.

778
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,422
Even if they signed the guest book
on the same day,

779
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,217
it doesn't prove that
they were in the car together.

780
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,929
Unless someone witnessed Ko
getting into Prof. Seo's car.

781
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,014
The cops said they'd look into it.

782
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,475
The dashcam footage from the car
would be solid evidence.

783
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,770
Prof. Seo probably got rid of it
for that very reason.

784
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:45,357
That's the first thing I'd get rid of
if I were in his situation.

785
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,567
Hey, I told you not to pour the sauce
over it.

786
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,236
Only you like to eat it that way.

787
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,406
I like it too. We'll pour it on this one.

788
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:57,411
Come on.

789
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,914
Was I too harsh
when I said he's on his own?

790
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,416
You can represent him.

791
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,585
Well, I don't feel confident
that I can do as well as you did.

792
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:12,008
Oh, Attorney Park Geun-tae called me.

793
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,429
Looks like Ye-seul has toughened up.
She's filing charges.

794
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,809
Well, about the deaths of Seo Byung-ju
and Lee Man-ho,

795
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,395
I think they're both connected
to Lee's son.

796
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,899
Remember? I was fuming mad that day.

797
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,445
When your son asked what you were up to,

798
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:35,198
you should've stopped
your atrocious action then and there.

799
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,661
I couldn't believe he still did it
after talking to his son on the phone.

800
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,164
What are you trying to say?

801
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,982
This is his son.

802
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,071
YU SEUNG-JAE

803
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,157
SEO JI-HO

804
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,241
MIN BOK-GI

805
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,006
Come take a seat.

806
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,677
Is this your first time here?

807
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,096
-Yes, sir.
-I see.

808
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,478
The vice dean, who had your back,
has resigned,

809
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,606
and Yang Jong-hoon has returned to school.

810
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,692
I bet you're not pleased, Prof. Jung.

811
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,905
I'd like to…

812
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:01,201
help you out and give you
all the support you need.

813
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:04,871
KANG SOL

814
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,710
DAUGHTER OF VICE DEAN KANG JU-MAN
ACCUSED OF PLAGIARISM

815
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,546
This is…

816
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,881
She needs to be taught a lesson.

817
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,717
She's the biggest troublemaker
at Hankuk Law.

818
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:20,720
Right.

819
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,515
But the dean is very protective of her.

820
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:28,144
The dean?
She'll be gone after her two-year tenure.

821
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,648
The president is the one
with the real power.

822
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:33,900
Speak of the devil!

823
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,072
Sit, it's okay.

824
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,615
Yes, sir.

825
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:48,290
Prof. Jung Dae-hyeon here
will teach those troublemakers

826
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,791
a serious lesson.

827
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,717
KANG SOL

828
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,634
NAME
DATE OF BIRTH

829
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,729
Good luck.

830
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,733
I'll do my very best.

831
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,326
Someone else was in Uncle's car
at the time of the accident?

832
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,495
If Ko Hyeong-su was in the car
with Prof. Seo,

833
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:31,458
he probably took the footage instead of
letting Prof. Seo get rid of it.

834
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,375
Why?

835
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,837
Being in the car at the time of
a DUI hit-and-run could ruin his career.

836
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,673
What if he's holding
onto the dashcam footage?

837
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,885
Maybe he kept it to threaten Prof. Seo
with it if needed?

838
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,055
So you think Ko Hyeong-su
has the dashcam footage?

839
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,308
KO HYEONG-SU

840
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,226
Prosecutor Jin leaked the info,

841
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,854
ordered by Ko Hyeong-su
to help the CEO of I-bit.

842
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,898
KO HYEONG-SU

843
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,067
You're filing charges
against Ko Yeong-chang

844
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,569
for coercion and even Ko Hyeong-su
for inciting him?

845
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,284
Prosecutor.

846
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,663
Please do not forgive my betrayal,

847
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,414
stay true to your values,

848
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,668
and make sure
you get Ko Hyeong-su punished.

849
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,239
Dan reported his election law violation.

850
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,659
He bribed Seo Byung-ju to cover it up,

851
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,745
instigated Prosecutor Jin
to leak Seo Gi-yeol's alleged crime,

852
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,789
procured funds for the head supporter,

853
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,708
ordered Lee Man-ho to kill Seo Byung-ju,

854
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:58,628
and ordered Ko Yeong-chang
to coerce Ye-seul into perjuring herself.

855
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,965
He also ordered Ki Du-seong
to kill Lee Man-ho.

856
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:06,803
Why did Lee Man-ho agree to carry out
Ko Hyeong-su's order?

857
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:11,766
Assemblyman Ko was the one
who sent Lee's son to the US.

858
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,814
Because of his son?

859
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,485
BECAUSE OF HIS SON?

860
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:26,781
KO HYEONG-SU

861
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,410
KO HYEONG-SU

862
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,870
Let's call it a day.

863
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,122
Okay, sounds good.

864
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,584
It's not like we can solve this
by racking our brains now.

865
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,420
And Ko Hyeong-su is certainly
not an easy one to beat.

866
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,297
There's a way.

867
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,759
A way to prove that Ko Hyeong-su
is a total scumbag.

868
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:50,930
The open constitutional review hearing
for the case of Jin Hyeong-u,

869
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:55,518
the first prosecutor in the country
to be charged

870
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,396
with publication of facts
of suspected crime, will begin soon.

871
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,902
The open hearing has begun, sir.

872
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,070
BY KO HYEONG-SU

873
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,573
Prepare for the press conference.

874
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,035
I think you should see this first, sir.

875
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:22,128
I assure you that I will only state facts
about Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

876
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,924
He proposed a bill to abolish the law
on defamation by publicly alleging facts,

877
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,885
so he won't take legal action against me
if this is all true.

878
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,805
He can sue me if any of the things I say
is false.

879
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,850
A few years ago, one of his campaign staff

880
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:40,063
reported him for spreading false news
against his opponent in the election.

881
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,441
But during the investigation,
he bribed the whistleblower

882
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,110
to drop the case.

883
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,030
Feeling guilty about giving in
and turning a blind eye to the truth,

884
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,449
she sent this letter
to the prosecutor in charge.

885
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,118
PLEASE DO NOT FORGIVE MY BETRAYAL

886
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,496
CONSTITUTION

887
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,749
We'll likely see a fierce debate
during this hearing today,

888
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:04,379
especially given that Assemblyman Ko plans
to propose a bill to abolish the law.

889
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:08,049
The prosecution and the media
are closely watching

890
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,718
how his announcement may affect
this hearing.

891
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:14,139
TOYGOODTOY, which used to be
the number one toy company,

892
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,891
-went bankrupt due to publication
-What is this now?

893
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,310
of unverified allegations.
The CEO died by suicide.

894
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:23,481
The reporter confessed that he wrote
the article based on what he had heard

895
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:28,153
from a prosecutor, who has now
been charged according to Article 126.

896
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,947
I found this while investigating
why he leaked such info.

897
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,993
It's a photo of Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su,
who the prosecutor is close to,

898
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,579
and CEO Cho Tae-yeong of I-bit,
TOYGOODTOY's competitor,

899
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,081
who's also Assemblyman Ko's
head supporter.

900
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,920
APPLICANT

901
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,715
Hey, we're dealing
with Prosecutor Jin here.

902
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,634
Don't we need Prof. Yang
to go up against him?

903
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,180
Well, I'm not trying to undermine
my roomie though.

904
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,057
I heard Prof. Kang Ju-man
is testifying for Prosecutor Jin.

905
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,186
Sol B is actually having a showdown
with her dad?

906
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:04,022
Prof. Kang isn't here yet though.

907
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,289
CONSTITUTION

908
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,290
What?

909
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:26,002
-What's Prof. Yang doing there?
-No idea.

910
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,296
He's supporting Prosecutor Jin?

911
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,931
I'm certain that someone else
was in the car with my uncle.

912
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,934
He wrote this note before he was murdered.

913
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:44,187
It reads, "Let me leave this hell."

914
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,106
It implies that
someone else was there with him.

915
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,400
Who could it be?

916
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,402
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

917
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,239
"M, A, T, E."

918
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:58,952
Damn it!

919
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,287
LET ME LEAVE THIS HELL

920
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,455
CONSTITUTION

921
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:08,002
We will now commence the hearing
for Case 2021-HG817,

922
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,047
a constitutional review
of Article 126 of the Criminal Code.

923
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,217
First, I'd like to make sure
the attorneys are here.

924
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,012
Mr. Jin, you will defend yourself today?

925
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,889
Yes, Your Honor.

926
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:22,892
I'm sorry.

927
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,187
I'm resigning,

928
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,607
so I won't be here
when the hearing happens.

929
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:31,859
I see.

930
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:36,864
Then is there anyone you can recommend?

931
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,954
You filed charges against me
for violating the law

932
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:45,540
that you think is unconstitutional?

933
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:49,335
Had you been indicted back then,
you could've requested this review sooner.

934
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:53,464
Article 126 of the Criminal Code
infringes on the public's right to know.

935
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,718
Although its objective is fair,

936
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,554
it fails to employ appropriate methods,
minimize damage,

937
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:02,181
and generate balanced legal benefits.

938
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:06,311
It is unconstitutional and violates
the principle of proportionality.

939
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:09,230
Ergo, it should be abolished.

940
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,734
I will dare say this to the man
who will have command

941
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,402
over the entire country soon.

942
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:19,574
Don't waste your power on trying
to control a nobody like me.

943
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:21,993
KO HYEONG-SU

944
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,499
Make them take down that video at once.

945
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:32,754
And sue them all for defamation
by spreading false information…

946
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,469
Then they'll try to prove
that it is not false information.

947
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:44,057
KO HYEONG-SU

948
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,683
These brats…

949
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,981
They're ganging up on me to bait me?

950
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,448
Yang Jong-hoon.

951
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,910
That bastard…

952
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,204
CONSTITUTION

953
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:09,666
Then we'll ask you some questions now.

954
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:15,004
Yes, I have a question
for Mr. Jin's witness.

955
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:18,424
Except for this case,

956
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,803
no one else has been charged
with breaking this law.

957
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:26,015
You believe that is why Article 126
should be abolished.

958
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,768
Could you please explain it
in more detail?

959
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:33,731
APPLICANT

960
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:38,277
What would've happened had the facts
about Lee Man-ho's sexual assault case

961
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,279
been published
through the proper channels?

962
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,533
He would not have been ruled
"feeble-minded" so easily,

963
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:47,495
and we could've prevented the verdict
which the public at large deemed unjust.

964
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,915
Politicians who applaud
publication of allegations

965
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:54,043
involving their opponents
and lash out when it happens to them

966
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,213
should no longer be allowed
to take advantage of this provision.

967
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,297
CONSTITUTION

968
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:02,218
The law exists, but no one has ever
been punished for violating it.

969
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,888
It means that the law is dead.

970
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,141
But we can't even bury it.

971
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:11,477
We're wasting our energy
trying to revive the dead law.

972
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:15,898
No other countries have such a general
and broad provision

973
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,818
against publication of suspected crime.

974
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:22,655
Regarding similar cases
in other countries, Ms. Erica Shin,

975
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,199
a lawyer and comparative law expert
at Harvard

976
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:30,455
who was also selected as a witness,
will virtually join us and tell us more.

977
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,081
CONSTITUTION

978
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,959
Are we ready for this video call?

979
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,170
He betrayed us to help Prosecutor Jin

980
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,422
and even organized
an international video call?

981
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,090
What's all this fuss about?

982
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,967
They won't win anyway.

983
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:47,388
CONSTITUTION

984
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,693
Hello, I'm Erica Shin.

985
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,542
APPLICANT

986
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,538
What I'm really curious about
is Ko's response,

987
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,832
but why is he as quiet as a mouse?

988
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,250
That's what the jerks want.

989
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,669
I have a plan in my mind.

990
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,546
Did Sol serve time in juvie?

991
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,214
For school violence?

992
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,716
My case will be ruled
self-defense for sure.

993
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,218
I bet Ko ordered you to do it.

994
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:10,638
You're a prosecutor,
so you shouldn't be treated as a minion.

995
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,265
What is it that you want to hear?

996
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:16,060
The string I'm holding on to
should not be a rotten one, you know.

997
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,603
Why did you want to see me?

998
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:18,646
Let me tell you.

999
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,649
Since I'm the one who asked him
to call you over.

1000
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,489
