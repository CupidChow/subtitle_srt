00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,146
COURT

2
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,070
Defendant.

3
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,488
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

4
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,490
When will your attorney get here?

5
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,285
PROSECUTION

6
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,079
They already seem half-hearted.

7
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,247
She's already in a tight spot.

8
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,583
-I'll go outside and check.
-Okay.

9
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,595
I apologize.

10
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,682
COURT

11
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,477
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,103
COURT

13
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,523
No way.

14
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,440
What's going on?

15
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,317
Prof. Yang is defending her?

16
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:50,944
Is that allowed?

17
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,946
Your Honor.

18
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,406
In order for the defendant
to be fairly judged

19
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,283
by the Court and the people,

20
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,787
I would like to request a jury trial.

21
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,335
"A counsel shall be appointed
from among attorneys-at-law.

22
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,213
In special circumstances,
courts other than the Supreme Court

23
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,048
-What's up?
-may permit the appointment

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,467
of a counsel
who is not an attorney-at-law."

25
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,177
Special defense counsel.

26
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,346
-This sounds--
-It won't work.

27
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,806
What? Why not?

28
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,057
They won't approve this.

29
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,268
I bet many judges don't even know
about this.

30
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,937
This is their chance to learn.
Why won't they approve it?

31
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,481
It was only relevant
back when there were few lawyers.

32
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,441
It cost a fortune to hire a lawyer then.

33
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,445
Nowadays, there are so many of them.
Public defenders too.

34
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,322
The chances are very slim.

35
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,659
As you've heard, all the public defenders
who were appointed have quit.

36
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,871
Well, I need my prof's
permission first anyway.

37
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,165
Prof. Kim will say yes, obviously.

38
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,292
What? I'm not talking about Prof. Kim.

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,218
COURT

40
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,846
Mr. Yang Jong-hoon is currently
being tried for murder--

41
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,307
All defendants are innocent
until proven guilty.

42
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,852
Law professors are not permitted
to practice law.

43
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,730
Based on Article 31
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

44
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,274
I've been appointed
as her special defense counsel.

45
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,785
There have been no precedents for decades.

46
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,913
That does not mean the clause isn't there.

47
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,874
With all the practicing attorneys,
it is no longer--

48
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,835
It was deemed relevant by the Court.

49
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,047
What are her extraordinary circumstances?

50
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,008
The victim's father is Assemblyman Ko,
a presidential candidate.

51
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,261
No one wants to represent Ms. Jeon
because Assemblyman Ko

52
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,221
is a powerful man.

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,642
So she chose me in order to exercise
her right to defend herself.

54
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,144
Yang Jong-hoon?

55
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,523
The Court approved it?

56
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,860
The judge approved it?

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,365
The presiding judge and I
used to work closely together.

58
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,284
The public defenders kept quitting,
so he was all stressed out.

59
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,953
How do you know that?

60
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,581
All right. We can't help it, then.

61
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,250
Any lawyer would be up for this?

62
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,585
If I can't take this case,
it means no one will.

63
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,922
Why would we destroy our career
by defying Ko Hyeong-su?

64
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,052
Ye-seul wants me to represent her.

65
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,180
So you'll quit teaching?

66
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,851
REQUEST FOR SPECIAL DEFENSE COUNSEL

67
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,978
This is…

68
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,189
I've been told that they normally
would not approve this.

69
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,275
If you were the judge,

70
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,195
would you deem her circumstances
"extraordinary"?

71
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,199
-I would.
-Then,

72
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,662
please help her so her reasonable request
won't be denied.

73
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,456
You want me to help her?

74
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,709
If this gets approved,
it'll set a precedent

75
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,253
for law professors practicing law
as public defenders.

76
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,839
Students can assist them
and learn what it's like

77
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,174
to work as a criminal defense attorney,
firsthand.

78
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,928
You always emphasized the importance
of giving students

79
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,056
firsthand experience.
This will make it happen.

80
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,850
I can tell that there's something.

81
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,187
If it's copied, hand it over.

82
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,605
What happened? Tell me.

83
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,358
Knowing you, you'd never ask anyone
for such a favor.

84
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,155
But I could express my opinion.

85
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,329
You're requesting a jury trial?

86
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,330
Yes.

87
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,999
I do not understand why that is necessary.

88
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,667
The defendant has pleaded guilty.

89
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,004
No, she only admitted
to causing the victim's injury.

90
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,509
I'll prove that she acted in self-defense
and, therefore, is not guilty.

91
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,012
A jury trial?

92
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,598
Self-defense?

93
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,266
Jeez.

94
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,019
Yang Jong-hoon, that prick…

95
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,314
A jury trial could work
in Yeong-chang's favor.

96
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,484
If Yang is found guilty,
the Court will be criticized

97
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,694
for appointing a murderer
as a public defender.

98
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,571
And the jury won't rule in their favor.

99
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,906
Self-defense?

100
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,033
Not a chance.

101
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,912
So it's up to you.

102
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,333
And? Another pain in the butt?

103
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,336
It's not a big deal.

104
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,631
Small problems can be a real nuisance.

105
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,258
This guy is Yang's student?

106
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:31,140
Remember the TOYGOODTOY CEO
who burned himself to death? It's his son.

107
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,102
He burned himself to death?

108
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,438
TOYGOODTOY? That toy company?

109
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,608
I'll take care of it, sir.

110
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,028
When I saw Prof. Yang enter the courtroom,

111
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,447
I couldn't believe my eyes. It was unreal.

112
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,950
I am glad that he's representing her, but…

113
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,411
Isn't it a bit much though?
I mean, he's losing his own trial.

114
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,372
He should worry about his own trial.

115
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,791
Prof. Kim is at the restaurant.

116
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,209
Count me out.

117
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,878
I have an upset stomach,
and I have to go home.

118
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:01,963
I'll call you later.

119
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,176
She would never say no to free food.

120
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,636
Did she actually fail?

121
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,012
Her stomach is upset.

122
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,682
She is upset, not her stomach.

123
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,600
She's upset because she failed.

124
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,436
Why else? This is so unlike her.

125
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,400
Oh, that's my sister. See you. Bye!

126
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,901
Okay, bye!

127
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,737
My cutie-pie!

128
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,867
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

129
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,995
Ice cream on this cold day?

130
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,459
Gosh.

131
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,671
-Are you stressed out?
-Yeah.

132
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,216
Why am I studying law
when I'm not smart enough?

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,344
-Are you that stressed out?
-Yeah.

134
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,556
I'm not smart like Dan, you know.

135
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,018
She must've struggled too.

136
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,605
Yeah.

137
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,565
She did.

138
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,154
You didn't live with us,
so you probably don't know.

139
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,532
Dad started gambling on top of everything,

140
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,451
so Mom had a really hard time.

141
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,661
Dan got very upset

142
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,582
every time she saw Dad give Mom
a hard time.

143
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,213
He took all the money you sent

144
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,881
and went gambling.

145
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,259
Why didn't you tell me back then?

146
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,930
Mom told me not to tell you.

147
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,434
She was afraid you'd do something to Dad
if you found out.

148
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,813
I still wanted to tell you,

149
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,274
but Dan also told me not to.

150
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,986
I see.

151
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,947
I had no idea.

152
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,075
Will you keep studying?

153
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,910
You won't give up, right?

154
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,914
Oh, did you find out your grades?

155
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,043
Hey, did you find out your grades?

156
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,211
What?

157
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,382
Sauce or no sauce?
You can eat whichever one you prefer.

158
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,260
We should talk about the jury trial
before the food comes out.

159
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,513
Is a jury trial really a good idea though?

160
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,266
Aren't Ko Yeong-chang's arm
and leg paralyzed?

161
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,226
Wouldn't the jury feel bad for him?

162
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,229
It would still be better
than just leaving it up to the Court.

163
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,983
An accident left the chief judge's son
paralyzed from the waist down.

164
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:27,942
Really?

165
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,112
That won't do Ye-seul any good.

166
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,531
-Judges are humans too.
-Totally.

167
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,824
But how do you know?

168
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,119
Right, there are many judges
in her family. Gosh.

169
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,580
I wish I was born into a family like that.

170
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,248
Your family's rich.

171
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,250
Nouveau riche.

172
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,210
Not like this prestigious family.

173
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,628
Did you hear anything else?

174
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,673
Not a single case has been ruled
self-defense in that court.

175
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,300
-Zero?
-Zero?

176
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,635
Then this will be the first.

177
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,139
In my next life, I want to be born as you.

178
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,976
Ye-seul has to tell them what he did
to prove it was self-defense,

179
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,603
so she should press charges too.

180
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,113
I don't want to press charges.

181
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,323
Why not?

182
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,701
Ye-seul, I understand how you feel.

183
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,037
I don't, so tell me.

184
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,998
He may have to live with a disability
for the rest of my life.

185
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,375
Right, I understand, but--

186
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,420
You'll ruin the trial
just because you feel guilty?

187
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,299
You'll ruin my first case
as a public defender?

188
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,759
Change your mind.

189
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,763
Prof. Yang, wait…

190
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,474
Just a second. Prof. Yang.

191
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,861
Just do what your heart says.

192
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,031
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,117
-For putting you through this.
-I know.

194
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,411
I don't want to miss out on tangsuyuk.

195
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,747
Let's go have some tangsuyuk.

196
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,267
WILL NOT FAIL

197
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,438
Everyone's busy trying to help Ye-seul.

198
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,689
PRINT/COPIES

199
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,774
Oh, right.

200
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,695
Here.

201
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,951
I practically lived on this
while preparing for the judicial exam.

202
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,079
There were days
when I ate nothing but this.

203
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,622
Try it.

204
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,753
Do you know why I took
the judicial exam ten times?

205
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,880
Take a seat.

206
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,132
PRINT/COPIES

207
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,386
Where should I begin?

208
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,054
Right.

209
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,226
The second time I took it, I was so close.

210
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,646
And I felt that I'd pass it
if I studied just a little harder.

211
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,984
When I realized that wasn't the case,

212
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,029
I had already invested so much time in it.

213
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,825
"I can do this.
I've just had some bad luck."

214
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,038
I couldn't give up
even after wasting my youth.

215
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,957
Right.

216
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,085
It was like a drug.
Do you know how I gave up?

217
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,798
I didn't know what else I could do,

218
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,758
so I kept hanging on. Then I had a dream.

219
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,970
In the dream,

220
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,765
I stole the exam paper and answer sheet
and ran away.

221
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,310
But I didn't even feel guilty.

222
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,812
I was fixated on passing the exam.

223
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,191
I couldn't run no matter how hard I tried,

224
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,735
so I went berserk and started bawling
like a crazy man.

225
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,571
I know it was just a dream,

226
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,990
but I was ready

227
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,494
to sell my soul to the devil
if I could just pass the exam.

228
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,709
Oh, right.
Ms. Oh will pick up the copies soon.

229
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,004
Wait here.
I'll tell you the rest when I'm back.

230
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,255
Wait, okay?

231
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,368
MILL

232
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,458
This isn't good.

233
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,920
I put that up there
so you wouldn't do this.

234
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,422
Let's go. I'm here to see you anyway.

235
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,678
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSES LEE MAN-HO ACT

236
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,971
LEE MAN-HO SET TO BE FREED

237
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,100
PERFECT MURDER THAT LEFT NO EVIDENCE

238
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,728
THE SOLES WERE CUT OFF

239
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,657
So what's up?

240
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,744
My uncle never used to check
his blood sugar often,

241
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,540
but he checked it every day
just before he passed away.

242
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,923
You should've cared about him
when he was alive.

243
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,345
Your uncle's diabetes
had gotten a lot worse.

244
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,724
His blood sugar was totally out of whack,

245
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,477
so his doctor told him to check it daily
for two months

246
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,396
and that he'd be hospitalized otherwise.

247
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,774
Then he started checking it regularly.

248
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,822
Did his doctor give him
a blood glucose logbook?

249
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,407
A logbook?

250
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,387
2:08 P.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

251
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,889
BLOOD GLUCOSE LOGBOOK

252
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,518
BLOOD GLUCOSE LOGBOOK

253
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,844
What is this?

254
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,763
KANG SOL

255
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,603
She refuses to write "Kang Sol B" on this?

256
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,939
Okay, fine.

257
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:29,154
KANG SOL A+

258
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,992
Hey, roomie. Why do you want
to drink this anyway?

259
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,874
Why are you drinking water
as if it's booze?

260
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,085
And what was that sound?

261
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,254
Gosh.

262
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,423
What is this?

263
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,508
It's booze.

264
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,553
Because of your grades?

265
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,806
Oh, my grades?

266
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,559
My darn grades.

267
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,649
To make up for the warning
in the first semester,

268
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,029
I studied so hard in the second semester.

269
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,448
I'm telling you, I studied really,

270
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,492
really hard.

271
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,369
You know that.

272
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,415
"You can do it"? Whatever.

273
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,543
That's like giving false hope.

274
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,048
Gosh.

275
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,551
Guess what my 1L GPA is.

276
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,014
Hey, what?

277
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,975
Are you worried that I might've failed?

278
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,853
Come on. Why would I be worried?

279
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,647
You're mean.

280
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,984
I was worried sick when I was checking it.

281
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:52,863
Just tell me.

282
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,620
It's 2.02.

283
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,833
Are you relieved to hear

284
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,169
that it's over 2.0
and I don't have to retake 1L?

285
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,425
I was so excited.

286
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,719
I was totally stoked.

287
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,306
But, you know,

288
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:25,354
seeing myself like that
made me feel so pathetic.

289
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,024
I'm at the bottom anyway.

290
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,820
Like a loser, I got all excited about

291
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,282
going up a tad bit from the rugged bottom.

292
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,747
Gosh.

293
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,127
You guys at the top must think

294
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,004
I'm like the most ridiculous joke ever.

295
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,300
I went through all that trouble
to get into this school

296
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,804
just so I could make
you smarty-pants shine.

297
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,392
Look at you.

298
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,019
You're trying hard not to laugh at me.

299
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,898
You're drunk. Let's go.

300
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,400
That's what you're doing.

301
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,365
Dan is the one who belongs here, not me.

302
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:28,000
I should've kneeled before the dirty money
instead of her.

303
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,214
I'm off.

304
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,050
Hey.

305
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,721
-Make sure you catch…
-Gosh.

306
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,306
What?

307
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,640
Not me!

308
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,434
The real killer.

309
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,710
Oh, Kang Sol A plus.

310
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,088
It makes no sense
that you're Kang Sol "B".

311
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,133
I'm sorry.

312
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,846
I'm sorry that I have the same name
as yours.

313
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,016
Get up.

314
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,230
Yes, I should.

315
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,361
To help Ye-seul prove that
it was self-defense and be acquitted,

316
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,904
I must study the precedents.

317
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:45,118
"The defendant… It is unfair…"

318
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,246
"It is unfair…"

319

321
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,391
and was moved to Saturday the 26th

Yes, it was moved to September 26th.

-What?

Oh, nothing.

327
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,991
Did you contact him?

328
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,933
Why am I here?

329
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,479
I'm so hungover.

330
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,402
Come out if you're hungover.

331
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,800
PRE-HEARING FOR KANG SOL B'S
PLAGIARISM CASE

332
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,596
So, you wrote this with Prof. Seo
when you were in middle school.

333
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,474
Then you submitted it to the contest,
not knowing that he had

334
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,309
submitted it to Harvard?

335
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,269
Had I known about it,

336
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,438
I would not have submitted it
to the contest.

337
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,816
It says we co-wrote it,
but I actually wrote most of it.

338
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,862
You were interested in this topic
when you were in middle school?

339
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,531
I was interested in infringement
of fundamental rights.

340
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,868
This law, where our right to know
clashes with defendants' rights,

341
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,412
only exists in Korea,
so I wanted to dig deeper.

342
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,499
So, you submitted what you wrote

343
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,376
back in middle school to the contest
after entering college.

344
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,337
I wanted to submit it back then,

345
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,422
but only college students were eligible.

346
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,217
Obviously, many years have passed
since then.

347
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,261
And you submitted it
without checking the new cases

348
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,806
and theories that have been introduced
since then?

349
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,934
No one was indicted for it
during those years, so there was

350
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,352
no criminal case to refer to.

351
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,646
And no theoretical controversies either.

352
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,982
But there was a notable civil case.

353
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,944
It examines whether the law
only exists in Korea

354
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,988
and if there are similar criminal cases
in other countries,

355
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,615
so I didn't include civil cases.

356
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,202
Since I never wrote about them,
I didn't need to update it.

357
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,745
KANG SOL B'S PLAGIARISM

358
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,289
I was confident
that it was a well-written piece.

359
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,042
You sure come from a family
of law professionals.

360
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,587
Prof. Yang,
would you like to say anything?

361
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,048
Anything else?

362
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,053
My middle school friend
also goes to Hankuk Law.

363
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,557
If you still don't believe me,
you can ask him.

364
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,892
-You mean, Seo Ji-ho?
-Yes.

365
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,645
He can verify that I actually wrote it
in middle school.

366
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,489
I feel like I just got punched
in the face, big-time.

367
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,869
She refuted all the reasons
why I was suspecting her,

368
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,288
and I had nothing to say.
How embarrassing is that?

369
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,167
I'm beginning to think that
maybe I was wrong.

370
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,378
Let's just ask the vice dean.

371
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,964
He must know the truth
since he's her father.

372
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,257
Oh, right.

373
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,510
He said he'd cooperate and stay out of it.
He won't do more than that.

374
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,931
You know, about Sol B…
She even mentioned Ji-ho.

375
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,434
They must've cut a deal of some sort.

376
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,060
-Right.
-What about Seung-jae?

377
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,606
I haven't heard from him since then.

378
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,150
His wife went through a lot to conceive,

379
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,110
so I'll wait until the end of the week.

380
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,905
Before your next trial, I'll--

381
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,072
Can I borrow your car?

382
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,621
Hey, where's mine?

383
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,832
You didn't get one for me? You're so mean.

384
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,250
Like I knew when you'd come.

385
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,385
It's hot.

386
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:16,014
This had better get rid of my hangover.

387
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,395
Hey, I can't find any cases
that are similar to Ye-seul's

388
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,523
-for the life of me.
-I told you there's none.

389
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,693
-Well, in case you missed something.
-Me?

390
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,611
Jeez.

BLOOD GLUCOSE LOGBOOK

392
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,034
What's this?

393
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,619
The ones that are circled.

394
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,663
Look. 227, what the prosecutor mentioned.

397
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,169
What is this?

398
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,421
-Then…
-You know me.

399
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:52,217
Of course. You rock!

400
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,510
What a relief.

401
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,553
-My gosh.
-Give it back.

402
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,721
Where are you going?

403
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,390
To see the one who'd be thrilled.

404
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,187
Right, you do deserve all the spotlight.

405
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,399
Thank God I didn't fail.

406
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,279
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

407
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,117
You can drive, right?

LAW AND ORDER THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST

409
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,291
What? You want me to file an appeal?

410
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,626
I've given up,
so they'll reduce your sentence.

411
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,504
I'll file a petition asking for leniency.

412
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,756
I'd really appreciate that, but…

413
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,719
I told you you're wasting your time.

414
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,311
I said I did it alone because of a grudge!

415
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,146
No one put me up to it!

416

SHOE PRINT, MURDER

LAW AND ORDER THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST

00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,285
PERFECT MURDER THAT LEFT NO EVIDENCE

420
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,164
SOLES WERE CUT OFF TO PREVENT SHOE PRINTS

421
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:09,627
What a waste of time.
Someone beat me to it and met him already.

422
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,173
I don't know who it is.

423
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,176
SEOUL BUKBU DETENTION CENTER

424
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,556
Oh, I know who it is. It's Yang Jong-hoon.

425
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,564
431R 5326

426
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,648
Something's fishy.

427
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,776
Doesn't the plate look fake?

428
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,903
431R 5326

429
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,530
The person who ordered him to kill you

430
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,325
at the detention center
must be the culprit.

431

431R 5326

432

434
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,058
Are you all right?

435
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,685
I don't want to die
before I clear my name.

436
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,230
I'm sorry.

437
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,899
We must catch the killer.

BLOOD GLUCOSE TRACKER

440
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,866
One of my uncle's belongings is missing.

441
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,326
His pen?

442
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,416
Oh, isn't that pizza?

443
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,792
Who bought this?

444
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,293
YU SEUNG-JAE

445
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,129
Oh, Seung-jae ordered it for us.

446
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,880
Where is he? Why only send this?

447
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,881
He was here.

448
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,758
Seung-jae was here.

449
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,093
When?

450
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,429
He should've waited a bit to say hi.

451
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,514
He's in shock because his grades dropped.

452
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,225
I get it though.
He always got an A plus on everything.

453
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,644
Maybe that A plus was the problem.

454
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,147
"The problem"?

455
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,982
Do you know something?

456
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,568
Say nothing.
Let's not talk behind his back.

457
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,153
I'm just curious. That's all.

458
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,071
Then ask him directly.

459
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,490
She's right.
He bought us this pizza after all.

460
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,576
What did I even do?

461
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,246
Like Seung-jae wrote here,
let's help Ye-seul return to school.

462
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,019
Do you know

463
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,897
why I asked you to come here?

464
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,487
Come closer.

465
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,541
Self-defense?

466
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,918
I'm sorry.

467
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,544
Then beg for my forgiveness.

468
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,213
Beg until your limbs feel numb.

469
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,924
You did this to me.
And what? Self-defense?

470
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,717
Why?

471
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,595
Because that bastard suggested it?

472
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,223
Ko Yeong-chang, the victim,
recorded spy cam sex videos--

473
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,809
Hey, let's just call them
"spy cam videos."

474
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,477
He says the camera wasn't hidden,

475
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,896
and he was going to delete them,
not spread them.

476
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,023
Bullshit! He wrote a novel.

477
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,526
I wrote a novel too.

478
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,653
I'd call it a blatant lie, not a novel.

479
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,071
Sum up their arguments.

480
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,030
Me?

481
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,533
Right, I should.

482
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,953
The two of them were in a relationship
for over three years.

483
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:33,206
They prepared for law school together,
but only Ye-seul got in.

484
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,874
Those are facts.

485
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:35,875
Ko insists that

486
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,795
Ye-seul two-timed him
after getting into law school.

487
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,129
Apparently, with me.

488
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,217
They insist that Ye-seul
witnessed my uncle's murder.

489
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,636
Prof. Yang's threats stressed her out,

490
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,805
so Ko persuaded her to testify
against him.

491
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,765
Gosh, that's just ridiculous.

492
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,934
So, she decided to do it,

493
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,479
but I blackmailed her into walking back
her statements to help Prof. Yang.

494
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,439
You "blackmailed" her? How?

495
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,860
I heard that jerk, Han Joon-hwi,
threatened you that he'd tell others

496
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,736
about me stopping by every night.

497
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,242
So, you betrayed me and walked back
your statements, which means

498
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,369
you were ready to break up with me.

499
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,832
I was going to delete our videos.
Why did you try to stop me?

500
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,463
I will…

501
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,009
pray for your recovery.

502
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,309
You can pray in jail!

503
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,437
This is bullshit.
I can't believe they're buying this.

504
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,189
I hope Seung-jae buys my story.

505
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,109
Why would such successful lawyers
want to waste their talent--

506
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,611
This is well-crafted bullshit.

507
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,404
Should I have added more details?

508
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:51,034
I heard Ko got rid of his phone, laptop,
and even his dash cam,

509
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,536
and he's saying he never installed
the spy camera.

510
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,497
-Was the camera hidden or not?
-Did he intend to disseminate it?

511
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,708
We must emphasize
that he was abusive to her.

512
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,626
No!

513
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,588
Oh, not that.

514
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,383
If the media covers this,
it'll become fake news.

515
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,766
Fake news?

516
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,816
AUDIO TRANSCRIPT CALL RECORDING

517
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,154
I did this around the time when I had
to wear sunglasses to your lecture.

518
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,366
I thought something had to be done.

519
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,326
There's a medical certificate.

520
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,829
And I recorded him saying
that he'd never do it again.

521
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,749
This proves that he was abusive to you.

522
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,751
So you want to press charges?

523
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:45,213
I'd like you to only use them
to prove my innocence.

524
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,426
I know he hurt me,

525
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,013
but he's paying for it already.

526
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,185
Let's get the facts straight.

527
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,730
He's not paying for what he did to you.

528
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,024
While committing the crime,
an accident happened.

529
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,609
It's his own fault, not yours.

530
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,741
-Sol.
-Hey.

531
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,787
Assemblyman Ko used fake news
to make his opponent take his own life…

532
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,417
Can you give us a moment?

533
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,547
We must win the trial to make sure Ye-seul
won't fall victim to fake news.

534
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,258
Assemblyman Ko has done this before.

535
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,760
This time, he's colluding

536
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,722
with all the hotshot lawyers
to help his son.

537
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,474
The sad thing is that it works.

538
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,226
Why do you think Dan left?

539
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,228
She became a whistleblower

540
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,522
so he could be punished
for his corruption.

541
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,483
But she gave in
and accepted the dirty money.

542
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,488
Have you heard from her since then?

543
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,532
She will contact me
if that is why she left.

544
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,870
Prof. Yang,

545
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:02,081
I want to prove that Ye-seul acted
in self-defense

546
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,333
so I can teach Assemblyman Ko a lesson.

547
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,003
I really want to show him
that he can no longer

548
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,131
use fake news and weasel out of things.

549
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,555
Oh, this is…

550
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,599
Dating violence could become a key issue.

551
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,225
Study jury trials first.

552
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,395
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

553
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,692
There is a small myoma.

554
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,404
But considering the location and the size,
I think we can just monitor it.

555
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,783
The cervical cancer biopsy results
will be out within a week.

556
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,951
Your baby's doing well?

557
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,079
Yes, thanks to you.

558
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,707
I feel bad because I can't breastfeed
my baby as often as I want to.

559
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,793
I heard you're pregnant.

560
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:48,753
Congratulations.

561
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,048
I told him not to tell anyone
until it's considered safe.

562
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,801
I guess Seung-jae told you.

563
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,762
I'm not surprised. He's very fond of you.

564
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,060
I want to respect his decision

565
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,480
to study law for our baby's sake.

566
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,944
-Please take good care of him.
-Gosh, of course.

567
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,780
He always does a good job, doesn't he?

568
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,367
Right, what's going on with Ye-seul?

569
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,829
If Assemblyman Ko is involved,
it won't be easy.

570
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,541
They won't have it easy either
now that Prof. Yang is her attorney.

571
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,044
Well, what about his own trial though?

572
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,840
Seung-jae seems very worried about it.

573
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,054
Yes! Cho Ye-bum.

574
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,891
Nice, the Prosecution Service.
I'm excited.

575
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,103
Oh, Hyeongseol?
You want to get this confirmed?

576
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,313
Bok-gi, you're…

577
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,733
Well, I want to be a human rights lawyer,

578
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,902
so I don't like those big law firms.

579
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,028
Will they want you?

580
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,155
What?

581
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,449
Hey, isn't that the law firm
Ko Yeong-chang hired?

582
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,327
-If you go there--
-I won't be able to help Ye-seul.

583
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,122
-Hey, how could you--
-Hold on. What is this?

584
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,331
Your name isn't here.

585
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,958
Is this an error?

586
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,836
You didn't get it?

587
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,879
Go ask them.

588
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,472
She aced the final exam even after
switching to Prof. Moon's class.

589
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,225
The vice dean gave her a lower grade.

590
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,519
Rumor has it that
he deliberately penalized her

591
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,771
after people found out
she was his daughter.

592
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,941
Oh, Prof. Yang has posted a notice.

593
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,109
What?

594
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,445
All Hankuk Law students are invited

595
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,907
to attend the final hearing
of Prof. Seo Byung-ju's case

596
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,742
which will take place today at 2 p.m.

597
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,328
What does he want to show us?
He's clearly losing.

598
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,413
Clearly, he has something to show us.

599
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,873
Do you know anything?

600
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,583
We shall find out.

601
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,338
Ye-seul has to testify again today.

602
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,797
I wonder if she'll be okay.

603
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,091
Why don't you call her
instead of just worrying?

604
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,010
-Every crisis is an opportunity.
-Stop!

605
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,303
Seriously, don't!

606
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,531
Seung-jae.

607
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,992
Headed to the Court, right?

608
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,166
What is this?

609
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,835
I don't have the courage
to be on the witness stand.

610
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,588
Make sure Prof. Yang gets it.

611
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,159
I'm here.

612
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,537
I told you this is faster
when the traffic's bad.

613
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,664
Where's Seung-jae?

614
00:38:58,794 --> 00:38:59,837
Professor!

615
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,633
We're sorry for making you testify twice.

616
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,802
-No matter what the prosecutor--
-What do I do?

617
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,763
The flash drive…

618
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:21,776
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON'S FINAL TRIAL

619
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,071
As you can see, all the numbers match.

620
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,990
However, this date on the logbook

621
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,159
is different from the one
on the glucometer.

622
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,869
Right, by one day.

623
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,662
Which date is the correct one?

624
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,997
OCTOBER 5, OCTOBER 4, 2020

625
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,292
The handwritten entry in the logbook,
of course.

626
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,837
The date could've been entered wrong
on the glucometer.

627
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,591
According to this logbook,
the blood glucose level of 227,

628
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:49,595
which the prosecutor mentioned,
was recorded the day before the incident.

629
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,891
We must verify that the logbook
and the handwriting

630
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,309
-are indeed--
-You doubt it.

631
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,353
Then let's check one more thing.

632
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:58,771
SEPTEMBER 26

633
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,273
That information is saved
on the glucometer.

634
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:06,654
Take notice that it says it was recorded
on September 26th at 11:30 a.m.

635
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:10,950
The mock trial class for September 25th
was canceled

636
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:15,121
and was moved to Saturday the 26th
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., right?

637
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:20,251
In the audience,
we have students who attended

638
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,337
the victim's mock trial class
on September 26th at 11:30 a.m.

639
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,133
It went on for three hours as the class
the day before had been canceled.

640
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:31,303
Hence, the victim was not able to check
his blood sugar during that time,

641
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,223
which means this was actually measured

642
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:37,852
at 11:30 a.m. on the 25th,
the day before the class.

643
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,730
It doesn't rule out the possibility
that the logbook was manipulated.

644
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,693
11:30 A.M. SEPTEMBER 26

645
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:47,820
Well,

646
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:53,284
to prove that everything in this logbook
was recorded by the victim himself,

647
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,952
we'd like to bring in a witness.

648
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,537
Who is the witness?

649
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,292
The victim's personal driver
who happens to be in this courtroom now.

650
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,003
We'd like to bring in Mr. Lee Man-ho
as a witness.

651
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,339
Objection.
Mr. Lee Man-ho already testified.

652
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,467
So did Ms. Jeon Ye-seul,

653
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,802
but the Court has approved your request.

654
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,679
-This is different!
-How so?

655
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:17,266
Mr. Lee Man-ho is a sex offender.
He is not a credible witness…

656
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:22,229
Are you arguing that
he is far less credible than Ms. Jeon?

657
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,235
I ask that we take a recess.

658
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,363
Joon-hwi never lets us down.

659
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,910
Thanks to him,
high blood sugar has been ruled out.

660
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,703
Let's see.

661
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,538
The missing laptop, out.

662
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,041
The one-way flight ticket, out.
High blood sugar, out.

663
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:45,419
And his request to bring in Lee Man-ho
as a witness. What timing!

664
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,298
If the prosecutor questions
Lee's credibility as a witness,

665
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,259
it means everything he said
when testifying against Prof. Yang

666
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,928
can't be trusted either.

667
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,348
While making Ye-seul seem more credible.

668
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,975
So, the prosecutor realized
he was digging his own grave.

669
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:00,893
It's not enough.

670
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,395
They must prove that it was sugar,
not meth,

671
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,315
in order to invalidate
Prof. Yang's fingerprints and DNA.

672
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,526
Why aren't they asking you to testify?

673
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,611
You really didn't see it?

674
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,948
I saw it.

675
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,122
You've never seen the logbook

676
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,166
and Seo Byung-ju didn't write that, okay?

677
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,168
I would never commit perjury.

678
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,090
FLOOR DIRECTORY

679
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,593
If I get caught, I'll go to jail.

680
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:40,057
Ending up in jail again
is what I fear the most.

681
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,648
FLOOR DIRECTORY

682
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,026
You seem to have serious trust issues.

683
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,074
Why did I help you out
when you put me behind bars?

684
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,911
To help you out,
I even said that I was the one

685
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,622
who leaked the info about Yang's charges.

686
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,208
You benefited from my testimony.

687
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,461
How dare you question my credibility
as a witness?

688
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,422
Get lost, will you?

689
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,883
Don't you dare tell me what to do!

690
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,679
I don't report to you, do I?

691
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:33,569
AUNT

692
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,119
Since Mr. Lee Man-ho isn't here
at the moment,

693
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:46,540
I must dismiss the counsel's request
to bring him in as a witness.

694
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,001
ACCUSED

695
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:49,960
Prosecution.

696
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,171
Give your closing statement.

697
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,595
Recently, Mr. Yang told me

698
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,431
that he became a law professor

699
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,851
to make sure there are
no more prosecutors like me.

700
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,895
When I heard that,

701
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:12,232
I became even more convinced
that he is the killer.

702
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,402
In a world without prosecutors like me,

703
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,280
the likes of Mr. Yang,
who take advantage of the laws

704
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,533
can get away with anything, even a murder.

705
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,081
Gosh.

706
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,248
Pick up.

707
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,716
PROFESSOR KIM EUN-SUK

708
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,176
If what Mr. Yang

709
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,680
put in the victim's coffee
was indeed sugar, not a drug,

710
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:46,100
and if the real killer
took the empty sugar packet

711
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,102
to frame Mr. Yang for the murder,

712
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,855
then the killer should know that Mr. Yang

713
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,901
had fed the coffee with sugar
to the victim

714
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:59,947
because the killer must've seen him do it.

715
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,409
The cup and the sugar packet
had Mr. Yang's prints all over them,

716
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:08,205
so the killer left them there as evidence
and drugged the victim.

717
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,289
MISCELLANEOUS

718
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,084
But among those whose shoe prints
were found at the scene...

719
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,252
PROSECUTION

720
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,295
everyone, except for Ms. Jeon Ye-seul,

721
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:22,010
has an alibi proving that
they weren't able to witness

722
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:27,391
Mr. Yang feeding coffee to the victim
between 14:05 and 14:15.

723
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:34,231
And with Ms. Jeon too, we could not find
any evidence related to methamphetamine.

724
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,942
-Mr. Yang may have told--
-No, I did not.

725
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,370
Defendant, Yang Jong-hoon, lost his temper

726
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,331
upon finding out that the victim,
Prof. Seo Byung-ju,

727
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,293
was the real culprit
behind his only cold case.

728
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,422
On a spur of the moment, he drugged
the victim's coffee, which killed him.

729
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,508
He killed a precious life
because of his personal grudge,

730
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,094
and it cannot be forgiven.

731
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:08,724
Moreover, Mr. Yang is a law professor
who teaches criminal law,

732
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,560
so what he did should rightfully
be condemned.

733
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,648
Ergo, I request that he be sentenced

734
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,693
to 20 years in prison.

735
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,967
Defendant, please give
your closing argument.

736
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,677
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

737
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,026
"Make sure no one ever suffers unjustly

738
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,196
even if you end up losing 99 perps."

739
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,535
The late prosecutor Mr. Seo Byung-ju
hated this saying the most.

740
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,412
"What about all the innocent people
who end up

741
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,790
suffering unfairly
because of the 99 perps?"

742
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,543
He said it is a prosecutor's duty
to make sure no one,

743
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,920
not even one person,
ever suffers unjustly.

744
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,381
However, he caused

745
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,676
a hit-and-run that killed
an innocent victim.

746
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:30,013
Then his life and career as a prosecutor
started to fall apart,

747
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,599
and he passed away.

748
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,938
One thing I'm sure of
is that Mr. Seo would not want

749
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,692
anyone else to suffer unjustly
because of his death.

750
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,862
The investigation began

751
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,491
with me pegged as the killer.

752
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,578
They only looked at evidence that put me

753
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,621
at a disadvantage and ignored the rest.

754
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,167
They completely dismissed the possibility
of it being a premeditated murder.

755
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,630
They shouldn't have focused
on the shoe prints to begin with.

756
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,591
If the goal was a perfect murder,

757
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,051
the killer mustn't have left
any shoe prints

758
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,803
to avoid becoming a suspect.

759
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:13,765
Would anyone be foolish enough to leave
shoe prints if it was premeditated?

760
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:21,732
Oh, I'm doing this because I do not wish
to leave a trail as a defendant.

761
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,819
I never imagined
I'd be tried as a defendant.

762
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:29,698
I always thought I'd be sitting here,
until I joined the law school.

763
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:32,409
Defendant, please be seated.

764
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:41,960
You made me a defendant. And for that,
I loathe you more than Mr. Seo.

765
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,503
PROSECUTION

766
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,173
But killing someone out of anger
and leaving my prints…

767
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,678
I'm not that foolish.

768
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,935
You think the killer had to have seen me
adding sugar at the scene

769
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,812
to take the empty sugar packet?

770
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,316
The killer could've witnessed it
without being at the scene.

771
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:08,070
What if there was a camera hidden
somewhere like the one in Ye-seul's room?

772
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:11,073
The killer was watching my uncle
elsewhere,

773
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,741
waiting for the perfect time.

774
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:16,953
Then when the job was done, the killer
took the sugar packet and the camera.

775
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,207
He had this pen during the mock trial,
but it's gone.

776
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,334
It wasn't there
when he was first found dead.

777
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,671
The victim's pen was nowhere to be found
on the day of the incident,

778
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,631
but the police wasn't interested.

779
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:33,136
And he dismissed the possibility
of methamphetamine being injected.

780
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,641
This needle mark here looks different
from these insulin injection marks.

781
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,684
You're right.

782
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:42,104
It looks like a thicker needle was used.

783
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,481
-What about the location?
-The upper abdomen.

784
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,693
The fat layer under the skin
around that area isn't that thick,

785
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,112
so it's not an ideal area
for insulin injections.

786
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,948
A deep injection into this spot here
would release the drug

787
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,366
directly into the stomach.

788
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:59,204
Then why did the police just assume
this was from an insulin injection?

789
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,167
Had the killer planned to drug
the victim's beverage,

790
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,712
it would've been done in secret.

791
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,963
Why is that?

792
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,841
Because the victim
would've resisted strongly otherwise.

793
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,427
Had the killer forced the victim
to take a lethal dose,

794
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,721
there would've been clear signs
of struggle.

795
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,390
There were no signs of struggle
or any defensive wounds.

796
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,271
If the killer had installed a camera
and managed to leave no prints,

797
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,940
he or she would've opted for an injection
as it's faster.

798
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:29,526
If you drug someone's beverage,
on the other hand,

799
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,445
it'd depend on the person,

800
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,197
but it could take up to 30 minutes.

801
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,076
But in case of an intravenous injection,
it only takes a few seconds.

802
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,997
Even if it's not an IV injection,
it rarely takes more than ten minutes.

803
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,584
If the killer injected the victim
with methamphetamine

804
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:49,004
at around 14:25
after Kang Sol B and I left,

805
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:52,549
it closely matches
the estimated time of death as well.

806
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,221
Shoe prints.

807
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,932
A hidden camera and an injection.

808
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,102
The prosecution should have
suspected these

809
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,272
and should not have ruled out
such possibilities.

810
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:10,692
You must not only hear and see
what you want to believe.

811
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,445
You shouldn't be foolish enough
to let the killer

812
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,823
roam free blinded by your false belief
that I'm the killer.

813
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,540
WITNESS

814
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,501
Do you really think I am the killer?

815
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,880
Don't you have a reasonable doubt now?

816
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,091
In dubio pro reo.

817
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,136
WITNESS

818
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,304
Please remember that.

819
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,932
JUDGE

820
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,266
Are you done?

821
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,980
WITNESS

822
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:54,736
This smoking gun will prove my alibi.

823
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,781
At the time of Prof. Seo's death,

824
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,450
Prof. Yang was in his office.

825
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:05,247
He called Prof. Seo as soon as he arrived

826
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,874
and made sure he had recovered

827
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,586
from the hypoglycemic episode
after drinking the coffee with sugar.

828
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,173
A student who had sneaked into my office
around the time of the incident

829
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,592
to hack my laptop
and ended up hiding in my closet,

830
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:21,429
recorded this statement
to help me prove my innocence.

831
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,477
I tried to persuade him to testify,
but failed.

832
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:32,357
But today, he mustered up the courage
to deliver this to me through Ms. Jeon.

833
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,150
PROSECUTION

834
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:36,319
Order!

835
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,696
010-523-6785

836
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,740
-Ms. Jeon Ye-seul.
-Yes.

837
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:41,950
Is it true?

838
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,076
JUDGE

839
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,538
-Yes, he gave it to me before I came here.
-Objection.

840
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:49,082
No need. I don't plan to submit it anyway.

841
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,500
-What?
-Why not?

842
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,920
Order!

843
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,676
Luckily, I was able to get my hands
on this smoking gun,

844
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,554
but this is considered inadmissible
at the moment.

845
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:03,597
Submit it.

846
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,433
Your Honor, I request
this piece of evidence be approved

847
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,184
and verified in this courtroom.

848
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,562
Regardless of this,

849
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,441
the Court's decision is…

850
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,402
That's what I want to know.

851
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,822
Over the course of this trial,

852
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,243
I did my best to invalidate the evidence
submitted by the prosecutor,

853
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,788
who launched the investigation
under the assumption that I am the killer.

854
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,836
The law scholar who testified
that there was sugar at the scene

855
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,006
is here today with an appeal letter
asking the Court not to question

856
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,674
the credibility of his testimony.

857
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,719
A student who lost his father
because of a prosecutor

858
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,596
who publicized mere allegations

859
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,682
is sitting over there, with faith
in the presumption of innocence.

860
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,061
Mr. Seo's frustrated nephew,
who's decided to take matters

861
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:54,439
into his own hands,
is also waiting to hear the decision.

862
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,441
The prosecutor

863
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:00,695
failed to prove that I am guilty
beyond all reasonable doubt.

864
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,864
Hence, I should be found not guilty.

865
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,956
As a professor who teaches criminal law…

866
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,123
JUDGE

867
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,877
…I never tell my students
that the law is just.

868
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,922
What makes the law just

869
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:22,467
are the judges' decisions based
on the presumption of innocence

870
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,429
and the law of evidence.
That is what I tell my students!

871
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,140
I hope the Court

872
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,644
shows the future law professionals

873
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,273
what it means
to make a truly fair decision.

874
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,071
Please show them by example.

875
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,616
I rest my case.

876
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,161
JUDGE

877
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,292
If I am found guilty after this,

878
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,714
I will submit this to the appeals court.

879
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,970
COURT

880
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,061
My, I had no idea you'd use it like that.

881
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:16,938
I learned a lot from you.

882
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,817
"In dubio pro reo." A defendant may not be
convicted when doubts remain?

883
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,946
I guess you're feeling confident.

884
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,239
Pulling this trick on me.

885
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,074
"Trick"?

886
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,205
Shall we go to the judge's office
and see what's here?

887
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,415
Sure.

888
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:39,252
We'll also show the judge the video
you watched during my closing argument.

889
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,424
So, you're deliberately barking up
the wrong tree.

890
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,594
Seo Ji-ho is the one barking up
the wrong tree.

891
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,221
If you don't want your student to be hurt,

892
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,974
persuade him to drop the case.

893
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,190
Jeez.

894
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:06,529
Man, I have to say,
Yang Jong-hoon is really something.

895
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,865
His closing argument almost got me.

896
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,284
It is a tough battle for Jin Hyeong-u.

897
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,162
Oh, Yang has been appointed
as a special defense counsel for…

898
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:17,707
What now?

899
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,627
Go away. Go!

900
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:22,587
Let's talk in private.

901
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,515
-Where are you going?
-Later.

902
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,892
-Hey, Kim!
-Spare me a minute.

903
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,852
I'm busy.

904
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,312
It's about your son.

905
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,652
POSTS

906
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,154
My dad made this toy.

907
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,450
You wrote that it contained
a cancer-causing chemical.

908
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,207
You had your bag stolen?

909
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,168
Then what was that flash drive earlier?

910
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,630
Gosh, he tricked us.

911
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,176
How's Seung-jae?
Did he say anything unusual?

912
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,763
He seemed down,
as if he was going somewhere far.

913
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,056
Somewhere far?

914
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,601
-He's not picking up.
-I know.

915
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,439
Seung-jae? Is that you? Oh…

916
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,066
Isn't this Yu Seung-jae's phone?

917
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,444
What? By the river?

918
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,904
Where is it?

919
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,700
-What's the matter?
-I think Seung-jae--

920
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,910
Isn't Seung-jae the one
who hacked the laptop?

921
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,537
It's him, right? Tell us.

922
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,955
-The smoking gun--
-Stop.

923
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,623
I told you to ask him directly.

924
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,958
Hey, let's go.

925
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,170
Try to gauge the situation
before you run your mouth.

926
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,212
Wait up!

927
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,465
Jeez, I can't even talk?

928
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,304
Come to the parking lot.

929
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,016
Wait.

930
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,145
Can we talk?

931
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,189
No, I have a prior engagement.

932
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,361
Call before the sentencing date.

933
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,034
Not after that.

934
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:25,376
FISHERY

935
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,673
Yu Seung-jae!

936
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,051
Prof. Kim.

937
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,681
You punk.

938
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,309
You could've turned your phone off
to avoid my calls.

939
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,186
Why throw it away by the river?

940
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,480
I thought something had happened…

941
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,614
I'm sorry.

942
00:58:58,826 --> 00:58:59,786
Drink up.

943
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,375
I should turn myself in sober.

944
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:19,514
Do you know what your grandparents
said to me most often?

945
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,143
"You must listen
to both sides of the story."

946
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:29,190
I needed a family who'd always
take my side no matter what.

947
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,611
So I told myself…

948
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:39,826
I should be a father who always
takes his child's side no matter what.

949
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,871
I told that to myself.

950
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,751
Is that why you scratched me off the list
for the court training?

951
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,255
Ms. Oh doesn't think

952
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,341
you plagiarized the paper.

953
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:59,095
That people forgot how smart you are
and jumped to conclusions.

954
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,389
Then all's good, right?

955
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:03,850
All's good?

956
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,519
What's the problem?

957
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,982
Your name isn't on that list because…

958
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,282
you don't qualify.

959
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,703
A law professional who's smart
but doesn't qualify.

960
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,498
Nothing's more dangerous than that.

961
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:36,591
Guys.

962
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,053
No matter what happens to Seung-jae,

963
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,221
let's all remember this.

964
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,642
We must help Ye-seul return to school.

965
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:47,935
HELP YE-SEUL

966
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,437
Stop trying to shut me up.

967
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,648
Ye-seul, don't worry. I promise you…

968
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,194
-Joon-hwi and I--
-Why rope Joon-hwi into it?

969
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,571
Must you be so obvious
about not feeling confident?

970
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,989
It's not that.

971
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,241
My point is, we should all join forces

972
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,660
and do this together.

973
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,705
Mr. Lee.

974
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,503
Do you see this girl gloating here

975
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:17,048
after hurting my son like that?

976
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,341
Have you no shame?

977
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,469
You should apologize to Yeong-chang
and reflect on what you did.

978
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:22,887
Mr. Lee.

979
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,932
They're saying she cheated on him
with you.

980
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,433
You should stay out of this.

981
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,611
What's the matter, sir?

982
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,072
What have you been doing
to manage the law school?

983
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,533
What a disgrace to Hankuk University.

984
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:47,370
A professor is being tried for murder,
and a student for aggravated assault.

985
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,456
You should've attended the trial today.

986
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,126
If Prof. Yang is found not guilty,

987
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:57,171
you'll be embarrassed of getting worked up
in front of the students.

988
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,089
What?

989
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:04,262
I'm sorry for what happened to your son.

990
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,513
Then,

991
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,600
you should not let this girl set foot
in school again.

992
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:13,396
Why are the professors and the students
trying to protect this criminal--

993
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:16,691
Let's wait and find out
whether she is a criminal or not.

994
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,990
Are you all here to help Ye-seul
prepare for her trial?

995
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:24,907
Yes, ma'am.

996
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,205
Let's go.

997
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,420
Kang Sol!

998
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:47,138
"Special defense counsel, self-defense."

999
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,474
I heard that was all your idea.

1000
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,896
Running your mouth like that--

1001
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,981
I will not regret it.

1002
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,527
I'm not Kang Dan
who regretted accepting your offer.

1003
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,653
What?

1004
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:06,073
Do you also like to install spy cams
like your son does?

1005
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:10,203
I really want to know how you found out

1006
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,913
that it was my idea.

1007
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:28,554
The dean got on the wrong side
of the president and Ko Hyeong-su.

1008
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,225
Do a good job, or she'll be the first one
on the chopping block.

1009
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,645
I can't believe she provoked them,
counting on you guys.

1010
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,688
You all heard that?

1011
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,816
Let's see if we can find
a lower court case

1012
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,818
like Ye-seul's
that was ruled self-defense.

1013
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,821
I'm out, as of today.

1014
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,739
I'm starting at Hyeongseol tomorrow.

1015
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:49,992
Why Hyeongseol?

1016
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,328
It's a great opportunity for Ji-ho.

1017
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,496
I'm okay.

1018
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:57,500
Don't worry about me.
Just do a good job and seal the deal.

1019
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,671
Good luck to you too,
but Hyeongseol won't be easy.

1020
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:02,755
Must you be so mean?

1021
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:07,009
When they're doing your reference check,
I'll tell them you're a jerk.

1022
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,178
You can't do that to your study mate.

1023
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,515
Just don't join Ko Yeong-chang's counsel.

1024
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:15,643
I feel like we're losing
a thousand soldiers,

1025
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,896
but show them what you can do.

1026
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,191
I'll do a good job.

1027
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,903
Do you really want to threaten me
with a reference check

1028
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,280
in front of Ye-seul?

1029
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,448
God, that jerk!

1030
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,867
I can't stand him.

1031
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,077
I'm not jealous, you know.

1032
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,079
I found a case.

1033
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,057
I'm here.

1034
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,696
I arrived just now.

1035
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,315
Prof. Yang gave it to me
and said it's my uncle's.

1036
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,400
Why do you think
he purposely gave it to me?

1037
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,946
It means someone instigated
the culprit to kill me.

1038
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:53,532
-It's different from the deal we made!
-It means he started to get agitated.

1039
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,785
How dare you come here?

1040
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,787
You want to write an article about Mr. Ko?

1041
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,830
I'll help you report exclusive news.

1042
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,123
What?

1043
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,584
The prosecutor offered to suspend
his indictment.

1044
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,295
You won't be able to control Seung-jae
as you want.

1045
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,047
Prof. Yang found it out only now?

1046
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,008
Therefore, according to Article 258
of the Criminal Code,

1047
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:14,095
the defendant is indicted
for grievous bodily harm.

1048
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,558
