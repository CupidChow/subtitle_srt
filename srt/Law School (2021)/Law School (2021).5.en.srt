KANG SOL B'S PLAGIARIZED DISSERTATION

3
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,656
MY VIEW ON KANG SOL B'S PLAGIARISM

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,533
BY PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

5
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,918
Bring me the laptop.

6
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,310
You think I can't find you, right?

7
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,231
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

8
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,006
I thought I made it clear.

9
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,552
You aren't allowed
to use a laptop in my class.

10
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,636
Professor.

11
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,722
A student's right
to use a laptop in class is

12
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,474
a matter of self-determination

13
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,268
as guaranteed by the Constitution.

14
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,435
And?

15
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,772
I don't want Article 10,
the right to pursue happiness, infringed

16
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,066
during the Constitution lecture.

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,067
Don't you think

18
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,196
what you just said infringes
my right to hold classes as the professor?

19
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,073
This is my court,

20
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,993
and I have a right to teach however I like
when I'm in my turf.

21
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,746
Don't you think you're abusing your right?

22
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,082
It's your dereliction of duty
as a student!

23
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,293
I'll have points deducted.

24
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,133
Do you believe others
didn't bring their laptops

25
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,551
just because of their grades?

26
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,595
I don't know what others are thinking.

27
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,556
I weighed the pros and cons
of using a laptop during this class,

28
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,933
and decided having it here
benefits me more.

29
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,518
Then was this on your list?

30
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,856
The fatal fact that you will be remembered
as the worst student

31
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,149
I ever had in my career.

32
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,623
Yes, Professor Kang.

33
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,834
Did you tell Kang Sol B to pick up
her laptop at my office?

34
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,711
She hasn't come for it yet?

35
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,338
I clearly remember telling her.

37
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,052
Professor?

38
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,888
Are you sure this laptop
is Kang Sol B's laptop?

39
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,140
Yes, I almost had to take it from her
by force.

KANG SOL B'S PLAGIARIZED DISSERTATION

KANG SOL B'S…

48
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,459
MY VIEW ON KANG SOL B'S PLAGIARISM

49
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,794
BY YANG JONG-HOON

50
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,005
I found this while preparing a paper
on publicizing criminal charges.

51
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,091
The student in question is

52
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,343
Kang Sol B, a freshman at our school.

53
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,429
This is practically a translated copy

54
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,722
of a paper you wrote

55
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,141
for Law Review
while you were studying at Harvard.

56
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,688
KANG SOL

57
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,440
I'll meet Kang Sol B first to check

58
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,985
-the facts of the matter--
-No.

59
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,488
I'll see her first.

60
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,412
Bring me the laptop.

61
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,967
You think I can't find you, right?

62
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,219
FROM YANG JONG-HOON

63
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:06,931
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

64
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,980
What brings you here at this hour?

65
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,940
Please take a seat.

66
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,322
If it's about the dismissal--

67
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,908
I can't resolve that by visiting you.
I'm visiting the president tomorrow.

68
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,660
Then what brings you here?

69
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,080
The biggest reason for my arrest
was destruction of evidence

70
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,749
because my laptop went missing.

71
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,125
I've heard.

72
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,127
At first, I thought I had lost it,

73
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,463
then remembered
keeping it in my office that day.

74
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,466
Why are you telling me this?

75
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,718
Someone could've stolen it.

76
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,720
I'm having a reasonable doubt.

77
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,015
Someone stole it?
Why would anyone steal your laptop?

78
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,808
What do you think?

79
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,270
It was a new laptop, so it only had
references for the plagiarism.

80
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,231
There were no leads or evidence
that'd point to the culprit.

81
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,317
There was no reason for me to hide that.

82
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,280
References for the plagiarism?

83
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,948
I bet you saw that too.

84
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,868
My view on the plagiarism
of Kang Sol B's research paper.

85
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,287
Why do you have 12?

86
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,500
If you had some until this morning,
you should have six left.

87
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,507
You haven't taken this for three days!

88
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,386
That's why you missed the comma.

89
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,227
Take it.

90
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,106
It wouldn't have happened
if you lived at home.

91
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,004
Hey, what are you doing?

92
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,970
LAW SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

93
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,809
Happy now?

94
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,811
I'm staying here.

95
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,282
We need some privacy.

96
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,117
What?

97
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,790
She has the same name?

98
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,335
I never liked how you had to share a room
with that girl.

99
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,673
B? Why should my daughter be the B?

100
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,508
This is so annoying.

101
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,928
Are you saying Kang Sol B

102
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,849
took your laptop
because of your opinion on her plagiarism?

103
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,936
The content is also in my head,
so that can't be the only reason.

104
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,440
In that case,
do you think the reason she took it has

105
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,860
a connection to Professor Seo's death?

106
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,032
I'm staying here.

107
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,244
-You're going to stay here?
-Yes.

108
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,461
Again?

109
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,714
Your dad's the last one
who gets to defy me.

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,344
Spit it out.

111
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,139
I'll go with you, so spit it out.

112
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,107
She missed the comma
for not taking her medicine?

113
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,570
Whoa, hey. Are you okay?

114
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,155
I'm fine.

115
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,658
Whoa.

116
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,542
Ye-seul.

117
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,043
Sol, I'm fine.

118
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,212
I think I had too much to drink.

119
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,215
I'll go to sleep.

120
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,216
Okay.

121
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,220
Are you sure you're okay?

122
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,847
Have you met with Kang Sol B?

123
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,849
Not yet.

124
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,104
I waited for Professor Seo
to meet her first before I dealt with her.

125
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,816
The president is already deeply concerned
that a murder case broke out

126
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,359
at our law school.

127
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,486
If the controversy
over plagiarism breaks out…

128
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,947
Covering it up may be an option.

129
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,240
That's not what I meant.

130
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,492
Once we restore the school's reputation--

131
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,078
Please do your best
to restore our ruined reputation.

132
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:39,996
Professor Yang.

133
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,747
I'll manage the plagiarism case.

134
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,667
Professor Yang!

135
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,008
I knew I shouldn't have
let you join a study group.

136
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,385
Those good-for-nothing study mates

137
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,845
made your grades drop too.

138
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,933
How on earth can your grades
be that low for the Criminal Code?

139
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,310
And the Constitution too.

140
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,354
Did you have to get points deducted
over a laptop?

141
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,690
At least you still got an A plus.

142
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,694
It doesn't matter anyway
because of my paper.

143
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,487
No one will turn that into a problem.

144
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,450
Only victims can complain about copyright,
and Seo Byung-ju is dead.

145
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,118
Yang Jong-hoon.

146
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,454
Professor Yang knows.

147
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,956
No one would believe a murderer.

148
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,833
Don't get weird ideas and--

149
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,876
The sugar packet.

150
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,045
It was on the table as he stated.

151
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,714
So what?

152
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,931
It wasn't Professor Yang who…

153
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,690
Tell me.

154
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,234
If it wasn't him, who was it?

155
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,786
METH LETHAL DOSE

156
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,458
Why won't he pick up his phone?

157
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,644
Hello?

158
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,358
Your daughter saw the sugar packet.

159
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,320
Why did she lie to the police?

160
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,572
That's not all.

161
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,907
I looked at her phone too.

162
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,701
"Meth lethal dose, where to get meth,
how long does it take

163
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,745
for a person to die after meth intake?"

164
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,498
Why did she search for these?

165
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,375
Could it be her?

166
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,252
No, right?

167
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,505
It's not about her
stopping to go to the psychiatrist.

168
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,842
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

169
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,596
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

170
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,781
Kang Sol.

171
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,284
Your laptop is in the professor's office.

172
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,202
-Why?
-It was his order.

173
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,328
You're to pick it up.

174
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,206
So why did you insist on having
the laptop--

175
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,922
KANG JU-MAN, IN A MEETING

176
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,881
Yang Jong-hoon's laptop
wasn't in Han Joon-hwi's locker or room.

177
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,301
He said the one who took
the laptop is the culprit?

178
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,162
Let's go study.

179
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,016
Dry my hair.

180
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,518
You can use that as an apology.

181
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,107
I had reasons to doubt.

182
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,942
You did feel sorry.

183
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,820
Then just say you're sorry.

184
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,031
-That's too hot!
-Gosh, I'm sorry.

185
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,491
It was cold wind.

186
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,911
That was easy, right?

187
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,542
Anyway, about the sugar packet
Prof. Yang mentioned.

188
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,085
You didn't see it on the scene?

189
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,212
No. Why?

190
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,591
If someone can testify
that the sugar packet was there,

191
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,968
it'd help him greatly.

192
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,578
I got my own problems,
but this case looks frustrating too.

193
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,537
I'M IN A LIBEL SUIT

194
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,790
-How did you know?
-My gosh.

195
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,667
Why couldn't you be here sooner?

196
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,338
Go join the police
if you can spot autopsy fabrication.

197
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,255
That?

198
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,090
I took a completely wild guess,

199
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,383
so I just got lucky.

200
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,386
That Gollum with connections
did all the big work.

201
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,597
What about your aunt?

202
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,266
She should be punished for her crime.

203
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,186
What are you up to?

204
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,772
"Bad FaMa"?

205
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,316
Yes, a website that exposes parents
who refuse to give

206
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,026
child support after their divorce.

207
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,655
The website operator got sued for libel.

208
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,951
So what's with this familiar face?

209
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,286
You know my situation.

210
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,789
I have too many papers due
and too much to study.

211
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,540
Yet Kang Sol's passionate heart

212
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,751
refuses to turn down
this frustrating case?

213
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,337
Why didn't you just study

214
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,255
instead of joining the Legal Clinic?

215
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,300
I can see everything.

216
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,681
If I help, let's call it even
for you helping me.

217
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,974
Even, my foot.

218
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,060
You need to prove
Professor Yang's innocence.

219
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,398
What's this?

220
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,315
MY ROOMMATE HAS LEFT

221
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,984
She's dropping our study group?

222
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,319
Dropping? Who's dropping what?

223
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,863
I thought you came back.

224
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,448
Welcome back.

225
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,201
I'm sorry to make you worried.

226
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,621
What time are we visiting them tomorrow?

227
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,081
-At four o'clock.
-Okay.

228
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,417
Did you look through the website?

229
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,376
I did.

230
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,377
Can you print that?

231
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,920
Okay.

232
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,971
Just do as I say.

233
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,227
We stopped seeing the psychiatrist,

234
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,354
but we've done well.

235
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,524
If you really think so,
let me stay in the dorm.

236
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,986
No.

237
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,780
Drop the study group, get a tutor.

238
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,618
You know the first-year grades
are very important to be a law clerk.

239
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,205
Stay focused on your study.

240
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,374
Do you understand?

241
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,462
Don't worry and just do as I say, then--

242
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,755
Speak for yourself.

243
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,599
Sol.

244
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,979
Is this why
you didn't let us read your paper?

245
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,618
I've been meaning to come and see you,

246
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,495
and I happened to take your call.

247
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,580
Vice Dean Kang said

248
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,333
you met the dean
over your daughter's grades.

249
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,961
I went to see her as a parent
of a student at Hankuk Law School

250
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,005
over the nonsense of how they let someone

251
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,926
who got arrested for murder charges
write the midterm test questions.

252
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:18,931
On top of that, you're indicted
and removed from your office.

253
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,016
I was removed
as an administrative measure.

254
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,601
It's as good as a punishment.

255
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,562
If you'll be tried for murder charges,
doesn't it disqualify you

256
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,023
as a professor at a law school?

257
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,859
Before you say that,
let's discuss your daughter's paper.

258
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,113
It wasn't just plagiarism,
but copyright infringement.

259
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,865
Since her grand prize
played a part in her admission,

260
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,700
so it could be revoked too.

261
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,286
Remember?
I was fluent in English by middle school,

262
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,122
getting full marks in TOEFL and TEPS.

263
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,334
As you can see, she also participated
in global mock trials, mock UN committee,

264
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,212
and was awarded
in various debate competitions.

265
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,090
Weren't you jealous
when I won the Best Reporter Award

266
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,716
at the Constitutional Court

267
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,094
over high school and university students?

268
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,471
But this paper, in middle school?

269
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,473
Sol helped him write that paper,

270
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,766
but he only listed

271
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,477
his name on the byline
when he turned it into Harvard Law.

272
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,855
Are you saying
Prof. Seo took advantage of her?

273
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,898
He said he can't finish that dissertation,

274
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,233
so we thought that was it.

275
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,153
We didn't know he published the paper
without her knowledge.

276
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,197
He completely disregarded
that middle school girl.

277
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,367
So your daughter had no idea
he published the paper?

278
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,078
I just wrote my paper
with the material I researched.

279
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,956
-And she submitted it in the contest.
-In conclusion,

280
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,624
this is a middle schooler's paper?

281
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,293
All of her father's side is in law.

282
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,503
Her home was filled with law books.

283
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,505
She played with those since kindergarten,

284
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,466
and knew the Constitution
better than the National Anthem.

285
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,927
She's capable of doing this
with her born legal mind.

286
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,971
That's for me to decide as a professor.

287
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,389
I don't care if you buy it.

288
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,685
You must be disappointed.

289
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,854
You wanted me gone like Joon-hwi.

290
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,731
No way.

291
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,317
He was so happy
that he even dried my hair.

292
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,861
I'm glad, then.

293
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,488
You wrote a paper in middle school?

294
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,911
With what you can do, I believe that.

295
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,999
I apologize for how my uncle
treated you with disdain.

296
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,468
Fabricating the cause of death?

297
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,220
I thought it happened only on TV.

298
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,139
I knew you didn't do it.

299
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,308
You even announced
how suspicious Joon-hwi was.

300
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,643
That's because…

301
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,648
my grades were already very awful,

302
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,108
so I couldn't risk
getting on Yangcrates' bad side.

303
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,698
How much do you want
to forget how I offended you?

304
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,076
I'll pay up over 24 months!

305
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,214
I wanted your side of the story.

306
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,301
Prof. Seo prepared his paper with you

307
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,346
while you were in middle school,
then published it as his own?

308
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,224
Yes.

309
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,768
If I had known he published that paper,

310
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,354
I wouldn't have turned it in
for the contest.

311
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,357
I heard you'd met with Prof. Seo.

312
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,777
KANG SOL

313
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,990
KANG SOL

314
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,704
Come in.

315
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,130
Take a seat.

316
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,974
With my mom.

317
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,312
She was very angry

318
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,940
that my paper was mistaken as plagiarized.

319
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,320
According to your mother,

320
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,864
Prof. Seo apologized to you, right?

321
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,747
Is it me this time?

322
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,583
So what if he doesn't believe it?

323
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,211
We told him that's our case.

324
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,466
How is he going to cross-check this
with a dead man?

325
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,927
Enough is enough!

326
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,971
Your daughter and I are perfectly sane.

327
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,181
It's all your fault!

328
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,065
I had a question.

329
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,042
Dad.

330
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,930
If only you passed the judicial exam
and became a judge.

331
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,441
You were with me at the time

332
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,819
when Prof. Seo was murdered?

333
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,279
Do you think the reason she took it has

334
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,365
a connection to Professor Seo's death?

335
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,455
No, it wasn't her. She was with me
when the case broke out.

336
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,706
She was with you?

337
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,376
She insisted on using her laptop in class,

338
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,837
so I called her and had a talk with her.

339
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,296
You weren't.

340
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,549
You didn't say that to the police.

341
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,643
Then why

342
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,895
didn't you say anything?

343
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,106
You said you saw this.

344
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,533
What about you?

345
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,411
Why didn't you say anything?

346
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,583
I have a sweet tooth.

347
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,876
You needed Prof. Yang

348
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,211
-to become the suspect--
-Enough.

349
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,508
We'll talk at home.

350
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,263
What if Prof. Yang sees this?

351
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,016
Don't bring this to school.

352
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,435
Make his suspicion solid.

353
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,065
Did you get rid of his laptop?

354
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,373
Are you okay?

355
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,835
How can I be okay?
I can't even give a lecture.

356
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,962
Should I nitpick over this
with the president?

357
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,508
This one is a criminal case.

358
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,596
Since I gave birth, it's too much
to be the chief of the Legal Clinic.

359
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,809
Hey, what's this? "Kang Sol B"?

360
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,853
My goodness.

361
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,564
I knew she was smart,
but she's this smart?

362
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:29,069
My gosh, in middle school?
Gosh, my son is nothing compared to her.

363
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,612
I'll take this case.

364
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,781
You should manage your own problem first.

365
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,407
What about the president?

366
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,701
She wrote that herself,
so compare those two.

367
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,747
Prof. Seo's paper.

368
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,790
What?

369
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,625
What is this?

370
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,674
HAN JOON-HWI

371
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,092
HAN JOON-HWI INVITED KANG SOL

372
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,803
SETTINGS

373
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,762
EXIT

374
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,347
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO EXIT?

375
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,398
HAN JOON-HWI

376
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,777
So you're leaving us?

377
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,989
-What will you do instead?
-Get a tutor.

378
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,464
When you search
for Hankuk University on the Internet,

379
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,926
all you get is "the Law School murderer."

380
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,512
Hankuk University
is now equal to a murderer!

381
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,597
In the National Assembly,

382
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,767
our alumni are hanging our heads in shame!

383
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,229
We already put him off duty,
so we'll punish him later--

384
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,773
Later, my ass. Dismiss him this instant!

385
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,151
A professor of a law school

386
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,153
is involved in a crime
none other than murder.

387
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,321
He murdered him!

388
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,073
He hasn't been tried,
so his charges aren't confirmed.

389
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,075
So you're going to sit here

390
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,744
and take the shame until then?

391
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,538
People are
only presumed innocent on paper.

392
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,790
Don't you know everyone
is presumed as guilty?

393
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,084
The fact that he's indicted
means he's guilty!

394
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,172
Before the alumni
stop donating to the school--

395
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,633
President, Prof. Yang Jong-hoon
of the Law School wishes to see you.

396
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,844
I'll call him.

397
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,556
Don't let him resign.

398
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,974
He should be fired

399
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,770
so that he can't show up here ever again.

400
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,917
The Law School murderer.

401
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,252
How arrogant.

402
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,589
You won't even greet me.

403
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,011
Did you want to be greeted by the murderer
of your closest friend?

404
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,971
You're right.

405
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,435
I never got to say one last goodbye
to my closest friend.

406
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,566
You may have avoided detention
even though you murdered somebody,

407
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,278
but you better not dream
of sticking around at the Law School.

408
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,406
I will

409
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,909
make sure I cut your throat.

410
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,038
If that's why you came,
you came here in vain.

411
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,707
I'll accept my removal
according to our rules,

412
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,209
but nothing more than that.

413
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,711
I'll do whatever it takes
within the scope of law

414
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,588
to fight and struggle.

415
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,923
What?

416
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,137
I get how you've gone crazy.

417
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,972
You've been indicted.

418
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,141
Assemblyman Ko.

419
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,977
When your close friend
indicted you for bribery,

420
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,895
you asserted very confidently

421
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,274
indictment doesn't equal guilt,
that you won't be caught in this frame.

422
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,360
It made me almost gag.

423
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,240
How long will you continue to be so sassy?

424
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,617
We'll see about that.

425
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,745
On the day he died,

426
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,206
why do you think
I tried to get on a flight?

427
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,962
I've been looking for Kang Dan.
I'll leave you at that.

428
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,350
What? Professor Yang?

429
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,312
Yes, okay.

430
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,736
BAD FAMA

431
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,783
What did your kids do to deserve this?

432
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,161
Their real names, occupations,
and photos of their faces.

433
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,871
That's too much personal info.

434
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,706
Are you worried about these people?

435
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,041
I'm worried about you.

436
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,626
You got papers and studies to do.

437
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,046
Stop talking to me.
I have to be Prof. Yang's assistant.

438
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,590
Prof. Kim said
he's coming in for the consultation--

439
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,717
-I'm doing this.
-What?

440
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,427
Prof. Yang asked me for help.

441
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,763
Be a good assistant.

442
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,604
How can the defendant
summon the prosecutor in charge?

443
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,650
After you're indicted, you'll be in court.

444
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,735
We didn't have to take this to court,

445
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,071
so you needed a chance
to drop the indictment.

446
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,075
First, release you, then drop this?

447
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,162
You're telling me to lose my face and job.

448
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,497
Go ahead.

449
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,543
There's nothing more dangerous
as wasting time as a prosecutor.

450
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,593
"A prosecutor who wastes time
brings shame to that scale."

451
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,805
You remembered that?

452
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,932
The dead victim used to say that often.

453
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,726
And also something
you should've remembered, Prosecutor Jin.

454
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,146
I see. I'm guessing that you remembered.

455
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,693
It turns out
that Prosecutor Seo wasted his time,

456
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,822
so I can see why you got mad
with a sense of betrayal.

457
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,203
I need to go put all of my efforts
into keeping this indictment going.

458
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,123
See you in court.

459
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:18,877
Right.

460
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,963
After you quit your job as a prosecutor,

461
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,674
Prosecutor Seo got completely wasted
and said this.

462
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,429
"If I end up dying,

463
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,849
I'll die in the hands
of Yang Jong-hoon, that jerk."

464
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,365
His children were
about to starve to death,

465
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,783
but he threw a feast

466
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,996
at a hotel restaurant on his birthday,
costing at least 100,000 won per person,

467
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,749
and got a luxury-brand bag
for his mistress.

468
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,169
Eight out of ten people
never receive child support.

469
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,256
I believe Child Support Agency exists
under the MOGEF.

470
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,008
Even with the request,

471
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,386
it takes a year and a half to two years
until a decision is made.

472
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,932
The livelihood is breaking down,

473
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,224
and the child…

474
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,854
Even when the court orders them
to pay the support,

475
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,481
many of them don't do it.

476
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,692
If they don't,
the worst punishment is detention.

477
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,028
But if they use a false address
or go off the grid

478
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,863
for six months, they get off.

479
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,201
And there are numbers of them
who'd rather be detained than pay up.

480
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,079
So did you want to punish them personally?

481
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,499
By putting them to shame?

482
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,710
That's not it.

483
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,797
The purpose of this website is
to shame them and make them pay.

484
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,256
Isn't that it?

485
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,973
Anyone with a child
would understand how I feel.

486
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,599
Even so, nothing will change.

487
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,686
All these people's information got out
because they had kids.

488
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,983
You came here as a defendant,
not a victim.

489
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,151
Joon-hwi.

490
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,989
I shouldn't have come.

491
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,368
Wait. You can't leave like this.

492
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,078
I grew up with a single mother,

493
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,663
so I understand how you feel.

494
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,375
Thank you.

495
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,294
I…

496
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,633
Don't you think you're too harsh?

497
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,176
She's a defendant?

498
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,095
She was a victim before she got accused!

499
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,680
She's in question for libel.

500
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,266
And she got sued over that,
so she is the defendant.

501
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,809
Professor, she was desperate--

502
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,061
You're giving legal,
not psychological advice.

503
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,147
Instead of getting emotional
and worked up,

504
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,940
you're to provide a solution calmly.

505
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,777
Present how you'll counter this.

506
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,988
Me?

507
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,742
You made him innocent
after he was sued for defamation.

508
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,830
Good luck.

509
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,421
Professor.

510
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,631
This is ripped up,

511
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,134
but is this the same sugar packet
from the crime?

512
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,686
CODE OF LAW, CRIMINAL CODE,
HANDS-ON CIVIL CASES

513
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:42,872
J2008B4 DECISION

514
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,791
J2008B4 DECISION

515
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,964
LEGAL ARTICLES: CHILD SUPPORT

516
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,800
IF CHILD SUPPORT IS 12 MONTHS OVERDUE…

517
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,904
Do you understand this concept?

518
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,990
Let's take a look at this explanation.

519
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,743
For example, even if
the debtor owes 10 million won,

520
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,787
if the trustee is insolvent,

521
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,082
if they have zero funds,
the actual value can be zero won.

522
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,166
In that case…

523
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,794
HAN JOON-HWI: YOU'LL REALLY GET A TUTOR?

524
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,716
MOM: DINNER IS READY

525
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,231
YOU HAVE 2 FINGERPRINT IDS

526
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,734
What is this?

527
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,612
Just a mom looking at her girl's phone.

528
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,823
What? Are you hiding something?

529
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,705
-What is this?
-I can't stay home.

530
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,834
Go to your room.

531
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:13,212
-Your tutor will be here.
-I can't stay here.

532
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,925
Is it that jerk, Han Joon-hwi?

533
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,473
You have no time to fool around
with jerks like him.

534
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,813
Go back to your room.

535
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,900
I went through much trouble
trying to get this tutor

536
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,694
who never does one-on-one lessons--

537
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,987
I don't need a tutor.

538
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,406
I wrote a paper in middle school.

539
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,035
What?

540
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,163
-You--
-I'm that good.

541
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,998
So why do I need help?

542
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,583
What's with you?

543
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,710
Is something wrong with you?

544
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,546
Go ahead and leave

545
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,506
if you can.

546
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,301
Don't spit it out.

547
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,725
Swallow it.

548
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,980
Gulp it down.

549
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,148
Swallow it.

550
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,906
You can't even swallow that.

551
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,868
Enough is enough.

552
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,955
Mom.

553
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,627
Whoever dies,

554
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,422
I'm not scared of that.

555
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,184
I'm going back to my dorm.

556
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,049
The law is there, but it's useless.

557
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,343
If someone doesn't want
to pay child support,

558
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,011
there are loopholes everywhere.

559
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,139
Gosh, this darned rhinitis.

560
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,728
Hey, Joon-hwi.
Go back to your room and sleep.

561
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,690
Whoa.

562
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,276
Why?

563
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,279
I mean, think of how the children are
suffering from this.

564
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,908
Children are the victims
of unpaid child supports.

565
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,663
Darn it. We should give them
criminal punishment like other countries.

566
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,251
It was for the public's good
to protect children's survival.

567
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,338
I need to make this argument
and have it accepted.

568
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,091
This is justified
since it's in the public interest?

569
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,425
That's your specialty.

570
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,095
But this one won't be easy.

571
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,223
Unlike Lee Man-ho's time,
it was done on a website run by a mother

572
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,017
who got no child support,
not a governmental institution.

573
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,104
Exactly. She didn't just expose
her ex-husband's information.

574
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,273
She had a verifying process
through checking decisions

575
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,483
to upload other people--

576
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,152
That means creditors can make a website

577
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,238
and upload information of their debtors?

578
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,781
-That's not right.
-Why not?

579
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,784
Both cases want to shame people for money.

580
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,203
Fine. I get that you're a big shot.

581
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,373
This is my limit.

582
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,503
Hey, if we don't make her innocent,

583
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,631
those shameless parents
who refuse to pay child support will

584
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,092
get confident
and feel justified for their actions.

585
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,928
Then what about the kids?
Their lives will be tormented.

586
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,347
I can't let that happen.

587
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,016
Should the big shot help?

588
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,476
You said it's my specialty.

589
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,492
That day,

590
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,664
I wanted Professor Seo
to disappear from before my eyes.

591
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,588
Hye-gyeong, your daughter…

592
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,590
I left you for that man,

593
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,302
yet he failed the judicial exam
and gave up,

594
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,347
and he became the ugly duckling
in his family of judges.

595
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:16,932
So I decided

596
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,354
to lay my life down
to turn her into a judge.

597
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,692
I told her to copy your paper.

598
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,111
-Hye-gyeong.
-Don't make an issue.

599
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,572
If you do, her life

600
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,116
and my life will both end.

601
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,245
You don't

602
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,083
want me to die and disappear, do you?

603
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,129
Does your husband know?

604
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,300
How did you end up like this?

605
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,346
It's all my fault.

606
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,934
If I turned out
the way she wanted me to be,

607
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,854
she wouldn't have been
this obsessed with you.

608
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,315
The milk is split.

609
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,610
We can't put it back,

610
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,737
but we can wipe it away.

611
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,953
Nothing happened to us.

612
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,165
Did you lose the laptop?

613
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,085
What will you do with your made-up alibi?

614
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,796
Prof. Yang will see the police record.

615
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,509
Let's not do this.

616
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,221
-Let's turn--
-No, not that.

617
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,015
-I don't want my life to end here.
-Sol.

618
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,559
You said it was your fault.

619
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,812
Then just do as I say.

620
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,398
Nothing happened to us.

621
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,782
I'll get a taxi.

622
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,049
Do you think I left Byung-ju

623
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,927
just to put up a photo like this
in my living room?

624
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,931
Will one of us have to die
before you stop saying that?

625
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,315
The public interest.

626
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,193
How am I going to prove
she did it in the public interest?

627
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,283
Hey, are you back?

628
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,995
I'm glad you're back.

629
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,538
It was too empty without you.

630
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,128
Are you coming back
to the study group too?

631
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:26,914
It's the same kind.

632
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,749
Where did you find it?

633
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,987
I found a single-serve sugar packet here,

634
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,364
not an ordinary packaging.

635
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,201
At first, the sugar packet
was found on the floor.

636
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,703
After he used it,

637
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,125
the packaging was left on the table.

638
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:23,846
That sugar packet.

639
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,808
Who dropped it and why?

640
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,853
COLOR PRINTER: 100 WON

641
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,612
Gollum will kill us if he catches us.

642
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,864
He won't do it if we ask.

643
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,615
And why are you such a coward?

644
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,993
We can just copy, pay up, and leave.

645
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,171
-My gosh.
-What was that?

646
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,382
Future prosecutors and judges.

647
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,469
You're in an empty store all alone
making copies

648
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,929
of someone's copyrighted work to study?

649
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,056
I won't let that happen.

650
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,518
-Get lost!
-Everyone else does this anyway.

651
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,353
Why are you the only one who won't?

652
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,230
I can't do it. Do you see this?

653
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,773
It's illegal to copy books.

654
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,775
But our textbooks are too expensive.

655
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,070
Please save the poor law students
and let us copy these.

656
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,947
No matter how expensive it is,

657
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,201
you violated the Copyright Act
of a Copyright Law textbook.

658
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,911
Must I let go of this irony?

659
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,497
It's not our main textbook,
and we just need an excerpt.

660
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,624
Paying 50,000 won for that is
like tyranny.

661
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,375
Am I the tyrant here?

662
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,544
If you want a portion,
just copy that part.

663
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,589
They don't tell us what that portion is
to make us buy the book.

664
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,174
What?

665
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,927
That's just completely unfair.

666
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,263
Go complain to your professor.

667
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,224
-Go complain to them!
-My gosh!

668
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,601
-Okay? Go complain to them!
-Move, move!

669
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,811
-Go! Go away! Go!
-What's going on--

670
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,858
Do you have a death wish?

671
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:05,030
Jung Dae-hyeon, that jerk.
Wasn't taking Yangcrates' class enough?

672
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,991
He pulled a cheap trick
to make them buy his wife's book.

673
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,535
NO ILLEGAL COPYING ALLOWED!

674
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,995
He shouldn't take advantage of them.

675
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,331
He could just make copies
to use in his class.

676
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,795
Hand it back.

677
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,341
I heard you'll be studying
the Copyright Act in Criminal Code.

678
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,509
-Yes.
-Okay.

679
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,845
Compensation is an important aspect
of copyright suits,

680
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,764
so we'll take a look at it too.

681
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:34,268
And Prof. Jung will do his class
only on that portion,

682
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,978
so you won't have to buy a book.

683
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,398
-All right!
-I knew it, Prof. Kim.

684
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,774
She took one for the team.

685
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:44,319
She truly loves her students.
Professor Kim! I love you deeply.

686
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,113
-I love you!
-I love you!

687
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,573
-I love you!
-I love you!

688
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,867
Why don't you show some true love
for the Civil Code too?

689
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,953
Why are your grades the lowest

690
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,414
for the Civil Code
despite my awesome lectures?

691
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,456
It kills my pride.

692
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,666
-It's hard.
-It's tough.

693
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,294
It's not fun if it's too easy.

694
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,838
The best law firms
will look at your Civil Code grades

695
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,798
before they hire you, so what now?

696
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,302
Now, let's make sure we do this right! Go!

697
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,095
-Okay!
-Yes, ma'am.

698
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,806
What do you think of
when you hear copyright infringement?

699
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:13,765
Plagiarism.

700
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,017
Paper plagiarism.

701
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,686
Paper plagiarism. That's a hot potato.

702
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:22,274
Let's say I plagiarized the paper
of Kang Sol B, who's sitting here.

703
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,483
Is that an infringement?

704
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,527
If it's plagiarized, it is, right?

705
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,529
Plagiarism doesn't equal infringement.

706
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,114
A valid copyright infringement

707
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:32,284
must include grounds
that are both subjective and objective.

708
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,578
Plagiarism is usually an ethical issue,

709
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:38,123
but it's not a copyright violation
that involves punishment and compensation.

710
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,876
Yes, the line between plagiarism

711
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,378
and copyright infringement is very vague.

712
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,340
You have perfect examples
of copyright infringement before you.

713
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,550
They got
at least one illegal textbook copy.

714
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:56,016
You're giving a lecture before criminals
who have infringed copyright.

715
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,893
And of course, I've never done that.

716
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,937
She always does that.

717
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,816
Right, what about the Bad FaMa case?

718
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,443
The opinion is under way.

719
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,655
Make sure you do a good job and win.

720
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,198
I'm not doing it.

721
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,117
Then who? Sol A?

722
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,537
It's going to be tough for her.

723
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,373
Only someone like you has a chance.

724
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,382
I'm very sorry.

725
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:32,469
It's important, so I need to do better,
but I can't seem to do it.

726
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,846
This won't work.

727
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,059
I'm sorry. You trusted me with this.

728
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,061
You don't have my trust, so try again.

729
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,355
What? Goodness.

730
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,482
I have no idea how to argue she did this

731
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,360
in the public interest,
not for personal revenge.

732
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,820
It's on her personal website.

733
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,572
The problem is that
she was already sued for libel before

734
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,075
by other parents
who failed to pay child support

735
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,952
and were exposed on her website,

736
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,161
then she was fined.

737
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,705
Is that a problem?

738
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,248
That means

739
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,960
there's a high chance
she'll be fined again…

740
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:08,839
Wait.

741
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,718
This client was
already sued by many people

742
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,971
who refused to pay child support,
not just by her husband!

743
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,641
It proves she didn't upload their info
just for personal gain

744
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,601
to make him pay the money.

745
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,314
She also got together with informants

746
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:29,317
to go to the MOGEF
to publicize this problem,

747
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,570
then protested
before the National Assembly.

748
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,823
Go eat something first.

749
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,493
Have you eaten already?

750
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,579
If you buy me jjajangmyeon, I'll--

751
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,789
My rule is never to eat with any students.

752
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,504
I shouldn't have asked.
That was so embarrassing.

753
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,301
Hey, Ye-seul. Where are you?

754
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,054
Why? She still won't pick up?

755
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,097
She's on the phone.

756
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,183
Is something going on with Ye-seul?

757
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,562
CLASS CANCELED

758
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,230
What? This is awesome.

759
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,567
That's odd. I thought
Prof. Kang never cancels his classes.

760
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,694
All right!

761
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,822
CLASS CANCELED

762
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,371
Excuse me.

763
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,332
Why was it canceled?

764
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,210
Prof. Kang didn't come today.
I think he's sick.

765
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,547
Right, did you get your laptop
from the professor?

766
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,884
Yes, the security guard gave it to me.

767
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,969
I was told to give this to you.

768
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,763
Okay, thank you.

769
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,724
The security guard?
Well, I'm glad you got it back.

770
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,561
He kept asking me over and over again
if I'm sure it was yours.

771
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,275
One second.

772
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,946
I have something to ask you.

773
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,576
I already paid everything I got on credit.

774
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,411
Stop asking me to buy food for you.

775
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,456
You had to see Prof. Yang
to prepare for the trial anyway.

776
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,708
I have to eat, so start copying.

777
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,793
Why should I?

778
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:14,214
Can I tell your wife about that girl
you practically stalked?

779
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,590
Do it.

780
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,009
-Should I?
-Do it. I'll do it. I will.

781
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,553
I'll do this.

782
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,973
You never did this saying it's illegal.

783
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,766
You should take down that motto.

784
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:25,934
It's not illegal.

785
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,519
The copyright holder asked

786
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,688
to give it to students for free.

787
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,856
The copyright holder?

788
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,944
You're off duty, so the books are no use.

789
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,863
Yes, you can't have classes. So why?

790
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,073
I'll use those as soon as I win the trial.

791
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,117
You'll use those as soon as you win?

792
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,911
He's telling you to do a great job
on his trial.

793
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,705
-Did you meet him?
-Who?

794
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:50,041
Yes, I did. But even if he had someone
behind him, he won't speak up.

795
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,044
He'll talk only after his case
ends as bodily harm.

796
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,505
The crazy man who stabbed Prof. Yang?

797
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,258
He's very skeptical,
and he's as sly as a fox.

798
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,553
I pleaded in his favor. Show him,

799
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,555
-then tell him I'll come see him.
-Okay.

800
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,685
He paid my fee in cash right away.

801
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:11,521
I wonder if he'll do well
on Prof. Yang's pro bono case.

802
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,441
I came to do that.
Let's get ready for the trial.

803
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,612
I have the arraignment
and a list of prosecution evidence,

804
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:22,866
then I went to the Prosecutors' Office
and copied the investigation record.

805
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,244
Hand it out.

806
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,754
What are you thinking?

807
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,088
PREPARATORY PROCEEDINGS

808
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,924
List of evidence from the prosecution.

809
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,134
These are real documents. So cool.

810
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,178
There is lots of evidence.

811
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,137
Is that so?

812
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,932
Then I'll be done for good

813
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,224
thanks to this evidence.

814
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,356
Article 318.1, Criminal Procedure Act.

815
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,484
"Documents or articles the prosecutor
and the defendant agree on are

816
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,819
admissible as evidence if genuine."

817
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,781
The prosecutor
can't use everything as evidence.

818
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,157
The defendant must agree.

819
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,075
Right.

820
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,869
Then Prof. Yang can disagree
with everything against…

821
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,413
If he disagrees with everything,

822
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,998
are we left with zero evidence?

823
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,333
Why would there be no…

824
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,839
Well, I have no time to explain that, so…

825
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,967
We do. A minute and 30 seconds.

826
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:23,593
Come on.

827
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,764
Disapproving evidence
usually denies its validity,

828
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,308
but what can the defendant do
by denying the weapon?

829
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,685
Will someone say,

830
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,187
"This knife isn't a knife!
This mace is lying"?

831
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,772
Then why do we do this?

832
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,191
Evidence admissibility
is useful with papers.

833
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,901
Our testimonies to the prosecutor,

834
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,945
the medical examiner's report,

835
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,321
and my uncle's notes.

836
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,366
With those, we have a chance
of making an argument saying,

837
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,659
"That person is lying."

838
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,828
Right. And now--

839
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,121
If we dismiss documents?

840
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,628
We summon the testifier

841
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,505
or the writer to court to have them

842
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,798
take the stand.

843
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,176
And we judge the authenticity
of the said document.

844
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,137
Why are you getting mad at me?

845
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,932
Then let's decide which evidence
I should approve or disapprove.

846
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:14,144
Wait, they're your key evidence.

847
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,354
You're asking your evidence
for their opinion?

848
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,315
I got some investigation records.

849
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,651
Wait, we're showing all these to them?

850
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,111
He's as crazy as you.

851
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,030
He's off duty, so he's using his case

852
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,448
to hold a hands-on class.

853
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:29,200
But I'm saying
they are a part of this case.

854
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,453
I've never seen the real record before.

855
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,330
This is huge.
We'll need at least 100 thimbles.

856
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,541
Bad students always complain
about their gear.

857
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,585
Pass your bar exam first.

858
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,669
NFS AUTOPSY REPORT

859
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,712
SEO BYUNG-JU

860
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,422
The autopsy report is dismissed.

861
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,924
The examiner went AWOL,
so he can't be summoned either.

862
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,259
It'll be easy to dismiss.

863
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,470
Then isn't it good for Prof. Yang?

864
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,597
We have no way of summoning the examiner?

865
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,807
I asked the embassy
and the Korean association

866
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,518
to look for him everywhere,
but he can't be located.

867
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,689
Since the examiner lives abroad

868
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,191
and can't be located,

869
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,569
-so Article 314, Exception…
-Article 314, Criminal Procedure Act.

870
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,404
"If a person who's to make a statement

871
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,407
is unable to do so due to death, illness,
residence abroad,

872
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,077
or any other similar cause,
the relevant report

873
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,913
and other documents
shall be admissible as evidence."

874
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,748
You're right. I was happy for nothing.

875
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,292
Approve his handwritten memo
to claim suicide.

876
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,419
What about testifier statements?

877
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,755
All of them are your testifiers!

878
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,966
You're right. All the suspects are here.

879
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,052
-You should disapprove.
-If it wasn't him,

880
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,638
that means one of you is lying.

881
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,474
-You should disapprove everything.
-Disapprove everything?

882
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,393
Then how many witnesses should I summon?

883
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,564
Him. And him.

884
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,316
Him, her, her, and him.

885
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:45,527
-They all testified.
-I did too.

886
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,321
Exactly. There are dozens of people.

887
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,116
You know how it is.
The trial will be too long.

888
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,952
-The judge won't summon all of them.
-I want to be a witness.

889
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:57,914
Prof. Yang may never eat with a student,
but he would never kill a man.

890
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,208
Please approve mine.

891
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,043
I don't want to take the stand.

892
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,379
And mine. I need that time to study.

893
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,132
Seung-jae and I weren't even at the scene.

894
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,343
If you look at my statement,
I barely said anything.

895
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:13,221
All right, now.
Take a good look at their statements,

896
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:16,683
talk to the prosecutor,
and summon the least amount of people.

897
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,351
Let's disapprove his first.

898
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,395
Whose statement?

899
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,190
There's no reason to disapprove
Prof. Kang Ju-man's statement.

900
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,317
He didn't say much,

901
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,861
and he seems to hate you a lot.

902
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,988
There's no reason
to have him as a witness.

903
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,781
Please have him as my first witness.

904
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,283
Why is the vice dean the first?

905
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:34,534
He changed his alibi.

906
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,584
NEW MAIL

907
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,462
I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAPTOP, LET'S MEET

908
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,005
Let's call it a day.

909
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,132
I need to find my laptop first.

910
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,487
CONTACTS: DAD

911
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,906
The phone is turned off.

912
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:13,990
DAD

913
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:14,908
CONTACTS: MOM

914
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,953
-What?
-Dad's phone is turned off.

915
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,121
Put him on the phone.

916
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,789
Come home if you want to talk.

917
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,584
Mom. Mom!

918
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,045
Darn it.

919
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:52,695
Dad.

920
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,031
Dad?

921
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,254
Vice Dean.

922
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,054
Aren't you leaving?

923
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,306
This is different from exposing debtors.

924
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,017
Unpaid child support isn't private debt,

925
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,978
but a dereliction of a parent's duty.

926
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:28,523
The state must take responsibility
for the child's survival,

927
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,400
thus making this a public issue.

928
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,521
That day,

929
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,982
I brought the sugar packet.

930
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:19,115
12:25 P.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020,
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

931
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,756
Vice Dean.

932
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,675
It's your first class in the mock court.

933
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,801
How do you feel?

934
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,221
Right. Yes.

935
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,392
-Would you like some coffee?
-You stay. I'll make mine.

936
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,660
I have a sweet tooth.

937
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,121
If this is about her paper,

938
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,918
I don't think I'll let this slide.

939
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,467
You should've stopped the wrong decision

940
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,968
your wife and daughter made.

941
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,595
Your daughter copied my paper,

942
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,222
won an award in a contest,

943
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,350
then used it to get into the Law School.

944
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:31,229
Just as Prof. Yang said, I do not think
we should condone any illegal acts

945
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,940
in the admission process
of the Law School.

946
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,363
Just as Prof. Yang said,

947
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,617
you bribed the school,
called it a donation, then got to teach.

948
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,495
I don't think
that's something for you to say.

949
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,250
My daughter just did as her mother said.

950
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:02,051
I can see why
Hye-gyeong regretted marrying you.

951
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,305
Even if she made her do it,
your daughter could've stopped.

952
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,184
Vice Dean, as a renowned legal scholar,

953
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,104
you know this much better than I do.

954
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:16,691
Your daughter doesn't qualify
to become a judicial officer.

955
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:24,782
YANG JONG-HOON

956
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,327
Professor Yang.
I meant to call you, but I forgot.

957
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,913
Yes, give me a second.

958
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:20,546
I killed him.

959
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,550
Professor Seo Byung-ju.

960
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,647
You finally…

961
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,527
found me.

962
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,230
It was all me.

963
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,731
Can you prove it?

964
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,775
Do you also think I'm a joke?

965
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,151
Why did you two meet up?

966
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:26,696
Tell him you couldn't tell
to hide our relationship.

967
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,322
You can do that, right?

968
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,615
You can't do this to me.

969
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,033
It's all your fault!

970
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,494
Everyone has a thing
that triggers their trauma.

971
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,371
I want to speak with you.

972
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,747
Ye-seul's boyfriend.

973
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,374
-Get in!
-I really don't like him.

974
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:39,667
I'm the one who's shocked.

975
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,669
I had to come as my girl got scared.

976
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:44,297
Your boyfriend looks somewhat dangerous.

977
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,548
I'm worried.

978
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,800
So Professor Kang is your father?

979
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,886
Attend my trial tomorrow.

980
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,804
Your dad's not at school.

981
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,556
Your dad will do something crazy.

982
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,352
