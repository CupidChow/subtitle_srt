1
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,231
The entire trial process
has come to an end.

2
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:10,236
Lastly, we have
one very important final step.

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,281
It's a process called
reaching the verdict.

4
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,700
Yes?

5
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:20,121
DELIBERATION: JURY'S DISCUSSION
VERDICT: JURY'S FINAL DECISION

6
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,332
A question from Juror No. 4.

7
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,461
"What does it mean to have this proven
beyond a reasonable doubt?"

8
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:31,883
I'm not sure how little
of reasonable doubt we can work with.

9
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,844
Please explain this in a simpler way
for us to understand.

10
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,305
Okay, here's the thing.

11
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,144
If the prosecutor brought enough,
if not perfect, proof,

12
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,190
and it is not reasonable to suspect
that the defendant may be innocent,

13
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,275
you should decide on a verdict of guilty.

14
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,320
However, when you find her guilty,

15
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:56,157
if you cannot clearly conclude her guilt
on common sense,

16
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,952
it means there are reasonable doubts left

17
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,287
on ruling the defendant guilty
for her crime.

18
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:05,834
Which means the prosecutor's presentation
was not enough to prove her guilt.

19
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,170
So, in that case,
you must find her innocent.

20
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,756
Do you understand?

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,967
JUROR

22
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,770
Defense counsel.

23
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,400
Is it possible for you to explain this
in an easier way?

24
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,158
JUROR

25
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:42,871
STENOGRAPHER

26
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,792
Now, please look at this screen.

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,838
Here are 50 puzzle pieces.

28
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,924
Let's put the puzzle pieces together.

29
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,055
What could this be?

30
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,518
I put some puzzle pieces together,

31
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:10,648
but you'd think these gray puzzle pieces
are still in pieces.

32
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,858
You're still doubtful.

33
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,028
There is room for reasonable doubt.

34
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,697
Let's put a few more together.

35
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:23,286
Well, that long droopy thing in the front

36
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:27,248
kind of looks like an elephant trunk.

37
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,125
But it seems too early to conclude.

38
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,752
It still seems doubtful.

39
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,505
There is still room for reasonable doubt.

40
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,591
Let's put together a few more.

41
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,388
Now, what do you think?

42
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,893
Do you have any doubt
that this is a picture of an elephant?

43
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,479
No, right?

44
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,983
In that case, there's no reason
to put the rest of the pieces together.

45
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,737
This is proof beyond reasonable doubt.

46
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,530
JUROR

47
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,616
Let me go. Let go!

48
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,618
Darn it, hey!

49
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,120
MILL

50
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,089
You. Tell me.

51
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,882
Tell me!

52
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,385
Why did he make you do this?

53
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,928
I have no idea.

54
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,389
I just do as I'm told.

55
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,311
Open it.

56
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,731
You want me to kill you?

57
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,486
It's the same person.

58
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,280
What is this?

59
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,040
MILL

60
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,670
What? What's with this?

61
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,724
In the end,

62
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,686
did I end up falling into your trap?

63
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,322
You can't risk your life to set up a trap

64
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:26,034
just to catch the real culprit!

65
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,036
How did you lose your anklet?

66
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,996
My gosh.

67
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:34,167
Don't you care about your death?
This is all you want to know?

68
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,879
MILL

69
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,922
-You go check on Byeol.
-Okay.

70
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,549
Darn it.

71
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,823
When I gave you

72
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,242
my blood,

73
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,581
I never imagined I'd see a day like this.

74
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,292
Okay, now. Where should I inject this?

75
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,837
-You should've left me to die then.
-Exactly. Right?

76
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,299
I never imagined I'd get caught in a trap.

77
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:28,387
I thought I should do it for you
as an insurance plan. Darn it, man.

78
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,974
It'll happen in a flash
if I inject it into your vein.

79
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,852
I'll need your cooperation.

80
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,479
This looks good.

81
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,608
Why did you kill him?

82
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,613
He helped you crawl out of prison
instead of rotting there forever.

83
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,323
There was no need to kill him.

84
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,243
You're right.

85
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,663
Why did I care

86
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,332
so much about my darned son?

87
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,502
My gosh, man.

88
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,046
Stop making me talk, okay?

89
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,932
If you inject it there,
you can't cover it up as suicide,

90
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,602
saying I killed myself because
I was scared that I'd be found guilty.

91
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,105
I'm very bad with my left hand.

92
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,693
That's insane.

93
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,780
I haven't thought it out that much.

94
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,825
Okay. That's a very good idea.

95
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,796
Yes, what?

96
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,965
What do you think? I'm home.

97
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,633
He's not home!

98
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,721
That jerk.

99
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,934
You!

100
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,982
Darn it.

101
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,255
You.

102
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,007
I'll kill you.

103
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,634
Gosh.

104
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,593
Damn it.

105
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,765
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

106
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,601
It's taking a while.

107
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,230
It seems like Juror no. 2
will take the lead in the decision.

108
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,317
It won't be acknowledged as self-defense.

109
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,279
You didn't bribe them, did you?

110
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,283
As if it was not enough to dig up
Ko's back.

111
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,620
My principle is to play by the rules

112
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,623
no matter how harsh
we tear each other apart in court.

113
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,795
I need to take a nap.

114
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,007
JURY'S DELIBERATION

115
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,553
In my opinion,
I don't see a need to drag this out.

116
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,846
Why are we beating around the bush?

117
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,392
Let's not get too self-conscious
about what others think

118
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,727
and share our opinions to reach a verdict.

119
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,024
No. 4 lady.

120
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,902
If you're going to sleep, go home.

121
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,903
My gosh.

122
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,323
I would've left if I could have.

123
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,576
They told me to shut up and stay

124
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,412
until you're done
even if I'm an alternate.

125
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,496
What can I do?

126
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,748
Then stop snoring, will you?

127
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,916
You're interrupting us.

128
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,046
You're dragging this out
yet you can't seem to reach a conclusion.

129
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,423
Isn't it obvious?

130
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,425
I say it's self-defense.

131
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,011
Do you think it's easy
to call something self-defense?

132
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,180
-Were you out while the prosecutor talked?
-My gosh.

133
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,057
If we accept her case as self-defense,

134
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,351
everyone will claim that
and assault cases--

135
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,730
What the heck are you saying?
Didn't you hear what my daughter-- I mean…

136
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,898
What that girl who's her age said?

137
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,358
I have a question.

138
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,654
You may not ask anything that can hinder
the fairness of the trial. Keep it short.

139
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,989
BEFORE THE DELIBERATION

140
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:22,496
The prosecutor said self-defense can be
used as a means of pardon for criminals.

141
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,417
But is it right to consider defense
against injustice,

142
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,210
meaning anything illegal, as a crime?

143
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,464
If there are an assailant
who beat up an elderly man

144
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,258
and someone who assaulted him
while trying to stop him,

145
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,344
should they both be considered criminals?

146
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,513
Then who would ever try to save
an elderly man from an attack?

147
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:44,101
Ms. Jeon Ye-seul is sitting there
as a defendant because she tried to stop

148
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,936
the distribution of her spy cam video.

149
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,940
All she did was try to defend herself
from an awful crime.

150
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,734
If that's considered a crime,

151
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,112
then should we just let someone
violate our rights?

152
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,407
Goodness, she sounded like a smart girl.
I wonder who her parents are…

153
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,495
Here are beverages for you.

154
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,004
You want to clear your father's name
by making me a defendant?

155
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,006
I told you to stop messing with me.

156
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,925
Why do you think I sat in on this trial?

What you see isn't everything.

161
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,316
But how would you know
the substantial truth

162
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,485
that even your father didn't know
until he died?

00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,878
SEO JI-HO

165
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,439
You said you believed

166
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,607
that I had written it.

167
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,611
I believe that
you were good enough to do so.

168
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,904
Is this a joke?

169
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,740
Why didn't you say it back then?

170
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,284
If you could've written that,

171
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,036
why would you copy my uncle's paper?

172
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,664
I began to have reasonable doubt.

173
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,541
And then I thought,

174
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,170
"Did she do it because of her mom?"

175
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,257
Why are you bringing her up?

176
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,259
She asked me to tutor you
on the Civil Code

177
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,052
at the beginning of the semester.

178
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:48,309
She offered me as much as I wanted
to quit the study group and tutor you.

179
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,979
I'm not even her son,

180
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,231
yet your tiger mom
made me feel suffocated.

181
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,903
-And?
-I didn't want to tutor you,

182
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,155
but wanted to help you breathe.

183
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,782
Is that why you asked me
to join the group?

184
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,747
As I studied with you,
I knew you were born with that legal mind.

185
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,790
If I'd been the school,

186
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,127
I would've accepted you
even without that paper.

187
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,713
-What are you--
-Trying to ask

188
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,343
is if you don't feel guilty.

189
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,557
Not everyone speaks up
just because they feel guilty.

190
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,560
But you should.

191
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,856
Admit to what you did
and ask for the best.

192
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,983
From my experience,

193
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,861
you're someone who could face it.

194
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,633
Are you okay?

195
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,593
How do you feel?

196
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,137
I heard your head clears up
the first time you do meth.

197
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,056
If you're curious, give it a try.

198
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,310
You didn't let him inject that
because you got curious, right?

199
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,354
Though you could've had him way before?

200
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,983
You overestimate me.

201
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,404
Wait, I never knew you could smile.

202
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,824
It's the drug. That's frightening.

203
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,243
Right.

204
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,501
He's the one who visited Ki Du-seong.

205
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,671
He is Choi Jae-cheol. He worked
for an ankle monitor manufacturer.

206
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,467
He was imprisoned for embezzlement,
and met Lee Man-ho in prison at that time.

207
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,348
So that's why he could take
the ankle monitor on and off.

208
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,976
Once Lee sues the keyboard warriors
and makes a fortune,

209
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,728
they were going to split it in half.

210
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,979
Darn it!

211
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,899
Choi Jae-cheol is the bridge
between Lee and Ki Du-seong?

212
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,486
If Lee Man-ho instigated Ki Du-seong
to kill you through Choi Jae-cheol,

213
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,780
he'd be the one who killed my uncle

214
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,617
and instigated your murder.

215
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,118
My gut feelings are right.

216
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,329
Professor!

217
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,789
The jury reached a verdict.

218
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,380
And now, the verdict

219
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,507
for case 2020-GH 311…

220
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,425
DEFENSE ATTORNEY

221
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,137
on causing grievous bodily injury
will be announced.

222
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,785
The jury have unanimously decided

223
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,958
to accept the defendant's case
for self-defense.

224
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,001
-Yes!
-All right!

225
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,633
Order.

226
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,471
As previously stated,
the verdict of the jury

227
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,684
only has an advisory effect
in the judge's decision.

228
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,732
I will announce the ruling.

229
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,736
Case 2020-GH 311…

230
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,786
What happened?

231
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,129
Come in! Damn it.

232
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,301
Stop any articles on Yeong-chang
from getting published.

233
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,721
And move him to a hospital
in a rural area.

234
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,598
-Don't let any reporters find him!
-Yes, sir.

235
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,227
Right, the ruling
of the Bad FaMa case just came out.

236
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,939
The articles on Bad FaMa

237
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,483
covered up the articles
on Ko Hyeong-su's son.

238
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,776
BAD FAMA FOUND INNOCENT

239
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,612
And it's all thanks
to Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

240
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,282
Why is it thanks to him? I made it happen.

241
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,035
I played a good part
as a member of the jury.

242
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,661
Didn't you just stay silent?

243
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,746
Come on.

244
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,914
I knew it'd be ruled self-defense.

245
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,375
Didn't you say you were doubtful?

246
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,587
Although it's pretty late,

247
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,088
you all have done well,

248
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,882
so please eat up.

249
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,967
Especially you…

250
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,846
-Ye-seul.
-Thank you.

251
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,767
The tab is on the dean tonight,
so let's eat until we all blow up.

252
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,310
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right.

253
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,646
Where's our man of the day,
Professor Yang?

254
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,066
He's probably catching up with someone.

255
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,821
My perfect winning rate
on jury trials was destroyed,

256
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,740
but why is the night air so refreshing?

257
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,952
I didn't know
you loved your students that much.

258
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,914
You applied to be her special attorney
and won her case.

259
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,043
Did you turn it into a jury trial

260
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,087
because you knew
I always take jury trials?

261
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,965
And you knew I'd stop Prosecutor Jin
from trying to pull a trick.

262
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,054
Don't be so happy though.
During the appeal--

263
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,227
Sim-won.

264
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,857
I know you very well
you won't lodge an appeal.

265
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,986
You'd think it's a waste,
an abuse of the right to appeal.

266
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,782
Yes, Ko Yeong-chang is a huge jerk indeed.

267
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,077
But if Ko Yeong-chang asks for an appeal,

268
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,454
I don't have the courage
to ignore it as abuse.

269
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,332
The woman I know you to be
probably does have it.

270
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,333
Really?

271
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,752
You turned down someone that cool?

272
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,509
There's the guy
who got lucky thanks to you.

273
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,721
I'll pay you back
for causing damage on my reputation,

274
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,431
so see you around. Bye.

275
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,192
Aren't you coming?

276
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,735
HAN JOON-HWI

277
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,780
KOREAN FULL-COURSE MEAL

278
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,828
The dean rarely buys us a meal, you know.

279
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,882
Do you think Assemblyman Ko

280
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,010
really wanted Bad FaMa
to be found innocent?

281
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,431
Do you think he wanted
to introduce a bill to abolish

282
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,808
defamation by publicly alleging facts?

283
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,728
I doubt it.

284
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,108
You've worked with him in his office.

285
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,362
You know that he's a man
who wants to work with legislations

286
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,699
that would help out his career
more than the people.

287
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,037
And you played a part in helping him
find something for his career.

288
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,415
I was desperate.

289
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,545
Isn't that what you wrote
with your bloody nose?

290
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,467
That she did it out of desperation
as it's a matter of the kids' survival.

291
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,763
So did I take part?

292
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,598
Yes.

293
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,143
I gave him the Lee Man-ho Act, too.

294
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,562
The Lee Man-ho Act?

295
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,608
He was the key member
of the Judiciary Committee.

296
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,151
No one else could've passed it.

297
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,279
That's…

298
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,864
Was it Kang Dan?

299
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,035
Prof. Yang told me later
that a student at Hankuk University

300
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,496
proposed that bill.

301
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,876
Let's go inside.
We're keeping everyone waiting.

302
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,462
Kang Dan is…

303
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,008
my sister.

304
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,389
I was trying to say
we should both be careful.

305
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,644
Why do you turn a cautionary measure
into a careless mistake?

306
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,855
Seo Ji-ho is a nobody. Why did you take
the case to the prosecution?

307
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,280
In his father's death, we obviously--

308
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,531
We played a part in it?

309
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,493
Hey, Mr. Choi.

310
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,876
Do you think we were the main culprits?

311
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,588
I didn't leak it because I wanted to.

312
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:44,553
My superior at the time, Seo Byung-ju,
despised leaking out suspected crimes.

313
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,222
-Then why…
-Why?

314
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:55,605
That's the reason why you should never
stab me in the back.

315
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,405
Actually, the one you stabbed

316
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,701
in the back is not me.

317
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,418
I guess you haven't heard.
The real culprit was caught.

318
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,670
What?

319
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,839
He was caught trying to kill me.

320
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,175
What the heck are you…

321
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,014
I never imagined I'd get caught in a trap.

322
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,683
I thought I should do it for you
as an insurance plan.

323
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,482
Jae-cheol spilled everything.

324
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,777
He said you killed Seo Byung-ju.

325
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,865
Are you allowed to question me
at such a late hour?

326
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:51,036
It's not like I want to be here.

327
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,293
I'm not done with the questioning.

328
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,837
Darn it.

329
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,298
Come on.

330
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,061
You tried to kill Jong-hoon?

331
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,063
I'm pleading the Fifth

332
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,607
until I get myself a lawyer.

333
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,150
And Seo Byung-ju.

334
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,320
Did you really kill him?

335
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,741
I refuse to state anything.

336
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,875
Hey, let's go for another drink!

337
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,919
Tell Yangcrates to come!

338
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,588
My head is too clear. I came home.

339
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,382
The real culprit

340
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,843
is caught.

341
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,845
-What?
-What?

342
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,888
The real culprit who killed Prof. Seo?

343
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,601
That's how Lee Man-ho made his alibi?

344
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,980
How dare he mess with the ankle monitor?

345
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,232
That's what money does.

346
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,318
Shouldn't Jae-cheol be considered
as an accomplice?

347
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,029
I wouldn't call him an accomplice,
but an aider.

348
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,364
Aider.

349
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,657
That's way too weak.

350
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,450
I mean, he messed with the anklet.

351
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,079
Look at how happy you are.

352
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,540
Weren't you pondering
why you wanted to be a lawyer?

353
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,626
No, seeing Ye-seul getting found innocent
made me realize

354
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,336
that I was born to be a lawyer.

355
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,297
I will…

356
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,799
just go home, then.

357
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,885
Why? You said no one's home.

358
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,387
My roommate went home, so stay with me.

359
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,305
She went home?

360
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,390
Are you concerned?

361
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,058
Why? Are you jealous?

362
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,560
Don't be so cute.

363
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,940
Wait, you left with the slippers
from the restaurant?

364
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,447
No matter how out of it you were--

365
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,910
It's not because she was out of it.

366
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,383
Hey. When did you come home?

367
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,136
I have something to say, Dad, Mom.

368
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,848
Something to say?

369
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,934
No! Have you gone insane?

370
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,689
Prof. Yang won't let this pass.

371
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,983
He's only giving me time
as Joon-hwi asked him.

372
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,318
No, you can't do that.

373
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,153
I'll die if you get kicked out.

374
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,531
I've never imagined you
as anything else than a judge!

375
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,577
Honey, do something.

376
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,581
I apologize for comparing you to Byung-ju,

377
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,792
so please do something.

378
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,751
Honey.

379
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,129
Yes, I'm your wife.

380
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,382
Please help save me.

381
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,009
If she gets kicked out of the law school,
I'll die.

382
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,888
I'd rather have you quit.

383
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,058
But not our daughter.
Our daughter can't get kicked out.

384
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,185
No, please.

385
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,311
I'm going to sleep.

386
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,526
No, honey.

387
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,412
I got you a change of clothes
from your room.

388
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,547
When I asked Prof. Yang about Kang Dan,

389
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,048
he refused to say another word.

390
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,386
She volunteered at a children's home
during high school,

391
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,264
and she must've looked after
Lee Man-ho's son.

392
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,022
I'm glad I gave you that bill

393
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,316
and sent you to Assemblyman Ko.

394
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,490
Right.

395
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,910
What does she want to do now?

396
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,747
She only did Ko Hyeong-su good.

397
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,672
Thanks to you,
I began to trust the law again.

398
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,967
Yes, let's focus on her innocence,

399
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,886
just how she was found innocent.

400
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,181
Gosh, I'm just glad
she was found innocent.

401
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,736
Mom, did you get home all right?

402
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,030
Yes, I got home just fine.

403
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:40,116
But some jerk destroyed our CCTV.

404
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,368
We don't need it anymore.

405
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,703
Lee Man-ho won't live across from you.

406
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,788
What do you mean?

407
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,707
He was the real culprit
of the murder case at our school.

408
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,168
He'll rot in prison forever.

409
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,837
Goodness, that's frightening.

410
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,965
You and Byeol can sleep in peace now.

411
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,425
Goodness.

412
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,469
Anyway, Mom.

413
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,181
I really wasn't sure about Juror no. 2.
How did you unanimously…

414
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,766
No, never mind.

415
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,976
You can't disclose the discussion.

416
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,229
Of course, I can't. If I do,

417
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,773
they told me
I'll either be fined or locked up.

418
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,985
I'm going to sleep in peace now.

419
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,613
Good night. Great work today.

420
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,120
What happened

421
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,914
with Juror no. 2 is…

422
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,292
Should we consider
his violation of her rights

423
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,629
continued even after he dropped his phone?

424
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,881
That's the key issue.

425
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,759
The Supreme Court precedents say

426
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,304
it's very difficult
to prove that continuity.

427
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,764
It should be difficult.

428
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,933
She still made him paraplegic.

429
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:50,437
She should be punished in some way.

430
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,565
But I wouldn't say imprisonment,
more like probation.

431
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,483
It wasn't your fault.

432
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,987
It wasn't your fault.

433
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,948
She really isn't helpful.

434
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,783
It wasn't the defendant's fault.

435
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,581
Stop talking! It's not self-defense!

436
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,332
-Darn you.
-Goodness.

437
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,042
-Hey!
-Stop.

438
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,255
Doesn't this look exactly like

439
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,966
how Ko Yeong-chang
reached for his phone in the footage?

440
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,970
Prosecutor, you thought the continuity
of his violation ended here.

441
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,346
Is that really the case?

442
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,016
If he reaches out to pick up this knife,

443
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,935
it means
his injustice against me continues.

444
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:31,978
Because of that fear…

445
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,940
this was all I could do.

446
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:36,900
You really hit me.

447
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:42,238
Shouldn't we consider the violation
to finally end at this point?

448
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:43,907
Right.

449
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,659
We should say the continuity stands.

450
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,163
I say it was self-defense.

451
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,839
Prosecutor Jin will have a tough night.

452
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,176
Ye-seul was found innocent,
and the real culprit was caught.

453
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,721
And Mr. Choi went to the prosecution
to share his witness account,

454
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,389
so he's probably furious.

455
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,228
This is probably
the worst day of his life.

456
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,067
What about you?

457
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,319
Why can't you sleep?

458
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,029
Do you think…

459
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,324
Prosecutor Jin will be indicted?

460
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,829
He said something weird.

461
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,956
Something weird?

462
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,458
That what I see isn't everything.

463
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,128
That my dad died without knowing

464
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,422
the substantial truth.

465
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,684
BAD FAMA FOUND INNOCENT FOR DEFAMATION

466
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,893
LEE MAN-HO ATTACKS KO

467
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,978
HIS BILL PROPOSAL…

468
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,154
Are you sure Lee Man-ho is

469
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,074
the real culprit?

470
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,327
Yes, sir.

471
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,372
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

472
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,377
These are the shoes he wore.

473
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,050
These are the same model.

474
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,261
And the soles.

475
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:35,518
The soles are the same as those
of the sneakers he was wearing.

476
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,312
The medical examiner said

477
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,771
the needle mark you see here

478
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,317
is the same as the one on this syringe.

479
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:47,280
Seung-jae said this is made in Germany,
and not often used in Korea.

480
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,032
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

481
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,743
On top of that, Choi Jae-cheol destroyed
all of his alibis.

482
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,038
Jae-cheol put the anklet on

483
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,374
instead of him
at the exact time of the incident.

484
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,378
It means Lee Man-ho is the real culprit.

485
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,382
Goodness.

486
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,971
There's no reason to lose heart.

487
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,557
Persuade Jae-cheol
and make it look like you caught

488
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,893
the culprit.

489
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,396
But the thing is,

490
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,524
Yang Jong-hoon contacted him first, so--

491
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,860
Then find out
how he contacted Choi Jae-cheol.

492
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,028
You'll find something.

493
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,618
I stopped articles on Lee's arrest
from getting published.

494
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,037
Hand it over to Reporter Choi

495
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,500
and let him publish the exclusive report.

496
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,253
Tell him to walk back his remarks.

497
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,052
No, I don't want to do an interview.

498
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,266
He took this and walked back his remarks?

499
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,728
Yes. He won't pick up my calls.
I'm thinking of visiting him.

500
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,981
He's a wasted chance.

501
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:08,319
Why do you think Prosecutor Jin took Lee
to the prosecution that quickly?

502
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,822
In an attempt to blame the police
for pointing at you

503
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,240
with poor investigation.

504
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,742
And will they simply agree
it was their fault?

505
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,914
I think Prosecutor Jin
wants to blame the police.

506
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,875
The police got furious saying
they could've righted the wrong

507
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,003
if he didn't leak out his suspected crime.

508
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,006
Were they Detective Jang and Oh?
I'm going to meet with them.

509
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,216
Good luck.

510
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,844
Hey.

511
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,222
Which floor is Prof. Yang's office on?

512
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,604
At the exact time of the incident,

513
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,191
your ankle monitor location
appears at this cafe

514
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,153
next to Attorney Seo Byung-ju's office.

515
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:56,034
But the one who was here with the anklet
wasn't you, but Choi Jae-cheol.

516
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,579
Right? Do you know what this means--

517
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,498
I demand a cross-examination
with Choi Jae-cheol.

518
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,758
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

519
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,635
This is Attorney Song Ki-joon,
Choi Jae-cheol's counsel.

520
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,847
You can talk to him.

521
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,562
Darn it.

522
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,857
You want us to testify

523
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,778
that Prosecutor Jin leaked
his suspected crime to the media?

524
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,904
Yes.

525
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,495
Are you insane?

526
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,290
He did piss me off, but why would I
mess with a prosecutor?

527
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,419
Detective Jang, Detective Oh,
this is a matter of your honor.

528
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,634
According to his media source,

529
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,346
the police turned a talented law professor
into a murderer

530
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,431
because of the poor initial investigation.

531
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,100
Prosecutor Jin told the media

532
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,894
even before we transferred his case
to the prosecution.

533
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,563
Man, that jerk.

534
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,481
And that jerk

535
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,944
leaked my dad's suspected crime
before he was found guilty,

536
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,614
then he ended up setting himself on fire.

537
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,574
Please help me out.

538
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,803
Helping out Seo Ji-ho
is the right way to apologize to me.

539
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,223
Whatever!

540
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,976
I still see my dad on fire in my dreams.

541
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,320
I can't believe this.

542
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,238
LIST OF SUPPORTERS

543
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,491
Ko's case got covered, and the number
of the supporters skyrocketed.

544
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,953
Do they have enough trust in him
to give him money?

545
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,454
This is doubly annoying.

546
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,498
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

547
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,334
Why isn't she coming?

548
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,919
It's awkward to be here alone.

549
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,632
Hey, where are you?

550
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,885
I had to come to school first.

551
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,220
DEAN'S OFFICE

552
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,475
The head supporter?

553
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,852
KO HYEONG-SU

554
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,688
Why is he holding that toy up?
That's so cheap.

555
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,065
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

556
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,109
I have the documents he requested.

557
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,696
Kang Sol B had to stop by the school
before she got here.

558
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,489
She doesn't need to come.

559
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,825
Sorry?

560
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,374
-If it's about the plagiarism--
-I did plagiarize.

561
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,464
I could've written that paper myself,

562
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,216
but I copied his.

563
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,385
Why are you telling us now?

564
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,766
Han Joon-hwi said
he helped his uncle write that paper.

565
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,351
He did?

566
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,646
I thought I needed to tell you the truth
and ask for the best

567
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,981
in order to avoid getting kicked out.

568
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,402
And the vice dean?

569
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,696
I told him yesterday.

570
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,115
I had to stop him from resigning.

571
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,536
But you don't look ashamed.

572
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,164
I'm sorry.

573
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,960
I look more shameless
with a guilty conscience.

574
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,107
Will you really be like this?

575
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:01,445
You need to get me a good lawyer
from a big firm like Hyeongseol!

576
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,158
That's not what you promised--

577
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,953
Hello? Hey…

578
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,791
Darn it.

579
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,295
Is it okay to leave them alone?

580
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,550
PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

581
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,929
PROSECUTOR LEE HAN-JU

582
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,452
Criminal Procedure Act Article 255.1.

583
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,413
You need to do that.

584
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,623
You did that to me, too.

585
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,083
You seem to do it often.

586
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,633
ARTICLE 255.1

587
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,926
Withdrawal of prosecution.

588
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,387
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

589
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,097
We have more than enough evidence.

590
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,351
The more you hold out, the more severely--

591
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,227
Why are you in such a rush?

592
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,274
I have to find myself an attorney first.

593
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,444
Let's take this slow, okay?

594
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,947
Be my guest.

595
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,827
Take him.

596
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,840
There's something more important
than my confession.

597
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,969
I can't believe
a smart guy like you missed that.

598
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,517
Motive for the murder?

599
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,061
Why did he kill him?

600
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,064
He's an organ trafficker and a rapist.
He can do worse.

601
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,650
He said it was because of his son.

602
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,193
His son?

603
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,028
Did Seo Byung-ju hurt him?

604
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,323
He found him feeble-minded

605
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,034
and even got him a job after he got
released, so why?

606
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,707
Gosh, you can now start giving lectures
with that textbook.

607
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,252
Prosecutor Jin withdrew your indictment.

608
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,090
Congratulations on the dismissal
of your label as the Law School Murderer.

609
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,219
Couldn't you thank me and say

610
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,263
I did a great job
even if you don't mean it?

611
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,889
Don't get your hopes up.

612
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,642
Just be grateful
your name was made known in return.

613
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,686
But he could still say thanks.

614
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,438
"Great job, Park.

615
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,023
You had a tough time
dealing with a cranky client…"

616
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,943
Who cares if he's cranky?

617
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,195
He's much better
than a jerk like Lee Man-ho.

618
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,532
Even public defenders
abhor the thought of defending him.

619
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,908
Abhorrence is a stretch.

620
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,870
-I'd do it if he pays me enough.
-Sure.

621
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,705
You go ahead and do it.

622
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,416
He's the guy who tried to kill
your client, but just do it.

623
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,918
-I…
-You don't even have an ounce of loyalty.

624
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,006
His indictment is canceled,
so he's not my client anymore.

625
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,048
I need to see you.

626
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,800
What?

627
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,013
I thought we were all done.

628
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,514
Presidency, my foot.

629
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,141
He's a petty man who fired us

630
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,811
over a personal matter
after his son's trial went down the drain.

631
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,355
It's not like I wanted to work there.

632
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,067
I would've been done with my internship
after a few days.

633
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,321
Gosh, should I have acted crazy
and held out?

634
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,491
What was that?

635
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,827
-Hop in.
-What?

636
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,870
My gosh.

637
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,207
She said she's more shameless
with a guilty conscience,

638
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,209
then made the dean and me speechless.

639
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,585
But she felt guilty.

640
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,171
Her conscience?
Of course, she should feel guilty.

641
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,006
But wait.

642
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,592
You're glad that she felt guilty at least?

643
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,178
You can't stand people like Sol B.

644
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,429
I can't stand her.

645
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,805
COVER LETTER: KANG SOL

646
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,807
I read her cover letter all over again,

647
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,977
but it didn't say anything
about winning an award with that paper.

648
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,687
Didn't she attach the certificate?

649
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,022
Well, she did.

650
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,192
But we only acknowledge awards
given by chancellors,

651
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,569
governors, mayors, or ministers.

652
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,531
This award was given
by the Asia Human Rights Law Association,

653
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,742
so it wasn't taken into account.

654
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,078
So this paper
didn't affect her acceptance?

655
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,873
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

656
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,630
This time, I'll leave
even if you rip this up.

657
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,843
We haven't reached a decision
on your daughter's punishment.

658
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,762
It's all my fault.

659
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,515
I'd like to take responsibility
for causing this scandal.

660
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,104
Han Joon-hwi came to see me,

661
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,440
asking for favorable arrangements
for Kang Sol B.

662
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,733
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

663
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,528
If that's what this resignation means…

664
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,030
Please punish her by the rules.

665
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:06,083
It looked like
Vice Dean Kang was set on resigning.

666
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,334
You should talk to him.

667
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,258
Did things go well with Prosecutor Bae?

668
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,843
She won't appeal.

669
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,345
No.

670
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,685
I mean, you and I go way back.

671
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,478
That's why you should run.

672
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,813
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

673
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,529
Why won't she lodge an appeal?

674
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:40,576
In that case, I'll visit you next time.

675
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,535
Goodbye.

676
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,628
Prosecutor Bae insisted that
it's an abuse of the right to appeal.

677
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,880
What? An abuse of the right to appeal?

678
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,382
-Get her on the phone!
-I already talked to her,

679
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,967
and she told me to tell you

680
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,262
it'll be a better choice for Yeong-chang
for you to drop this case,

681
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:04,642
and how you should be grateful that
Ye-seul didn't sue him for dating abuse.

682
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,851
What?

683
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,520
Prosecutor Bae, you…

684
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,814
I need to see Prosecutor Jin!

685
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,069
-You were fired from Ko's office, too?
-Yes.

686
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,113
What about the internship?

687
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,824
What will you do?

688
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,161
-I can find another law firm.
-The accusation.

689
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,122
Right.

690
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,708
My key witness backed out,

691
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,336
so the detectives who worked
with Jin stepped up.

692
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,879
The ones for your dad's case?

693
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,756
No, for Prof. Yang's.

694
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,384
Their words aren't the smoking gun,

695
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,470
but it can show how Prosecutor Jin
had been leaking information.

696
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,766
Why do you think
Prosecutor Jin attended Ye-seul's trial?

697
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,310
By chance?

698
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,979
Why do you think I sat in on this trial?

699
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,857
Who benefitted the most
after Prosecutor Jin

700
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,484
leaked your dad's suspected crime?

701
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,577
KO HYEONG-SU

702
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,373
The toy company
that had been competing with your dad's.

703
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,582
I-bit?

704
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,252
CEO Cho Tae-yeong of I-bit
is Ko's head supporter.

705
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,838
What?

706
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,466
You should know the substantial truth
to get into law.

707
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,885
The substantial truth.

708
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,472
Then did Prosecutor Jin do that
upon Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su's request?

709
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:37,860
What? The most effective angle
in taking photos of a partner's affair?

710
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,445
What kind of an angle…

711
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,240
It's more about your speed than the angle.
Take the photos

712
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,159
as soon as you kick open the door.

713
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,578
Cameras are slower,
so use your phone camera.

714
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,164
Please come to my office
for further consultation.

715
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,081
The address.

716
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,040
Yes, sir.

717
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,335
Why am I here?

718
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,922
You got fired from your internship.
Do it here.

719
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,508
Here? I freaking hate it.

720
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,844
I freaking hate you, too.

721
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,972
I'm only doing this for you
because Prof. Yang asked.

722
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,016
What? Prof. Yang?

723
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,142
PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

724
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,061
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

725
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,565
Was Assemblyman Ko behind you?

726
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,069
Did he take money from I-bit's CEO--

727
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,406
If you don't want to see him
get dragged out, take him outside.

728
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,866
Tell me!

729
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,205
You can't do this here. Hey.

730
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,372
Calm down and come.

731
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,373
-Calm--
-Let me go!

732
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,958
Calm down for now.

733
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,418
Come on out. Come.

734
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,506
-Let me go!
-That's enough.

735
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,008
-Let me go!
-Enough is enough, really.

736
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:50,933
Will you go back inside?

737
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,351
What?

738
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,144
You're saying I'm out?

739
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,524
Tell him you persuaded him to leave
and get the kudos.

740
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,408
Okay, then. Try to calm down.

741
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:10,869
Bye.

742
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,837
You knew, didn't you?

743
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,517
Why didn't you tell me?

744
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,270
I knew you'd do this.

745
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,861
You know nothing good can come
from doing this,

746
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,739
but you'd still do it.

747
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,480
So you're Seo Ji-ho's roommate?

748
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,026
Tell him to get a grip and wake up.

749
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,363
I'm sorry to tell you this
right before my internship is over.

750
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,491
I don't think

751
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,411
I can work for you anymore.

752
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,246
What?

753
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:40,334
I plan to do everything I can
to help Ji-ho prove your guilt.

754
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,088
And it'd be a conflict of interest
to stay here

755
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,381
and share the same office.

756
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,260
Prosecutor Lee.

757
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,057
He wants to help you investigate my case.

758
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,434
I'll send him there. Good luck.

759
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,645
Happy now?

760
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,815
Yes, thank you.

761
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,776
I'll do a good job.

762
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,616
Prof. Yang.

763
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,209
Prof. Yang.

764
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,836
Why did you refer me to Mr. Park's--

765
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,505
He'll take Lee Man-ho's case.

766
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,590
Help him during your internship.

767
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,050
What?

768
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,806
Cheers, guys. Cheers.

769
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,492
Over here.

770
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,247
You already got drunk without me?

771
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,499
Yes, your friend

772
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,086
feels really frustrated right here,

773
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,506
and feels like her head
is about to blow up.

774
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:11,800
So I got drunk.

775
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,428
Because of Lee Man-ho?

776
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,556
Hey, you know,

777
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,934
I really have no idea
why the law should protect

778
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:24,521
those scumbags like Lee Man-ho.

779
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,190
Do you know, Joon-hwi?

780
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,777
Do people who pass
the second-round judicial exam know that?

781
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,866
Figures.

782
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,876
I'm jealous of you.

783
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,629
You could be a future prosecutor.

784
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,466
How are prosecutors different?

785
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,717
They're different.

786
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,472
You won't have to worry about
what you can do to reduce the sentence

787
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,265
for a scumbag like Lee Man-ho.

788
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,268
Quarter him to death!

789
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,270
Punish him severely!

790
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,063
You can do that.

791
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,903
I was really thankful

792
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:17,365
that Lee Man-ho disappeared
from the house across mine.

793
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,994
But why the heck is Prof. Yang telling me
to help defend him?

794
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,914
How does this make any sense?

795
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,084
It makes no sense.

796
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,385
-Go!
-We're late!

797
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,015
CAN WE DEFEND BAD PEOPLE?

798
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,642
LECTURE ROOM

799
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,604
In this lecture today,

800
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:52,192
I'd like you to have a discussion
as future officers in law,

801
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,111
freed from your stress over grades
and your bar exam.

802
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,864
Stop acting like you're a sinner.

803
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:03,912
You got me, Ji-ho, and this girl
fired from our internships.

804
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,874
Think of everything we did to help
and be confident.

805
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,253

00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,383
We didn't exactly get fired
because of you.

808
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,094
"What kind of lawyer do I want to be?"

809
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:27,227
When you work for justice
and the benefit of your client as lawyers,

810
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,812
you'll face this problem first.

811
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,065
Can we defend bad people?

812
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,652
And of course, by bad people,

813
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,696
I mean atrocious criminals

814
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,990
who committed a serious crime.

815
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:44,995
Now, can any of you
answer that with confidence?

816
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,915
CAN WE DEFEND BAD PEOPLE?

817
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,710
Latecomers,
can you each give me an answer?

818
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,920
Can you defend a bad person?

819
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,009
Article 12.4 of the Constitution says,

820
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,386
"Any person who is
arrested or detained shall have

821
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,513
the right
to prompt assistance of counsel."

822
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,976
But I still don't think
I can defend a bad person.

823
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,227
Why can't you do it?

824
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,981
I feel like I'll become a bad person too
while defending a guy like him.

825
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,316
Then don't take the bar.

826
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,692
Prof. Yang.

827
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,820
You cannot turn down a client
just because he or she is a bad person

828
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,488
denounced by the whole world.

829
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,867
Even bad people
have the right to be defended.

830
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,370
If you're afraid
defending him will make you bad,

831
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,623
Attorneys-at-Law Act Article 24…

832
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,500
Attorneys-at-Law Act Article 24,
Duty to Maintain Dignity.

833
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:36,212
Paragraph One, attorneys cannot
do anything to damage his or her dignity.

834
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,007
Paragraph Two, attorneys are prohibited

835
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,509
from concealing the truth
or making false statements.

836
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,929
If we can maintain our dignity,
there is no reason

837
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,013
to not defend them.

838
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,181
Whatever.

839
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:51,186
Back then,
if any attorneys stood on your side,

840
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,855
you may not have ended up
going to a juvie.

841
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,068
You don't care
how it'll go down in history,

842
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,488
but you only seek the judicial truth?

843
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:02,948
I see.

844
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,785
Ye-seul, what do you think?

845
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,207
I'm not sure yet.

846
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,670
I don't know if I have a right
to defend the good or the bad.

847
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,423
May I…

848
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,176
provide you the answer?

849
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,598
HAPPY CORRECTION, HAPPY PEOPLE

850
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,977
What were you thinking
when you got me an attorney?

851
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,480
It's not like you'll find out anything.

852
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:38,108
I'm sure you're aware
of his obligation to keep silent.

853
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,403
I know that very well.
So I want to hear it from you.

854
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,574
You murdered Seo Byung-ju
because of your son?

855
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,245
Did I say that?

856
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,041
I didn't have a drop of alcohol,

857
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,252
but I can't seem to remember.

858
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,461
And your insurance plan?

859
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:02,090
You said you let me live
as an insurance plan.

860
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,592
That means
you'll be put in an anxious position

861
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,177
once I die and disappear.

862
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,014
That could mean someone might be
involved in this murder.

863
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,475
For example, it could've been instigated
by someone, a murder by contract.

864
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,104
I see.

865
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:19,232
You'd rather die than go to prison,
but you needed to find your son.

866
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:21,609
So you killed him as you were told,
then blamed me.

867
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:26,239
Yet you're nothing but a ticking bomb
to the instigators of your murder,

868
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:29,492
so in case they try to get rid of you,

869
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,536
you hoped that I'd stay alive.

870
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,167
I'm alive and well,

871
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,671
and it looks like they abandoned you.

872
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,050
So now, tell me something.

873
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,815
What should I tell you?

874
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,193
You know what.

875
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,195
Your sentence will drop significantly

876
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,113
if it's instigated by another.

877
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,668
What did he say?

878
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,047
My gosh.
There was no use in acting as your driver.

879
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,007
Hop in.

880
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,319
Hello?

881
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,447
I'd like to ask you
about Lee Man-ho's son.

882
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,574
I have nothing to tell you.

883
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:54,869
I'll talk to you later.

884
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,163
Who was that?

885
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,208
I'll tell you later. Who was that?

886
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:01,876
Later.

887
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,049
So did Lee Man-ho really say

888
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:12,470
he killed Prof. Seo Byung-ju
because of his son?

889
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,765
That's enough for now.

890
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,350
I'll call you again.

891
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,060
All right.

892
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,823
Will you prosecute him?

893
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,036
Should I write up a draft?

894
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,874
Hey, come on!

895
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,501
How is she this strong?

896
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,337
Let's just go see him.
Let's go see him first, then…

897
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,922
What are you doing? Push her!

898
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,215
I'm not going!

899
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,593
I'll puke
as soon as I see Lee Man-ho's face.

900
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,636
Then go puke after you see him.

901
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,681
Hey, Bok-gi!

902
00:57:56,764 --> 00:58:00,268
This is dereliction of duties.
I can't count this as your internship.

903
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,812
Sol, just come with us
and just sit there, okay?

904
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,356
No, you go! I don't want to go there!

905
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,526
If only it wasn't for Prof. Yang…
I hate you, too!

906
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,778
Why did he put me up for this?

907
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,448
How can he ask me to defend a guy
who almost killed him?

908
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,366
That's why this draws attention.

909
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,411
And I took it because it's great publicity
without paying a dime.

910
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,289
Prof. Yang defends people like Ye-seul

911
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,832
instead of bad guys!

912
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,334
Tell me about it.

913
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,087
We might be stoned to death
while defending Lee Man-ho,

914
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,881
a guy everyone wants to avoid.

915
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,092
And you want to be a human rights lawyer?

916
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,763
I did something for you that you asked
for during Ye-seul's trial.

917
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,390
I do one for you, and you do one for me.

918
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,643
That's not the same as this!

919
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,019
You'll make me go deaf!

920
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,979
Go yell at Prof. Yang instead!

921
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,606
You can't even squeak before him.

922
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,150
Of course, I can squeak before him!
I'm good at it!

923
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:50,944
Squeak.

924
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,629
You don't plead the Fifth
when you're with your attorney.

925
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,006
He'd have no excuses to make.

926
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,926
Let's go.

927
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,306
Why are you so pissed?

928
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,809
You'd be the most thrilled that I'm here.

929
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,602
It'd be the best if I were not here.

930
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,937
You finally said something.

931
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,399
You ask him.

932
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,400
Ask him what?

933
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,824
I thought you were looking for your son.

934
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,660
-And you wanted him to see this?
-My gosh!

935
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:52,130
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT
CHARGE: PUBLICATION OF SUSPECTED CRIME

936
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,382
THE DEFENDANT, PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U…

937
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,723
Goodness. This isn't easy.

938
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,851
Are you having trouble?

939
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,895
Do your thing. Stop minding me.

940
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,694
Man, I can't do this.
I need to shower with cold water.

941
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,821
Don't get anywhere near my desk.

942
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,073
Okay.

943
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,761
THE DEFENDANT, PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

944
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,055
PUBLICIZED SUSPECTED CRIME
BEFORE THE INDICTMENT…

945
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,815
-Hey.
-Hey, he's here.

946
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,150
Hurry!

947
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:58,529
You're the first to be charged for leaking
suspected crime. How do you feel?

948
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,491
-Prosecutor!
-Please say something!

949
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,575
-Wait!
-Say something!

950
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,826
-A word!
-Wait!

951
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,621
ONLY THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED HAVE A FUTURE

952
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,499
Hello? Prosecutor Yang.

953
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,501
I have something to say. Come see me now!

954
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:21,803
EMERGENCY RESPONSE

955
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,852
Let us begin the trial
of case number 2021-GD523,

956
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,021
with Jin Hyeong-u as the defendant,

957
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,274
for publication of facts
of suspected crime.

958
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,487
You can't see Lee Man-ho today.

959
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,531
Was he in the ambulance?

960
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,368
VISITOR RECEPTION

961
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,203
The defendant, Jin Hyeong-u,

962
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:50,665
is not allowed
to publicize suspected crime

963
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:53,584
before the indictment as a prosecutor.

964
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,962
However, in September 2016,

965
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,339
during the investigation

966
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:01,801
of Defendant Seo Gi-yeol's
suspected crime,

967
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:06,097
he disclosed this information
to reporters Choi Jung-hyeok

968
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,683
and Kim Hyeon-jae
at an unspecified location

969
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:11,686
before the indictment had been made.

970
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,399
Defendant.

971
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,695
What's your opinion
regarding your charges?

972
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:24,574
Your Honor,

973
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,618
there is no precedent of an indictment

974
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,871
for violating Article 126
of the Criminal Code.

975
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,539
That article was as good as dead.

976
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,543
However, I stand here
as the first one to be indicted

977
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,213
to have a chance to share that
Article 126 of the Criminal Code

978
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,424
is an unconstitutional clause

979
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:44,635
which hinders the people's right to know.

980
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,055
I request an adjudication
on its constitutionality.

981
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,407
EMERGENCY CENTER

982
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:13,831
Choi Jae-cheol's bail request
was processed,

983
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,416
and he was released this morning.

984
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,461
But Lee Man-ho…

985
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,254
-What happened?
-Stabbed with a knife.

986
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,380
And the OR?

987
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,340
I'll check.

988
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,761
Hey. Hey! Wake up!

989
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,063
I can't…

990
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,107
I can't go down…

991
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,528
I can't go down alone.

992
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,332
What about Lee Man-ho?

993
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,876
Damn it.

994
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,087
That jerk…

995
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,424
That jerk…

996
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,095
What about that jerk?

997
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,973
That jerk…

998
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,812
No. Tell me.

999
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,189
Say it! Tell me!

1000
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,176
It's an arrest.

1001
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:53,180
-Who stabbed him?
-Ki Du-seong, the guy who stabbed you.

1002
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,724
Ki's become a hero.

1003
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:57,727
Accept the claim he acted
in self-defense and close the case.

1004
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,229
Just give the public what they want.

1005
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,024
I request Ms. Jeon to join in.

1006
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,775
Why don't you accept it?

1007
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,862
The moment I saw this photo,
I realized my hunch was wrong.

1008
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:09,780
I think he killed my uncle and tried

1009
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,491
to kill you as well
because someone put him up to it.

1010
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,910
How did I miss that?

1011
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,163
Don't trust your gut
as it has been proven to be unreliable.

1012
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,873
Investigate thoroughly.

1013
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,459
Someone's toying with me now.

1014
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,214
