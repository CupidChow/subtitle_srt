A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,357
OCTOBER 2010

3
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,652
The victim will be hospitalized for weeks,
but you didn't apologize.

4
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,615
She should apologize to my sister first.

5
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,408
"Victim"?

6
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,662
Kim Mi-ri bullied my twin sister.
She's the assailant.

7
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,208
The moment I saw her
setting my sister's hair on fire…

8
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,002
I lost it and punched her once.

9
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,088
-You punched her once?
-Correct.

10
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,256
There's no way she's that badly hurt.

11
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,842
-This is so unfair!
-Will you settle the case?

12
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,219
Are you kidding me?

13
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,806
Would you settle with a bully
who tortured your sister?

14
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,975
No, I'd just go to a juvie.

15
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,020
Juvie?

16
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,191
-What if I agree to settle the case?
-Probation.

17
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,072
Is she that kid?

18
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,493
The scumbag who has no remorse
for beating up someone?

19
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,372
Mister, who are you to call me a scumbag?

20
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,542
Kim Mi-ri is not showing any remorse
whatsoever.

21
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,460
Chief Prosecutor is her father.

22
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,800
If she apologizes for what she did
to my sister, I'll do the same.

23
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,847
But you shouldn't use your position
to help your daughter.

24
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,726
Send her to jail,
not the detention center.

25
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,230
She needs to be convicted
to learn her lesson.

26
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,982
After beating up someone,

27
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,151
she won't settle the case,
let alone apologize.

28
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,488
Which is why, instead of probation,
she'll be sent to the detention center.

29
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,240
What?

30
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,159
We cannot force her to apologize.

31
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,329
-It's against the freedom of conscience--
-Hey! Prosecutor Yang!

32
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,081
If you'd like a sincere apology,

33
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,125
-tell your daughter to--
-What?

34
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,506
Come to my office!

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,929
Prosecutor Yang.

36
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,979
I'm hungry. Let's order food.

37
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,025
You should go to his office now.

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,152
Order some food for her.

39
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,949
You are the assailant in this case
because you hit her.

40
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,994
Right, so I should reflect on my actions.

41
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,581
I was going to,

42
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,834
but can I have some food first?

43
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,045
-Is this the Great Wall?
-Extra pickles for me.

44
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,506
Extra pickles, please.

45
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:58,154
TRUTH AND JUSTICE ONLY BY THE LAW

46
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,283
Don't push.

47
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,284
Step backward.

48
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,036
-Don't push.
-It's him.

49
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,413
-Did you admit to the charges?
-A comment, please!

50
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,415
-Did you kill him?
-Do you admit to it?

51
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,001
I thought he was asleep.

52
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,254
I was so shocked.

53
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,840
My heart still races
whenever I think about it.

54
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,301
When I went there,
Professor Seo was alone.

55
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,761
He had a headache, so I left.

56
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,889
-I can go now, right?
-Did you hear anything?

57
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,766
The door opening, for example.

58
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,060
Should I just say I did?

59
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,395
-Tell us!
-Did you kill him?

60
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,854
Do you admit to the charges?

61
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,064
Did you kill him?

62
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,065
Why did you do it?

63
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,278
Did you do it alone?

64
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,862
Because of a personal grudge?

65
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,072
Give us a comment!

66
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,410
Why did you go there?

67
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,330
My footprints mean nothing
if you've arrested Professor Yang.

68
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,540
Right, but--

69
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,084
You should focus on proving
that he is indeed guilty.

70
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,587
Just a comment, please!

71
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,922
Was it planned?

72
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,549
-Over here!
-Did you do it alone?

73
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,342
-Did you do it?
-Over grudges?

74
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,635
Just a comment, please!

75
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,762
CITIZENS' POLICE
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT 1

76
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,473
This.

77
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,183
This.

78
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,394
And this too.

79
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,230
We lifted your prints off these,

80
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:20,069
which proves that you opened the lid,
put methamphetamine into the coffee,

81
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,741
and offered it to Seo Byung-ju.

82
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,536
If I killed him,
you wouldn't find my prints anywhere.

83
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,333
Prints are often left at the scene
if it occurred on the spur of the moment.

84
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,420
You two were very close
during your prosecutor days

85
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,756
but had a falling-out
due to the bribery case.

86
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,842
You quit being a prosecutor
because of him.

87
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,469
Clearly, you had a motive.

88
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,888
Then I would've killed him
a long time ago.

89
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,101
Pro-running AF, 270mm.

90
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,438
You wore the exact same running shoes
on the day of the incident.

91
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,025
But we couldn't find them anywhere
in your home or your office.

92
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,363
You threw them out to conceal the fact
that this impression is yours.

93
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,531
You destroyed evidence.

94
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:06,991
And your laptop?

95
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:11,162
Your TA said you use your laptop
to prepare for your classes.

96
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,830
It's not at school or at your home.

97
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,833
I lost it.

98
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:18,920
You lost it?

99
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,423
You just happened to lose your laptop

100
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,718
right after the incident?

101
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,722
If you think it can be used as evidence,
please find it.

102
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,307
You'll weasel out like this?

103
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,602
As for the running shoes,
ask Mr. Sung Dong-il in the copy room.

104
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,897
Detective Oh, ask him now.

105
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,400
I heard you used to work with him.

106
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,320
-Yes.
-Are you all right?

107
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,656
We had to arrest him.

108
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,699
We were afraid he'd flee.

109
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,579
You see, we'd never cuff
a Hankuk University law professor

110
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,041
in front of his students
without sufficient evidence.

111
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,212
You would've left the country
had we not arrested you.

112
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,048
The night of the incident,

113
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,343
you booked a flight to Boston for today.

114
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,637
A one-way flight, not a round trip.

115
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,264
E-TICKET ITINERARY

116
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,641
PASSPORT

117
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,229
E-TICKET ITINERARY

118
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,860
A one-way flight? Why?

119
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,195
To never come back?

120
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,448
But why?

121
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,457
The copy room is closed.

122
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,460
I can't reach Sung Dong-il.

123
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,920
What? You mean, he's gone AWOL?

124
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,050
Don't tell me you killed him too.

125
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,264
Instead of your missing laptop,

126
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,517
we'll have to look through this.

127
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,311
Unlock it for us.

128
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,732
Using my fingerprint this way
is considered coercion.

129
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,484
"Coercion"?

130
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,071
What does your fingerprint
have to do with--

131
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,907
If you use my fingerprint this way

132
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,118
to coerce a confession,
it'll be considered unlawful.

133
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,084
What's in this thing?

134
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,922
As of this moment, I plead the Fifth.

135
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,720
Request a warrant
and send this to Digital Forensics.

136
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,138
Yes, sir.

137
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,188
You have to watch out for jerks
who know the law well.

138
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,898
I heard there were injection marks.

139
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,526
From insulin injections.
The victim was diabetic.

140
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,445
The methamphetamine was administered
in powder form.

141
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,073
None of the suspects
has handled a syringe before.

142
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,826
If personal grudge was the motive,
ask Oh to be a character witness.

143
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,788
He must've witnessed them
having a falling-out.

144
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,566
Just unlock it.

145
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,819
If you don't,
the police will suspect you more.

146
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,784
Are the DNA results out?

147
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,164
Okay.

148
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,462
The hair found in Seo Byung-ju's hand
is also yours.

149
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,758
You should hire an attorney.

150
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,729
What's going on? Why did they arrest you?

151
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,646
For murder?

152
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,981
Please uncuff him.

153
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,650
Do you have an attorney?
Have you hired one yet?

154
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,235
What is going on?

155
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,198
Oh, my TA has the flash drive
with all the exam questions.

156
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,498
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

157
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,416
Hey, Seo Ji-ho.

158
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,419
Professor Yang got arrested
in front of us.

159
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,422
Does finishing the mock trial
even matter in this situation?

160
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,634
I don't want to make time for this again,
with midterms coming up.

161
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,595
-Even so--
-Study like your life depends on it.

162
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,805
This time, it's do well or die.

163
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,516
-Don't even say that word.
-My gosh!

164
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,019
There's a video of Yangcrates' arrest
on the Internet.

165
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,062
What?

166
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,772
-Here.
-Many people have watched it.

167
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,856
Who posted this?

168
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,774
SUSPECT ARRESTED

169
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,318
What? You can see his face in this video!

170
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,070
Who did this? This is defamation--

171
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,571
It's what a murderer deserves.

172
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,073
Who is a murderer?

173
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,450
He might be evil in class

174
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,743
but can't be a killer.

175
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,330
-Something's gone terribly wrong.
-What's your point?

176
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,457
Why did you ask us to stay?

177
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,919
What I'm trying to say is…

178
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,922
Why don't we submit a petition
to the police?

179
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,924
Let's tell them he'd never do
such a thing.

180
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,384
Can you be sure?

181
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,637
-What?
-Are we sure he'd never do that?

182
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,811
Yes. The Professor Yang I know
would never kill anyone.

183
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,812
No.

184
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,856
On what grounds?

185
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,818
They may release him in 48 hours.

186
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,486
He's innocent until proven guilty.

187
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,029
The presumption of innocence.

188
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,032
"Innocence"?

189
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,535
He was deemed guilty
the moment they cuffed him.

190

HANKUK UNIVERSITY

191
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,581
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

192
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,669
If you're going to the police station,
ask Professor Yang

193
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,712
about our Criminal Code exam.

194
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,927
What? Ask him about the exam?

195
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,470
For real?

196
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,471
-Yes.
-Yes.

197
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,344
-Nothing's been confirmed yet.
-We know nothing.

198
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,180
-"Law school murderer"?
-We have no way

199
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,514
of knowing what the police…

200
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,391
-The police are on it.
-We want to know.

201
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,393
-It's not true.
-Someone else will do it?

202
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,311
It's not that.

203
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,730
Professor Yang already wrote
all the exam questions.

204
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,482
-We know nothing.
-They're useless.

205
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,984
He can't even mark the exams now.

206
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,569
The police may release him.

207
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,739
The police arrested
a Hankuk University law professor

208
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,492
in front of his students
without a warrant.

209
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,160
They wouldn't do it for no reason.

210
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,662
Look, the phone's ringing off the hook!

211
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,457
-That's--
-Everyone is in panic mode now.

212
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,044
The dean's been meeting
with the president every day,

213
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,296
and the alumni have been complaining.

214
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,632
The president is worried
they'd halt funding.

215
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,051
Professor Yang has done so much harm
to the school.

216
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,677
What if they release him?

217
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,680
If the police fail to get
an arrest warrant within 48 hours--

218
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,849
The warrant has been issued.

219
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,021
We can't revise our academic calendar
because of Professor Yang.

220
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,364
I'm telling you.
These running shoes are mine.

221
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,116
That day,
I had to attend a funeral unexpectedly.

222
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,661
Clothes-wise, I was okay,
but I only had these runners,

223
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,621
so Professor Yang lent me his shoes.

224
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,332
And it's not like
I intentionally avoided your calls.

225
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,626
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

226
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,880
My leg got trapped by a subway train,
so I was in the hospital.

227
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,008
Here, look at this.

228
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,094
You were hospitalized?

229
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,096
I dropped my phone and broke the screen.

230
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,847
And Professor Yang got arrested.

231
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,517
My goodness, talk about bad timing.

232
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,979
Anyway, I swear
I didn't purposely avoid your calls…

233
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,023
I swear. Please believe me.

234
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,358
You can look into it.

235
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,694
Check my hospital bill and track my phone.

236
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,946
Sure. You're done talking, right?

237
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:24,864
What?

238
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:26,824
What about the shoes?

239
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,952
Right, where are the shoes?

240
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,914
The doctor ran all kinds of tests,
so they kept moving me around.

241
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,833
-From a two-person room--
-You lost them?

242
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,251
Yes, for real.

243
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,003
No worries. It's tainted evidence.

244
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,548
I can go?

245
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,759
I'd like to see him since I'm here anyway.

246
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,344
Go to the detention center.

247
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,555
We've handed him over.

VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT 1

ARRESTED AS PRIME SUSPECT

250
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,896
No wonder he got arrested.

251
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,230
What was he thinking?

252
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,815
Why didn't he hire an attorney?

253
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,819
Didn't he have one for the warrant review?

254
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,739
He refused to hire one,
so the court got him a public defender.

255
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,200
He's a Hankuk Law graduate,
but a total nutcase.

256
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,119
Him being a public defender is comedy.

257
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,621
Don't blame him.

258
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,665
I heard Professor Yang shut him up
and said nothing

259
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,292
in front of the judge.

260
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,002
Jeez.

261
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,838
He should be vehemently protesting
his innocence.

262
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,467
This punk should keep his mouth shut
to help him.

263
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,973
But what if Professor Yang
had nothing to prove or explain?

264
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,477
Maybe he really killed him.

265
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,442
Got a death wish?

Oh, boy.

00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,796
My gosh.

271
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,048
The trial ran late.

272
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,926
The judge went on
about gender sensitivity.

273
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,762
Hello.

274
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,431
Where were we?

275
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,356
You got a warrant

276
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,775
to get his phone unlocked?

277
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,738
Looks like you have no choice.

Is this the car?

285
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,116
We found this near the crime scene.

286
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,660
The hit-and-run happened
when you were headed home

287
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,911
after committing the act.

288
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,958
You passed by the scene on your way home,
so try to remember.

289
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,836
Did you see the driver
who hit the kid and fled?

290
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,715
He says he was too drunk
to even remember raping the girl.

291
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,217
Even if he saw the car,
he wouldn't remember.

292
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,720
-Right?
-If you're playing dumb

293
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,722
to use feeble-mindedness as an excuse--

294
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,266
If that's what you're doing,
don't even try.

295
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,728
I never fall for that bullshit.

296
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,230
A life sentence, right?

297
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,232
He'll rot in jail
for the rest of his life.

298
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,235
He could get beaten to death in there,
if he's unlucky.

299
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,615
If you saw it, just say so.

300
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,706
Well, I'm just curious.

301
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,501
If I say that I saw the license plate,

302
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,462
what will you do for me?

303
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,256
-You saw it?
-You saw it?

Don't tell me Prosecutor Seo is…

310
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,987
He definitely saw the car.

311
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,032
He's insisting he doesn't remember
to be deemed feeble-minded.

312
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,618
Tell him he won't get his way.

313
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,454
Then I'll persuade him to give us a lead…

314
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,835
Feeble-mindedness due to alcoholism…

315
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,420
is right.

316
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,811

317
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,107
What's wrong?

Guys!

321
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,251
Prof. Jung's writing our exam questions
instead of Prof. Yang.

322
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,669
He hasn't been indicted yet.

323
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,006
He was taken into custody
and got arrested right away,

324
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,633
so I bet they think
he'll be indicted for sure.

325
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,263
Do you have his old exams?

326
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,434
He hates students talking about
his exam questions,

327
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,977
so he takes the question sheets.

328
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,812
I bet there's nothing.

329
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,982
Who took Professor Jung's class?

330
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,404
The batch right before us
couldn't take his class

331
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,323
because he was on sabbatical.

332
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,075
Can you get his old exams?

333
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,160
Me?

334
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,455
You got an A+ on all your finals.
What's your secret?

335
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,540
That's…

336
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,336
Professor Jung Dae-hyeon's old exams.
Join me in the study room.

337
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,675
-Hey, come on.
-What?

338
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,593
What is it?

339
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,803
Seung-jae, are you coming?

340
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,263
Yes.

341
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,940
LAW AND ORDER THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST

342
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,485
I have no idea why you pleaded the Fifth
and got a public defender.

343
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,028
Stop this.

344
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,364
Can my exam take place
before the Civil Code exam?

345
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,408
Why can't law professors
practice law on the side?

346
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,662
If the Legal Clinic professors
were allowed to do it,

347
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,789
-I'd be your attorney.
-The exam schedule--

348
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,958
Who cares about that?
You've been arrested!

349
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,085
What the heck are you thinking?

350
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,837
The questions that you wrote…

351
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,341
They'll be useless.

352
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,555
Professor Jung will rewrite them
instead of you.

353
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,599
That won't happen.

354
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,685
Don't you see what's going on?

355
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,979
If you get indicted, you'll lose your job.

356
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,857
Tell the vice dean
I must speak to him in person.

357
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,278
So what if he comes here?
Will it change anything?

358
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,322
Professor Yang!

359
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,867
Gosh, that stubborn man.

360
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,542
Please begin.

361
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,924
CRIMINAL CODE MIDTERM EXAM
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

362
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,434
Student A, who is against

363
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,729
the faculty appointment of Lawyer B,
a former chief prosecutor,

364
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,565
put up this notice
on the school bulletin board.

365
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,402
You can access the petition below
by scanning the QR code on it.

366
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,739
MARCH 2020

367
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,073
What is this?

368
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,241
-This is weird.
-Hey.

369
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,076
Hey.

370
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,709
What's this?

371
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,918
What?

372
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,128
A petition?

373
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,671
What a way to trick people.

374
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,715
We have to sign it to join him?

375
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,594
Studying with the second-round passer.
It is very enticing.

376
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,846
You'll do this?
You have your own study group.

377
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,931
He passed the second-round judicial exam.

378
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,392
But should I sign this or not?

379
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,102
Do it and piss the school off?

380
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,187
Sign what?

381
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,653
"Compensation for unlawful acts."

382
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,074
If I were to choose the worst one,
I'd pick defamation.

383
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,409
This one is the biggest headache.

384
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,703
What did you learn
in your Criminal Code class?

385
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,288
What constitutes as defamation?

386
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,874
Publicly alleging detailed facts
that devalue

387
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,501
or harm someone's reputation.

388
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,086
Oh, okay.

389
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,712
But the thing is,

390
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,049
we also need to look at
whether it's likely to spread

391
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,675
and whether it's a true fact.

392
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,304
There's a fine line
between criticism and slander.

393
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,057
COMPENSATION FOR UNLAWFUL ACTS

394
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,605
SIGN THE PETITION!

395
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,608
Who's seen this petition
on the bulletin board?

396
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,822
Okay.

397
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,951
I heard the student who put it up
is also here.

398
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,040
Go take it down at once.

399
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,752
Then I wouldn't even have bothered
getting it approved.

400
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,671
You refuse to take it down?

401
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,132
-Yes.
-What?

402
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,049
Please.

403
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,053
What's your name?

404
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,805
I'm Han Joon-hwi.

405
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,350
The school will take legal action
against you based on

406
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,562
Article 307 of the Criminal Code
and Article 750 of the Civil Code.

407
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,481
You'll be held liable for all damages
caused by your statement.

408
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,693
Hire an attorney.

409
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,657
-My gosh.
-What is going on?

410
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,325
-What will happen now?
-No idea.

411
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,493
That was scary.

412
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,999
The school warned A
that they would take legal action

413
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:23,378
if he did not take down the notice
and stopped petitioning at once,

414
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,713
but A refused.

415
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,966
Can A be legally punished for his action?

416
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,760
What conditions must be met
for him to be punished?

417
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,098
It's a false defamatory statement.

418
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,516
It's just my opinion.

419
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,728
Studying law with the donation
that caused a bribery scandal…

420
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,979
It's humiliating.

421
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,274
Defamation is a false statement of fact,
not opinion.

422
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,694
But you wrote that the school hired Seo
as a professor

423
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:51,448
because of his donation as if it's a fact
and questioned their "real motive."

424
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,117
You wrote this without checking the facts.

425
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,827
You're spreading false information.

426
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,247
I just wanted them to clear the suspicion.

427
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,833
I guess it can be seen that way.

428
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,127
So you admit it's false info?

429
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,212
CHECK, "REAL MOTIVE"

430
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,882
He'll be subject to a criminal punishment
even if it's a fact.

431
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,635
Wordings such as "bribery scandal"
and "real motive"

432
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,887
-defame the school and Seo Byung-ju--
-Why?

433
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,514
If it was in the public interest,
he won't be.

434
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,891
Justification.

435
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,144
It's not like he did it
for his own selfish gain.

436
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,064
As Hankuk Law students,
we have the right to know.

437
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,900
Let's be honest.
The timing is very suspicious.

438
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,236
Getting hired
right after making the donation.

439
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,239
Just because it seems suspicious
doesn't mean it's a fact.

440
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,243
SIGN THE PETITION!
WITHDRAW B'S APPOINTMENT!

441
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,418
FALSE INFORMATION

442
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,337
FACT

443
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:12,320
Prosecutor Yang, what are you doing here?

444
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,865
At first,

445
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,411
the detectives suspected me.

446
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,872
When I proved my alibi,

447
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,168
they didn't even hide
their disappointment.

448
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,258
Gosh, I'm his attorney.
Why do I have to wait outside?

449
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,262
Do you guys have a microwave here?

450
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,680
Hey, seriously.

451
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,224
I thought this would shackle me down.

452
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,476
Who knew it'd help me?

453
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,939
Thanks to this, I could prove
that I wasn't at the murder scene.

454
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,318
Now, do you remember?

455
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,673
Damn it.

456
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,384
Hey! Wait!

457
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,719
Stop for a second.

458
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,846
Wait! Stop!

459
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,532
07P 4295

460
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,704
This is what I saw.

461
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,415
07P 4295

462
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,417
Lawyer Seo Byung-ju…

463
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,045
Oh, right.
He was a prosecutor at the time.

464
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:57,467
Prosecutor Seo told me
that I must take it to my grave,

465
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,096
so I had no choice.

466
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,183
Is that why you went to Seo Byung-ju
and got a job as his driver?

467
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,770
I had nothing else going on,
so I asked him just in case.

468
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,271
And he hired me.

469
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,232
Jeez.

470
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,442
Just to cover up his hit-and-run accident,

471
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,279
he accepted my argument that
I was feeble-minded and let me out.

472
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,698
I guess he wanted to keep me close

473
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,659
for his peace of mind.

474
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,743
That bastard…

475
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,373
God…

476
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,459
KANG SOL A

477
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,919
Time's up.

478
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,630
Put your pens down. Hands in your laps.

479
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,548
Gosh.

480
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,555
Time's up. She can't keep writing.

481
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,597
Hey, you!

482
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,515
Put your pen down.

483
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,101
I'll tell your professor.

484
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,894
-Wait.
-Hand it in.

485
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,396
-Just a second.
-Hand it in now.

486
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,814
-Come on.
-Just a second!

487
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,732
No!

488
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,195
His attempt to cover up the hit-and-run…

489
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,030
CODE OF LAW

490
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,657
…cost him his life.

491
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,326
When you found out

492
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,248
that he was the culprit
behind your only cold case,

493
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,793
you must've been awfully shocked.

494
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:18,590
I, too, would've felt so betrayed
and wanted to kill him.

495
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,093
Okay, we have a motive.

496
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,094
We sure do.

497
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,686
-Hand him over to the prosecution.
-Okay.

498
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,774
Wait, but…

499
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,233
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

500
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,156
A is Han Joon-hwi, and B is Seo Byung-ju.

501
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,784
Gosh, how could Yangcrates give us
a question like this?

502
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,494
Especially given the situation.

503
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,705
He's a sociopath. Would Joon-hwi
want to solve this question?

504
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,790
Yeah, he seemed fine.

505
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,501
I grieved as I solved this.

506
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,586
I couldn't stop thinking of Professor Seo.

507
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,297
If Yangcrates killed him…
I'm getting shivers.

508
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,591
What's going to happen to Sol now?

509
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,468
She should get a zero.

510
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,303
She only handed it in 30 seconds late.

511
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,764
That's a lot.
We all could've used extra time.

512
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,308
Won't you benefit the most
if she gets a zero?

513
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,811
-You two are at the bottom.
-Hey, watch what you say!

514
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:13,895
I did well this time.

515
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,940
Isn't the answer,
"False information, defamation"?

516
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,274
Yeah, obviously.

517
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,818
Ms. Oh proved it.

518
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,320
PROVING THE ALLEGATION WRONG

519
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:25,740
Everything about the alleged deal
is not true.

520
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,659
See it for yourself.

521
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,077
-For real?
-Is that true?

522
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,411
-Look at that.
-My gosh.

523
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,667
This proves
that there was nothing unlawful

524
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,168
about his appointment.

525
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,089
Do not expect any leniency.

526
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,092
We'll hold a disciplinary hearing
and decide

527
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,761
whether to expel you
or cancel your admission altogether.

528
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,855
I didn't know it was a false allegation.

529
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,318
Article 307-2 of the Criminal Code
states that

530
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,612
the alleged fact must be false

531
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,739
and the one making the allegation

532
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,742
must be aware of it
in order for it to qualify as defamation.

533
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,870
If the person believed that it was true,

534
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,872
it can't be considered an illegal act.

535
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,292
You believed such a deal
actually took place?

536
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,796
That means
you don't trust the school at all.

537
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,341
It means he doesn't trust me at all.

538
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,221
I always said any freebies
are considered bribes,

539
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,016
yet I accepted free land as a gift.

540
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,186
I understand why he doesn't trust me.

541
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,526
You quit the judicial exam

542
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,029
and even got yourself in trouble here.

543
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,616
What are you doing?

544
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,745
Whose fault is it that I gave up?

545
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,497
Make a donation and leave.

546
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,666
I don't want you to come here.

547
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,293
Must you do this?

548
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,549
Yes.

549
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,595
I came here
so I wouldn't turn out like you.

550
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,096
I refuse to learn from you.

551
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,601
Don't you know that you're not qualified
to teach at a law school?

552
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,604
As for the bribe, I was found not guilty--

553
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,357
You got away with it
because they couldn't prove it.

554
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,736
Stop toying with the law
and deceiving people.

555
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,449
Joon-hwi.

556
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,952
I'm sick of asking you
how you ended up in this mess.

557
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,082
I don't care what you do, Uncle.

558
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,250
Just stay out of my sight.

559
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,175
Must you make such a fuss? Oh, dear.

560
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,387
Think about how much money
he's given them.

561
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,390
What's the big deal
about getting hired as a professor?

562
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,241
Jeez.

563
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,122
What's going on?

564
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,832
What's with you and Professor Seo?

565
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,208
I know there's something.

566
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,627
Hey, what's going on?

567
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,380
-You need ointment.
-No.

568
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,049
Tell me, or I'll drag you.

569
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,304
He's my uncle.

570
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,140
What?

571
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,770
Hey, Joon-hwi!

572
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,482
So you have it out for your own uncle?

573
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,778
You want to ruin your own future
because he betrayed your trust?

574
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,364
If you get expelled,
what about my studies?

575
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,284
Darn it! I signed the petition, you know.

576
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,703
KANG SOL A

577
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,498
Look, this dot here.

578
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,751
This is my signature.

579
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,419
It's tiny, but…

580
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,796
Gosh, fine.

581
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,799
I wanted to study with you
but didn't want the school to hate me.

582
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,217
So I used this trick.

583
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,680
Do you think you can win against Ms. Oh?

584
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,101
Enough, okay?

585
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,061
Yes, enough.

586
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,730
Ms. Oh was a Supreme Court justice.

587
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,523
-Don't regret this.
-My point exactly.

588
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,650
Don't regret it later. Just take it down.

589
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,487
Ms. Oh is clearly out to get you.

590
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,863
-Am I?
-What?

591
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:41,913
You think I'm out to get Joon-hwi?

592
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,956
Oh, you heard that?

593
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,627
Just before that, I said
he should listen to you and take it down.

594
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,795
Right?

595
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,172
I said that.

596
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,300
I hear the police interviewed you?

597
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,178
Ms. Oh, please give me a chance.

598
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,347
-I promise you I'll persuade him--
-No.

599
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,601
I'll never take it down of my own accord.

600
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,478
Then I'll do it.

601
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,813
If you give me a chance,

602
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,608
I'll show you that
you're indeed out to get me.

603
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,407
-Did you finish photocopying it?
-Yes, here.

604
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,035
DEFAMATION CASES

605
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,829
What? You'll show her?

606
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,746
What's going on?

607
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,875
Read this and refer to it
while writing my defense argument.

608
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,252
No, I don't want to.

609
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,753
Stop talking nonsense.

610
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,338
I can't defend you.

611
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,299
I agree. It makes no sense.

612
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,803
How will you trust that girl
with such an unfit legal mind?

613
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,180
These are all recent. Do more research.

614
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,390
No, I can't do this.

615
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,183
I can't. Your future depends on this.

616
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,353
Why me?
There are so many smart people here.

617
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,898
Hey, there are many people
who'd happily defend you.

618
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,233
You really think so?

619
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,237
Who will side with me,
knowing I'm fighting against the school?

620
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,784
Come on. You can still do better than her.

621
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,662
She said "self-comfort"
instead of "self-help."

622
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,959
Why glare at me?
I just deeply empathize with you.

623
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,502
What if I do it?

624
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,588
I know you can't do it.

625
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,299
I can! What will you do if I pull it off?

626
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,550
You can't.

627
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,262
Hire me if I pull it off.

628
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,346
Deal!

629
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,184
So just study this first, right?

630
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,979
I studied the defamation law so much.

631
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,276
Gosh, I should've just handed it in
on time.

632
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,277
ZERO

633
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,031
Didn't it say you must allocate
enough time for each question?

634
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,701
Gosh, why did I change my answer?

635
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,039
I won't actually get a zero, right?

636
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,503
Go beg him if you're that worried.

637
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,089
I can't do that.

638
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,675
-You'll visit him.
-That's…

639
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,637
That's because I'm worried
about Professor Yang.

640
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,388
You're not desperate enough yet.

641
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,681
Worry about yourself.

642
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,435
If you don't want another warning,
act before they finish marking…

643
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,855
How are they going to mark the exams?

644
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,696
I did you a favor,

Just admit to it
and ask for a lighter sentence.

Lawyer Park speaking.

652
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,140
Lawyer, my ass.

653
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,058
You nutjob!

654
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,061
You're defending Professor Yang?

655
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,854
I'm busy at the moment.

656
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,773
-Let's--
-Did you take the answer sheets?

657
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:56,983
What did you tell him?

658
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,528
Oh, right! See this one that's taped up?

659
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:05,741
-The student kept writing even after--
-Hey!

660
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,201
Don't tell him.

661
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,369
Why not?

662
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,162
His TA asked me to relay the message.

663
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,039
Keep your mouth shut. You forgot.

664
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,417
I did, but I remembered it thanks to you.

665
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,210
I'm going to tell your wife

666
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,963
that you only take on dirty cases
that pay a lot!

667
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,091
Can I talk to him?

668
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,802
You can't talk to a suspect.

669
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,470
You sneaked your phone in there

670
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,597
so you can make money
off things like this!

671
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,183
I'll just close out your tab.

672
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,311
A call for you.

673
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,064
Hold on.

674
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,692

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,081
Why haven't they released you yet?

680
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,249
THE DONATION IS A FACT

681
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,668
The cops said
the runners are tainted evidence.

Hello?

686
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,639
Marking the exams isn't important now.
I need to know more to help you!

00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,974

-Hello?

00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,229
Yes, sir.

691
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,523
A prosecutor who lives by the rules.

"Rules"?

693
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,195
I wish to show
what a true prosecutor ought to be

694
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,239
to those who abuse the law
for their own selfish gain.

695

Prosecutors who abuse the law?

696
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,244
Those who know the law well

697
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,081
are more dangerous than those
who know nothing about it.

698
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,542
What are the rules
you wish to strictly abide by?

699
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,922
The principle of legality
and the presumption of innocence.

I have no idea why your name
is in your uncle's will,

which he had written before he died.

00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,339
This is for you
to disclaim your inheritance.

So, it's about money.

We don't even know who killed him yet.

716
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,935
The police will catch
and punish the killer.

717
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,439
Even if Professor Yang
actually killed him,

718
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,399
I hate you more than him.

719

I want to stop hating you,

I really didn't want to see him again

Hand over the keys.

730
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,659

-Yes, sir.

Oh, right.

Do you want to be cordial

Right, yes.

Then let me work on this.

00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:22,951

Fire Yang Jong-hoon.

745
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,874
But we don't have
the court's decision yet.

Don't you know

747
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,754
people don't care about that?

748
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,881
They're enraged by the suspicion.

749
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,634
We can't let the court of public opinion
sway us.

750
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,595
According to our rules,
he needs to be indicted for us to--

751
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,597
Then change the rules and get him fired!

752
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,476
Calm down. He's been handed over
to the prosecution, so let's wait--

753
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,019
Who do you have to thank

754
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,647
for your mock courtroom?

755
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,069
If you don't do as I say,
you'll regret it later on.

00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:04,243

758
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,457
I'll go.

00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,835
Sir.

760
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,756
I get he's in the Committee,
but he's overstepping the bounds.

761
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,050
You're frustrating me here.

762
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:24,012
If we piss him off,
we'll see a massive drop in donations.

763
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,850
You shouldn't say that,
knowing your law school spends the most.

He wishes to take the Fifth all the way.

769
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,169
Since there's plenty of evidence,
we can indict you

770
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,379
right away even without your confession.

771
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,551
That means marking these

772
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,928
is pointless, right?

773
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,061
If you get indicted,
you'll lose your job right away.

774

Isn't this a complete waste of time?

00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,403
If you say you'll confess to the crime,
I'll let you finish…

776
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,282
I'll be done soon. Just talk to him.

777

He doesn't want to explain himself here.
He'll do it in the courtroom.

I let the kids use this room so they could

For free.

786
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,005
It was so much work
to find all those cases.

787
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,882
It's rewarding though.

788
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,843

PROSECUTION

792
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:36,395
Han Joon-hwi did not know
that what he wrote in the petition

793
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,647
was based on false information.

794
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:42,234
Since Mr. Seo Byung-ju was appointed
as a professor

795
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,986
right after making the donation,

796
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,071
the suspicion was reasonable.

797
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:50,075
He approached Mr. Seo directly
to verify the suspicion,

798
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:54,079
and Mr. Seo told him to think
however he wanted

799
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,081
instead of denying it.

800
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,378
That was because his question
wasn't worth answering.

801
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,964
He's smart enough to have understood
what Mr. Seo meant.

802
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,883
And also because Mr. Seo

803
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,636
is his uncle.

804
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,894
He was not able to submit any evidence

805
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,397
to prove that his allegation
was founded on facts.

806
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:25,027
You think that smart guy actually
believed such an unfounded suspicion?

807
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,654
If he knew it wasn't true,
why did he put up--

808
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,407
He laid down a smoke screen
because he was afraid

809
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,660
that his admission might seem to be
related to the donation.

810
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,080
I could've used such help,
but he didn't need to go that route

811
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,458
as he passed the second round
of the judicial exam.

812
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,962
If I were the dean,
I'd want to pay him to join the school.

813
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,966
Had he known that it wasn't true,

814
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,553
he wouldn't have put up a petition
attacking his dear uncle.

815
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,805
Even urging people to sign it.

816
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,809
He did it even though it pained him
because he believed it was true.

817
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,354
For the sake of justice
and for his uncle--

818
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,647
Thank you.

819
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,775
-I still--
-Now, from the prosecutor's perspective.

820
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,778
-Pardon? Professor, I--
-Ji-ho, you be the defense attorney.

821
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,116
He's putting his specialty to use.

822
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,416
Why on earth did Joon-hwi

823
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,961
put up such a petition
that attacks his dear uncle?

824
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:26,546
Goodness.

825
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,633
Seeing his uncle trying to
evade responsibility made him believe

826
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,135
-his suspicion was true.
-He was attacking him.

827
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,346
He's dissing himself now.

828
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,640
Even though it pained him,

829
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,393
for the sake of justice and for his uncle,

830
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,645
he made that decision.

831
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,063
Unbelievable.

832
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,981
He's reversing his own argument.

833
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,358
He can't be trusted.

834
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,278
THE ACCUSED

835
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,446
Prosecution.

836
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,615
I think…

837
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,744
Joon-hwi…

838
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,497
Even though he knew it was not true,

839
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,584
because of his personal grudge
against Mr. Seo…

840
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,466
I'm sorry.

841
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,387
You can do it.

842
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,390
No, I can't.

843
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,771
The prosecution gave up,

844
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,274
so Joon-hwi won.

845
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,736
The school will drop the case then.

846
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,779
-What?
-Seriously?

847
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:34,322
For real?

848
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,282
What the…

849
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,825
What's going on?

850
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,953
Was her name Kang Sol?

851
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:46,710
When I saw her sitting there
looking dazed and confused…

852
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,046
She's like you in your younger days?

853
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,882
You cried, saying you couldn't do it.

854
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,137
When I was told to attack my own argument…

855
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,973
Gosh, I hated it so much.

856
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,477
So, I became a judge instead of a lawyer.

857
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,354
Anyway, I'm sure the kids in their 1L year

858
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,649
now fully understand defamation
thanks to your little show.

859
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,529
Without it, the president
wouldn't have let him go unpunished.

860
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,949
Our plan totally worked.

861
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,326
"Our plan"?

862
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,413
At the entrance ceremony,

863
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,583
you said you'd do anything
for the students.

864
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,794
Yes, I did.

865
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,713
Did you see the petition on the board?

866
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,340
"Petition"?

867
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:37,719
How about we put on
a little show together for the students?

868
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,726
Let's visit him together.

869
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,818
DETAINEE NUMBER: 2023

870

VISITATION FORM
NAME: YANG JONG-HOON

871
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,408
Can you be sure?

872
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,868
VISITOR NAME

873
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,830
Are we sure he'd never do that?

874
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,208
VISITOR NAME

875

RESTRICTED ITEMS

877
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:13,880
Hey.

878
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,216
VISITATION FORM

879
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:22,973
VISITOR NAME
KANG SOL, HAN JOON-HWI

880
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:29,729
Professor.

881
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,857
-Are you okay?
-The verdict?

882
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,358
Pardon me?

883
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,318
Guilty of the murder?

884
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,612
What do you mean?

885
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,365
I've been acquitted.

886
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,411
They couldn't prove it
beyond a reasonable doubt.

887
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,789
Oh, the mock trial.

888
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,625
I wanted to pronounce him guilty,

889
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,377
but because of the reasonable doubt…

890
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,795
So, he was found not guilty.

891
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,131
So, you didn't kill her.

892
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,299
I did.

893
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,216
What?

894
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,428
The lack of evidence saved me.

895
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,431
What? So my hunch was right?

896
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,516
You said you didn't kill the victim.

897
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,977
I was the judge. I let a murderer go?

898
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,312
I can't believe this.

899
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,105
Darn it.

900
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,274
What about you?

901
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,613
Did you kill him?

902
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,493
My gosh, please have a look.

903
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,411
Thank you.

904
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,538
Please have a look. Hello!

905
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,789
We just opened.

906
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:30,707
Please take this.

907
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,257
Next news.

908
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,260
It looks like Professor Yang Jong-hoon
of Hankuk Law School,

909
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:46,431
who was arrested for the murder of
Seo Byung-ju, will soon be indicted.

910
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,390
Reporter Choi.

911
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,768
Yes, it seems like his motive

912
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:53,063
was linked to
the Jurae-dong hit-and-run case,

913
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,731
which has left many people shocked.

914
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:58,318
In order to cover up his hit-and-run case,
Lawyer Seo Byung-ju

915
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:02,030
struck a deal
with the child rapist Lee Man-ho,

916
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,782
the only witness of the accident.

917
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,535
Yang, who was the prosecutor
in charge of the Jurae-dong case,

918
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,789
had a falling-out with Seo
upon finding out the truth….

919
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:11,748
Thank you…

920
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,215
…had a falling out with Seo…

921
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,216
Are you all right?

922
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,301
upon finding out the truth.

923
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,679
Based on that, the police identified

924
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,639
Yang Jong-hoon as the prime suspect.

925
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:31,142
The on-site inspection Yang requested
will be conducted today.

926
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:33,561
You're taking the Fifth.

927
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,814
Will you cooperate
with the on-site inspection?

928
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,817
Seo struck a deal with Lee Man-ho
to cover up the hit-and-run.

929
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,318
Was that your motive?

930
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,070
Make a comment!

931
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,281
POLICE

932
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,044

00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,263
WAITING ROOM

934
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,234

935
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,948
POLICE LINE

936
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,242
DO NOT ENTER

937
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:36,207
Hey. How come they're considered
witnesses and we aren't?

938
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,626
Seung-jae wasn't here
at the time of the murder,

939
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,462
and I was nowhere near that room.

940
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,130
You want to be there?

941
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,799
-Yeah.
-You could be seen as a suspect.

942
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,470
Isn't Joon-hwi there
as the victim's family?

943
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,638
Oh, maybe.

944
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,556
You can't do that!

945
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,682
-What?
-Just a moment.

946
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,683
-Get out.
-Wait.

947
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,310
Get out. You cannot come in here.

948
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,980
Let's start in the media room.
This way, please.

949
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:15,538
Mr. Seo wanted to take an early break
on the day of the incident

950
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,457
because of a headache?

951
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,501
Correct.

952
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,004
2P.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020,
THE DAY OF THE MURDER

953
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,464
Let's take a 30-minute break.

954
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,144
Are you all right?

955
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,980
If you're tired, we can just wrap up here.

956
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,359
I took headache pills, so I'll be fine.

957
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,486
Okay.

958
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,655
Professor Kim.

959
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,492
I know you're holding back

960
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,287
many things you want to say to me.

961
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,750
You do? What a shame.

962
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,212
I kept quiet assuming you didn't know.

963
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,468
When you were a prosecutor,

964
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,805
you made Jong-hoon
leave the Prosecution Service

965
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,474
and made me quit being a judge as well.

966
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,983
Seo walked out of the room,

967
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,821
sat on the stairs,
and put methamphetamine into his coffee.

968
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,782
Right at that moment,

969
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,828
Yang walked down the stairs…

970
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,377
and said this to Seo.

971
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,296
What are you doing?

972
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,555
A former chief prosecutor doing drugs?

973
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:01,269
Right, you must've been high
when you sent the video.

974
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,151
I was confessing to you.

975
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,282
WAITING ROOM

976
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:18,745
Turn yourself in…

977
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,080
to the police.

978
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,962
I'm confessing to you.

979
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,590
Don't you get it?

980
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,928
If you forgive me…

981
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,430
Forgive you?

982
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,266
You want to be forgiven?

983
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:42,810
Yes.

984
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,859
I've suffered enough.

985
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:55,949
Then,

986
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,619
I should forgive you.

987
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:03,206
Feeling the urge to kill Seo
in that moment,

988
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,125
Yang poured the entire sachet
of meth into the coffee.

989
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,877
It was sugar, not meth.

990
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,173
Stop writing a novel.

991
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,223
After I dumped his methamphetamine

992
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,766
-in the sink,
-No!

993
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,062
he went into hypoglycemic shock.

994
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,649
He passed out from hypoglycemia,

995
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,276
so I gave him coffee with sugar.

996
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,253
It fell out of the glasses?

997
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,381
He rolled down the stairs?

998
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,135
Detective Oh.

999
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,845
Check the glasses Seo was wearing.

1000
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,680
Yes, sir.

1001
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:33,546
Did you kill him?

1002
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:37,842
No.

1003
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,096
You didn't do it, right?

1004
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,723
I knew it.

1005
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,850
Then who…

1006
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,144
Who did it?

1007
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,122
It was you?

1008
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,547
Han Joon-hwi.

1009
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,654
You killed my husband for the inheritance?

1010
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,698
I need to know clearly who killed him.

1011
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:24,657
Do the autopsy.

1012
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,825
Glasses without it.

1013
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,785
It's Joon-hwi who destroyed the evidence.

1014
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:28,911
The culprit took it?

1015
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,705
To frame Professor Yang?

1016
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:31,706
Did you kill him?

1017
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,750
You're the one who pushed him
on the stairs?

1018
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:34,792
I killed him?

1019
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,085
Think however you want.

1020
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,421
No way.
Lee Man-ho lives that close to our house?

1021
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,590
Mom told me not to say this, but…

1022
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,633
Hello? This is Byeol's sister.

1023
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:44,886
What? What did you say?

1024
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,429
If he's suspected,

1025
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:49,015
do they think Joon-hwi took
Prof. Yang's laptop too?

1026
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,308
Bring me the laptop.

1027
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,185
You think I can't find you, right?

1028
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,936
If Prof. Yang dies just like that…

1029
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,688
Whatever it is, I don't care.

1030
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,648
I'll do it. Let's spilt the inheritance.

1031
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,901
Professor Yang? How… How bad is it?

1032
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,779
