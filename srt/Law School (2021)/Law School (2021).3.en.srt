1
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:05,273
AUGUST 2017

2
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,694
I only get 30,000 won?

3
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,073
I paid over 300,000 won for all these.

4
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:17,118
Your sign shouldn't say, "We buy books,"
but "We only take your books for free."

5
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,870
-They're in awful shape.
-Next story.

6
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,831
-All useless. These are like trash.
-The trial for Seo,

7
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,249
a former chief prosecutor.

8
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,460
-The main issue
-No, no.

9
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,213
-is if the acquittal will be sustained.
-Don't you know?

10
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,799
-Reporter Choi is at the court.
-Take a good look.

11
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,675
-These look bad for a reason.
-Choi?

12
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,093
-Quiet, please.
-I am here

13
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,637
at Seo Byung-ju's final trial

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,348
-Whoever buys this hits a jackpot.
-in Seoul High Court.

15
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,766
-Here.
-Was the ruling made?

16
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,685
-And here. The notes look so perfect.
-Not yet.

17
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,897
-Will it be overturned?
-Study with this, and that's it.

18
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,857
-Anyone will make it.
-We can't tell.

19
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,442
But Yang Jong-hoon, the prosecutor,

20
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,861
stepped down as a prosecutor
to be a witness--

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,030
Give me 50,000 won, then.

22
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,659
-So? Did you get into Hankuk Law School?
-What?

23
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,786
Don't talk big if you didn't.

24
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,038
Yes, of course, I did.

25
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,414
So 50,000 won. Deal?

26
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,876
I was already offering much more
with 30,000 won, but I'll add 5,000 won

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,420
since you got into Hankuk University,
so 35,000 won.

28
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,381
-No, 50,000 won.
-I'll pay

29
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,550
the 50,000 won, so let me watch the news.

30
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,719
-But these are for law school--
-And I'm going there.

31
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,931
The ruling of the final appeal

32
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,684
of former chief prosecutor Seo Byung-ju
has just been made.

33
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,395
-These will get you in at once.
-The judges overturned

34
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,105
-the initial ruling
-You can do it.

35
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,232
and found him guilty of taking bribery.

36
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:34,154
Many are waiting to see if Seo will lodge
an appeal to the Supreme Court,

37
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,240
-waiting for the verdict.
-May I have the money now?

38
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,666
Are you sure I'll get in at once,
Ms. Senior?

39
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,418
"Ms. Senior"?

40
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,170
I plan on going to Hankuk Law too.

41
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,547
I'd get in without these,

42
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,716
but it seems like you need the money.

43
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,599
Hey, my sister
isn't going to sell those books to--

44
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,309
Goodbye.

45
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,351
Hey, wait.

46
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,440
BALANCE: 994,350 WON

47
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,150
It's about time. Finally.

48
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,570
I'll have six zeroes in my account!

49
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,198
Are you that happy
for making that money by fraud?

50
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,366
Fraud?

51
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,369
Right, about Hankuk Law School?

52
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,039
You're too young to know what fraud is.

53
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,000
"A crime when someone defrauds another

54
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,710
and takes property from someone."

55
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,004
Article 347 of the Criminal Code.

56
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,550
I mean, I wasn't trying to deceive him--

57
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,761
You didn't do anything
knowing he was fooled

58
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,387
to take his money.

59
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,848
So? I'm a fraud now?

60
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,309
If you don't want to be one,
you should get in.

61
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,435
Get in? To where?

62
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,937
To Hankuk Law School.

63
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,730
Me?

64
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,649
Hey, Byeol.

65
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,610
Do you think a law school
is like a community center?

66
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,362
And Hankuk Law School?

67
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,073
It's not for everyone.

68
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,534
-You're good at English.
-I'm just all right.

69
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,245
Millions of people are better.

70
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,913
But your college grades are good.

71
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,791
That's because Dan practically helped out
with everything…

72
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,709
Why do you do this to me?

73
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,254
You can get Dan's books back
and study again.

74
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,339
You said you can get accepted at once.

75
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,924
Hey, at once? My foot.

76
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:21,427
I made up a total lie
to get him to pay me more.

77
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,933
Then, you must feel sorry
for that guy, right?

78
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,559
Did he make me feel any sorrier?

79
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,852
He claims he's a big shot.

80
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,604
He said he'd get in without those.

81
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,439
But still.

82
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,317
And he offered the money first.

83
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,486
I should've made him pay twice as much.

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,614
How much more do you want?

85
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,035
And it wasn't just a claim. I'm that good.

86
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,664
How much more should I give you
to make you feel ashamed

87
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,999
for playing a law student?

88
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,087
There's nothing you can do
to make her feel ashamed.

89
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,298
She'd rather get into Hankuk Law School.

90
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,383
I'll get going then.

91
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,303
Byeol. Hey, Byeol!

92
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,390
YOUR GUIDE TO LEET

93
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,820
FRIDAY 7:40 P.M., MUST SWITCH
THE TIME OF DEPARTURE TO THE VICTIM'S…

94
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,698
You even quit to have him punished.
How do you feel now?

95
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,283
I feel crappy.

96
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,578
You testified Seo made you a request
back when you were on duty.

97
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,331
It was accepted
and the case was overturned on appeal.

98
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,833
But we still have the Supreme Court
to go to.

99
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,211
Do you believe the Supreme Court
could overturn the decision again?

100
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,088
If my testimony isn't found reliable.

101
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,966
I heard you and Seo
were very close as colleagues.

102
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,342
What happened to you two?

103
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:57,565
TRUTH AND JUSTICE ONLY BY THE LAW

104
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,317
Inmate 2023, it's your court day.

105
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,127
DONGBU DETENTION CENTER WAITING ROOM

106
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:35,061
Based on that, the police identified
Yang Jong-hoon as the prime suspect.

107
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,271
The on-site inspection Yang requested

108
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,981
will be conducted today.

109
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,652
The request was made unprecedentedly
by Yang, the suspect,

110
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,987
right before his indictment.

111
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,116
Yang has been pleading the Fifth
until this day.

112
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,659
The change in his attitude is…

113
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,578
Hey, Kim.

114
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,540
Postponing the indictment?

115
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,417
He said he'd admit
if we do a spot inspection.

116
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,628
A former prosecutor
killed his former chief.

117
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,588
It's a huge shame on the prosecution.

118
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,006
A formal briefing? No way.

119
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,679
I didn't say that just to Choi.

120
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,973
It's just something I said over a meal.

121
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,975
If you can't trust me,
come out for a meal.

122
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,977
Are you telling him about suspected crime?

123
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,604
Let's talk later.

124
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,524
You said I killed him
over his deal with Lee Man-ho

125
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,067
to cover up his hit-and-run.

126
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,194
It's not a bad story for you.

127
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,697
The more the media talk,

128
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,199
the more people will become furious
at Seo Byung-ju.

129
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,701
If the people feel that way,

130
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,411
it'll help reduce your sentence.

131
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,082
I know you're like this,
but you're still my senior.

132
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,751
I have everything set up for you.

133
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,005
-Article 126 of the Criminal Code.
-Publicizing suspected crime?

134
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,674
There's no use for that law anyway.

135
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,426
LAW AGAINST PUBLICIZING A SUSPECT

136
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,304
There's no prosecutor
who was ever indicted for doing that.

137
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:55,016
The media kept going on
about how the former chief prosecutor

138
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,478
was in league with a heinous rapist,

139
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,021
so most people are saying

140
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,440
they hate the deceased
more than the killer.

141
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,027
Let's make it so that people can see
how anyone could become furious

142
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,737
and would want to kill someone

143
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,448
during the spot inspection.

144
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,452
Can you free him until we get there?

145
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,662
After all, he's my senior.

146
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,464
Feeling the urge to kill Seo
in that moment,

147
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,300
Yang poured the entire sachet of meth
into the coffee.

148
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,052
It was sugar, not meth.

149
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,056
Stop writing a novel.

150
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,148
No, stop it!

151
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,735
After I dumped his methamphetamine
in the sink,

152
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,281
he went into hypoglycemic shock.

153
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,037
I found a single-serve sugar packet here,
not an ordinary packaging.

154
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,002
-You never said that before.
-He refused to testify.

155
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,505
He's about to talk now.

156
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,219
Let's just say there's sugar.

157
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,137
Well, excuse me.

158
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,683
You can use this.

159
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,227
It's edible collagen, for your skin.

160
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,896
Fine.

161
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,849
He passed out from hypoglycemia,

162
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,642
so I gave him coffee with sugar.

163
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,231
But it wasn't there at the scene.

164
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,441
The sugar packet.

165
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,448
We didn't find a sugar packet,
and it's not on the evidence list.

166
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,243
Stop trying to pull this trick on us.
It was never…

167
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,537
It was never here to--

168
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,039
It was here to begin with.

169
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,749
You need to cut your crap.

170
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,417
What is he yapping about?

171
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,127
Gosh.

172
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,883
Tell them to hear him out.

173
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,719
Please hear out my client--

174
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,347
Then, he'll need
to at least make some sense.

175
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,932
If it was here to begin with,
where would it go?

176
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,726
We already combed through the office.

177
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,364
It fell out of the glasses?

178
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,032
He rolled down the stairs?

179
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:58,949
Detective Oh.

180
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,327
-Check the glasses Seo was wearing.
-Yes, sir.

181
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:28,771
It was you?

182
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,402
Just kill me!

183
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,487
Turn yourself in now!

184
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,117
Han Joon-hwi.

185
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,460
11:10 A.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020,
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

186
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,772
YOU RECEIVED A NEW EMAIL

187
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,235
FROM SEO BYUNG-JU,
JURAE-DONG HIT-AND-RUN CASE

188
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,660
SEO BYUNG-JU

189
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,334
-Hello?
-This is Yang Jong-hoon.

190
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,418
Give me a second.

191
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,129
Let me call you back.

192
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,132
Now that Joon-hwi knows,

193
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,969
Jong-hoon will also find out soon.

194
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,114
WITNESS WANTED

195
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,369
HONGIM REAL ESTATE AGENCY

196
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,582
Yes, that's my real estate agency.

197
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,417
My husband used to run this place.

198
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,505
Someone else recently came by
to check too.

199
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,632
A middle-aged man in glasses?

200
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,135
No, he was a young man
without any glasses.

201
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,555
He was wearing a hoodie that day.

202
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,143
Was it him?

203
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,687
Yes, it was him.

204
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,733
HAN JOON-HWI

205
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,862
The video
for the Jurae-dong hit-and-run case?

206
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,033
Yes.

207
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,119
I sent it.

208
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,712
You were the prosecutor in charge.

209
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,424
DO NOT ENTER

210
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,467
Someone had to reveal the truth.

211
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,848
You met your uncle here on that day,
didn't you?

212
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,953
Did you have to be the one to reveal…

213
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,999
the truth?

214
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,423
Did you kill him?

215
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,636
Professor Yang Jong-hoon singled you out.

216
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,224
I asked, did you kill him?

217
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,937
You do have a good reason.

218
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,231
He left a huge inheritance to you,
a kid who isn't even his own.

219
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,658
Sign that in front of me…

220
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,368
DISCLAIMER OF INTEREST BY HEIR

221
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,746
unless you want to be suspected.

222
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,917
You betrayed your uncle.

223
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,213
He thought of you more dearly
than his own daughters,

224
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,840
yet you stabbed him in the back!

225
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,557
That's not for you to say.

226
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,768
What?

227
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,105
You used your kids
as an excuse to stay in the US,

228
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,690
you even took another lover.

229
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:29,655
I have every right to know
who killed my husband.

230
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,948
Asking if I killed him?

231
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,243
Think however you want.

232
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,496
There's only one answer
you want anyway, Aunt.

233
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,875
Sit!

234
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,632
You have no right to do this to me.

235
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,720
And don't come to see me
with something like this.

236
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,273
We can't prove that this belongs
to the deceased.

237
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,899
I request a second autopsy.

238
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,449
A second autopsy? Because of this?

239
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,327
He had a bad headache on the said day,
which hindered his mock trial class.

240
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,497
He could've fallen down
since his nose pad was found here.

241
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,832
That's just a possibility--

242
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,751
That's where the investigation begins.

243
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,796
Is this the reason for this inspection?

244
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,758
You're trying to postpone the indictment
by using the inspection

245
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,051
and a second autopsy?

246
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,138
The nose pad is intact
on the glasses he wore.

247
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,139
See?

248
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,641
Do you have anything else to say?

249
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,101
They were switched.

250
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,315
Mr. Seo was wearing rimless glasses
on that day.

251
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,234
Thanks.

252
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,155
But when I left after giving him coffee,

253
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,408
his glasses were changed
to those black ones for some reason.

254
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,451
He's right.

255
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:01,705
He was wearing rimless glasses
when we talked during the break.

256
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,670
Why didn't you keep your mouth shut
and continue to plead the Fifth?

257
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,172
Darn it!

258
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,925
The autopsy report didn't show
any brain damage--

259
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,970
And I wanted a photo proof,
but why is the attachment left out?

260
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,099
What?

261
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,683
It really isn't here.

262
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,644
They said the camera wasn't working.

263
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,728
Right at that moment?

264
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,481
You could've been suspicious.

265
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,317
Suspicious, my foot.
Stop insulting medical examiners.

266
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,236
We can't redo the autopsy.

267
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,113
Not only is your evidence weak,

268
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,573
but if we had to take out his body
from the ground,

269
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,242
his bereaved family will protest.

270
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,326
What if we don't?

271
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,003
I need to know clearly
who killed my husband.

272
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,674
Please do the second autopsy.

273
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,809
Prof. Yang wanted a second autopsy?

274
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,060
It's a sudden twist.

275
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,603
A second autopsy isn't easy.

276
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,148
If he was buried, he'd be decomposed too.

277
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,941
They buried him quite recently.

278
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,110
Professor Seo's wife
got here late from the US.

279
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,528
Really?

280
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,405
Well, if he was in the morgue, yes.

281
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,824
But still, he has to prove

282
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,118
there was a sugar packet
to prove his innocence.

283
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,161
You're right.

284
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,912
I don't really think I saw it.

285
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,498
The culprit took it?

286
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,875
To frame Professor Yang?

287
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:30,961
Am I sure of this?

288
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,672
Yes, we are.

289
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,718
If the real culprit took it,

290
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,805
he or she must've known Professor Yang
gave Professor Seo that coffee with sugar.

291
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,642
If he was going to frame Professor Yang,
knowing what happened,

292
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,103
isn't this premeditated homicide,
not manslaughter?

293
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,188
You're right.

294
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,564
And someone with a grudge.

295
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,858
A grudge? That means
it's most likely Professor Yang.

296
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,237
If it's not him, that means the culprit

297
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,115
is someone who was in there
among the testifiers here today.

298
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,366
She just found him first.

299
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,994
Professor Yang seems to be
suspicious of Joon-hwi.

300
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,245
-Joon-hwi?
-Han Joon-hwi?

301
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,580
He's suspecting Joon-hwi?

302
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,665
Does it make sense?

303
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,667
Why not? He even put up that petition.

304
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,252
That petition was--

305
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,587
He thought of him as a son,

306
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,131
but he still put that up,
refusing to accept his uncle.

307
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,758
Then, why not?

308
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,888
MY HUBBY

309
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,439
Hey, babe. I left it on silent
during the spot inspection.

310
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,359
-I mean it.
-But still, it can't be Joon-hwi.

311
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,069
I hope not.

312
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,196
It can't be him, right?

313
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,242
If Professor Yang is suspecting him,
he must have a reason.

314
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,036
If you're curious,
you can ask his public defender.

315
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,204
He's our senior.

316
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,664
He didn't seem enthusiastic.

317
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,291
Right? It looked
as if he was forced into this.

318
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,543
He didn't seem too trustworthy.

319
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,754
It'd be perfect
if Professor Kim Eun-suk took him.

320
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,464
-Mr. Yang.
-Did you admit to it?

321
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,258
-Did you confirm everything?
-Mr. Yang!

322
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,717
-What happened?
-Was it you?

323
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,885
Did you kill him?

324
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,428
-Say something!
-Did you do it?

325
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,555
-Did he break his silence?
-Mr. Yang!

326
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,140
-Did you do it?
-It's you, right?

327
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,184
-Say something!
-How did you kill him?

328
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,311
-Did you clarify it?
-What's your motive?

329
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,856
Professor Yang wanted a second autopsy?

330
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,904
A second autopsy?

331
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,949
Did he deny his charge
instead of admitting to what he did?

332
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,535
Was there a problem
in the initial investigation?

333
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,620
What problem? There wasn't a problem.

334
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,621
Do you admit to it?

335
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,123
-Do you?
-Did you do this?

336
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,165
Say something!

337
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,709
Why did he want the autopsy?

338
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,460
You can talk to him later!

339
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,172
You need to defend him
and tell them it's to prove his innocence!

340
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,173
What's with you?

341
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,550
Come here.

342
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,801
-Quick.
-Anything to say?

343
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,179
I know I can't be an attorney
as a law professor,

344
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,974
but at least,
let me be his public defender.

345
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,309
Ask the Minister of Education.

346
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,395
I believe the Min. of Justice stated
professors of the Legal Clinic

347
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,105
working as public defenders

348
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,607
is not a breach
of the Attorneys-at-Law Act.

349
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,943
If the Ministry allows,
I want to defend Yang.

350
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,155
Innocent or not,
this job isn't for our Legal Clinic.

351
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,408
People will end up criticizing and say
we're trying to protect our own.

352
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,535
We should protect him
if he's falsely accused.

353
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,787
Read this article.

354
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,581
The media arbitrarily reported on him

355
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,333
and turned him into a murderer

356
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,959
even before he got indicted!

357
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,337
When I say no,
I mean that you can't do it!

358
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,340
Then, quit your job and defend him!

359
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,091
-Vice Dean!
-Professor Kim!

360
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,179
I understand you two were very close
since the training institute--

361
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,805
It's not because we're close.

362
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,974
Well, I guess we are.

363
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,269
But I'd do the same for you
if you were falsely accused.

364
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,354
That won't happen, so get back to work.

365
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,273
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

366
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,819
There's no use
in visiting the dean over this.

367
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,906
We've decided to dismiss him
once he gets indicted.

368
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,535
You sound as if you want him to.

369
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,705
Well, you're very close
to Professor Jung Dae-hyeon,

370
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,665
who has been
after Professor Yang's position.

371
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,422
If he's suspicious of Joon-hwi,

372
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,217
does this mean he also took
Professor Yang's laptop?

373
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,387
A laptop isn't easy to throw out,
so he probably hid it.

374
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,931
I'd hide it under my mattress.

375
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,891
The police will think like you,

376
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,726
so a locker for me.

377
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,229
Hiding it in my stuff
could be much better.

378
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,106
They'll find it during the search.

379
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,857
Stop talking behind a guy's back.

380
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,068
If you're dying to know, ask him.

381
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,906
He'd have to be around for us to ask.
Or you can ask him for us.

382
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,909
Don't you have a study group to go to?

383
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,162
What about our study group?
Joon-hwi won't be there.

384
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,332
Exactly. Where did he go?

I can't believe you wanted to see me.
Did you see the court?

407
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,050
It's probably the most fabulous mock court
in this world.

408
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,223
Not only will you hold mock trials,
the court will do real ones too.

MY DEAR JOON-HWI

412
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,590
07P 4295.

413
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,594
It was your car.

414
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,762
Joon-hwi.

00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,723

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,810
It was your car.

417
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,270
Car number 07P 4295.

418
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,564
Joon-hwi.

419
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,065
It was your car.

420
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,943
It was yours! It was your car!

421
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,493
Why?

422
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,580
Why did you do that?

423
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,506
Why?

424
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,426
Why did you do that?

425
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,804
They took the banner down.

426
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,850
Goodness.

427
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,899
Is it because of what I did?

428
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,443
It's not getting developed.

429
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,236
Lee Man-ho was the witness?

430
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,489
I think the deceased made a deal
with Lee Man-ho

431
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:41,242
and let him off with feeble mindedness
to cover up his hit-and-run case.

432
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,163
He hit him here, bang.

433
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,498
Vroom.

434
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,009
How dare a guy like me

435
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,179
hold his weakness
and shake your uncle around.

436
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,891
Yes, I did that. I did.

437
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,270
That was the only way I could save myself.

438
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,317
Hey, I'm sad about this too.

439
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,029
Deal or whatever, he's my savior
who let me stand here today.

440
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,993
The only guy who took my side is gone.

441
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,377
Darn it.

442
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,048
My blood is valuable.

443
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,137
About your uncle…

444
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,557
He kept a pair of spare glasses
in his car.

445
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,228
But on the day he died,
it disappeared from his car.

446
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,776
You're his bereaved family,

447
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,196
so find out if they're on the list
of evidence or his articles.

448
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,262
You won't redo the autopsy, right?

449
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,391
His family strongly insists, so…

450
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,726
Just have him indicted.

451
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,562
I can't just indict him!

452
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,522
-What I meant was--
-Also,

453
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,858
why did you miss the nose pad
in the first search?

454
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,610
This is a high-profile case.

455
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,823
So this is our fault?

456
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,825
-Is it?
-Whoa, wait.

457
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,536
Open up!

458
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,288
Darn it.

459
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,290
He wanted the case transferred ASAP.

460
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,626
He's the one
who leaked the case to the media!

461
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,721
I heard Inmate 2023 made a big scene
at the inspection.

462
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,515
After all, he was a prosecutor.

463
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,391
He might end up leaving soon.

464
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,176
Let's not contaminate the scene.
Step back.

465
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,386
-What?
-Is he dead?

466
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,470
Should we report this?

467
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,763
-Is he dead?
-He's down?

468
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,014
-What?
-What's going on?

469
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,789
MOM

470
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:27,427
The prosecution's decisive argument
will be Jamie's fear of needles.

471
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,804
Six months before the case,

472
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,974
the victim began to give insulin shots
to her diabetic mother.

473
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,643
So she can now inject shots herself?

474
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,562
That's pretty good.

475
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,446
But it seems more plausible
for the suspect to have killed her

476
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,532
out of a sense of betrayal
than her committing suicide.

477
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,910
How is murdering her in betrayal

478
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,078
more plausible than…

479
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,625
If he loved her,

480
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,877
it could happen, right?

481
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,298
PROFESSOR SEO BYUNG-JU

482
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,886
PROFESSOR SEO BYUNG-JU

483
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,306
If he loved her.

484
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,227
I'll go to the mock court first.
Make sure you get me off.

485
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,831
MOM

486
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,211
MOM

487
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,296
YOU HAVE 8 MISSED CALLS FROM MOM

488
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,307
You think Joon-hwi is the real culprit,
don't you?

489
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,978
You believe he pushed my husband
down those stairs.

490
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,563
It's just a speculation.

491
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,941
We need to do a second autopsy
to know for sure.

492
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,695
I find Joon-hwi more suspicious than you,
Prosecutor Yang.

493
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:13,074
Once Byung-ju dies,
he'll inherit a huge amount of money.

494
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,703
Are you saying he wanted his inheritance?

495
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,497
I've lived for decades
as a prosecutor's wife.

496
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,915
And he has enough reasons

497
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,500
other than the inheritance.

498
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,213
He treated his uncle like vermin
ever since the bribery case broke out.

499
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,260
He's an ungrateful rascal
who repaid his uncle's kindness with evil.

500
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,559
It's too unfair
for you to be stuck in there.

501
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,730
We must reveal the truth
by conducting a second autopsy.

502
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,745
The medical examiner you mentioned before,

503
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,371
are you sure he's good?

504
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,919
What? I can't see him?

505
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,005
OK CIVIL AFFAIRS CENTER

506
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,633
I came a little too late.

507
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,302
Joon-hwi's aunt got here first.

508
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,429
-Professor Seo's wife?
-Yes.

509
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,264
What brings you here?

510
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,479
Can you let me in, too?

511
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,355
Someone else got in, so I couldn't.

512
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,442
-You can come tomorrow.
-Wait.

513
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,735
I have to talk to him.

514
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,445
Then be his attorney.

515
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,114
This visit is only for his attorney to--

516
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,365
Tell him we're interns.

517
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,702
Exactly.

518
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,165
I thought about this all night.

519
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,211
Regardless of the autopsy result,
finding the culprit who fed meth--

520
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,545
The prosecutor should.

521
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:53,299
The prosecutor framed you as the murderer,
so to prove your innocence…

522
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,551
-Why should I prove my innocence?
-Sorry?

523
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,513
-Do I have to prove my innocence?
-No, sir.

524
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,598
What? He'll be found guilty.

525
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,016
The evidence of the crime.

526
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,019
All you have to do
is discredit or withdraw the reliability

527
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,896
-of the prosecution's evidence.
-What?

528
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,148
If the autopsy changes
the cause of his death,

529
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,859
it'll discredit
the prosecution's evidence.

530
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,656
Is that why you wore those glasses?

531
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,869
The sugar packet wasn't the only thing
that went missing.

532
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,392
OCTOBER 5TH: 911

533
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,813
OCTOBER 5TH: 911

534
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,565
SEPTEMBER 23: PROFESSOR KIM EUN-SUK

535
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,317
Is this 911?

536
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,694
Please speak.

537
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,362
I'm at Hankuk Law's mock court.

538
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,031
My professor fell down the stairs
and fainted.

539
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,617
-Is he breathing?
-One second.

540
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,579
Hello?

541
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,663
Please speak.

542
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,374
HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

543
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,351
How did you know he talked to 911?

544
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,104
I told him to check the call history
with 911 for that day.

545
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,522
Han Joon-hwi made a call.

546
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,024
And he fell down the stairs.

547
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,861
-Did you find out?
-Sorry?

548
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,155
Right, yes. The police are correct.

549
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,114
MONITORING CENTER

550
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,365
As I told the police,

551
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:46,162
Lee Man-ho was at Hankuk University
that morning as Professor Seo's driver.

552
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,914
But he left right away.

553
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:49,790
PERSONAL DETAILS

554
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,919
Lee Man-ho was definitely away from school
at the time of his death.

555
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,004
They can trace his location
with his anklet.

556
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,298
Don't people cut that off and run away?

557
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:01,552
The police also thought
Lee Man-ho could've tampered with it,

558
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,889
so they checked every place he visited
before and after his death.

559
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,812
I checked everything myself, too.

560
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,856
Lee Man-ho has a solid alibi.

561
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,444
Did you want to get on his good side
by looking up everything?

562
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,822
I'm guessing
you didn't seem trustworthy enough

563
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,699
if he made me do that separately.

564
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,326
Does this mean

565
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,370
it was Joon-hwi?

566
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,709
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

567
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,171
We confirmed
how your uncle rolled down the stairs.

568
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,215
If he had brain damage,

569
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,009
that means he could've died
after some time has passed.

570
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,971
The cause of death is…

571
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,723
Are you also suspicious
of the autopsy result?

572
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,272
-How did you find this?
-I just did.

573
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,356
I doubt it was easy.

574
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,816
But nothing's impossible.

575
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,027
So you went to the Police University?

576
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,613
But you dropped out
before half a year passed.

577
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,115
Because of your inheritance,

578
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,951
your aunt suspects it was you
over Yang Jong-hoon.

579
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,287
Will you do the second autopsy?

580
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,372
What if we do? Will that be a problem?

581
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,500
You didn't kill him.

582
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,670
Did you kill him?

583
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,881
Did you push him down the stairs

584
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,719
and get rid of the sugar packet
Yang mentioned?

585
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,470
I thought I was a testifier.

586
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,472
Yes, so answer my question.

587
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,729
If you didn't, say so.

588
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,857
Do you want to leave
as a suspect, not a testifier?

589
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,069
-You probably can't do that.
-What?

590
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,906
If you have two suspects
who aren't accomplices for one case,

591
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,118
isn't it humiliating
for the detective and the prosecutor?

592
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,119
What did you say?

593
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,414
You'll have to let Professor Yang go
if I become the suspect.

594
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,793
I'm saying a second autopsy
won't do you any good, prosecutor.

595
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,299
Could I be excused?

596
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,009
I have to be in a class.

597
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,344
PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U

598
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,145
That little rascal. Darn it!

599
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,064
Let's do the second autopsy.

600
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,025
Of course I don't want to do it.

601
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,486
But we can't let him toy with us.

602
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,490
Find out everything on Han Joon-hwi.

603
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,701
Get the warrant for the autopsy.

604
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,661
That's a great decision.

605
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:36,957
My gosh.

606
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,606
Excuse us.

607
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,241
Hey.

608
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,659
Hey, you!

609
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,703
What are you looking for?

610
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,248
What is it?

611
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,667
What are you looking for?

612
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,922
CONSTITUTION 1

613
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:31,720
Professor Kang said it's all my fault
if any of you get in there with a laptop.

614
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,266
Your grades are out.

615
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,477
Our grades? Goodness.

616
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,069
2ND SEMESTER MIDTERM GRADES
IN CONSTITUTION

617
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,406
What? Our average is in the 30s again?

618
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,992
Why does Professor Kang
never give out good grades?

619
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,703
The average for Civil Procedure Code
is five.

620
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,414
You get an A+ if you score over ten.
Unbelievable.

621
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,542
I'm sure everyone here never got
such a low grade before law school.

622
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,836
No way. I think I'll get an A+.

623
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,504
One second.

624
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,924
I'm awesome. I did better than Ji-ho?

625
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,969
How do you know my grade?

626
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,181
I saw you write your nickname
in the start of the year. "Fewgoodmen."

627
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,142
Gosh, you and your sentimentalism.
Good for you.

628
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,977
Are you kidding? Don't look at mine.

629
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,438
I have to do a little recon
before the game begins.

630
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,732
I need to know who's ahead of me.

631
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,776
Hey, but this time, I got ahead of you.

632
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,694
Good luck.

633
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,447
What?

634
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,617
Wait, what is this? 90-something?
"Newbeginning"?

635
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,618
Who's this?

636
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,495
Could it be…

637
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,997
You're right. He got 91 points.
It's Seung-jae.

638
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,583
HOLDOUTANDWIN: 29

639
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,085
My gosh, how is this grade possible?

640
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,504
No one got up to the 80s.

641
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,006
See? Even Joon-hwi got 71 points.

642
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,216
The one below him, 69.

643
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,179
Why couldn't he give me one more point?

644
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,806
You still did better than me.

645
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,066
I should do better on the finals.

646
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,401
NEWBEGINNING

647
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,402
Gosh.

648
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,447
No matter how well I'll do in the finals,
I'll never get A+.

649
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,699
Ji-ho, aren't you in danger?

650
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,910
I'll be fine if Joon-hwi leaves.

651
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,578
If he leaves?

652
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:24,124
Right. I heard he might be disciplined
by the Student Discipline Committee.

653
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,293
If he's the real culprit
of Professor Seo's case,

654
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,503
he'll naturally leave.

655
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,588
My gosh.
How can you think of such a thing?

656
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,048
It's just grades, not the bar.

657
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,634
Your grades are what will get you a job
at a law firm.

658
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,177
Grades stay for life, not exams.

659
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,929
Grades are more important.

660
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,598
Ji-ho, that's a bit harsh
as a fellow student.

661
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,310
Only half the people pass the bar now,
so one of you two won't make it.

662
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,521
A fellow?
We aren't soldiers or undergraduates.

663
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,356
This is a training school.

664
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:51,443
Don't you secretly wish Sol gets a zero
for turning in her test late?

665
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,195
What?

666
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,783
I'm going to kill you.

667
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,826
CONSTITUTION 1

668
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,953
Excuse me.

669
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,789
Where's Professor Kang Ju-man's class?

670
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,957
Right here.

671
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,421
-He's here.
-Quiet.

672
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,969
I'm not going to accept any objections
regarding your grades.

673
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,305
Do not make a trip to my office in vain.

674
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,308
-Who's supposed to be there?
-Han Joon-hwi.

675
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,979
-Joon-hwi, where are you?
-Minus one point.

676
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,025
HAN JOON-HWI: 69

677
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,860
You lost your precious point.

678
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:34,778
Over there.

679
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,365
Well, I'm Yu Seung-jae.

680
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,619
You're late, but I'll let you off.

681
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,289
Again, his answers were great
for this test,

682
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,915
as if he was reading my mind.

683
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,295
Turn to page 115 of your textbook.

684
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,922
The dispute and clash of human rights.

685
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,470
Like teacher, like student.

686
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:00,971
Han Joon-hwi.

687
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,766
He's as unusual as you.

688
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,728
I'm in the mood for some coffee.

689
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,938
I guess you won't treat me
with respect today.

690
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,234
Hang in there. Once you get out--

691
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,944
We'll extend your stay,

692
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,113
regardless of the second autopsy.

693
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,075
Why? Wait.

694
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,369
If his cause of death changes
in the autopsy--

695
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,330
There's not a lot of chance
things will turn around.

696
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:30,042
And he can still destroy evidence,
just like the missing laptop.

697
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,086
-I didn't hide the laptop.
-But lost it?

698
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,837
I didn't lose it. It was stolen.

699
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,883
You're going to change your argument?

700
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,511
I had time to think
in the detention center.

701
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,974
Come to think of it, I left my laptop
in my office on the day of the incident.

702
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,227
It was gone the next day.

703
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,439
It was obviously stolen.

704
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,900
Who'd steal that anyway?

705
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,276
You're right.

706
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,571
The one who stole it wanted it to look
as if you destroyed the evidence

707
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,073
to put you in a tight spot.

708
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,991
The sugar packet and the laptop.

709
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,911
Don't you think they're gone
for the same reason?

710
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:06,995
So you didn't do it?

711
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,581
It's Joon-hwi who destroyed the evidence.

712
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,793
He hid those glasses
with the missing nose pad.

713
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,962
We need to clarify the facts.

714
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,299
-We will.
-Of course we will, Prosecutor Jin.

715
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,177
Don't just look at what you want to see

716
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,596
and listen to what you want to hear.

717
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,779
Darn it.

718
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,365
Where's that case for his glasses?

719
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,409
Why can't they find it?

720
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,579
Maybe Ji-ho forgot to put the case
where he found it.

721
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,291
You have no time to stretch your legs.

722
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,043
Look at what you got me into.
Han Joon-hwi, that kid--

723
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,130
Don't I seem more suspicious
if you look at the hard evidence?

724
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,715
My goodness.

725
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,633
All evidence is fact.

726
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,971
Then just be the culprit.

727
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,933
Let's wait for the autopsy result.

728
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,605
That's all for today.

729
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,445
Excuse me.

730
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,864
I have questions on Han Joon-hwi
about the incident.

731
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,073
Please don't leave.

732
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,744
Cooperate unless you want to be summoned
as a testifier.

733
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,871
Why are you taking our time?

734
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,414
-Exactly.
-What is he doing?

735
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,708
That's a threat, not cooperation.

736
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,045
If you need us, summon us to the station.

737
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:41,924
Darn it.

738
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,648
When did we get this?

739
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,442
Why haven't I seen it?

740
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,362
It'd be perfect with rice,
but we're completely out right now.

741
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,575
Mom, I saw this man a few days ago at the…

742
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,119
Mom, the address!

743
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,955
What? What about the address?

744
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,043
NOTICE

745
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,127
LEE MAN-HO'S ADDRESS

746
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,463
Isn't it the house across?

747
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,889
Good for you, Inmate 2023.
They're redoing the autopsy.

748
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,976
If they're digging up a body
they buried already,

749
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,143
he'll get out soon.

750
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,981
The law school murderer sure is different.

751
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,485
Hey, share your secret with us
before you get out, okay?

752
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,784
Prosecutor Yang.

753
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,245
Long time no see.

754
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,789
I always told myself

755
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,542
I'll kill you first
once I get out of here,

756
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,920
but you came in here yourself.

757
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,050
Does it hurt?

758
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,178
It hurts, doesn't it?

759
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,390
I'll let you pass away very quietly.

760
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,142
Guard!

761
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,395
Guard!

762
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,481
Guard!

763
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,506
RESTRICTED AREA

764
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,096
MURDERER NEXT DOOR

765
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,514
LAW-CIOPATH

766
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:36,807
LAW SCHOOL MURDERER

767
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,975
GET OUT OF THE LAW SCHOOL, LAW-CIOPATH

768
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,769
GET HIM EXEPELLED, YOU'RE REAL CREEPY

769
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,728
YOU SMELL

770
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,854
WRITE ANOTHER PETITION

771
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,822
MURDERER NEXT DOOR

772
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,073
Hey, Joon-hwi.

773
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,578
Detectives came by.

774
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:03,834
If you need me in any way,
feel free to make use of me.

775
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,430
This is Kim Eun-suk.

776
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,642
Professor Yang? How bad is it?

777
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,154
-Are you okay?
-You okay?

778
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,828
Make sure you keep the door locked.

779
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,539
I'll be quick.

780
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,403
LEE MAN-HO'S ADDRESS

781
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,561
What happened?

782
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,855
How did he get stabbed with a knife?

783
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,275
Inmate 2023 was attacked
by a thug he arrested as a prosecutor.

784
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,319
So it was revenge?

785
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,947
Inmate 2023 came just as the attacker

786
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,074
was swearing to kill him.

787
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,326
Doctor, what happened?

788
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,371
We stopped all his bleeding,

789
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,207
but he lost lots of blood,
so his hemoglobin count is low.

790
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,291
He needs blood now.

791
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,126
Are his vitals stable?

792
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,463
We managed to stabilize him
by using dopamine and IV,

793
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,173
but we can't let our guard down.

794
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,384
We're in need of blood,

795
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,304
but the patient has a rare blood type,
so it's not easy to do.

796
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,348
If you can't let your guard down,

797
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,475
does that mean he could die?

798
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,019
Without blood,

799
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,188
you'll have to be prepared for the worst.

800
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,108
The worst? How much time does he have?

801
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,069
A few hours at most.

802
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,572
Is he Rh negative?

803
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,323
He's O Rh negative.

804
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,827
We're putting the word out
for an emergency transfusion,

805
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,078
so give it some time.

RESTRICTED AREA

807
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,639
How is he?

808
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,933
What's your blood type?

809
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,896
He'll die due to lack of blood.

810
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,565
Is that my fault?

811
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,817
He was attacked by a guy whom he arrested.

812
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,819
What the heck is your blood type?

813
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:23,325
Attention, please.
We're in dire need of O negative blood.

814
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,827
Please find a medical staff
if you can donate blood.

815
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,746
-No way.
-What does she mean?

816
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,581
Lee Man-ho lives that close to us?

817
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,292
Where are you right now? At home?

818
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,921
Mom told me not to say this, but…

819
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,464
Hello? Byeol?

820
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,634
What? Gosh.

821
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:42,928
Darn it.

822
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:00,153
Yes?

823
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,198
Professor Yang is in a critical state?

824

SEO BYUNG-JU TO BE EXAMINED AGAIN

826
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,038
Hey, come here.

827
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,206
Check your text.

828
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,459
-Do you know any O negatives?
-No.

829
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:15,460
-I don't.
-Do you?

830
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,544
This is bad.

831
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,256
PROFESSOR KIM EUN-SUK

832
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,633
WE NEED O NEGATIVE BLOOD

833
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:25,428
One, two.

834
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,471
One, two.

835
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,765
One, two.

836
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,475
Gosh.

837
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,909
We'll find the blood, right?

838
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,729
His blood pressure is dropping.
So is his pulse.

839
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,439
Mr. Yang!

840
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,150
-Get epinephrine, 2ml, a defibrillator.
-Yes.

841
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,070
-Professor Yang!
-You can't come in.

842
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,197
Please wait outside.

843
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,366
-Charge to 120 joules.
-Charged.

844
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,035
Cleared. Shock!

845
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,038
-Charge to 200 joules.
-Charged.

846
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,414
Cleared. Shock!

847
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,875
He's showing V-fib, doctor.

848
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,251
-200 joules.
-What now?

849
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,377
Cleared. Shock!

850
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,004
-200 joules.
-Charged.

851
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,172
Cleared. Shock!

852
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,056
Why aren't you at school?

853
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,182
Why are you here?

854
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,892
I came because I was worried.

855
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,687
You're moving right away.
You can't live here.

856
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,314
What if we don't?

857
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:02,233
You can't find cheaper housing
compared to this area.

858
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,487
I'll be more careful.

859
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,405
You can go back and study.

860
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,617
Don't get bad grades and kicked out.

861
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,993
If you die, die there.

862
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,037
Mom.

863
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,541
So nothing happened
since you saw him at the terminal?

864
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,504
If you ever run into him,
you know what to do.

865
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,380
Don't even look that way.

866
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,840
Hey.

867
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,217
Don't look.

868
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,384
Okay.

869
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,473
He deserves to be killed
by getting fried in feces.

870
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,892
I can't move since poverty is my crime.

871
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,186
-Run along then.
-Okay.

872
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,104
Let's go.

873
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,259
RARE BLOOD COMMUNITY

874
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,385
WE NEED O RH NEGATIVE

875
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,766
I can't believe we couldn't find
one person with O Rh negative blood type.

876
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,935
Those we know
are too far from the hospital.

877
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,562
What if the worst happens?

878
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,064
Please excuse me then.

879
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:24,858
Okay.

880
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,487
I doubt he's in his right mind.

881
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,031
The autopsy is probably underway.

882
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,244
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

883
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,517
-We still have no blood?
-Not yet.

884
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,856
What if he really changes places
with Professor Yang?

885
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,233
-He must've been after the inheritance.
-What?

886
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,318
What inheritance?

887
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,236
Money is a good reason for murder.

888
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,656
Inheritance lawsuits are the dirtiest,
you know.

889
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,872
Look at his scary eyes.

890
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,749
-Let's go.
-Okay.

891
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,294
Be careful not to be found dead.

892
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,600
I was a bit late.

893
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,436
I should've put it back
before the police came.

894
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,606
If I gave it to them,
the evidence wouldn't be admissible.

895
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,150
Even if you gave it to them,

896
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,652
it'd pass as solid evidence

897
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,279
unless the police made you
steal this from me.

898
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,246
I'll wait and see what you'll do with it.

899
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:03,623
Right.

900
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,792
Is the autopsy over?

901
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,385
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

902
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,845
No, that's not what I meant.

903
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,265
I'll call you later.

904
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,308
What happened?

905
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,476
To my office, please.

906
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,312
Was there damage in his brain?

907
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,295
Is Yang Jong-hoon in a bad state?

908
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:52,922
Who's this?

909
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,674
This is disappointing.

910
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,176
You punched me
and made me lose valuable blood.

911
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,309
I heard he's as good as dead
unless I give him my blood.

912
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,476
What should I do?

913
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,813
Why are you asking me?

914
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,191
Who'd benefit the most
if Yang Jong-hoon dies

915
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,944
and shuts his mouth for good?

916
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,281
If that's you, I won't give him my blood.

917
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:31,461
I already told you.
I'm here right now thanks to your uncle.

918
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,589
O RH NEGATIVE NEEDED NOW

919
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:37,091
So? Should I give him my blood or not?

920
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,984
Don't do a thing, and stay still.

921
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:02,241
Don't give him your blood.

922
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,290
Professor Yang is in critical condition?

923
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,168
He could actually die
without a transfusion!

924
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,461
He won't last.

925
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,171
Did you push him on purpose?

926
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,881
Will you let me go if I tell you?

927
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,717
That punk scares me.

928
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,427
Any chance that it was manipulated?

929
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,555
Unless he was ordered to frame him
for drugging the victim to death.

930
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:08,558
All these circumstances and evidence
are pointing to Joon-hwi.

931
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,059
I killed him.

932
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,437
Something must've gone wrong.
This can't be.

933
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,272
What if we lose both of them?

934
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:17,984
Joon-hwi submitted his withdrawal letter
this morning.

935
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:18,985
I can't reach him.

936
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,279
The prosecution delivered
some shocking news.

937
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:25,158
