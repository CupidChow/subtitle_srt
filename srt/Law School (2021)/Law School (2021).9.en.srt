1
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,534
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

2
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,703
It's Ye-seul. She's gone.

3
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,581
She probably didn't go too far.

4
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,506
Yeong-chang.

5
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:30,924
Yeong-chang!

6
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,763
Yeong-chang, no…

7
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,059
SOL A

8
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:49,943
Professor Yang.

9
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,778
Ye-seul.

10
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,200
We're behind the dorm
for Hankuk Law School.

11
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,244
We have a patient. Please hurry.

12
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,121
Sol, Yeong-chang…

13
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,372
We need two ambulances.

14
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,581
I'll take her and run.

15
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,208
Hankuk Hospital is closer that way.

16
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,585
Ye-seul. Wake up.

17
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,962
-Don't come.
-Why not?

18
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,547
Assemblyman Ko will be furious.

19
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,382
She may get arrested at the hospital.

20
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,466
Arrested?

21
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,093
Then detained too?

22
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,428
If they think
she destroyed evidence or fled.

23
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,943
He's in surgery.

24
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,654
Hello, sir.
It looks like his operation just began.

25
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,075
Where is that brat?

26
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,330
EMERGENCY CENTER

27
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,674
How dare…

28
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,803
How dare you.
How dare you do this to my son!

29
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,222
-She's a patient.
-Move aside!

30
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,643
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,948
Ms. Jeon, let me take you to the station.

32
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,660
May I go
after Yeong-chang's operation is over?

33
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,287
Shut up.

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,873
-Let's go.
-She's undergoing treatment.

35
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,750
She'll present herself afterwards.

36
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,794
"Treatment"? After what she did to my son?

37
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,338
I'm so sorry.

38
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,010
-Finish getting your IV.
-What are you doing?

39
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,805
She's not in a state to be questioned,
so she can't go.

40
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,850
What are you doing?

41
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,018
Phone, please.

42
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,066
It is December 5th, 9:40 p.m. now.

43
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,361
Ye-seul's bag is on the bed.
I'm filming this as is.

44
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,197
And over here, too.

45
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:00,865
And this.

46
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,205
And this. I'm filming these as is.

47
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,917
-You're the witness.
-What are you doing?

48
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,711
Proving that
she didn't try to destroy evidence.

49
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,880
You saw everything. We're the witnesses.

50
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,507
I'm not going to be a witness.

51
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,803
You have to do it.
Something happened to Ye-seul.

52
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,017
If you won't come with us,
we'll have to arrest you.

53
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:30,937
I'll go.

54
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,772
You aren't going anywhere.

55
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,156
If you're fine,
why weren't you arrested in the act?

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,157
You collapsed.

57
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,910
You have a few more tests.
Finish them first.

58
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,245
Professor.

59
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,334
Wasn't it embarrassing enough
to arrest and detain me?

60
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,544
You should get a grip.

61
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,172
She took a toll because of the shock,

62
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,675
so once she gets better,
I'll bring her to the station.

63
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,135
Move aside.

64
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,886
I'll arrest you for stopping me.

65
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,431
You deserve to be stopped
if you're abusing your power.

66
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,807
What?

67
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,526
She's a victim, too.

68
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,697
She was trying to stop your son
from spreading a spy cam video.

69
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,036
If she gets interrogated now,

70
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,121
there'll be a lot of damage to you, too.

71
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,498
You should hope
your son's operation goes well

72
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,959
while keeping his belongings together.

73
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,884
Let her get treated first.

74
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,722
I'm on my way to the hospital.

75
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,640
Please ask your wife for help.

76
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,518
And you must be studying.
You don't need to come, Seung-jae.

77
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,770
Okay. Goodbye.

78
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,611
-Professor!
-My gosh!

79
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,987
-Goodness!
-Oh, no.

80
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,198
-How many weeks?
-At 22 weeks, 3 days.

81
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,491
Get Dr. Lee now.

82
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,160
Dr. Lee's surgery is delayed.
If you're in a hurry…

83
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,746
Professor, may I take a look?

84
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,167
Your baby's heart is beating well,

85
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,960
and the baby is…

86
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,380
having lots of fun.

87
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,382
I see enough amniotic fluid,

88
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,426
and your cervical length is fine.

89
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,720
Your uterus looks fine, so…

90
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,388
So I won't have to worry?

91
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,100
You aren't bleeding,
but you're mid-pregnancy.

92
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,185
She'll suggest you stay for about a week.

93
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,479
Hey, looking cool.

94
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,773
I didn't know you were an OB-GYN doctor.

95
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,361
It seems like you'd be a great doctor.
Why did you go to law school?

96
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,987
Tell me about it.

97
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,157
Even your professor asked
why you quit and went to law school.

98
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,203
You're busy studying

99
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,705
that we only see each other
at times like these.

100
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,295
Your uterus seems to be fine.

101
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,674
You may bleed again
if you strain yourself or get stressed.

102
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,092
Please try to remain calm.

103
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,677
And just in case,

104
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,763
why don't you get hospitalized
for about a week and see how you do?

105
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,057
Are you his wife?

106
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,725
Yes.

107
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,145
I see, you're both OB-GYN doctors.

108
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,855
That's what I wanted, too.

109
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,524
But he quit then ran off to law school.

110
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,278
What are you doing? Get her admitted.

111
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,195
Okay.

112

00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,711
Goodness. What is this?

116
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,463
What? Is it not working?

117
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,381
What's with you?

118
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,799
Wait, nothing is working.

119
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,968
Goodness. What am I going to do?

120
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,972
My gosh, come back. Goodness.

121
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,515
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

122
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,768
This file won't open,
then something must have happened.

123
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,686
It froze.

124
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,190
-May I take a look?
-Can you fix computers?

125
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,029
I didn't get a virus, did I?

126
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,989
I hope it's not ransomware.

127
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,074
I pressed that before.

128
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,076
Did you back up important files?

129
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,621
What? I'm going to lose everything?

130
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,164
I think it has a virus.

131
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,544
So? Do you think you can fix it?

132
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:27,006
I'll take a look, but if it doesn't work,
I'll take it to an expert.

133
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,218
You need to get some rest,
so you have to lie down.

134
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,262
I mean, if I can't get that fixed…

135
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,057
Seung-jae.

136
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,684
I need you to save me yet again.

137
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,186
Please fix that.

138
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,521
Okay.

139
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,524

BASIC FACTS OF THE INCIDENT

146
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,981
I could just go alone.

147
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,440
You've got your Civil Code exam.

148
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,277
She's in my study group. I should go.

149
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,029
Aiming for all A pluses again?

150
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,699
Don't make it sound easy.

151
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,450
Do you know how hard it is?

152
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,289
What about me?
Don't you think things are hard for me?

153
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,916
Do you know how hard it is
to harvest eggs?

154
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,383
Fine. The one who's suffering today
is someone else.

155
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,015
FLU AND PNEUMONIA

156
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,521
I AGREE TO BE EXAMINED
FOR EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT…

157
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,690
I know it's hard, but…

158
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,110
It wasn't an assault.

159
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,448
We were in love.

160
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,659
It's sexual assault to film you secretly.

161
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,578
Please don't put it like that.

162
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,705
How…

163
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,916
How is spending time with someone I love…

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,335
I know it's tough,

165
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,212
but you have to look straight
at your situation.

166
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,924
The moment you were forced
to have intercourse

167
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,927
and began to hide signs of assault
behind your sunglasses,

168
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,055
you couldn't call it love.

169
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,474
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,768
I can't do it.

171
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,317
Professor,
how did Yeong-chang's surgery go…

172
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,460
The media hasn't caught on.

173
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,630
And his phone and laptop
are already taken care of.

174
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,424
But…

175
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,971
What? Examined for sexual assault?

176
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,640
Yes, sir.

177
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,817
Did the surgery go well?

178
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,527
We did our best,

179
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,822
but we'll have to wait and see
if he'll regain consciousness.

180
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,490
You'll have to see?

181
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,909
I'll tell you more details
at the director's office.

182
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,244
Give me an answer now!

183
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,329
The director wanted to see you upstairs.

184
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,627
Are you saying he may never wake up?

185
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,087
Yeong-chang…

186
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,299
Professor, I can't do this.

187
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,718
How can I do it after doing that to him?

188
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,596
It's all right.

189
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,727
If it's too hard to take,
you can cry, okay?

190
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,146
It's all right.

191
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,906
What about Ye-seul?

192
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,367
She's with me. You don't have to come.

193
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,202
I was on my way right now.

194
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,579
You still have tests.

195
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,872
Go study.

196
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,792
-But--
-You better not flunk because of my test.

197
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,212
Okay. Please look after Ye-seul, ma'am.

198
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,756
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,260
This darned test is keeping me away

200
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,761
from looking after a friend.

201
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,056
It'll be harder for her
if you flunk out because of her.

202
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,017
You just got back?

203
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,852
-Did you do it?
-What?

204
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,230
Right, yes. I did as you said.

205
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,065
But do you think

206
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,985
the worst could happen for Ko Yeong-chang?

207
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,403
Then Ye-seul might--

208
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,779
Just go study.

209
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,072
Your tests aren't over.

210
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,659
Those darned tests, tests, tests!

211
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,036
Darn it!

212
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,662
My gosh.

213
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,054
2020 2ND SEMESTER CIVIL CODE FINAL

214
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,097
ON JULY 1ST, 2016, PARTY B HANDED OVER…

215
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,517
No way. What happened here?

216
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,020
EXERCISE OF SUBROGATION RIGHTS

217
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,313
It's a win for us.

218
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,829
2020 2ND SEMESTER CIVIL CODE FINAL

219
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,336
THE DEBTOR MAY EXERCISE HIS RIGHT

220
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,648
I got chills as soon as I saw
the Exercise of Subrogation Rights.

221
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,234
I can't believe your study group
made a right prediction.

222
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,529
It's thanks to what Sol A found
on Korea Law Review.

223
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,532
She thought we'd get questioned on this
and picked it out.

224
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,827
She looked determined not to flunk out,
and she's on a roll.

225
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,372
My study group also went through
all of Prof. Kim's works

226
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,874
but couldn't catch it.

227
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,918
Hey, should I switch to your study group?

228
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,628
If I join in Ye-seul's place…

229
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,589
In Ye-seul's place?

230
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,757
I mean, I didn't mean in her place.

231
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,634
Well…

232
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,929
I mean, if you snatched her
before something like this happened--

233
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,431
Will you keep saying that?

234
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,640
Snatch who from what?

235
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,726
Why are you getting mad at me?

236
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,563
Pretty girls like Ye-seul
tend to fall more easily for bad guys.

237
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,315
Guys like you in the world of law

238
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,817
will get bashed
for lack of gender sensitivity.

239
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
What? Bashed? Are you done talking?

240
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,070
Hey, Min Bok-gi!

241
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:14,955
Speak.

242
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,249
I think he hacked into it.

243
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,045
After I saved my midterm draft
in the first semester,

244
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,213
my laptop suddenly broke down,

245
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,506
so Seung-jae fixed it.

246
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,136
If he saw the folder at that time,
I'm sure he would've been tempted.

247
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,600
The vice dean also asked him
to fix his laptop

248
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,977
after he heard that Seung-jae fixed mine.

249
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,272
I never asked him,
so he would've sneaked in here.

250
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,732
Then in the first semester--

251
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,193
I got a new one in the second semester.

252
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,612
He wanted to hack into the new one,

253
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,823
so that's why
he came to this room secretly?

254
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,369
Seung-jae, what happened to you that day?

255
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,372
It's your fault.

256
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,087
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,590
Something came up at home.
Please excuse me.

258
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,842
He was flustered at my question,

259
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,427
then he said it was my fault.

260
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,555
I gave him the idea
to hack into these computers.

261
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,182
That's how he got all A pluses?

262
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,102
Is this just speculation?

263
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,854
I wouldn't say it's just that.

264
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,649
I looked up
Seung-jae's midterm answer sheet again.

265
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,567
It's almost perfect,

266
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,736
except for one provision he got wrong.

267
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,949
And I also put the same wrong provision

268
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,701
on the answer sheet I made.

269
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,085
ANSWER SHEET

270
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,586
And this is?

271
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,382
Maybe it means his head went blank, too.

272
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,227
Goodness, that jerk.

273
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,188
I'm just frustrated.

274
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,190
He's a smart and good kid.

275
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,900
Hacking is an awful crime.

276
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,694
I know that, too.

277
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,655
If only I didn't let him see my laptop…

278
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,368
Well, anyway,

279
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,495
even if Seung-jae was here that day,

280
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,332
there's no reason to prove the alibi
at this point in time, right?

281
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,461
He didn't die right after he got drugged.

282
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,171
He died after some time passed.

283
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,717
Their argument is you gave him meth
and came back to the office.

284
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,137
Wouldn't it be easier to prove

285
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,056
that you gave him sugar, not drugs?

286
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,223
He can do that.

287
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,354
2:25 P.M., OCTOBER 5, 2020
THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

288
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,743
I saw sugar there
and put it in your coffee.

289
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,579
But you never know,
so you should see a doctor.

290
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,664
Hypoglycemia can be dangerous.

291
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,047
-I'll see him.
-No, I will.

292
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,758
I'll give him a chance to come clean

293
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,301
and prove your alibi.

294
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,302
Can you do it?

295
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,349
He has the smoking gun
that can prove your innocence at once.

296
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,142
If he spills it, he'll die,

297
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,894
but if he doesn't, you will.

298
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,270
It must be killing him.

299
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,275
All right, fine. I'll do it.

300
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,820
I will.

301
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,619
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON

302
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,206
Professor.

303
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,669
I'm here about Dan
now that my tests are over.

304
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,754
You'll find out at the trial tomorrow.

305
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,172
At your trial tomorrow?

306
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,674
Yes.

307
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,307
Isn't this funny?

308
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,187
This mock court should be a sacred place,

309
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,189
but it's made with dirty money

310
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,317
from a criminal who killed someone
by accident or on purpose,

311
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,153
be it a bribe or a gift.

312
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,950
What do you think

313
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,120
Professor Seo regrets the most
after his death?

314
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,333
Hitting that child was just an accident.

315
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,712
The moment he ran off
and tried to cover it up,

316
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,131
he fell into a trap
he couldn't escape from.

317
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,885
It was too late to take responsibility.

318
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,262
That's what he'd regret the most.

319
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,604
I hope your empty answer sheet

320
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,398
doesn't mean you give up

321
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,108
but a way you displayed courage.

322
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,405
I'll see you in court.

323
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,961
PROFESSOR YANG JONG-HOON'S FOURTH TRIAL

324
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,422
Jeon Ye-seul,
a witness from our previous trial,

325
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,717
is now indicted for causing
serious injury on her boyfriend.

326
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,510
Her testimony cannot be trusted.

327
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,305
Although Ms. Jeon
witnessed the murder scene,

328
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,933
she couldn't tell
because the defendant threatened her.

329
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,186
Then her boyfriend convinced her
to come to me to state the truth.

330
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,773
I can't believe he's going that far.
He should write a novel.

331
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,942
As soon as her relationship fell apart,

332
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,526
she changed her statement

333
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,113
then dared to frame him for filming her
against her will.

334
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,281
Objection!

335
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,158
We do not know the fact of the matter--

336
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,119
Her trial will reveal
that everything I just said is true.

337
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,829
Please consider that,

338
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,164
and I'd like to request

339
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,543
that you put off the trustworthiness
of her testimony until her trial is over.

340
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,256
I'd like to turn in
the arraignment of her charges

341
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,423
on injuring a person.

342
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,389
JUDGE

343
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,850
Attorney, will you agree
to have this arraignment as evidence?

344
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,770
If he refuses,
the prosecutor might summon Ye-seul again.

345
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,648
The judge might do that directly
with his power.

346
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,191
No way.

347
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,151
Her life is already tough.

348
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,654
It'd be too cruel
to have her on the stand again.

349
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,704
We do not accept.

350
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,374
I'd like to have
Ms. Jeon Ye-seul as a witness again.

351
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,753
Request accepted.

352
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,588
If the judge agreed,

353
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,550
does it mean he's suspicious
of the validity of her testimony?

354
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,552
The prosecutor's tactic worked.

355
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,429
He's trying to destroy the validity

356
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,015
of the testimonies
that benefit Professor Yang.

357
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,147
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

358
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,123
This is an airplane ticket to Boston

359
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,542
dated the same day
the defendant was arrested.

360
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,961
It's not a round-trip ticket but one way.

361
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,671
The prosecution points to this

362
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,923
and argues
the defendant was trying to flee

363
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,760
after he murdered Mr. Seo Byung-ju.

364
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,263
Defendant. Why were you headed to Boston?

365
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,773
To find someone.

366
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,649
I bought it one-way

367
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,234
because the date of my return

368
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,612
depended on whether
I can find the person or not.

369
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,614
Who were you trying to find?

370
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,116
Kang Dan.

371
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,496
How dare he try to bait me.

372
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,707
What did you mean by that bait?

373
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,003
Kang Dan.

374
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,214
"Kang Dan"?

375
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,049
Who is Kang Dan?

376
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,468
-That is unrelated to this trial.
-Unrelated?

377
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,677
In that case,

378
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,096
do you admit

379
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,682
this airplane ticket cannot be used
as evidence to prove his charges?

380
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,020
She was a part of the campaign
for Assemblyman Ko Hyeong-su.

381
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,566
She became a whistle-blower of his camp
over spreading fake news of his opponent

382
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,984
then suddenly disappeared.

383
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,528
-What?
-Disappeared?

384
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,445
Your Honor.

385
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,406
Defendant, refrain from stating
unrelated information.

386
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,866
Delete that.

387
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,035
Please give him restrictions

388
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,913
on spreading false information
in front of media personnel.

389
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,458
That's a problem of defamation
for the said man,

390
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,711
but I do not believe
we must put him on restriction here.

391
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,421
It's not false information.

392
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,050
A mysterious disappearance
after whistle-blowing?

393
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,137
She dropped the charges herself
then flew over to the U.S.

394
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,847
-What?
-Wait.

395
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,181
How do you know that?

396
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,858
I heard it from Prosecutor Seo Byung-ju.

397
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,985
-Seo Byung-ju?
-He heard it from him?

398
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,863
-What's going on now?
-From Seo Byung-ju?

399
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,580
Ko Hyeong-su.

400
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,171
KO HYEONG-SU SPREADING FALSE NEWS
ON HIS OPPONENT

401
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,464
PARK JUNG-GIL CHARGED
WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT

402
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,217
PARK JUNG-GIL FOUND DEAD AT HOME
AFTER HIS RESIGNATION

403
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,849
KO HYEONG-SU'S VIOLATION
OF THE ELECTION ACT FROM A WHISTLE-BLOWER

404
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,351
NO RESULTS

405
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,192
I'm not sure
if I could send this letter to you,

406
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,652
but I still wanted to apologize.

407
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,070
Prosecutor Yang,

408
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,115
I promised
to never compromise with injustice,

409
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,618
but I'm sorry I didn't hold to my words.

410
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,704
I ended up kneeling down
before filthy money.

411
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,707
Please do not forgive my betrayal,

412
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,792
stay true to your values,

413
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,462
and make sure
you get Ko Hyeong-su punished.

414
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,801
She knelt down before filthy money?

415
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,600
Why are you here?

416
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,188
I saw the view on your plagiarism.

417
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,523
I didn't plagiarize.

418
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,817
But Prof. Yang won't believe it.

419
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,736
So?

420
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,989
Do you want to believe
Prof. Yang is the culprit?

421
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,534
Is that why you said
you didn't see the sugar packet?

422
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,164
Then why are you so sure
that Prof. Yang didn't do it?

423
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,927
I was with him.

424
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,266
Let's give you the benefit of doubt

425
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,434
and say it was sugar, not methamphetamine.

426
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,395
Then you're saying

427
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:07,691
you left the scene right away
as soon as Seo came back to himself?

428
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,192
I want to be left alone.

429
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,569
Please leave.

430
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:21,663
However, both Kang Sol B and Seo Ji-ho
had never seen the sugar packet

431
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,040
although they came in after you.

432
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,294
Seo Ji-ho said
the victim was intoxicated on drugs.

433
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,337
Kang Sol B said--

434
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,924
We refused to have Kang Sol B's testimony,
so you cannot leak that out.

435
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,510
You can summon her and ask her yourself.

436
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,345
I didn't feel the need to do that,

437
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,598
but if you wanted to prove your innocence,

438
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,809
shouldn't you have her stand here

439
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,520
to confirm what she said
during the questioning?

440
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,607
Why didn't you summon her as a witness?

441
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,028
According to what you said,
you should beg to have her here.

442
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,698
She's here in court.

443
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,951
You should request
to have her as a witness.

444
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,911
A WITNESS CAN BE SUMMONED ON THE SPOT

445
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,998
I'm giving you this big chance.
Why won't you do it?

446
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:12,172
Kang Sol B's testimony will confirm
what he said isn't true.

447
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,633
It'll only confirm the fact that
the defendant is the real culprit.

448
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,266
Hey, what brings you here now?

449
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,643
I had a question for you. Let's go inside.

450
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,811
Hey, what's with you?

451
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,647
I have to hand these out.
I'm running late.

452
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,732
It's about Dan.

453
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,777
Did something happen between her
and Byeol's dad before she--

454
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,570
Stop!

455
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,738
She's not our family.

456
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,032
Mom, tell me.

457
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,368
Did you know
she was in an assemblyman's camp?

458
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,702
I don't know anything.

459
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,164
Why aren't you at school studying?
Don't say a thing on ancient history.

460
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,958
Don't come home
if you'll bring this up again.

461
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm a busy woman, you know. Goodness.

462
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,690
FILES

463
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,608
PHOTOS FROM MY PHONE

464
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,278
On the day of the incident,

465
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,116
why weren't you there
at the mock trial class?

466
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,742
That morning,

467
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,496
I was emailed the video
of the Jurae-dong hit-and-run incident.

468
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,543
I was on the scene at Jurae-dong
to check the facts.

469
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,087
You returned to school at about 12:30 p.m.

470
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,006
Until that moment,

471
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,927
his anklet still had power,
so we could trace his whereabouts.

472
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,221
If you were in school,

473
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,057
why weren't you at the mock trial class?

474
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,268
Because of the shock.

475
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,479
And you even forgot
your duty as a professor?

476
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,900
Because you didn't know what you would do
if you saw the victim?

477
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,153
-He's leading the defendant!
-Sustained.

478
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,155
WITNESS

479
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,823
But in the end,

480
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,910
you went over to see the victim
after getting some coffee for him.

481
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,374
I wanted to make sure…

482
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,293
Thanks.

483
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,586
by asking him in person.

484
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,296
The Jurae-dong hit-and-run case.

485
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,634
It was you?

486
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,065
Let's take a 30-minute break.

487
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,217
Yes.

488
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,262
It was me.

489
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,599
Why did you put in that little?

490
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,767
Pour everything in.

491
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,646
You killed a child
but you don't want to die,

492
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,857
yet you're tormented
to shamelessly live on?

493
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,487
You're right.

494
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,575
I can't do this anymore.

495
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,495
When you saw him,

496
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,455
did you become furious?

497
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,669
Do you think
I got furious and killed him there?

498
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,921
If I wanted to,

499
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,507
I would've left him to die
from hypoglycemic shock.

500
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,010
I see. So there wouldn't have been
a need to give him sugar?

501
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,768
What if he didn't have hypoglycemia
to begin with?

502
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,145
-What is he suggesting?
-So what if he didn't?

503
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,856
-Then what will happen?
-What now?

504
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,404
NOTARIZED DOCUMENT

505
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,321
AGREEMENT

506
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,824
KANG CHIL-SEONG
WILL NOT ABUSE AN SUK-JA AGAIN

507
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,535
ONCE KANG DAN REACHES AN AGREEMENT
WITH KO HYEONG-SU

508
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,289
AGREEMENT TO THE FOLLOWING

509
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,291
KANG DAN, KANG CHIL-SEONG

510
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,709
ATTACHMENT

511
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,085
KANG DAN, KANG CHIL-SEONG

512
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,466
NOTARIZED DOCUMENT

513
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,135
AGREEMENT

514
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,972
This is a glucometer,
which the victim always used.

515
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,726
And he always kept a record
of his glucose level.

516
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,145
Let's look at the glucose level

517
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,772
tested at 12:30 p.m.
on the day of the incident.

518
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,359
It's at 227.

519
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,194
This is hyperglycemic.

520
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,780
It wasn't previously on the list.

521
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,950
I had thought I wouldn't need this
to prove him guilty.

522
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,411
I'll turn it in as new evidence.

523
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,288
It's cheating to turn it in like this.

524
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,416
There's nothing to discuss.

525
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,920
If it's cheating,
the judge won't have to take it.

526
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,380
Well, you know…

527
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,050
Please do not accept it as evidence.

528
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,468
You must present that

529
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,179
the prosecutor's petty trick
cannot fool this court.

530
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,057
If you don't,
it'll be taken for the next one.

531
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,101
If your verdict gets overturned,
it'll have an impact on the judges.

532
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,186
Defendant.

533
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,647
So I understand that it's not easy.

534
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,357
-That's it.
-I see.

535
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,025
-That's tough.
-Very tricky.

536
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,735
Order!

537
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,656
I will accept it.

538
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,116
We'll put the questioning to a halt

539
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,534
and inspect the evidence.

540
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,663
Defense counsel, do you agree?

541
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,750
No, I do not.

542
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,670
Then I'd like to have the record

543
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,546
of the glucose level inspected.

544
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,507
Accepted.

545
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,259
Things were already unfavorable.

546
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,053
Why did he get on the judge's nerve?

547
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,684
His glucose level was 227
when it was taken at 12:30 p.m.

548
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:03,231
The possibility that 227
will turn into hypoglycemia at 14:55 is

549
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,027
nonexistent, unless the victim was
overdosed with insulin during that time.

550
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,946
WITNESS

551
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,448
-Isn't that so?
-Objection!

552
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,201
We do not know if this was
the victim's blood--

553
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,579
We already confirmed that it's his blood
through these bloody strips

554
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,415
from the trash can on the crime scene.

555
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,628
I have the NFS report that proves
the blood left here

556
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,796
belonged to the victim.

557
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,636
-How can this be?
-What?

558
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,887
It's game over.

559
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,015
-What's going to happen?
-It's now over.

560
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,558
He won't be able to get out.

561
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,519
YOU HAVE 2 MISSED CALLS

562
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,733
COURT

563
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,488
CALLS

564
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,906
JU-YEONG

565
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,450
I was about to call you.

566
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,952
-Ju-yeong.
-Can you come to the hospital now?

567
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,957
I can't do that now. I'm…

568
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,209
You need to come see me first.
Come quickly.

569
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,643
I told you it's not late yet.

570
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,564
I believe you have the courage.

571
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,523
HANKUK UNIV. HOSPITAL

572
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,441
See you in court.

573
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,358
PROF. KIM EUN-SUK

574
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,153
It's not too late, Seung-jae.
I'm waiting for you.

575
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,658
-You're here.
-Hey.

576
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,840
-This is…
-It's awesome!

577
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,885
-That's our baby.
-It was a success?

578
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,514
You looked really busy,

579
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,266
so I didn't mention it
until my blood level went up and up

580
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,227
and I began to see the fetus.

581
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,105
This time,
the sperm was in good condition,

582
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,232
and the fertilized egg
was implanted smoothly.

583
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,526
I did have a good feeling about it.

584
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,115
Why did you take this off?

585
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,246
Don't you ever take your ring off again.

586
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,916
It's now a sign that shows
you're this little one's dad.

587
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,965
I won't be hard on you
for going to law school now.

588
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,092
So, please study harder

589
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,511
for our baby's sake.

590
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,494
Get lost.

591
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,706
-Yeong-chang.
-"Yeong-chang"?

592
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,876
Go call Han Joon-hwi by his name.

593
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,920
I heard you weren't arrested
thanks to him.

594
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,175
I'm so sorry.

595
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,136
You're sorry?

596
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,098
You made me like this,
and you're sorry now?

597
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,941
Did he tell you to come see me?

598
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,321
Did he tell you to cry me a river
and beg me to settle?

599
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,215
It must be really tough.

600
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,010
I heard the news.

601
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,264
That he woke up, but one side of his body
is still paralyzed.

602
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,978
He could get better
if he continues to get treated.

603
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,939
Don't be hard on yourself.

604
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,234
I try not to.

605
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,239
But it feels like my fault.

606
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,242
How could this happen to you?

607
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,038
Don't I seem pathetic?

608
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,086
I thought it was

609
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,130
very admirable of you.

610
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,468
Bearing witness at the trial.

611
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,930
I couldn't have done that.

612
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,478
I thought I couldn't do it either.

613
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,983
When I saw Prof. Yang
sitting there as a defendant,

614
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,655
I realized how much weight
something I say could hold.

615
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,118
I didn't know when I read it on books,

616
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,370
but once I stood there,

617
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,958
I realized what this law we study

618
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,044
actually meant.

619
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,798
Then things happened.

620
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,143
Goodbye, then.

621
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,771
Please don't tell anyone
in our study group that you saw me.

622
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,857
-Ye-seul.
-I doubt

623
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,192
I'll return to school.

624
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,530
I don't want them to be worried about me.

625
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,909
Thanks for everything.

626
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,459
You would have

627
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,712
done the same.

628
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,276
Man, I don't think it'll be easy

629
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,986
unless we find the real culprit.

630
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,699
DEAN OH JEONG-HUI

631
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,913
If you're curious, come and see.

632
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:34,872
It seems chaotic.

633
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,625
Yes.

634
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,628
What? It's over?

635
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,506
Prof. Yang requested to resume it later.

636
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,341
Aren't the odds against him now?

637
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,927
Forget the odds, it means he did it.

638
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,637
He wasn't hypoglycemic.

639
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,056
Professor Yang.

640
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,367
Why are you here?

641
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,369
The sugar packet.

642
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,665
-You think I saw it, right?
-Yes.

643
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,836
But why didn't you ask me to testify?

644
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,382
That's your decision,
just as it was for Ye-seul.

645
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,100
My wife got pregnant
after many failed attempts.

646
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,186
If she finds out what I did,
the worst can happen with the shock.

647
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,647
Please don't wait for me. I'm sorry.

648
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,275
Why don't we persuade Sol B?

649
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,987
The prosecutor can't summon her
as a witness because she may say

650
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,447
she saw the sugar packet.

651
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,866
Please summon me as a witness.

652
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,245
I'll destroy
the prosecutor's argument at once.

653
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,500
Then you'll no longer be suspicious of me
for committing plagiarism.

654
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,921
You said you won't let your students
turn into an officer like me.

655
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,966
But she sounds just like me.

656
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,803
So you'll destroy my argument?

657
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,016
Then you'll be all over the news
for making a deal

658
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,768
with a murderer
to cover up your plagiarism.

659
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,408
Seo Ji-ho?

660
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,330
Okay. I'll stop by for a second.

661
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,676
So, you sued me?

662
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,931
You only learned rubbish from Yang.

663
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,894
A first-year law school student
should be studying really hard right now.

664
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,939
You shouldn't use your energy
on this nonsense.

665
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,066
Remember my call?

666
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,652
Who's the prosecutor
mentioned in your article?

667
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,279
I said I couldn't tell you
to protect my informant.

668
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,365
My father died because of him.

669
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,282
SEO GI-YEOL

670
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,660
If you won't tell me,
I'll go to the prosecution.

671
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,911
There's no need.

672
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,668
I'll tell you. Listen up.

673
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,798
It's Prosecutor Seo Byung-ju.

674
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,551
Seo Byung-ju.

675
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,470
It was you, wasn't it?

676
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:38,931
That was ages ago.

677
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,976
You should've checked long ago.

678
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,688
Checking the facts is
the basic duty of a judicial officer.

679
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,445
If you want to pass the bar exam at once,
drop the lawsuit

680
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,822
and focus on your studies.

681
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,837
He won't be an easy fight.

682
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,964
But I'll seem easy to him.

683
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,884
I guess so.

684
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,804
Why didn't I

685
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,349
ever think of checking this
with your uncle?

686
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,351
Checking the facts is the basics.

687
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,645
It is the basics.

688
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,275
Why didn't I ask him
for the reason he changed,

689
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,943
not even once?

690
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,955
This was made by my dad's company.

691
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,460
Show him that you aren't that easy.

692
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,129
In my eyes, you also

693
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,381
don't seem too easy.

694
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,309
Sol!

695
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,607
-What brings you here?
-Hey, because I missed you.

696
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:16,070
I'm doing fine thanks to Joon-hwi.
Didn't he tell you?

697
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,455
-Go home.
-Okay.

698
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,716
Dan cut us off ages ago,
and she's not in Korea anymore.

699
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,718
Even if you stayed here--

700
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:40,719
Telling me to move?

701
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,889
I wanted to talk about Prof. Yang's trial.

702
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,433
If she ever calls, I'll let you know.

703
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,519
Didn't she already call you? No?

704
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,145
If she called Prof. Yang,

705
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,981
I'm sure she called her family.

706
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,608
He couldn't talk to her either.

707
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,193
What the heck are you saying?

708
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,071
I saw him talk to her
with my own two eyes.

709
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,157
What are you talking…

710
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,787
You really didn't get a call?

711
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,123
Man, what is this?

712
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,333
She feels closer to strangers
than her family?

713
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,878
Maybe she got sick of all of you,
so she packed up and left.

714
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,047
Man.

715
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,049
You need to leave this area now.

716
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,514
Are you scared I might do something
to your cute little sister?

717
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,850
You're on a watch 24 hours a day

718
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,561
because there's a high chance
you'll commit another crime.

719
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,229
Exactly.

720
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,232
My every move is getting tracked.

721
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,943
What the heck can I do anyway?
Over there. Look.

722
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,625
Why did you install a CCTV
in front of my place?

723
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,211
To protect Byeol
and to get something I'm after.

724
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:57,921
What are you after?

725
00:45:58,755 --> 00:45:59,965
It's top secret right now.

726
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,051
Why did you leave during the trial?

727
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,471
My reason is top secret too.

728
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,765
What about the trial? How did it go?

729
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,810
He wasn't hypoglycemic to begin with?

730
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,063
Isn't that critical for Prof. Yang?

731
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,399
Yes, for now.

732
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,775
Forget the sugar or whatnot.

733
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,361
We have to prove
the number on the tester is wrong.

734
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,697
If we say the date is wrong…

735
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,409
We should just catch the culprit.

736
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,121
Where are we going?

737
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,415
To run an errand for Prof. Kim.

738
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,379
Why do you look so worn out?

739
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:41,840
I'm fine.

740
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,593
Are you here alone?

741
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,972
My mom went out to get a lawyer,

742
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,934
but no one will take it.

743
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,185
Why not?

744
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,478
They all got scared.

745
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,940
The next president,
the man of the Judiciary Committee.

746
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,483
Assemblyman Ko is a big shot.

747
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,861
Darn it.
There are millions of lawyers in Korea.

748
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,072
We say there are too many.

749
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,657
The law circle is very tiny.

750
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:11,328
Everyone is a friend of another friend.
You can get a public defender.

751
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,996
What if he's like Park Geun-tae?

752
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:14,873
Not very likely.

753
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,418
You have to find an lawyer soon
to ask for a settlement.

754
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,713
He won't settle this case.

755
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,341
I'm not hopeful.

756
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,470
-But you have to--
-It's grievous bodily harm.

757
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,682
I won't be able to go to school anyway.

758
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,226
I don't care.

759
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,520
But we do.

760
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,605
Come to school.

761
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,108
Let's prepare together
until you find a lawyer.

762
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,409
It'd be perfect
if Prof. Kim could defend her.

763
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,537
A law school professor
can't be an attorney.

764
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,539
I know. I know that.

765
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,499
That's why she didn't defend Prof. Yang.

766
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,387
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

767
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,309
I'm sorry I suddenly visited
while you're distressed over your son.

768
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,439
Your sister was like this too.

769
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:25,193
She suddenly barged in like this
and asked for a job.

770
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,363
She seemed smart, so I trusted her.

771
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,491
I didn't think she'd betray me for money.

772
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,453
Right.

773
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:40,208
She wouldn't have become such a wreck
if it hadn't been for your stepfather.

774
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:46,548
The Kang Dan I know would rather get hurt
than become a wreck.

775
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,926
ASSEMBLYMAN KO HYEONG-SU

776
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,595
She wrote something like this.

777
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,726
NOTARIZED DOCUMENT

778
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:58,644
AGREEMENT

779
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,603
So what?

780
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,730
I was wondering
if you met my stepfather then.

781
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,148
KANG DAN, KANG CHIL-SEONG

782
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,653
Why would I?

783
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,697
It seemed like he needed the money,
not Dan.

784
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,032
Like I said,

785
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,867
your sister came to see me first.

786
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,536
I don't care if your stepfather
put her up for the money or--

787
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,913
I shouldn't have come.

788
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,123
Like father, like son.

789
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,584
Ko Yeong-chang took after you.

790
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,003
What?

791
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,215
The way he said Ye-seul framed him
after filming her in secret

792
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,134
is no different from that time
you said Dan framed you

793
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,886
when you actually did something illegal.

794
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:46,233
Are you sure you won't regret
what you just said?

795
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,071
Do you have any idea what you just did?

796
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,700
You just lost the chance for Jeon Ye-seul

797
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,369
to settle her case.

798
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,505
All right. We can't help it, then.

799
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,801
Can you let me know
if any lawyer would be up for this?

800
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,930
If I can't take this case,
it means no one will.

801
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,223
Times are tough for us.

802
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,017
Why would we destroy our career
by defying Ko Hyeong-su?

803
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,562
I should quit teaching
and defend her myself.

804
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,273
Okay, then. Goodbye.

805
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:28,942
Should I do it?

806
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,571
I'm sure
Ye-seul wouldn't want you to quit.

807
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,491
-I heard you and Joon-hwi saw her.
-Yes.

808
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,285
Did you ask her to return to school?

809
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,454
I did, but she didn't give me
a good answer.

810
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,164
I did it too.

811
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:46,084
I sent her millions of text saying
I'll wait until she comes. She will.

812
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:50,422
Hey, Attorney Lim.
I'm calling on behalf of my student--

813
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,425
Yes. You already know?

814
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,886
You can't do it?

815
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,471
My goodness.

816
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,850
Look at that kid.

817
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,145
He almost died
then barely came back to life.

818
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,772
But just grievous bodily harm?

819
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,941
Tell the prosecutor

820
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,152
to switch the arraignment
to attempted murder!

821
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,322
We have to be careful
if we want to charge her with that.

822
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,200
We have to prove her motive,
that it was intentional.

823
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:22,913
It won't be easy to prove
if Jeon Ye-seul intended to kill him.

824
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,499
You're taking loads of money,

825
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,084
yet you only want to do easy work?

826
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,631
They had been dating,

827
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,134
and the incident broke out
as she tried to stop him

828
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,469
from sending a video.

829
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,222
No, that's not it.

830
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:45,811
You better get your facts straight.

831
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,147
He wasn't trying to send it.

832
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,025
He was trying to delete it

833
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:55,195
as he asked that brat
to break up with him.

834
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,323
Even so,

835
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:02,786
the court is very strict
when it comes to attempted murder cases.

836
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,791
The prosecutor said we should charge her
for bodily harm and punish her--

837
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:08,875
Attorney Song.

838
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,753
Here's my take.

839
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,591
I don't want that brat to be branded

840
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,762
as just some petty assailant
after doing that to my kid.

841
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:26,309
I'll make sure
she has no place in this world

842
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,938
by making her guilty of murder
or attempted murder.

843
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,359
If that's what you want--

844
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,279
If you can't do that,
get her punished more severely!

845
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,240
Yes, sir.

846
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,826
Who's her attorney?

847
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,620
No one will dare to jump on this case.

848
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,456
Let me know if anyone good takes her case.

849
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,084
I'll make them useless.

850
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,132
GRADES

851
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,675
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, MOON HONG-GI

852
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,886
I just proved what I can do.

853
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,055
I surpassed everyone
and took the top as an outsider,

854
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,640
so they hate me a little.

855
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,436
Great job.

856
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:21,156
Prof. Yang filed a complaint
with the school regarding your plagiarism.

857
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,159
We'll begin by discerning the truth.

858
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,079
I will be taking part as the vice dean,
not your father--

859
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:32,042
It's a loss for the school to lose
a talented student like me.

860
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,794
Please make a wise decision

861
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,547
as the vice dean, not as my dad.

862
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,599
About Seung-jae's grades.

863
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,934
I wasn't trying to see it--

864
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:49,851
You wanted to.

865
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,771
Fine. I tried my best to take a peek.

866
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,648
How could it all plummet from A plus?

867
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:58,151
And he submitted an empty sheet
for Civil Code. Something is going on.

868
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,237
He isn't even in school.
He was always in school.

869
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,615
You should call him.

870
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,784
Okay. Eat your food.

871
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,330
I don't think Sol A has to worry
about flunking the year now.

872
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,373
Her finals went well.

873
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,667
Went well, my foot.

874
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,543
My finals for Criminal Code were awful,

875
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,838
and I have no idea what I wrote down
for Constitutional Law.

876
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,717
But it's a relief that I picked out
a potential question for the Civil Code.

877
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,719
You did the best on Criminal Code midterm.

878
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,971
Yes.

879
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:29,099
Thanks to that abnormality,
I think I may not flunk out.

880
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,393
But I'll have to see.

881
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:34,521
But still, you had one best score.
Congrats.

882
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,607
-Not flunking isn't cause for celebration.
-Hey!

883
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:42,028
If you're worried about failing after
studying hard, then consider giving up.

884
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,822
She says she won't have to worry.

885
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,991
Hey, guys.

886
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,201
Did you look at Prof. Jung's announcement?

887
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:51,913
He'll only grade us on finals and reports,
leaving out Prof. Yang's midterm.

888
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,541
-Are you serious?
-Parents and students protested

889
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,751
how the school let him
give out the midterm.

890
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,461
The trial doesn't look promising,

891
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,588
so the school accepted
Prof. Jung's request.

892
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:06,761
I heard Prof. Jung went off the grid
to avoid objections from students.

893
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,763
If he leaves out the midterm,

894
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,391
Sol A would be the biggest victim in this.

895
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,813
So is Prof. Yang guilty?

896
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,732
They asked him to remove his office.

897
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,442
In other words, get lost.

898
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,485
If he's a killer, he should be long gone.

899
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,403
What?

900
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,614
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

901
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,742
PROFESSOR JUNG DAE-HYEON

902
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,035
Is this true?

903
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:34,539
Did you force your student who caused
grievous injury on Assemblyman Ko's son

904
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,750
to get examined for sexual assault?

905
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,376
No, I just made a suggestion.

906
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,961
What are you trying to do?

907
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,880
Are you trying to humiliate my son

908
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,631
because I won't take your bait?

909
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,592
Wasn't killing my best friend enough?

910
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,761
After what happened with your midterm,

911
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,680
if you continue
to cause trouble like this,

912
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,515
we cannot condone this any further.

913
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,852
He has already been put off duty.

914
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,313
There's a high chance
he'll be found guilty.

915
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,607
You shouldn't mention it
before his verdict is--

916
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,860
Does he hold your weakness or something?

917
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,362
Why are you
taking his side so desperately?

918
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,947
You're crossing over the line.

919
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,283
What do you want to say to me?

920
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,331
Apologize to the assemblyman politely,

921
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,334
and it'll look better
if you quit first, so--

922
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,668
I am not going to quit.

923
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,297
You can fire me
once the Supreme Court finds me guilty.

924
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:39,938
If you want

925
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,982
that brat to settle this,

926
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:47,028
you'll have to kneel down before me first.

927
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:54,661
Your student became obsessed with my son,

928
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,330
then caused this tragedy.

929
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:00,959
The victim in this incident
is the one who got hurt like a moron,

930
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,211
my son.

931
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,010
This is why we say
one can never get rid of their habits.

932
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,971
You little jerk.

933
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,764
Wipe your hands.

934
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,433
And remember, I'm keeping my eyes on you,

935
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,645
the man who loves to mess around
with fake news.

936
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,330
YANG JONG-HOON: ON BUSINESS

937
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:50,842
My goodness!

938
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,390
Are you all right?

939
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,186
You don't look all right to me.

940
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,355
I will be.

941
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,277
Lee Man-ho said you talked to Dan.

942
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,278
I did.

943
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,447
She called while I was with him,

944
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,574
so I asked her to text me her number.

945
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,159
But nothing yet.

946
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:18,828
Wait.

947
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,672
I went to see Assemblyman Ko over this.

948
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,467
But I think I caused trouble.

949
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,844
I went over to talk about Dan,

950
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,554
but I brought up Ye-seul, too.

951
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,143
What if she can't settle her case
because of me?

952
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,149
I made him furious.

953
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,488
Great work.

954
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,282
-Sorry?
-Great job.

955
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,246
-What about settling…
-Find another way, then.

956
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,591
A WAY TO AVOID SETTLING A CASE

957
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,221
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SETTLE YOUR CASE
FOR NORMAL ACUPUNCTURE

958
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,597
Gosh, darn it.

959
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,933
Is there a way out of this
without a settlement?

960
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,316
SECOND SEMESTER GRADES

961
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,318
Please.

962
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,029
Darn it.

963
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,574
Prof. Jung Dae-hyeon must be my enemy.

964
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,660
I don't think Ye-seul is here.

965
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,456
Time for the grades of truth.

966
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,750
My gosh, my heart is racing too.

967
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,003
Please.

968
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,880
Please. My gosh, please.

969
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,010
CHECK

970
00:59:58,511 --> 00:59:59,929
Please.

971
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,474
Darn it! I can't do it.

972
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,227
I can't bring myself to check this.

973
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,105
What? You were all in my office.

974
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,857
Ye-seul.

975
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,983
Ye-seul.

976
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:14,235
We have a long way to travel.
Let's get going.

977
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,695
-Let's go.
-Okay.

978
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:21,826
You were interested in crime publication
since middle school,

979
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,620
and you won an award on this too.

980
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,913
So you want to test me?

981
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:30,001
If you help me,
I'll believe you wrote the paper.

982
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,420
How are you going to show me your trust?

983
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,341
-What?
-Since we went to middle school together,

984
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,927
be a witness and say I wrote it.

985
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,347
What do you--

986
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:46,976
Hello?

987
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,395
Yes, I'll be there right now.

988
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,107
Are we all here?

989
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,485
-I'm here for Seung-jae.
-Okay.

990
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,654
I feel very reassured now.

991
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,657
Sadly, at this moment,

992
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,409
even if she finds a private
or a public defender,

993
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,204
they won't be able to put in
everything they can do.

994
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,289
I'll put in everything I can do!

995
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,417
And me too?

996
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,794
And him too.

997
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,421
Settle first to reduce sentencing.

998
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,548
Is that possible?

999
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,342
She should kneel down if she must.

1000
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:20,843
To a jerk like him? No way.

1001
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:21,928
Should I go do it?

1002
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:26,015
I thought of a few ways
so that she can avoid settling the case.

1003
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,227
I thought of this all night.

1004
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,939
About Ye-seul, I mean.
We can argue that it was self-defense.

1005
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,983
Spreading a sexual video
is already illegal,

1006
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:39,904
and Ye-seul felt tormented to death
because of his actions,

1007
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,699
so she was trying to stop him
before he uploaded it.

1008
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,243
CASE RULING

1009
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,245
Why don't we go with self-defense?

1010
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,955
Self-defense?

1011
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:49,914
I agree.

1012
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,166
Self-defense isn't recognized too often.

1013
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:56,045
The court has strict criteria
on acknowledging self-defense,

1014
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,548
-so it won't be easy.
-It's not a fight if it's easy.

1015
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,217
It's a recent ruling of a first trial.

1016
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,594
Judge interpreted defense broadly
and affirmed self-defense.

1017
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,264
First rulings can be reversed
on the second trial

1018
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,558
-and in the Supreme Court.
-It may not happen.

1019
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:11,352
The ruling pointed out that
it's degenerative to assert

1020
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,438
you should just stand a beating
in a fight.

1021
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,690
If this was made
at least in the lower court,

1022
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,066
it means we have a chance.

1023
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,651
Okay.

1024
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,154
Let's make Ye-seul innocent.

1025
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,824
Then we'll need a good attorney too.

1026
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,617
Who's his attorney?

1027
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:33,624
JEON YE-SEUL'S FIRST TRIAL

1028
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,880
What? They're all his attorneys?

1029
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,132
Why does he have so many?
He must be insane.

1030
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,569
Why isn't Ye-seul's attorney here?

1031
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,988
Her public defender resigned again.

1032
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,406
Then who'll be here?

1033
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,241
I'm sure someone else was assigned.

1034
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,409
All rise.

1035
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,594
GRADES

1036
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,100
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

1037
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,441
PROSECUTION

1038
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,280
Defendant.

1039
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,783
When will your attorney get here?

1040
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,289
They already seem half-hearted.

1041
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,667
She's already in a tight spot.

1042
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,503
-I'll go outside and check.
-Okay.

1043
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:15,726
I apologize.

1044
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:23,484
DEFENSE COUNSEL, ACCUSED

1045
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,157
-No way.
-What's going on?

1046
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:32,076
Prof. Yang is defending her?

1047
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:33,786
Is that allowed?

1048
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,541
Your Honor.

1049
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:42,879
In order for the defendant to be
fairly judged by the Court and the people,

1050
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,799
I would like to request a jury trial.

1051
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:14,702
Ergo,

1052
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:18,080
I request that Yang Jong-hoon be sentenced
to 20 years in prison.

1053
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,666
So you're deliberately barking up
the wrong tree.

1054
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,252
Make sure you catch the real killer.

1055
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,546
I said I did it alone because of a grudge!

1056
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,797
Something's fishy.

1057
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,218
I need to ask something.

1058
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:34,138
One of my uncle's belongings is missing.

1059
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,806
-Why?
-Not why but how.

1060
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,433
That's what you want to know.

1061
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,644
You did this to me.
And what? Self-defense?

1062
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:43,147
The court will be criticized
for appointing a murderer. Not a chance.

1063
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,231
So it's up to you.

1064
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,233
I'll take care of it, sir.

1065
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,194
Professor! What do I do?

1066
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:52,448
