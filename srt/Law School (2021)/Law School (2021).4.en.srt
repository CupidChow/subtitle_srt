MARCH 2, 2020
HANKUK LAW SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY

2
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,528
2020 HANKUK UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

3
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:24,501
When I failed to overturn my conviction,
I thought the law could kill me.

4
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,670
However, the law did not betray my trust.

5
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,299
The donation I'm making
to Hankuk University, my alma mater,

6
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:36,471
is my way of apologizing to the law,
which I questioned for a moment.

7
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,143
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,103
I'm sorry. My gosh!

9
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,147
You two again?

10
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,774
I sat between you at orientation.

11
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,738
Seo Ji-ho?

12
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,867
And Min Bok-gi, right?

13
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,453
From what I recall, I'm older than you.

14
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:03,957
Yeah, sis.

15
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,216
Sorry.

16
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,802
It can be tiring to sit next to me.

17
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,306
Those guys who are staring at me…
they're wasting their time.

18
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,893
I'm taken.

19
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,520
MY HUBBY

20
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,355
Babe, I'll call you when I'm done.

21
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,695
CONGRATULATIONS

22
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,863
What? 5.6 billion won?

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,824
You'll give that much to Hankuk Law?

24
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,743
-I'm donating it.
-Right, but why?

25
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,914
-Why would you donate to them?
-You should do it too.

26
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,251
Now that the judicial exam
has been abolished,

27
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,295
we should help law schools
cultivate talent.

28
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,215
Cultivate talent, my foot.

29
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,926
I know it's too late for me now…

30
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,891
but I decided to do it
when the Supreme Court acquitted me.

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,061
Also because of Jong-hoon,
who became a professor because of us.

32
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,230
Not because of your nephew?

33
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,526
What are you thinking?

34
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,489
Don't go all crazy
because your son didn't get in.

35
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,952
How could I not be upset?

36
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,832
I have to give a congratulatory speech
when my son won't even be there.

37
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,376
That idiot.

38
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,837
The girl he's seeing got in,

39
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,505
but he didn't.

40
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,305
ENTRANCE CEREMONY

41
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,350
Byeol, bring this. You can come with Mom.

42
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,309
I'm late. See you!

43
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,227
Okay.

44
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,272
Is this really a law school?

45
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,107
Maybe she's fooling us.

46
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,027
It's such a mystery.

47
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,657
How did that troublemaker
get into law school?

48
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,492
I'd believe Dan, but…

49
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,205
Sol can do it too.

50
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,460
Maybe she lucked out and got in.

51
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,337
But will she do well here?

52
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,007
I heard the smartest kids in the country
go to this school.

53
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,218
This is it.

54
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:26,891
Now, the 11th class
of Hankuk University Law School

55
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,186
will take the oath of admission.

56
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:35,483
Ms. Kang Sol will take the oath
on behalf of the newly admitted students.

57
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,652
Ms. Kang, please come to the podium.

58
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,870
There is another newly admitted student
with the same name.

59
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,706
Keep this in mind.

60
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,055
Nice to see you here, Prosecutor Yang.

61
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,892
Oh, you're not a prosecutor anymore.

62
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,894
Right, Professor Yang?

63
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,319
You're in no position to say anything
to future judicial officers.

64
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,158
You still can't accept the fact
that it was a gift, not a bribe?

65
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,876
As a law professor
who teaches criminal law,

66
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,880
you shouldn't hold a grudge
against the Supreme Court's decision.

67
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,426
I wouldn't call it a grudge.

68
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,887
It's doubt.

69
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,728
Have you seen Kang Dan since then?

70
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,634
He won't last.

71
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,427
-What about the blood?
-Not yet.

72
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,311
-Prof. Yang is in critical condition?
-You didn't get the text?

73
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,782
My little sister is Rh negative, so I know

74
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,200
how rare it is.

75
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,203
He could actually die
without a transfusion!

76
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,879
Sir! Please let me out!

77
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,882
He could die.

78
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,759
-He won't die.
-Hold on.

79
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,511
-Wait! Let me go!
-Professor Yang

80
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,554
will be okay.

81
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,284
Do not give it to him.

82
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,163
Don't give him your blood.

83
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,292
Okay, then will you give me
half of your inheritance?

84
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,385
He'll really be okay, right?

85
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,597
He's passed the critical stage,
so he'll recover soon.

86
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,725
Thank goodness.

87
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,352
Okay.

88
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,940
They found a donor,
so he has received a transfusion.

89
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,115
You were right.

90
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,745
I told you he'd be okay.

91
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,418
Hey, you're drunk.

92
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,711
You should go to bed.

93
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,047
Come on.

94
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,395
INVESTIGATION AND TRIAL

95
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,314
I CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVE FACTS ARE TRUE

96
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,818
Ji-ho.

97
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,030
Would you write a complaint?

98
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,955

HAN JOON-HWI

101
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,220
Hey, Joon-hwi.

102
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,014
I have to study. Hey!

103
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,308
Get up. Hey, get up!

104
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,185
Get up.

105
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,729
Gosh, what's taking him so long?

106

Jeez.

AUTOPSY REPORT

109
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,785
What's up? I'm a busy guy.

110
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,580
Luckily, you got a transfusion,
so you're okay now.

111
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,334
It must've been hard
to find Rh-negative blood.

112
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,753
You were lucky.

113
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,380
We found a donor at the last minute.

114
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,883
I don't know who it is,
but we should thank the donor

115
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,092
for saving his life.

116
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,095
Recovering quickly is one way to do it.

117
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,848
We never disclose our blood donors.

118
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,059
Well, get some rest, then.

119
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,063
Whatever.

120
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:53,402
You lucked out and regained
your consciousness for a reason.

121
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,362
Can you see it?

122
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,198
Gosh, hold on a second.

123
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,871
It's rare to find a brain hematoma

124
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,040
in a second autopsy.

125
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,670
But Professor Seo Byung-ju's wife
hired a top medical examiner and--

126
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,590
So it's not that they missed it.
They deliberately left it out, right?

127
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,675
Bingo.

128
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,513
SECOND AUTOPSY REPORT

129
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,515
SUSPECTED TO HAVE DIED OF DRUG OVERDOSE

130
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,684
SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE CAUSED BY A FALL
CANNOT BE RULED OUT

131
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,687
Apparently, the first medical examiner
quit and left the country.

132
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,817
His son is in Canada,
so he went there to get cancer treatment,

133
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,943
but I can't reach him.

134
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,028
His family all left with him.

135
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,825
So we can't ask him
why the brain damage was left out?

136
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,034
That's right.

137
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,327
Gosh, this is nuts.

138
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,288
Now there are two likely causes of death.

139
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,667
Darn it.

140
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,222
PLEASE RECYCLE

141
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,725
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

142
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,692
How can you eat now?

143
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,951
Professor Yang nearly died because of you.
Professor Seo too.

144
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,080
You give me the creeps. Get out.

145
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,793
Do you think I'm the killer?

146
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,837
Yes.

147
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:40,259
Why not suggest that I turn myself in
as a good roommate should?

148
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,552
You'll turn yourself in?

149
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,762
Then do it before the final exams.

150
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,434
I can get an A plus
if you drop out before then.

151
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,311
Oh, because of your grades?

152
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,396
Like you said, as a good roommate should.

153
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,190
You said I creep you out.

154
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,026
If you do that for me,
I'll take back the comment.

155
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,324
Hey.

156
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,910
Why give me a case that won't even pay…

157
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,120
Darn it!

158
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,124
Because of it, I may even have to take on
the attempted murder case!

159
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,128
Is it him?

160
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,798
Can I talk to him?

161
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,179
Who ordered you to do it?

162
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,057
Look at you, Professor Yang.

163
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,434
You still got it.

164
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,148
Do I look like a loser
who just carries out orders?

165
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,817
Got an attorney yet?

166
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,489
Need a recommendation?

167
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,491
What?

168
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,118
My public defender.
He says my case won't pay much.

169
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,288
Spend the money you've made
from being a loan shark.

170
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:55,292
Pay him good money, and he'll get
your sentence drastically reduced.

171
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,335
When did I say that?

172
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,170
Bodily harm, not attempted murder.

173
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,257
What? For real?

174
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,383
Bodily harm?

175
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:07,388
You stabbed me due to a personal grudge
but weren't trying to kill me.

00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,659
About my mark--

180
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,536
I said no disputes will be accepted.

181
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,413
May I check my answer sheet?

182
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,583
I need to know what I got wrong
to do better on the finals.

183
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,254

Let's go study.

193
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,210
I want to read it.

194
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,420
There's nothing to read.

195
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,880
Prof. Kang has one too.

196
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,466
I thought he hated you,

197
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,593
but he even read your dissertation.

198
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,136
What dissertation? This?

199
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,265
-Wow, you won the grand prize?
-Grand prize?

200
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,810
"Asia Human Rights Dissertation Contest"?

201
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,980
My gosh!
Why didn't I write one in undergrad…

202
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,566
Read it.
You want to be a human rights lawyer.

203
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,485
Can I make a copy of this? Let's all--

204
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,569
No, forget it.

205
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,158
I'm looking for Han Joon-hwi
in first year…

206
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,590
Just talk it out, or I'll call the cops.

207
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,973
You killed my husband for the inheritance?

208
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,773
How could you have the audacity
to walk around the campus?

209
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,735
My gosh!

210
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,570
Are you okay, ma'am?

211
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,038
Why did you do that?

212
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,457
Why do you think your uncle

213
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,712
made the donation and built the mock court
even though I tried so hard to stop him?

214
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,589
How… How could you…

215
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,219
kill your uncle?

216
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,647
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

217
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:11,238
That jerk stabbed you.
How could you ask me to represent him?

218
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:16,035
He'll pay you good money.
He's a loan shark and has a lot of cash.

219
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,495
Still, from attempted murder
to bodily harm?

220
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,457
-Can I really do it?
-Yeah.

221
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,461
There's something, right?

222
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,052
How are you feeling?
So you miraculously found a donor?

223
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,638
He's recovering quickly.

224
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,265
That's great.

225
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,976
That being said,
you should get out on sick bail

226
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,270
before you fully recover.

227
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,816
Got anything to say?

228
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,817
Sorry?

229
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,819
As my attorney.

230
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,113
Oh…

231
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,615
Well…

232
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,908
How should I be released?

233
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,201
On sick bail?

234
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,206
Well…

235
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,374
Sick bail…

236
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,585
-Apply for it.
-No.

237
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,796
Cancel the arrest warrant.

238
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,049
-You actually know things.
-Jong-hoon.

239
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,260
Looks like you also need to explain
why that needs to be done.

240
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,972
Well, if he's released on sick bail,
it'll be a temporary release.

241
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,474
It doesn't quash the warrant--

242
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,310
-I obviously know--
-Of course, I'm sure you know.

243
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:27,022
But it'll be embarrassing for you
to reverse the decision you had…

244
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,109
We'll make the request.

245
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,027
No, you should do it yourself.

246
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,612
Let's just do it ourselves.

247
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,615
If he has to get it canceled himself,
it'll be so awful--

248
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,991
I want you to do it.

249
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,163
Is this because of the second autopsy?

250
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,666
You have no reason to detain me,

251
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,377
so get it canceled.

252
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,049
He was after his money?

253
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,761
That's why he killed his uncle
who practically raised him?

254
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:02,474
I witnessed it with my own eyes.
He refused to sign the renunciation form.

255
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,351
Families can be torn apart over money.

256
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,186
Blood may be thicker than water,

257
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,896
but money comes first.

258
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,691
You're not in our study group.

259
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,235
Don't jump to conclusions.

260
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,154
I'm not jumping to conclusions here.

261
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,615
All these circumstances and evidence
are pointing to Joon-hwi.

262
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,493
There's plenty of evidence
pointing to Professor Yang.

263
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,082
Oh, are you hoping
Professor Yang is the killer--

264
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,834
I just hope it's not Joon-hwi.

265
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,812
Turn yourself in.

266
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,402
You don't deserve to teach here.

267
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,487
Joon-hwi.

268
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,575
The prosecutor I admired the most
betrayed his principles.

269
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,661
And my beloved uncle…

270
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,998
hit a kid with his car and killed him.

271
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,250
My whole world collapsed.

272
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,131
I sent the video to Professor Yang.

273
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,469
What?

274
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,890
Turn yourself in now,
before he reports it to the police.

275
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,768
How could you do this?

276
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,062
Please get out of the gutter now.

277
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,488
You ungrateful brat.

278
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,580
LAW AND ORDER THAT PUT PEOPLE FIRST

279
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,170
He's coming out!

280
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,005
BUKBU DETENTION CENTER

281
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,924
How does it feel to be released?

282
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,968
-You didn't kill him?
-Step aside.

283
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,262
-Please, another time.
-Move back.

284
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,429
Out of the way!

285
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,351
If you're that curious,

286
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,230
ask the prosecutor who leaked info
about my charges before indictment.

287
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,148
Nothing has changed.

288
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,569
BUKBU DETENTION CENTER

289
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,615
However, he's seriously injured
and requires medical treatment,

290
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,826
which means he is not likely to flee,

291
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,245
so I've concluded
he doesn't need to be detained.

292
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,126
As a prosecutor, I also have to protect

293
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:38,213
the accused's rights
for the sake of public interest.

294
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,007
-Out of the way.
-Why are you here?

295
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,093
-A comment, please.
-No, out of the way.

296
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,222
I had arrested him on reasonable grounds,

297
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,474
but he suffered an injury
while in custody,

298
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,768
so I came here out of concern.

299
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,604
But he's not well,
so please try not to bother him.

300
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,982
He said you'd leaked info
about his alleged crime.

301
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,151
-Is it true?
-No, of course not.

302
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,527
My job is to protect…

303
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,030
Read this since you're here anyway.

304
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,666
I'm going to sue Prosecutor Jin Hyeong-u

305
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,002
for publicizing facts
about my alleged crime.

306
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,924
He'll be the first prosecutor
to be indicted and prosecuted

307
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,427
for publicizing facts
about an alleged crime.

308
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,304
-Mr. Jin.
-Do you admit to it?

309
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,263
Is it true?

310
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,973
-Tell us the truth.
-Just a comment!

311
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,107
I'll doze off with my eyes open.

312
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,943
Professor Jung Dae-hyeon's lectures
are like sleeping pills.

313
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,278
Just take them online.

-What's going on?

00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,661
-Hey, look.
-What is happening?

317
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,288
Why is he here?

CRIMINAL CODE

319
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,719
Kim Cheol-su, a student,

320
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,639
went to the restroom
while out on a date with his girlfriend.

321
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,560
Upon returning, he witnessed Park
sexually assaulting his girlfriend.

322
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,314
So he punched him in the face
and told him to let her go.

323
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,609
Insisting that he did not
sexually assault her,

324
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,945
Park argued with Kim
and punched him in the end.

325
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,950
Park continued to play innocent,
and Kim punched him back out of anger.

326
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,661
They were both charged with assault.

327
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,205
Kim insisted that he had acted
in self-defense, but…

328
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,463
You over there, in sunglasses.

329
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,551
I'm sorry. I've got a sty.

330
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,844
The Court's decision?

331
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,761
Pardon?

332
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,932
Well, the Supreme Court…

333
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,268
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,354
I came unprepared thinking
Prof. Jung was giving the lecture.

335
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,647
You didn't do the reading?

336
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,359
I was going to do it,
but you suddenly got arrested.

337
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,903
So you thought you didn't have to do it.

338
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,157
Then you shouldn't be here. Get out.

339
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,366
Professor Yang.

340
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,410
If you didn't do the reading, get out.

341
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,833
He's even scarier
now that he's been stabbed.

342
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,876
-Professor.
-Sol A.

343
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,460
The Supreme Court's decision?

344
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,378
Pardon?

345
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:29,467
Oh, they didn't accept Kim's claim
that he had acted in self-defense.

346
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,385
Why not?

347
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,262
They concluded that it was a fight.

348
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,264
Why can't a fight be ruled self-defense?

349
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,310
Self-defense is a countermeasure
against unfair harm done to oneself,

350
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,896
whereas a fight is a forcible encounter.

351
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,814
He was trying to save his girlfriend.

352
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,983
Isn't it a permissible act
of self-defense?

353
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,654
Then Kim Cheol-su should have--

354
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,990
He should've stopped
after punching Park once.

355
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,535
-Why is that?
-Because the act of punching Park back

356
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,289
in retaliation
is considered an act of self-defense

357
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,000
and an attack at the same time.
It's mutual combat.

358
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,127
Is that right?

359
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,469
Do you really think so?

360
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,479
Only the first time he punched Park
is considered an act of self-defense?

361
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,314
And the sexual assault stopped?

362
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,398
Yes.

363
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:29,194
After that,
they argued and got into a fight.

364
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,447
-Said the Court. What about you?
-Sorry?

365
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,532
I think…

366
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,912
to not be seen as mutual combat…

367
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,958
Kim shouldn't have fought back.
Then he could've sued him for assault.

368
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,087
You seem annoyed.

369
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,341
I'll try to understand
the Court's decision.

370
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,261
You should question it
instead of trying to understand it.

371
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,804
Pardon?

372
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,060
He'll be the first prosecutor
to be indicted and prosecuted

373
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,354
for publicizing facts
about an alleged crime.

374
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,606
-Mr. Jin.
-Do you admit to it?

375
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,275
-Can we have your comment?
-Please.

376
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,609
Just a comment, please.

377
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,986
-Do you admit to it?
-Do--

378
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,533
I won't ask twice.

379
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,035
Did you push him on purpose?

380
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,290
Will you let me go if I tell you?

381
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:24,958
What?

382
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,751
I've got class.

383
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,800
The Supreme Court's decisions
can be overturned.

384
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,510
Don't just complain about it.

385
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,430
Question it and persevere
until you find the answer.

386
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,767
Han Joon-hwi.

387
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,195
As you're all probably aware,
Joon-hwi and I

388
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,073
are suspects in the murder
of Professor Seo Byung-ju.

389
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,369
They say I made him overdose,
and Joon-hwi pushed him down the stairs.

390
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,038
Let's say that's a fact.

391
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,166
If he died from a brain hemorrhage
caused by a fall,

392
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,043
what should our charges be?

393
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,421
It'll depend on whether
what Joon-hwi did was intentional.

394
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,840
-If it was an accident?
-Negligence causing death.

395
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,383
As for you, attempted murder.

396
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,302
-If he died of an overdose?
-Murder.

397
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,013
For Joon-hwi,
negligence causing bodily harm.

398
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,223
It cannot be prosecuted
if the victim objects.

399
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,517
The deceased victim
can't demand your punishment,

400
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,394
so you won't be charged.

401
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,022
-If he died of an overdose?
-Seriously?

402
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,231
He won't be charged?

403
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,609
That is not true.

404
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,072
It doesn't mean I'll only be indicted
if the victim

405
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,990
wishes to press charges against me.

406
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,494
It means I'll be let off if the victim
doesn't want me to be charged.

407
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,664
In fact, due to the absence of the victim…

408
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,291
EXPRESSION OF UNWILLINGNESS

409
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,667
…I'll be charged regardless.

410
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,877
TO PUNISH

411
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,961
You still got it.

412
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,423
I need your consent
for the next assignment.

413
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,135
Put yourself in the prosecutor's shoes

414
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,013
and determine which one of us
is more suspicious

415
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,307
based on legal principles and evidence.

416
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,728
I've already uploaded all the materials
you'll need, but keep in mind

417
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,271
they're confidential documents.

418
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,898
CRIMINAL CODE

419
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,691
-Seriously?
-I can't believe this.

420
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,325
Compare the two?

421
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,828
Nothing can faze Yangcrates.

422
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,787
He's invincible.

423
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,956
Negligence charges can be dropped?

424
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,165
It's not just an injury.

425
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,500
But it lacks intent.

426
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,211
If you inflicted bodily injury,
it was intentional.

427
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,547
But it probably wasn't intentional.

428
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,923
CIVIL CODE

429
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,634
CIVIL CODE

430
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,345
CIVIL CODE

431
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,222
Oh, dear.

432
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,767
You all look frazzled, like zombies.

433
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,562
Clearly, Yangcrates is back.

434
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:55,024
I'm sorry, but I do need to talk to you
about your marks.

435
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,236
I've e-mailed it to you individually,

436
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,866
so make an appointment to see me
in my office.

437
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,159
-Okay?
-Yes, ma'am.

438
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,910
All right, let's begin.

439
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,830
Seven million dollars!

440
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:13,042
A little mistake led to a massive loss.

441
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,504
Let's first go over this damage case
that took place in the US.

442
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,175
-I thought you'd be crying somewhere.
-This happened

443
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:24,345
-I'd rather get kicked out and breathe.
-at an American dairy company in 2014.

444
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,806
The employees who were in charge
of shipping out…

445
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,266
So what's the assignment?

446
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,185
They sued the company

447
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,313
for unpaid wages…

448
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,695
"Do not disgrace
the scales of Lady Justice."

449
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,658
That's what your uncle told me

450
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,869
when I met him for the first time
as a probie.

451
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,291
Prosecutors punish those
who have committed criminal acts.

452
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,210
CONVERSATION WITH A PROSECUTOR

453
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,129
More accurately speaking,
a prosecutor's job

454
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,759
is to make sure no one is left
feeling wronged by enforcing the law.

455
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,969
Isn't he a hotshot prosecutor?

456
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,639
He even put a business magnate
behind bars.

457
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,681
Whose dad is he?

458
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,645
"Once a bad person, always a bad person."

459
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,898
To not fall prey
to such bias or prejudice,

460
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,191
she wears a blindfold.

461
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,860
To create a world where
"one law for the rich

462
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,363
and another for the poor"
is simply not allowed,

463
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,824
she holds this sword.

464
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,120
When someone breaks the law,
even if it's the president,

465
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,499
your teacher, or your family,
it shouldn't matter.

466
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,210
Put the person on this scale

467
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:41,965
so he or she can be punished fairly
according to the law.

468
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,677
HAN JOON-HWI

469
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,054
That is a true prosecutor.

470
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,647
"Be fair…

471
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,025
so no one will be left feeling wronged."

472
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,237
That's what my uncle said…

473
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,659
but he covered up the accident
and wronged the victim even after death.

474
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,710
You should've caught him.

475
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,048
When he deemed Lee Man-ho feebleminded,
you should've caught on.

476
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,343
You should've suspected him
when he insisted the bribe was a gift.

477
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,932
If only he had been arrested…

478
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:42,942
Did I do it?

479
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,454
Turn yourself in.

480
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,289
Get out of my way.

481
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,629
Why don't you just kill me?

482
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,177
EMERGENCY NUMBER

483
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,471
Just kill me!

484
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,139
Turn yourself in now!

485
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:22,982
Uncle.

486
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,110
Uncle!

487
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,574
911.

488
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,951
-Is this 911?
-Please speak.

489
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,994
I'm at Hankuk Law's mock court.

490
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,580
My professor fell down the stairs
and went unconscious.

491
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,706
Is he breathing?

492
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,375
One second.

493
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,210
-Uncle.
-Hello?

494
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,765
Uncle, are you all right?

495
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,951
Uncle.

496
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,369
Are you okay?

497
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,375
Yeah, I'm fine.

498
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,421
Just let me give this lecture.

499
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,174
You hit your head hard.
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

500
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,605
I should've just taken him
to the hospital.

FACTS ABOUT YANG JONG-HOON'S
SUSPECTED CRIME

502
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,912
FACTS ABOUT HAN JOON-HWI'S
SUSPECTED CRIME

503
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,458
Comparing who's more suspicious?

504
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,959
Isn't it so cruel?

505
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,046
You didn't know
how cruel Professor Yang was?

506
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,423
I take it back.

507
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,593
He's not really cruel.
He's awfully persistent.

508
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,472
I'd benefited from it once.

509
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,349
What do you mean?

510
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,268
If I tell you,

511
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,937
will you call me "Sis"?

512
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,526
When did it begin?

513
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,737
Had I known you had feelings for Joon-hwi,

514
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,947
I wouldn't have been so friendly with him.

515
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,575
I must've really irked you.

516
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,535
You were upset about being Sol B--

517
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,746
Not at all,
because you're no match for me.

518
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,416
So?

519
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,126
Who's more suspicious?

520
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,505
I know how you feel,
but based on evidence?

521
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,425
Overdose versus brain hemorrhage
caused by a fall.

522
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,594
If we determine
the immediate cause of death--

523
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,179
It won't be easy.

524
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,473
You don't die right away
from a hemorrhage.

525
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,266
In many cases, it takes a while.

526
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,268
Drugs too. It takes time to be absorbed.

527
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,022
Shouldn't the NFS determine
the immediate cause of death?

528
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,024
I know the director of the NFS very well.

529
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,653
Seriously, I'm not lying.

530
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,863
This case would be a headache
even for him.

531
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,825
All right.

532
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,870
I should curry favor with our future
judges, prosecutors, and lawyers.

533
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,539
Here, have some. Take a break.

534
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:26,833
Take a break.

535
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,836
Here, have some.

536
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,806
I don't bribe just about anyone.
With you two, it's more like almsgiving.

537
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,643
How do you know if these will be bribes
or alms down the road?

538
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,395
You got a 28. And you, 29.

539
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,855
I see.

540
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,567
Don't pull your hair out, though.

541
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,484
You'll go bald.

542
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,486
You don't need to pull your hair out

543
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,030
because I don't care.

544
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,910
I brought my exam notes.
Feel free to use them.

545
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,247
PRINT, COPY, BOOKBINDING

546
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,416
You don't care?

547
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,839
What do you mean?

548
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,091
The immediate cause is unknown.

549
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,719
I really don't care.

550
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,637
I care.

551
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,727
I killed him.

552
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,567

SUSPECT YANG JONG-HOON, EVIDENCE

554
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,509
The DNA test results,
which are the most reliable evidence,

555
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,637
show that the hair
found in the victim's hand

556
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,431
-belongs to Professor Yang Jong-hoon--
-Hey.

557
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,266
Just say "Professor Yang."

558
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,727
The hair belongs to Mr. Yang.

559
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,271
If he gave him coffee with sugar
because he was showing

560
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,315
symptoms of low blood sugar, it's possible

561
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,276
that he grabbed Yang's hair
during his hypoglycemic shock.

562
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,948
HAN JOON-HWI, EVIDENCE

563
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,157
MOTIVE

564
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,325
DETAILS OF CRIME

565
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,577
As for Mr. Han, the most decisive evidence

566
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,747
-is that he switched the glasses--
-How will you prove it?

567
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,083
I saw him bringing the pair
without a nose pad

568
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,502
from the scene
and hiding it in the dorm room.

569
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,004
But you didn't see him switch the glasses.

570
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,756
Only state facts.

571
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,093
Then take out the part
about him switching the glasses.

572
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,554
Joon-hwi, can't you just tell us
what you did?

573
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,391
I told you guys to only stick
to the evidence we have.

574
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,271
To be honest, I don't understand
why we have to do this.

575
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,563
I do not want

576
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,816
to put either Mr. Yang or Mr. Han
on the scales.

577
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:05,283
The issue about Joon-hwi's suspected crime
is not if he switched the glasses,

578
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,496
but if he pushed Seo
on purpose or accidentally.

579
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,085
Answer my question.

580
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,879
He tried to stop me
from calling the police,

581
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,257
then he tripped
and rolled down the stairs.

582
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,426
Hey, why are you telling us this just now?

583
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,636
You should've told us
before we let Yang go.

584
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,348
Why are you defending yourself now?
Why didn't you do this sooner?

585
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,851
The more you suspect me,

586
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,478
the less reason you'll have
to keep him detained.

587
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,690
So you did this on purpose?

588
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,611
Because you wanted
to help him get released?

589
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,542
Was it because you wanted me
to return to school soon?

590
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,887
He passed the second-round judicial exam.
Why apply to law school?

591
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,097
That punk scares me.

592
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,766
He used one sneaky trick.

593
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,563
He's about to get locked up
because of Yang Jong-hoon.

594
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,773
I can't believe

595
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,108
he made people suspect him
just to help Yang.

596
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,902
He got us good this time.

597
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,751
You can't determine
the immediate cause of death?

598
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,710
We need to know…

599
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,588
01 PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

600
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:46,133
Then which one is the most likely cause…

601
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,095
Fine, all right.

602
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,809
Why don't we consult other experts,
not just medical examiners?

603
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,062
Everyone says it's not easy
to pick one as the cause of death.

604
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,897
Jeez, what a mess.

605
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,357
Without the second autopsy…

606
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,862
There's a renowned American
forensic pathologist named Johns Patrol.

607
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,406
I'll contact him for help.

608
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,200
Why can't we figure out the cause?

609
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,953
What if we lose both of them?

610
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,830
That won't happen.

611
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,165
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

612
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,336

HEAD PROSECUTOR JIN HYEONG-U SUED

614
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,674
I saw it too.

615
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,764
Have you interviewed the accused yet?

616
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,603
You seem to be doing great.

617
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,357
Investigate the case swiftly
and thoroughly.

618
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,320
I hope you're curious as to why I'm here.

619
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,865
I have a rare blood type.

620
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,701
Recently, I donated blood
and saved a man's life.

HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

622
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,331
I wanted to see if he was alive and well.

623
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,087
Looks like he's doing very well.

624
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,219
Anyone with a conscience would never

625
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,055
deliberately sabotage someone
who saved their life.

626
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,892
For example,
trying to dig up dirt on someone

627
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,812
with a proven alibi
who has clearly turned over a new leaf.

00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,404
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

629
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,410
If you saved my life,

630
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,454
you must've had a reason.

comparing them is such a waste of time.

00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,105
Did you check your mark?

637
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,191
What? It's already out?

638
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,818
It's 97.

639
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:11,779
Way to go, Sol B.

640
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,532
I hope I didn't actually get a zero.

641
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,492
You got a 97.

642
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,702

00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,460
MOM

647
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:29,922
MOM

648
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,803
I…

649
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,097
-I got a 97?
-Hey, Sol!

650
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,058
Criminal Code! Did you see your mark?

651
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,352
Something must've gone wrong.
This can't be.

652
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,480
They didn't give you a zero
for handing it in late!

653
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,774
You won't believe this.
You got the highest mark.

654
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,985
You beat Joon-hwi and Seung-jae.

655
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,528
Did they get me and B mixed up?

656
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,323
-Did the marks get switched?
-Maybe.

657
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,576
I find it hard to believe
that Sol B got a 79.

658
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,966
MOM

659
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,009
I can't believe this.

660
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,438
Hey, your mom's calling.
She's called you seven times.

661
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,612
You should answer it.

662
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,113
It seems urgent.

663
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,582
MOM

664
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,418
MOM

665
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,671
I'm in front of the dorms.
Come out, or I'll barge in.

666
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,810
What is this?

667
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,481
Open your eyes.

668
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,232
Open your eyes and look at this!

669
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,401
You won't get an A plus.

670
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,738
You may not get an A
even if you get a 100 on your final exam!

671
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,580
You must be out of your mind.
How could you lose to your roommate?

672
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,125
You'll get a B now that you're called B?

673
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,513
HANKUK UNIVERSITY CAMPUS DIRECTORY

674
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,224
This makes no sense.

675
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,642
I know. It's crazy.

676
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:47,893
What happened?

677
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,853
-Isn't it so crazy?
-Yeah, I know.

678
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,397
-Gosh.
-How did she do it?

679
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,523
She got a 97?

680
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,108
-Gosh.
-Kang Sol A?

681
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,401
-For real?
-Darn it.

682
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,070
Seriously, I find it so hard to believe.

683
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,279
Hey, guys.

684
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:02,825
I mean, how?

685
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,284
CRIMINAL CODE

686
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,828
Got complaints about your marks?

687
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:07,955
Kang Sol A.

688
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,667
Had you not handed it in late and torn,

689
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,669
you would've gotten a 100. It's too bad.

690
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:14,795
-Pardon?
-Seriously?

691
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,088
-My gosh.
-For real?

692
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,299
-Gosh.
-It makes no sense.

693
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,677
Only one person wrote the correct answer,

694
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,429
which is "Stated facts, defamation."

695
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,139
Kang Sol A.

696
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,557
-What?
-Seriously?

697
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,434
-Why is that correct?
-No idea.

698
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,769
The school confirmed that it was false,

699
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,646
and even Joon-hwi acknowledged it.

700
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:35,190
The mock trial ruled it
a false defamatory statement.

701
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,985
I don't understand why it's a fact.

702
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,153
-Me neither.
-Totally.

703
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,988
-I don't get it.
-It makes no sense!

704
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,656
Why did you think he stated facts?

705
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,161
At first, I also wrote that it was false
but changed my answer

706
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,996
because of the comma.

707
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,247
-Comma?
-Where?

708
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,875
I noticed the comma between

709
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,544
"received a donation from B"
and "hired B as a professor."

710
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,590
-My gosh.
-It wasn't in Joon-hwi's petition.

711
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,302
The comma means
that the statements about his donation

712
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,012
and appointment are both true.

713
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,223
-My gosh.
-I didn't even notice it.

714
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,266
Darn it.

715
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,479
You failed to identify it
and correctly apply the law.

716
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,438
Any other comments?

717
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,898
-No, sir.
-Nothing?

718
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,108
Pardon? Oh, I'm sorry.

719
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,737
I assumed it'd be exactly the same
as Joon-hwi's petition,

720
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,779
so I missed it.

721
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,990
Prejudgment can be like a deadly poison.

722
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,825
-Anything else?
-Well…

723
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:30,954
I should always be alert and focused
as one comma can turn false information

724
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,456
-into facts--
-Then tell me.

725
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,250
If what A wrote is true,
should he be found guilty?

726
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:39,463
In Korea, it can be considered an offense
even if the statement

727
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,215
-is a fact--
-So is he guilty?

728
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,009
No, I wrote that
he should be found not guilty.

729
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,429
Why?

730
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,181
Article 310 of the Criminal Code.

731
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,518
Even if it's a fact-based
defamatory statement,

732
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,521
the act is not punishable
if the facts are true

733
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,272
and solely for the public interest.

734
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,899
It was for the public interest,

735
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,151
-so it is justified.
-Yes.

736
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,277
Joon-hwi, I mean…

737
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:06,448
A put up the petition demanding the school
clear suspicions surrounding

738
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,952
the donation and the hiring process
and collected signatures

739
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,663
because he was acting
in the public interest as a student--

740
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,414
He could've had a personal agenda.

741
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,458
A and B are related but were on bad terms.

742
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,545
Here's the Supreme Court's decision
on Case 98D2188.

743
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,130
"If the primary objective
was for the public interest,

744
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,217
Article 310 of the Criminal Code
cannot be ruled out

745
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,594
even if there was
a personal agenda involved."

746
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,304
So he's not guilty.

747
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,432
-Gosh.
-What the…

748
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,351
She's very smart.

749
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:44,069
How could a criminal be allowed
to write questions

750
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,947
for the Criminal Code exam
and even mark them?

751
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,033
He's still just a suspect.

752
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,243
He's not a criminal.

753
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:55,205
A professor was arrested
and charged with murder.

754
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,624
That, in and of itself,
is an utter embarrassment.

755
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,793
This exam was so important
to the students--

756
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,803
You can speak with the vice dean about it.

757
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,430
Her kid's in 1L.

758
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,058
You can speak with me.

759
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,729
Let's talk in front of the dean.

760
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,691
You don't have any power.

761
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,279
I gave Professor Yang permission
to write exam questions.

762
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,281
So you can speak with me.

763
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:35,787
Turns out no one noticed the comma.

764
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,414
Except for me!

765
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,167
Yes. I've become a celebrity
because of that comma.

766
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,794
I got the highest mark in my class.

767
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,464
Kang Byeol! I'm not lying.

768
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,342
I'll call you later.

769
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,551
Excuse me!

770
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,721
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

771
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,893
Hello, I'm a Hankuk Law student.

772
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,770
Didn't you conduct the second autopsy?

773
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,481
I told the prosecutors everything.
Excuse me.

774
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,067
Any chance that it was manipulated?

775
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,737
I heard no one can reach
the first medical examiner.

776
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:13,325
And the camera happened to break that day.
Hence, no photos or videos.

777
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,702
I saw this while doing my homework.

778
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,955
He was accused of manipulating one
10 years ago.

779
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,544
There's no way he had missed
what you found.

780
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,380
If he saw it, why did he leave it out?

781
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,091
Unless he was ordered
to frame my professor

782
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,468
for drugging the victim to death.

783
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,349
That's enough. He'd never do that.

784
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,196
CITIZENS' POLICE
FOR OUR RIGHTEOUS NATION

785
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,490
How did the interview go?

786
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,701
HAPPY CITIZENS

787
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,952
It wasn't a big deal.

788
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,997
But thanks to you, I'm "the accused" now.

789
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,417
-Did they treat you like a suspect?
-Of course not.

790
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,293
I'm a prosecutor. How dare they--

791
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,130
Drop that attitude and get with the times.

792
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:11,299
-I'll submit evidence, so you'll--
-What? Be indicted?

793
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,468
You've just been indicted.

794
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,680
I guess you haven't heard.

795
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,515
I've notified the school.

796
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,143
-You're trying too hard.
-Not really.

797
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:25,605
I bet you thought the two likely causes
of death would be a problem.

798
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,399
But you were wrong.

799
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,235
Both you and Han Joon-hwi
have been indicted.

800
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,155
As joint principal offenders.

801
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,114
JOINT OFFENDERS

802
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,949
That is one groundless conclusion.

803
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,492
It's not groundless.

804
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,871
Han Joon-hwi used such a sneaky trick
to get you out.

805
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,165
If you weren't in on it together,
why would he…

806
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,333
go to such lengths?

807
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,377
Oh, right.

808
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,464
I'm leaking info again, aren't I?

809
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,679
Everyone at the school seems shocked.

810
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:02,267
Get a lawyer who used to be
a judge or prosecutor this time.

811
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,986
The prosecution delivered
some shocking news earlier today.

812
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,907
Professor Yang and Han Joon-hwi
have been indicted

813
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,367
as joint principal offenders
in the murder.

814
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,119
Pardon me?

815
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,579
"Joint principal offenders"?

816
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,457
I'm sure you're all shocked by the news.

817
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,875
Ms. Oh.

818
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,378
I rushed to call this meeting

819
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:34,466
to inform you of the school's decision
regarding Professor Yang.

820
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,593
This indictment makes no sense.

821
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,220
They're joint offenders?

822
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,931
Are they writing a novel?

823
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:44,434
That is for the judge to decide.

824
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,896
Even with the presumption of innocence,

825
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,649
if Professor Yang continues to teach,

826
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,068
it'll lead to more unwanted problems.

827
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,196
So he'll be removed from his position.

828
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,405
-What?
-Gosh.

829
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,782
-Seriously?
-Oh, boy.

830
00:51:58,865 --> 00:51:59,991
Will that be enough?

831
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,119
Shouldn't he be fired?

832
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,996
Isn't it almost the same thing?

833
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,833
Telling him that he can't teach.

834
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,167
No, it's different.

835
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,294
He can keep his professor title.

836
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,632
He can't teach the Criminal Code course
anymore.

837
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:19,010
Professor Jung,
please continue to fill in.

838
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,597
As for Joon-hwi,
I'll have the vice dean take over.

839
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:27,269
Joon-hwi submitted his withdrawal letter
this morning.

846
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,105
"Removed"?

847
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:14,190
They were both indicted
as joint offenders.

848
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:17,360
It means they planned the murder together
from the get-go.

849
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,448
We should've seen the whole picture
instead of comparing them.

850
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,325
-This is crazy.
-My gosh!

851
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:25,869
Hey.

How dare you set foot in here?

866
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,795
Are you going to flee
now that you've been indicted?

867
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:00,964
You scumbag.

868
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,676
I can't believe you schemed
with Yang Jong-hoon.

869
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,428
"Schemed"?

870
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,517
What's going on?

871
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,977
What are you doing here?

872
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,272
Why did you cremate him?

873
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:23,820
They dug him up
for the second autopsy,

874
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,238
so burying him again was--

875
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,990
You observed the second autopsy.

876
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,325
Yes, I did.

877
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,328
Were there really signs of bleeding
in his brain?

878
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,625
I couldn't actually observe it
because it was too gruesome.

879
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,294
I fainted, so I saw nothing.

880
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,088
Go help her.

881
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,597
Because it was too gruesome?

882
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,098
Was it not just an act?

883
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,142
What are you talking about?

884
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,811
What are you implying?

885
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,863
Didn't you put on an act to give them time
to manipulate the results?

886
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,581
Come on. Hurry.

887
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,792
What are you suspicious of?

888
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,086
-You said you know the director well.
-I sure do!

889
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,670
-My gosh.
-Long time no see.

890
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:26,174
The results from the first
and second autopsies don't add up.

891
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,343
I briefly talked to them about the things

892
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,844
that I don't understand.

893
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,555
The examiner just said the usual things,
but his assistant…

894
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,849
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

895
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,228
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

896
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,789
They were photos of another corpse,
not Professor Seo.

897
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,083
That's not true.

898
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,753
The examiner recorded
this phone conversation.

899
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,964
Shall I play it in front of him?

900
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,889
I said the cause of death has to be
brain hemorrhage from a fall.

901
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,766
I never told you to whip up two causes!

902
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,101
I said it's not true!

903
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,565
What's with that glare?

904
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,400
I didn't do it.

905
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,569
It wasn't me!

906
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,200
Okay, thank you.

907
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,412
The NFS asked them
to launch an investigation,

908
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,581
so the examiner and the wife
have been booked.

909
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,375
Oh, no. Joon-hwi must be shocked.

910
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,336
It proves that he's innocent,
so he should call it even.

911
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,714
I'm impressed that you pulled this off.

912
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,716
All the digging has paid off.

913
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,802
Joon-hwi managed to clear his name,
but Prof. Yang…

914
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,763
Indictment isn't a joke.

915
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,349
Take responsibility for indicting us
as joint offenders.

916
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,811
You practically wrote a novel.

917
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,189
You should attend my lecture
on joint offenders.

918
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,488
Your charges will be dropped.

919
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,537
I've been dismissed.

WITHDRAWAL FORM

921
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,149
You didn't kill him either.

922
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,318
Is there evidence to prove it?

923
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,695
Had you been the killer,

924
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,573
you wouldn't have gotten Sol A
to check Lee Man-ho's alibi.

925
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,660
Maybe I was trying to dump it on him
because I'm the killer.

926
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,578
My alibi hasn't been proven.

927
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,205
Still, I think--

928
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,749
If there's no evidence,
it's just an assumption,

929
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:05,917
which is unlike you.

930
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,418
The sugar packet--

931
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,379
I'm glad they know you didn't take it.

932
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,468
I'm glad…

933
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:21,766
that you survived.

934
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,403
Wait, just a second.

935
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,362
Too bad.

936
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,115
I'm O Rh negative. But today, I lost

937
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,575
some of my valuable blood.

938
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,079
My blood is valuable.

939
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,624
Can you get his number?

940
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,543

941
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,052
WE NEED O RH NEGATIVE

942
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,557
Do not give it to him.

943
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:07,270
Sure, if that's what you want.

944
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,773
Okay, then will you give me
half of your inheritance?

945
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,318
I can't agree to that.

946
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,196
Then I should give him my blood.

947
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,282
I know you won't.

948
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,659
If Prof. Yang dies just like that,

949
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,370
you'd benefit more than I would.

950
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,456
You really think so?

951
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,584
You're in quite a mess yourself.

952
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,631
So I have no reason
not to donate my blood to him.

01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:22,989
PROFESSOR KANG JU-MAN

969
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,980
I bet you saw that too. I'll go see

970
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,523
-the dean tomorrow.
-Prof. Yang!

971
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,525
The one who took the laptop
is the culprit?

972
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,111
You're fired so you can't show up here
ever again.

973
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,446
You look just like her.

974
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,156
Looked like you never come home.

975
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,824
He was watching our house.

976
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:07,825
Want to talk to you.

977
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,161
I shouldn't ask though I'm curious.
It's insane.

978
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:11,996
All the suspects are here.

979
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,373
Is this why you didn't let us
read your paper?

980
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,958
I heard you'd met with Prof. Seo.

981
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,418
Why did you search that?

982
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,420
Whoever dies… I'm not scared of that.

983
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:22,256
If you did something wrong,
you should pay for it.

984
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,383
If Prof. Seo wanted to take issue with it,

985
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,219
would you have wanted to kill him?

986
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,637
Is it me this time?

987
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,641
