1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,260
Hey, come out of there you bastard!

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,500
Geum Do High's Chairman Hyeon Kang Woo

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,620
Oh my god!

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,530
We all lie.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,640
She didn't do it.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,260
In order to protect something

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,080
You're free!

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,470
There is an answer document?

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,230
Or in order to hide something.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,300
Tae Woon, you will be the winner of the math contest.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,460
X reported Tae Woon?

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,060
What are you looking at, you bastards?!

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,970
His lie was probably for the same reason.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,830
School 2017: Everyone lies.

15
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,690
Episode 7

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,830
Hyeon Tae Woon is such a bad kid.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,920
I feel so unlucky.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,580
Hey,hey, hey. There's Hyeon Tae Woon.

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,860
Why is he so confident?
How is he not ashamed?

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,570
He's so fortunate to rely on his dad for everything.
 He's such a disgrace.

21
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,840
Did X report the exact scene? X is great!

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,800
Are you crazy? What do you mean confession? What if you get caught?

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,760
I'm not confessing.

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,960
Then why are you reporting?

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,020
If not, then I have to participate in the math contest.

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,700
Is that why you did it?

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,970
Well then, do you think I did it for the public?

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,060
But then, what happened?

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,500
So...

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,870
Here. My father wanted me to give this to you.

31
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,530
Aigoo.. He didn't have to.

32
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,640
Please tell your father that I'm thankful.

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,860
Yes. I understand.

34
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,690
Mr. Principal,

35
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,960
The math contest..

36
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,560
It'll be fine as long as I memorize the answer key, right?

37
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,830
Tae Woon, you'll be the winner for the math contest anyway, so just memorize the answer key well.

38
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,490
Thank you, Mr. Principal. I'll try my best to memorize.

39
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,430
Impressive. You're definitely the X.

40
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,400
Right?

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,000
But, how are you going to deal with the consequence. Everyone is freaking out.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,300
Idiot,

43
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,870
worry about yourself.

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,650
Thi-this! What are you going to do?

45
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,710
X, this bastard, is creating more mess.

46
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,990
I think it's you, Mr. Principal, who is making a mess, not X.

47
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,660
What did you say?

48
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,620
Why are you only helping wealthy students with the math contest?

49
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,580
Students are obviously doing this because they're frustrated.

50
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,600
Are you crazy?

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,100
I guess so. How am I able to ramble without being crazy?

52
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,930
Am I crazy?

53
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,330
Try to come up with whatever solution.

54
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:18,040
Apparently the education department is raging because of the portfolio leak, and contest dishonesty.

55
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,030
The chairman would also be upset.

56
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,430
A proper admission (of guilt) and quick probation is needed.

57
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,220
Yes. I think you need to apologize for now.

58
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,940
An apology?

59
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,660
You're saying I should apologize to the students?

60
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,300
No, I'm not going to!

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,440
Excuse me, but the chairman is on his way.

62
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,620
People from the education department are also coming.

63
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,250
There are so many complaints posted on the education department website.

64
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,970
We're going to look through them carefully this time. So please understand.

65
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,340
For the school portfolio leak case, there was a mistake in the administrative procedure.

66
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,880
Not only the school portfolio case was a problem, but there are also other problems, such as the discrimination by grades, and the demerit system.

67
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,170
This time, there is even the dishonesty in the school competition. It's not a matter of just one or two incidents.

68
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:47,100
If school inspectors give private schools more autonomy, we will obtain good results at once.

69
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,900
Chairman, the school is not the place to obtain good results.

70
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,990
It is the place where student obtain grades.

71
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
How are students reacting?

72
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,830
The atmosphere is really bad. Everyone is upset.

73
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,050
First, please punish Hyeon Tae Woon. That's why I called him.

74
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,240
That's the way to relieve their anger. Group action will only make the problem worse.

75
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,140
Still..

76
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,950
I'm fine. I did wrong anyway.

77
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,810
Does that mean the math contest will be newly held?

78
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,360
It's the best to re-hold the math contest without any fraud

79
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,530
in order to relieve students' anger.

80
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,610
You can leave now. Be careful of your actions.

81
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,270
Yes.

82
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,770
But...

83
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,870
I don't think it'll relieve the anger just by punishing me.

84
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:23,410
Won't it be good to have someone higher-up taking responsibility?

85
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,260
The kids are going crazy. They might bring in their parents too.

86
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,060
You're absolutely right. If we do that,

87
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,730
If we do that, then who should be responsible?

88
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,640
The chairman ... can't take the responsibility.

89
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Myself, as the vice president, is way too weak.

90
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,940
If we do that, then who should be responsible?

91
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:57,580
Who... should take responsibility?

92
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,730
Is it someone whom we think it is?

93
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,670
Notice of discipline. 2nd Year, Hyeon O O, School service 1 week, Reason: A dishonest act in math competition.

94
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,710
He is right.

95
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,360
Impressive. I'm so shocked. This can't be possible!

96
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm so shocked in fear.

97
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,550
Wow, even Hyeon Tae Woon is receiving punishment.

98
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,640
That's such a weak punishment after something like that.

99
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,210
What is X doing? He should punish this type of students.

100
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,310
You're right.

101
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,750
Punishment Notice

102
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,600
Woah! What a scene here.

103
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,970
Right?

104
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,060
This is such a rare thing to view.

105
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,720
I wish X would do something.

106
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,830
I want X to properly punish him!

107
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,970
X? Not a prayer.

108
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,780
Even Hyeon Tae Woon received punishment. Would we be fine?

109
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,210
Don't worry. My mom said she'll take care of it.

110
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,070
Crap! The principal even gave me an award for the art contest.

111
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,870
If we're not X, then other students will begin doubting us. Would it be okay?

112
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,630
That's why we have to hurry up and catch X.

113
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,950
But Song Dae Hwi already knows we do this. Could he be X?

114
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,970
Don't worry.

115
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,140
Song Dae Hwi can never tell anyone because he needs a lot from us anyway. Never.

116
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,470
You come and go out of my hideout so naturally.

117
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,900
It's better than looking very unnatural. Drink this.

118
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,270
By the way,

119
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,190
is that really all?

120
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,180
Because you do not want to participate in the math contest?

121
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,290
I can't say ...

122
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,630
Why did I do that?

123
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:04,100
In the past, I have been doing it just to take revenge on wicked bastards for fun.

124
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,850
A person died! Why does the reputation matter to you!?

125
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,730
I'm not going to let you slide anymore! Don't ever make me look shameful!

126
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,150
And then?

127
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,690
But,

128
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,950
I thought this 'fun' I'm having might be helpful to someone.

129
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,380
Someone?

130
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,690
Well..an idiot and

131
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,160
someone annoying.

132
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,300
So refreshing.

133
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,300
This is it for the class today.

134
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,200
The math contest will be held at Classroom 1-1 for those of you participating. I wish you good luck.

135
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,190
-That's it. Have a good day!
-Yes!

136
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,870
By the way, does Hyeon Tae Woon's punishment only last for a week with just volunteering?

137
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,480
His father got his back.

138
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,550
How rude!

139
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,770
Hyeon Tae Woon probably has a reason.

140
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,000
People are so rude.

141
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,200
I knew Ra Eun Ho was not the culprit!

142
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,090
view count: 1

143
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,430
I only have one view.

144
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,880
It's not been too long since you uploaded it.

145
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,510
Still. How can only one person read it?

146
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,150
Just wait. You're so impatient.

147
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,860
But then, is drawing such fun?

148
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:19,110
Yes. I'm the happiest when I'm drawing.

149
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,240
So, I'm going to get a job where I am able to draw forever.

150
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,830
What about you? Do you not have a dream?

151
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,090
I don't have anything like that.

152
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,560
That's not it! Curve the handlebars up more!

153
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,430
No. That will ruin the balance.

154
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:48,000
Then at least change the saddle. I'm not giving anyone rides so make it short enough for just one person.

155
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,440
And engrave my initials "JK" on the gas tank.

156
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,030
This customer has quite a lot of demands...

157
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,850
Wow, this is so sick! If this goes on the market for real, this owner would buy it 100%!

158
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,320
It'll be hella expensive.

159
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,470
Hey, now. You should give me a discount! Aren't we friends?

160
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,770
In your dreams, punk.

161
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,590
- Let me look at it!
- It's not done yet!

162
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,070
I got one not long ago.

163
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,450
What was it?

164
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,380
I want to...

165
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,480
make fun of you. A lot, a lot.

166
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,700
You want to die. A lot, a lot.

167
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,890
Hey, but don't you know that saying?

168
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,890
From the moment you start having a dream, your life gets exhausting.

169
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,460
Where was it that you learned so many negative things only, high schooler?

170
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,330
Just look! You just got super exhausted that you didn't get a lot of views!

171
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:55,550
- You've got dark circles now.
- You're so negative. I do not!

172
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,800
Just look at yourself.

173
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,990
Announcement: 2nd year intramural mathelete contest first place winners are as follows

174
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,700
Woah, Song Dae Hwi!

175
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,490
As expected, in a real contest the winner is Song Dae Hwi!

176
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,300
- That's right.
- If you show them what you've got, of course you're first.

177
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,560
Thank you.

178
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,920
- President, you're awesome!
- Awesome

179
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,580
X is even awesome-er!

180
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,780
Weeds. You can pull and pull but they'll just grow back.

181
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,470
It's a pointless killing.

182
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,630
Ugh! So hot!

183
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,770
Hey!

184
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,160
If you got first place thanks to me, then you should thank me. You're as shameless as ever.

185
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,870
What to do? Your dad couldn't help you this time.

186
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,210
I should be grateful.

187
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,700
Playing with small things like numbers isn't my style.

188
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:17,230
Anyway, that world is not what your brain can adjust to.

189
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,490
Ha this bastard. You're stinging me.

190
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:26,230
Does such a great guy like yourself really need to fall to rock bottom like that?

191
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,810
Was there no other way than that?

192
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,460
What?

193
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:42,630
Kids who have nothing, like me, have to do everything themselves.

194
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,870
Otherwise, we'll get trampled over by bastards like you.

195
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,560
So that's why you did such a stupid thing.

196
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,600
Let me ask you one thing. Where did you get that master key from?

197
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,910
If you're going to ask, ask the question you really want to know:

198
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,790
Do I know what you did with that master key?

199
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,990
What the heck!

200
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,200
You two are fighting again?! Lighten up that look!

201
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,130
Why are you only picking out me? Am I a grade-schooler that always picks fights?

202
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,790
with a guy impossible to communicate with!

203
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:28,830
Pulling weeds looks like too easy of a punishment for someone caught trying to cheat.

204
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,550
A guy who's never had to pick them can't understand how hard it is!

205
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,000
Song Dae Hwi! Congrats on the math competition!

206
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,190
I knew it. Since the contest was fair and square, our student president swept up first place. You're so awesome!

207
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,550
These darn cicadas are so noisy!

208
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,880
Thanks. It's all thanks to you.

209
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,050
I'll treat you to something yummy sometime.

210
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,340
All I have left is time. I've got tons of it. I'll look forward to it!

211
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,470
- Let me know a good time.
- Sure.

212
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,070
So nice, so nice~

213
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,620
- What?
- I'm annoyed that I have to pull weeds on a hot day. Gotta problem with that?!

214
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,220
Then why did you do something like that in the first place.

215
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,800
- You... Come here and pull these.
- Why would I do that?

216
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,290
You're my senior, aren't you? A senior in weed pulling. Come show me how it's done.

217
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,270
Come here. Quickly.

218
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,470
Why? What is it?

219
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,740
You went crazy because of the heat, didn't you? You're crazy! Crazy! A lunatic!

220
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,530
- Are you insane? Have you lost your mind?
- No, no...

221
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,690
What exactly are you two?

222
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,400
What are we?

223
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,690
You and Song Dae Hwi.

224
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,600
We're nothing.

225
00:18:53,210 --> 00:19:00,170
I heard you guys used to be really close. Why are you like this now?

226
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,560
- You don't need to know.
- Did you, by chance, do all that for Dae Hwi?

227
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,770
Are you crazy? Would I do something like that for that jerk?!

228
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:20,170
I don't really know why, but for some reason, it feels like you two aren't actually fighting.

229
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,620
Rather, it just seems like because you both are hurting,

230
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,430
you're trying to tell each other to pay attention to the other.

231
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,090
What do you even know?

232
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,700
You're right. I don't know anything.

233
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,000
Congratulations.

234
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,370
I knew I can't properly beat you and your intelligence.

235
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,210
I'm sorry.

236
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:14,900
My pride hurts when you apologize. That's your ability.

237
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:22,290
Right. Is there anything I can do to help with the performance assessment?

238
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,370
Final exam.. I need to start preparing for that.

239
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,520
I'll help you with the final exam problems.

240
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,200
By the way, you told me you needed the spec for medical volunteering. Right?

241
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,470
Yes.

242
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,190
If I talk to my mom, I think I can find one for you.

243
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,230
Really? Can you really do that for me?

244
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,110
But

245
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,780
do you really have to get 1st place on the final exam?

246
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:09,160
What..does that mean?

247
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,460
My father

248
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,580
is going to kill me if I get a 2nd place again.

249
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,640
You're so well off. But do you really have to destroy yourself like that?

250
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,460
Do you not have any other way?

251
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,330
If you want anything, I can help you with one or two.

252
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,600
I'll think ... I'll think about it.

253
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,810
You're right.

254
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,820
Hey Hey Attention!

255
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,050
Why?

256
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,160
X is in our class!

257
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,450
What?

258
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,220
Sixth Sense Reversal. Ultra goosebumps!

259
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,000
I really got goosebumps!

260
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,350
Who is it?

261
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,070
I'm telling why only the school records of class 2-1were revealed.

262
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,330
That's...

263
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,220
That's the evidence that X is in that class!

264
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,760
But that's still not confirmatory evidence.

265
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,190
If you can't catch him this time, you're in trouble more than a salary reduction.

266
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,530
I'm okay for the trouble,

267
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,390
but if you keep suspecting people over evidence that isn't absolute...

268
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,610
I think it's unfair.

269
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,100
Are you crazy? Who do you think you're talking to?

270
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,880
Don't hurt innocent kids over evidence you're not sure of.

271
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,990
Truthfully, shouldn't you apologize to Ra Eun Ho?

272
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,810
I'll have to leave because of class.

273
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,820
He has certainly gone crazy.

274
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,250
He...

275
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,600
What if he's X?

276
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,640
Student President, isn't it you?

277
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,640
I mean,

278
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,470
You have the school's master key.

279
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,410
Hey, are you crazy? Isn't it you?

280
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,570
You like immature things.

281
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,870
Hey

282
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,590
He's Byeong Goo!

283
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,690
He's my friend Byeong Goo.

284
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,450
He's rich though. He even flies drones.

285
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,860
Ah, really who is it? Is X really even in our class?

286
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,250
Yoon Jae Wook, isn't it you?

287
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,850
Why do you always act cute? It's not me.

288
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,770
Then who is it?

289
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,270
Who's lying?

290
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,000
Seeing as how Tae Woon got reported, it's Song Dae Hwi, isn't it?

291
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,850
Huh?

292
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,870
Uh... no, about that...

293
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:26,030
We're sure that it has to be one of the two. Then it's Song Dae Hwi.

294
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:30,580
I think someone played a joke with that post-it note.

295
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,610
Why?

296
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,730
I don't think it's either of them.

297
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,220
I think you know.

298
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,160
No! I don't know...really.

299
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,420
You really don't know?

300
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,140
Who's X?

301
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,230
Yeah. I haven't found him yet.

302
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:00,040
I'm already cleared of being suspected. I was thinking of not looking for him anymore.

303
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,020
Hey. I'll leave.

304
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,450
Those two keep sticking together lately.

305
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,800
What should we do? Why is it narrowed down to our class?

306
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,920
Because the school records of only our class was posted.

307
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,870
Did you expect this?

308
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,400
I didn't think of it at all.

309
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,130
I knew, but I didn't think they would find out through this.

310
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,180
You acted effectively.

311
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,410
What should we do?

312
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,350
If we get caught this time, we're really accomplices.

313
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,070
What should we do, Ra Eun Ho?

314
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,290
I know.

315
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,320
If we get caught this time, it's really the end for us.

316
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,850
We're in huge trouble.

317
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,620
I will bite you.

318
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,140
A big harm?

319
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,290
He should secretly film the principal doing bad things, and give him demerits the same way we are.

320
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,930
If he made this into a video, don't you think it'd be really funny?

321
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,340
Ra Eun Ho is X...

322
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,320
Then her reported relationship with Tae Woon should worsen.

323
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,840
Why does the chain keep getting broken?

324
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,730
How much your legs are powerful, so the chains can't stand and are broken?

325
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,830
- Do you want to die?
- Oh? What are you doing?

326
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,550
Do you want to die?
Do you want to die? Oh, your arm strength isn't a joke!

327
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,700
Hey, what about my arm?

328
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,360
What is this over-exaggerated skinship?

329
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,180
Hey, leave. Quickly leave.

330
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,260
What?

331
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,360
Go inside!

332
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,580
Hey, student. Get off.

333
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,280
- Who is he?
- Just someone.

334
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,260
I'm her brother. Quickly get off.

335
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,670
Ah, hello.

336
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,960
Motorcycle. Your wealth is okay.

337
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,020
Oh, good. Alright.

338
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,320
Your physical strength seems okay too.

339
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:47,930
As a man, I'm really curious about something...

340
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,760
Do you not look at a girl's face?

341
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,500
Do you not look at her personality either? I mean, why? What do you see in this?

342
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,470
- Go. Leave!
- You see that?

343
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,030
Hey, thanks. Go first.

344
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,730
- Hey, student!
- Leave!

345
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,490
- So what I want to ask is...
- Leave!
- Why do you not look at a girl's face?

346
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,170
- Why are you doing this?
- You'll regret this later!
- No, you'll regret this!

347
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,540
Go. Just go.

348
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,960
Thanks!

349
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,970
I look at a girl's face a lot though.

350
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,200
Mom! Mom, Mom!

351
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,160
Madam Yoon. Your daughter has a boyfriend.

352
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,660
- What?
- I told you it's not like that!

353
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,650
Anyway, he seems rich. Why don't we take this opportunity and have her married off?

354
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,800
Why do you throw anchovies?

355
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,720
Where did you fool around and get drunk again?

356
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,000
Uh? Side dishes are flying over.

357
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,570
Ah, our daughter!

358
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,700
You're attending the webtoon academy well, right?

359
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,960
Of course I am!

360
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,440
Don't you need anything else?

361
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,340
There's a summer vacation special program. Just for a month.

362
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,300
Never mind. It's too expensive.

363
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,120
Do it. Do it.

364
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,190
No! It's really expensive.

365
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,530
I will send you there!

366
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:25,100
I will! Our daughter just needs to study hard.

367
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,990
I will take care of everything else, got it?

368
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,850
You take care of yourself.

369
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:38,260
Dad will pay, ok?

370
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,130
What work is he doing? His body is covered with pain patches.

371
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,220
You're living diligently.

372
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,360
I know right.

373
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,100
But is X really in our class?

374
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,730
Huh?

375
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,030
Uh... who knows?

376
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,890
If I know who it is, I would help them.

377
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,570
As you know, I owe X.

378
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,630
Eh, it's a given...

379
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,340
is what X would think, right?

380
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,790
I guess so.

381
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,050
X seems like a good person.

382
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,330
Of course.

383
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:23,720
What are you listening to? Are you listening to music?

384
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,820
Do you want to listen?

385
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,690
Oh, sure.

386
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,270
♫ Our summer days are flashing by ♫

387
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,270
♫ In between the spilling sunlight ♫

388
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:53,900
♫ When I think of you, my heart jumps ♫

389
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,700
♫ The sky is dazzlingly blue ♫

390
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,940
♫ The trees are dancing outside of the window ♫

391
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,970
♫ While I'm looking at your profile next to you♫

392
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,400
♫ I smile ♫

393
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,960
♫ Everything I wish for and want to happen ♫

394
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,410
♫ Everything precious I wish would last forever ♫

395
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,890
♫ Like the blue sky in the distant future ♫

396
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,940
♫ Will we remember the summer of our youth? ♫

397
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,920
Was your boyfriend always that kind?

398
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,270
I know right. I'm seeing that for the first time too.

399
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,620
I have something to say.

400
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,000
What? Say it here.

401
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,290
I want to say it between just the two of us.

402
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,410
What do you have to say?

403
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,200
What kind of flower do you like?

404
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,770
What? That's what you're curious about?

405
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,410
Yeah.

406
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,020
What are you doing?

407
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,430
I'm listening to music. Why!

408
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,300
Turn it down, someone's going to hear!

409
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,910
I don't want to! I always listened to music like this. I don't use earphones, that's tacky!

410
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,020
Ah, really! Are you seriously crazy?

411
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,270
The song's good, huh!

412
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,730
Why are you like this!

413
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,770
Suspension?

414
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,210
We'll have an investigation from the Education Office.

415
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,190
If you rest for a bit, I will bring you back to school after everything's over.

416
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:20,500
Anyway, we need to prove that we have the determination to reform and reflect.

417
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,730
But I'm still the Principal!

418
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,780
Didn't you always say this?

419
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,830
That even we need a sacrificial lamb, we should solve the problem.

420
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:38,240
This is the moment. Please take the lead. Be the lamb, the sacrificial lamb.

421
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,110
Please consider it as a short break for the big goal.

422
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,950
Doesn't someone have to take responsibility?

423
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,710
How is it? X?

424
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,800
How about it?

425
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,760
Hey hey hey!

426
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,330
Hey

427
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,880
A Harvest of autumn water dropwort.
 (Water Dropwort is ax extremely poisonous plant)

428
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,460
What is he saying?

429
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:07,180
Guys! The Principal was fired!

430
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,240
- Really?
- What?

431
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,600
Discrimination in grades, revealing the school records. All were reported. So he is fired.

432
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:20,960
Then X reported it even to the Education Office? Daebak!

433
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,400
He did great job

434
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,500
Wait a minute.

435
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,660
Principal Yang Do Jin

436
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,950
Hey. Why do you put it on?

437
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,950
When a person changes, the nameplate is the first thing that's changed.

438
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,150
The acting principal, Assistant Principal Pak Myung Deok

439
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,050
You look like someone who has waited for this for a long time.

440
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,780
I swear to the sky. I'm not the person who clings to the position.

441
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,360
What's this situation aw.

442
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:10,210
Luckily you're being suspended. A room for you is ready.

443
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,070
Rest peacefully after a long time.

444
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,210
Long time continue forever.

445
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,410
I really wanted to do this while sitting in this seat.

446
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,520
It's fun as I expected.

447
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,220
Ah the picture frame of principal on the hallway.

448
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,440
Remove it immediately and put it where you think it's a remote corner.

449
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,410
But it's still the Principal's face...

450
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,800
Not right now.

451
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,170
Where there's no tiger, the fox is the king.

452
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,300
See how he is.

453
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,810
"Don't kick ashes from briquettes carelessly with your foot" (Poem 'I ask you' by poet Ahn Do Hyun)

454
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,960
"Have you ever been fiery for somebody else"

455
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,320
"Once in your life?" Oh it's hot.

456
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,950
You? Who do you think you're speaking informally to?

457
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,610
I'm not speaking informally though. I was reciting the poem we learned today.

458
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:35,830
Principal! It's heavy, let me carry it.

459
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:41,440
The evidence just had to point at you of all people as the culprit.

460
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,070
I know right, right at you.

461
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:50,040
'The school morals have fallen to the ground', isn't it?

462
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,520
Class 2-1. Catch the X or whatever

463
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,360
And this final exam. Be prepared if you don't get a good grade.

464
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,980
You should be prepared.

465
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,460
Move!

466
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,220
X this punk!

467
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,110
I'm not going to leave you alone!

468
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,830
How can you not look even once?

469
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,980
Huh? Ah, sorry.

470
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,730
Aren't you hungry? It's already dinner time.

471
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,050
Time really went by fast.

472
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,800
What are we going to eat for dinner?

473
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:24,250
Dinner? Sorry, but today is a bit...

474
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,560
You have to study today, huh? And study tomorrow too.

475
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,060
Nam Joo...

476
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,120
It's okay. I have plans too.

477
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,100
I'll leave first.

478
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,950
No clothes for us here.

479
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,380
Don't just stay at school all the time.

480
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,570
Try the shoes

481
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,250
Let's go

482
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,660
I'll come back later

483
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,430
Thank you.

484
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,350
Have a good day.

485
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,700
Please show your card.

486
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,640
You're a VVIP here too, right? Use your card.

487
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:38,540
I forgot my card wallet today too.

488
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,600
Didn't you say you forgot it last time too?

489
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,450
You also forgot today too.

490
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,490
We can permit you with your names. What are your names?

491
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,180
Yoo Bit Na.

492
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,560
You're checked. Yoo Bit Na. I will let you enter.

493
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,760
Are you a member too?

494
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,350
You said your mother is a member here too.

495
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,900
But if I get caught coming here...

496
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,620
My grades dropped so I was banned from shopping.

497
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,220
Would your mom find out? We're just entering.

498
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,930
I'll just leave.

499
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,370
I have a massage appointment too.

500
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,650
Really? Which massage shop? Let's go together.

501
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,030
Huh?

502
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,390
What is this?

503
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:51,080
You're here? Look at this. Someone threw this new thing away.

504
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,090
You're in your third year now, so I thought you might need it.

505
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,150
Did I say I need stuff like that?

506
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:03,050
Are you a beggar? Why are you picking up something someone else threw away!

507
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,830
It's not like that.

508
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,090
So dirty.

509
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,060
Alright, alright. I won't take it.

510
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,820
Here. I won't take it.

511
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:25,170
But daughter... everything's fine with that friend, right?

512
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,190
Nothing special happened, right?

513
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,230
As expected from my daughter's boyfriend, he's really handsome!

514
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,560
So why did you come to school? To give such a piece of bread?

515
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,080
Nam Joo. That's what you like!

516
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,180
I'm so embarrassed I could die.

517
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,080
Why are you always living like this?

518
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,560
Why don't you live nicely like other parents? Why are you always untidy?

519
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,040
I'm annoyed to death.

520
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,750
Nam Joo!

521
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:17,030
Kids these days are really hard, huh?

522
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,860
Many problems were reported.

523
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:27,160
Our committee is thinking of inspecting very carefully.

524
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:27,940
Of course!

525
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,270
There won't be as many problems as you think.

526
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,310
My pen!

527
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,290
What are you doing?

528
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:59,260
You took my notebook last time too, didn't you take my pen as well?

529
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,930
Do you know how much it costs?

530
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,990
I don't know, I didn't take it so give it back.

531
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,430
Give it back!

532
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,040
Ah, really!

533
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,270
- Where did it go?
- Hey.

534
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,810
Put my things back immediately.

535
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,770
You've got to be kidding me.

536
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:21,660
Where did you hide it? Where did you put it!

537
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,720
I told you I didn't take it.

538
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,670
- You hid it!
- I didn't hide it!

539
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,860
- You took it!
- I told you I didn't take it!

540
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,980
I think you took it!

541
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,630
I told you I didn't take it!

542
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,520
Where did you take it!

543
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,120
Give it back!

544
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,620
It's really expensive!

545
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,540
Let go! I said let go!

546
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,030
Hey!

547
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:43,290
Hey! What are you girls doing?

548
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,180
Seo Bo Ra and Yoo Bit Na, won't you two stop!

549
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,260
- Let go.
- Quickly give it back!

550
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,620
I told you I didn't take it!

551
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,050
You took it!

552
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,200
Tell me!

553
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,750
What are you guys doing!

554
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,260
Blood?

555
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,120
We'll have to proceed to looking into school violence right away.

556
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,280
School violence is what should be reported as soon as it is witnessed.

557
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,350
I know it. But it is a simple incident in the kids' process of growing up.

558
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:19,960
Follow me quickly. Right now!

559
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:34,750
Bo Ra. Look at me.

560
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,070
Did you hit Bit Na first?

561
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,970
I told you she did, why do you keep asking her only?

562
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:48,960
I've heard your side enough. I need to hear Bo Ra's side too.

563
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,890
Bo Ra. Is Bit Na telling the truth?

564
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:58,640
No. She pulled my hair first.

565
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,150
When did I do that!

566
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:08,960
Teacher Jang. Did you really not see?

567
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,010
I told you earlier.

568
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,930
I saw, but not from the beginning.

569
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:20,780
When I saw, Bo Ra wasn't only being hit.

570
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,690
But could you say more accurately?

571
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,910
I don't know. I didn't see!

572
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:31,430
Why are you like this to me?

573
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:44,070
I got it for now. Go back to your classes.

574
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,690
Don't fight again.

575
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,450
I'm asking you a favor.

576
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,200
Teacher Jang.

577
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,590
Why?

578
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,160
You probably already know this since you were their homeroom teacher for first year,

579
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,150
but Bo Ra isn't the kind of kid to hit someone first.

580
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,700
She has a quiet personality too.

581
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,120
How do I know that?

582
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,380
What?

583
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:43,120
How do I know if she's just quiet in front of others but violent secretly?

584
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,780
Still, if you look at how she acts on a normal basis...

585
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:52,060
Even the parents don't know their children. And I'm not even their mom.

586
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,930
Why did they have to fight in front of me of all people!

587
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,640
Don't misunderstand.

588
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,820
What did you say?

589
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:20,010
Would I really ask you for help again?

590
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,440
What I had to go through that time was more than enough for me.

591
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,150
You!

592
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,080
Look at how you're speaking.

593
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,580
I don't expect anything from you.

594
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,140
So don't worry, wondering what you're going to do if I ask you for help again.

595
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:39,390
Don't make that kind of expression because that's not going to happen.

596
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:10,800
I just want the person who did wrong to apologize.

597
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:17,060
And that the other friend would accept it. I want that to happen.

598
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,590
But from some day, that became hard.

599
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,490
I'll say that I hit her then.

600
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,690
What?

601
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,560
I'll be the offender.

602
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,880
Bo Ra.
What's the point of opening an investigation?

603
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,090
Yoo Bit Na's mom is going to bring in an expensive lawyer.

604
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:36,240
I can't win anyways. My household doesn't have that kind of money.

605
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,410
Listening to that side only just because of the lawyer-

606
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,560
Teacher. I can leave, right?

607
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,190
Huh?

608
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,020
Your expression isn't looking too good.

609
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,550
Ah, Teacher.

610
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:11,270
Is something wrong?

611
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:18,920
Why does my class never have a peaceful day?

612
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,720
Friends fight with each other.

613
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,460
They even pair up to trespass in the Teacher's Office.

614
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,620
They pair up to trespass in the Teacher's Office?

615
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,760
You definitely heard something that night, right?

616
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,420
Yes.

617
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,600
So about that...

618
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,890
What do we do? It's our Homeroom Teacher!

619
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,440
What do you mean what do we do? Shut up!

620
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:59,730
There were two people. One was a girl, one was a boy.

621
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:08,680
They seem like kids from my class, but I can't tell the school. I'm dying from debating about it.

622
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:15,820
We have to find them. We should ask them why they did that when we find them.

623
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:21,860
But if it was a girl from Class 2-1, honestly, wouldn't it be Ra Eun Ho?

624
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,690
Why Eun Ho?

625
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:29,340
Don't you remember? At that time, at the backyard, behind the warehouse.

626
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,460
He definitely ran this way! Didn't you see?

627
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,050
Go this way.

628
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:51,370
We had a lot on our minds at that time, so we just listened to Ra Eun Ho and ran, but that area was very wide.

629
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:58,230
Rather than X running away, it makes more sense that Ra Eun Ho hid him.

630
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:06,260
I felt suspicious, so I kept an eye on her. But couldn't find any suspicious evidence.

631
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,990
But it still won't be Eun Ho.

632
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:13,660
Even when she was accused, she was so desperate. It won't be her.

633
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,970
She could have done it without a choice.

634
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:22,410
Because he might have some kind of situation.

635
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,560
Ah, awesome!

636
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,480
Hey you're noisy.

637
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,830
A comment was posted!

638
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:45,130
'It's funny' Ah, they said it was funny!

639
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,620
They must like immature things.

640
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,830
He really...

641
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:54,010
My number one fan. I will post a reply.

642
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,920
What are you doing?

643
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,120
Don't tie it. Don't tie your hair.

644
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,490
Why are you like this? It's neater for me to do work.

645
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,090
Go around like this.

646
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:28,430
Cover your face and do this.

647
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,300
This is pretty. Oh, it's pretty.

648
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,660
Why is he like this!

649
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,330
Ah, come in.

650
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:00,030
It seems to be very noisy over there.

651
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,010
Since they are high-spirited teenagers, they are a bit so.

652
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:09,890
A bit... do you really think it's just a bit?

653
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:10,740
What?

654
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,990
Breaking into the teacher's office, hacking into the Principal's ID,

655
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:20,440
School vandalism, vehicles damage are a bit?

656
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,520
The chairman seems to be suffering.

657
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,750
He is my close friend. I am ashamed to see him.

658
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:30,820
I'm looking for him.

659
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,430
Wrap it up quickly.

660
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:36,850
It seems like an average student's prank. Doesn't it hurt your pride?

661
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:43,100
That... If it's done rashly, it can scar young kids...

662
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:46,850
Is it because it reminds you of your past?

663
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,040
No.

664
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,070
Find him quickly.

665
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,660
The chairman is planning to request an formal investigation.

666
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:15,870
If the student is caught like that, it would be difficult to defend him.

667
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,780
Excuse me, Teacher.

668
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,370
I have something to tell you.

669
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,850
Hm?

670
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,890
I should ask the kid with circumstantial evidence only.

671
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,850
But what if that kid...

672
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:45,720
So you're worried they'll be hurt is what you're saying.

673
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,900
Yes. But there is a reason why I suspect her.

674
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,600
I can't ignore that as a police officer.

675
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,630
It's a really simple problem.

676
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,280
What?

677
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:05,320
Follow the rules.

678
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:10,760
The more complicated, hard, and confusing a problem is,

679
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,290
you should still follow the rules.

680
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,880
If you follow the rules without being swayed until the end,

681
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,680
that is the only way you will find out if you were right or wrong, if you made a mistake,

682
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,780
If you made mistake, where you did. You will be able to figure everything out.

683
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:40,830
No matter what, say that the Principal offered to you first. Say that you didn't know anything.

684
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:41,550
Yes.

685
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:47,320
If the discipline is given, show your remorse cl definitively, so that no one complain.

686
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,410
Yes.

687
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,380
Do you have a problem?

688
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,340
It would have been nice if she tied her hair back.

689
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,180
Tae Woon looks great

690
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,490
with demerits and discipline punishment!

691
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,620
Then should I share it with you? Huh?

692
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,560
Ra Eun Ho.

693
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,990
We need to talk.

694
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,710
Why did you go into the office that day?

695
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,540
That...

696
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:47,710
There's evidence so nothing's going to be solved by hiding it.

697
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:51,630
You didn't come by yourself that day, right?

698
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:00,330
I'm asking you again.

699
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:06,420
Who went to the office with you that day? Who was the male student!

700
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:28,320
I... can't tell you.

701
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:41,850
If you don't tell us who went with you,

702
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:46,890
you will have to take full responsibility and leave this school!

703
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,650
There's a witness and the evidence is solid.

704
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,840
I would like you to tell the truth, Eun Ho.

705
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,170
You've worked hard, Teacher.

706
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,790
Yes, you've worked hard too.

707
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:17,200
Hey, Ra Eun Ho.

708
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,300
What did they say?

709
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:32,650
It seems like we were caught going into the office that day.

710
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:37,050
But they don't seem to know if it was you or Song Dae Hwi.

711
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:39,330
Then what did you say?

712
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:43,040
That I couldn't tell them, of course.

713
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:50,810
You should have said that you were with me or Song Dae Hwi!

714
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,460
Are you crazy? You'll be expelled this time!

715
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,280
If you get caught, you can't get out of it at all!

716
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:03,190
How can I do that? You and Song Dae Hwi will be dead if you get caught too.

717
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,670
Hey dummy. So you're going to die to save us?

718
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:16,190
I'm frustrated too.

719
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:20,570
So don't push me.

720
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:29,330
Forget it. You stay still.

721
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,860
What are you going to do?

722
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,820
I'll take care of it.

723
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:56,850
Did she do it by herself? How is she the avengers?

724
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:59,030
She didn't do it.

725
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:07,770
Kids like me who don't have anything have to do everything by ourselves.

726
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:11,250
If we don't want to be stepped on by jerks like you.

727
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,360
Certificate of Commendation. 1st place Song Dae Hwi in Math Competition.

728
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,030
Then you should have said you were with me or Song Dae Hwi!

729
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:43,890
How can I do that?

730
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:48,250
You'll be expelled this time! If you get caught, you can't get out of it at all!

731
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:21,110
Hey! What are you going to do?

732
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,420
I said I'd take care of it.

733
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,660
Take care of what?

734
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,020
Hey.

735
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,350
It's me.

736
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:49,210
What?

737
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:51,060
I said it was me.

738
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:55,290
I was the male student who went into the office with Ra Eun Ho.

739
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,590
Hyeon Tae Woon!

740
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:14,510
Hyeon Tae Woon. What did you just say?

741
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:32,950
♫ I want to stay by your side. I'll only stay by your side. ♫

742
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:36,980
♫ I'll always stay by your side. I'll always protect you. ♫

743
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,340
♫ If I try to reach your tears, it becomes smoke. ♫

744
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:43,200
♫ I want to be that place where we were. ♫

745
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,430
♫ I hope the candle doesn't blow out. ♫

746
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:49,920
♫ Rock a bye baby. Rock a bye baby. ♫

747
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,200
School 2017.

748
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,820
What's wrong?

749
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,070
I really hate myself.

750
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:59,330
Stop talking about Song Dae Hwi. Don't you even feel wronged?

751
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:03,320
Bo Ra. It's your last chance. I will help you no matter what.

752
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,190
You can just report me. Why are you guys taking the blame?

753
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,220
Stop it, jerk.

754
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:11,740
Don't worry. I won't break down from something like this.

755
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:15,690
I'm sorry. I don't think I considered how you felt.

756
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:16,830
It's not true, right?

757
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,890
About what?

758
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:20,110
Are you sure you won't regret it?

759
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,700
♫ Before it's broken any more. ♫
