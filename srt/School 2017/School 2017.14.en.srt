1
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,650
What is with this person?

2
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,870
This brat! Stay still!

3
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,040
Stay still!

4
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,790
You've been caught.

5
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,970
You're busted, you rat-like punk.

6
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,760
You thought you wouldn't be caught by my hands, you punk?

7
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,440
Quickly catch him! Catch him!

8
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,490
Hey! Stop right there!

9
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,280
I'll see you in the store room.

10
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,670
Hey! Come this way! Come here!

11
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,070
- I'll go this way so you go that way!
- Yes.

12
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,070
What are you?

13
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,540
Ah, Ahjusshi, did you not see X here?

14
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,410
He went this way though.

15
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,800
X.

16
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,480
Oh. What are you doing here?

17
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,010
I was just chasing X until now-

18
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,620
Oh! Over there! It's X!

19
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,940
This way! He's over here!

20
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,980
Running around trying to catch him...

21
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,800
How about over here...

22
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,800
This way! He ran this way!

23
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,210
I found his hoodie!

24
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,390
Even just searching for X

25
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,020
is totally like X.

26
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,230
You just caught the hoodie?

27
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,700
I almost caught him.

28
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,630
He took this off and ran away.

29
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,720
Where exactly is the content under the hoodie...

30
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,550
I wanted to find him so badly like crazy...

31
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,120
You worked hard running around in the middle of the night.

32
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,050
Rest here a bit and then go.

33
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,020
Ehhh, X this bastard.

34
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,700
I should have caught him.

35
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,340
This guy...

36
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,200
But... who is he?

37
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,030
That kid over there

38
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,500
is the Chairman's son.

39
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,320
He's the mini chairman of Geumdo High.

40
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:46,120
School 2017
How to face something that went awry

41
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,450
Episode 14

42
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,550
Are you okay?

43
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,470
What about the Principal? You didn't get caught?

44
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,320
Of course I didn't.

45
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,070
I'm X, I don't get caught that easily!

46
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,880
Look at your sweat! Did you get hurt anywhere?

47
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,430
Oh. I'm ok-

48
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,320
Oh, my leg!
Your leg?

49
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,980
- Yeah.
-Why, why, why?

50
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,670
I must have sprained it.

51
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,670
Ah, really? What should I do?

52
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,320
It was fine a while ago, but the pain is incredible.

53
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,410
Pain?

54
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,080
There's no medicine here.

55
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,690
Oh.

56
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,530
Let's quickly go home.

57
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,680
But... I don't know if I can walk properly.

58
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,000
Are you okay?

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,250
Ah, it hurts.

60
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,350
- It hurts?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,490
Does it hurt a lot?

62
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,740
Should we go to the emergency room?

63
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,460
No, no. It's not that bad.

64
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:15,340
But... if your leg is hurt like this, then doesn't that mean you can't ride your motorcycle?

65
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,860
Oh?

66
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,490
I have to take you home then, right?

67
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,680
I... I guess so.

68
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm so upset.

69
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,610
Ah, really...

70
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,380
When is your dad coming? I wonder if it'll be fine tomorrow.

71
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,710
I don't know.

72
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,720
For some reason, I don't think it'll get better easily but take a long, long time.

73
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
A long time. Really?

74
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,870
Quickly go to the hospital tomorrow.

75
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,980
Okay.

76
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:07,370
But the Principal will think X is two people then, since he saw me too.

77
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,060
It does seem like he won't sit still.

78
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,060
Why did I suddenly go there? I was only worried.

79
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,010
You worried a lot?

80
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,100
Why? What kind of worry was it for you to worry that much?

81
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,630
I'm leaving.

82
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,260
Make sure you put some ice on it.

83
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,390
Why?

84
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,350
Take care.

85
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,320
You should say your greetings, girlfriend.

86
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,680
Girl...friend...

87
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,920
Girlfriend... I'm going.

88
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,080
Take care!

89
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,660
Take care!

90
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,630
It was good while I was lying, but I can't escort her out.

91
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,880
I should make use of it tomorrow too.

92
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,920
It was definitely two people.

93
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,520
This means it's certain that there's an accomplice.

94
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,610
I suspect one person to be Ra Eun Ho...

95
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:47,090
then the other... who is the other person?

96
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,360
Song Dae Hwi? He broke into the teacher's office last time

97
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,340
and stole the problems to the math competition.

98
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,210
He's suspicious...

99
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,720
is what people might think I'd think, but Song Dae Hwi is a fake!

100
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,350
Last time when X appeared, Song Dae Hwi and Hyun Tae Woon were definitely in the warehouse.

101
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,720
X appeared!
Quickly catch him!

102
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,980
Excuse me, hold on.

103
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,930
What are you guys?

104
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:21,420
We just wanted to study quietly ourselves. This is a study room.

105
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,830
To hide X's identity, they used Song Dae Hwi as a fake!

106
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,840
That's what I'm saying.

107
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,660
Rather than being a principal,

108
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,980
Doesn't a detective suit me better?

109
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:43,420
Now that the Principal is sure that there are two people involved, he's going to be acting more meticulously.

110
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,630
X should be careful for the time being.

111
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,700
Eun Ho, you'll get in big trouble if you get caught this time.

112
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,120
That's true...

113
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,590
Because of the cafeteria incident, I think all the expired food has now been thrown out.

114
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,050
Makes sense. The cafeteria food lately has been improving, too.

115
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,270
Well... why don't we wait and see for now?

116
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,760
It's too much to keep going this way. Our budget is set, but to keep cafeteria food at that level is...

117
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,370
Am I crazy to keep putting out that kind of standard?

118
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,880
Since we calmed them down, we should go back to the way it always was.

119
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,980
That's how we can get our unit cost down.

120
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,500
I understand.

121
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,150
Then like before, we'll lower the quality of ingredients, poor or without any nutrition...

122
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,240
Secretly, so that no one will notice.

123
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,740
Are you okay?

124
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,230
Ah, of course. It was nothing for me.

125
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,530
Haha, your timing, really...

126
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,200
Are you crazy? This is school!

127
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,120
So?

128
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,710
There are other kids. What are we going to do if rumors spread?

129
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,900
Do what? I'll be happy! I want to grab each and every one of them and spread the rumors.

130
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,500
You really-

131
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,610
What are you doing? What are you two doing?

132
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,820
What are we doing? What should we do? What could this be?

133
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,030
Are you crazy?

134
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,040
Hey! Why can't we let rumors spread?

135
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,640
I ought to let rumors spread so that those punks who confess to you can't even dream about it!

136
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,990
If they find out about our relationship, we're totally stuck. If your father finds out...

137
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,580
Stuck? Oh... right...

138
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,080
- Stuck. Rumor?
- No...

139
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,770
Byeong! My amigo! Come here!

140
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,770
- Amigo! Come over here!
- No, don't worry about it! You can just go!

141
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,680
- Just go.
Oh!
- Oh, are you okay?

142
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,130
Yea, I'm okay!

143
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,210
- Byeong Goo, don't go!
Let's talk.

144
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,640
Turn around.

145
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,380
Hey, let's go get some orange juice.

146
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,160
- Hey, did you hear the rumor?
- What rumor?

147
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,460
Ra Eun Ho got a boyfriend! So if you know this rumor, spread it.

148
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,230
Ra Eun Ho's boyfriend? I already heard about that rumor.

149
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,620
You heard? About Ra Eun Ho's boyfriend?

150
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,190
Yea. That rumor spread a lot already.

151
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,230
It's that guy who left the note on her wall poster earlier, isn't it?

152
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,090
No, Byeong Goo!

153
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:38,030
Her boyfriend isn't him. Ra Eun Ho's boyfriend is-

154
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,060
Do you want to die?

155
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,470
Let's talk.

156
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,590
No, I don't want to.

157
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,960
Oh! Your leg!

158
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,060
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

159
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,530
It must have temporarily... gotten better... or not?

160
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,530
Sorry!
Oh, hey!

161
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,740
Hey, hey!
You really!

162
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,170
- Seriously?
- Ow! Ow!

163
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,100
No, no, don't do that.

164
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,940
I'm sorry! I'm sorry for lying!
You really!
I'm really sorry!

165
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,780
- C'mon! Hey, receive your punishment!
- Oh, no...

166
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,780
- Oh, no, why you hitting me?
- Stay still!

167
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,240
- C'mon!
- No...

168
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:38,730
♫ When I get home it's dark ♫

169
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:46,300
♫ So that my tired feet can take a rest ♫

170
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:54,150
♫ Like fluttering in the wind ♫

171
00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:01,460
♫ Even my shaky mind can take a break ♫

172
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,330
Yes, Nam Joo's Father. Yes, don't worry too much.

173
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,040
Yes, I talked to her on the phone. She'll return soon.

174
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,160
Yes. Yes, then...

175
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,800
♫ Like the time ♫

176
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,980
♫ which was painful passes ♫

177
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,040
♫ The white winter which is also piled up with sorrow ♫

178
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,500
Nam Joo!

179
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,320
Where did you go? You even skipped school.

180
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
♫  when spring arrives and the flowers bloom, ♫

181
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,390
Nam Joo.

182
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,800
♫  will pass ♫

183
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,360
You're having a hard time, right? I'm sorry.

184
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,440
You must have a lot of things you want to do, but because of me you put your dreams away.

185
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,290
I'm sorry.

186
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,320
Stop it.

187
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,700
♫ With your fragrance leaving ♫

188
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:25,830
♫ Today again is a day of shedding tears ♫

189
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:30,300
♫ It passes ♫

190
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,410
Why? You're not craving it? Should we go out and buy something else to eat?

191
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,860
No, it's okay.

192
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,510
Hey, Ra Eun Ho. I heard you got a boyfriend?

193
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,530
Tae Woon told me. Who is it?

194
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,460
I got one. Someone who is really good at acting like his leg hurt.

195
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:03,320
Acting? Oh my gosh, a celebrity? Then is it an actor?

196
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,650
Why is the meal service in Korean high schools always such a mess?

197
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,730
I know right.

198
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,590
Oppa. Should we go out and eat ramen?

199
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,930
I told you I'm not your Oppa.

200
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Hey, be careful. You can't be sick like last time.

201
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:35,010
Why are you concerned about that?

202
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,880
I know right.

203
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,890
Don't, don't.

204
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,760
- It will...
- be okay.

205
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,980
It will be okay.

206
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,590
Hey...

207
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,770
Why is she like that?

208
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,030
Hey, Ra Eun Ho! Ra Eun Ho, what's wrong?

209
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:09,200
Hey! Ra Eun Ho! Are you okay? Why are you like this?

210
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,340
- Eun Ho.
Ra Eun Ho, snap out of it.

211
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,030
- Eun Ho. Ra Eun Ho.
- Why is she like this?

212
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,660
- Snap out of it, are you okay?
- Ra Eun Ho.

213
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,090
It's food poisoning. Her immune system was weakened a lot already,

214
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,210
so it was serious enough for additional complications to develop.

215
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,060
Then well... should we at least admit her into the hospital this time?

216
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,430
It's not to that extent. She has to be careful when eating food for the time being.

217
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,390
For now she just needs to rest.

218
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,630
Thank you.

219
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,110
We should call her parents, right?

220
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,570
Since they said she'll be fine if she rests for one or two hours,

221
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,770
I'll contact them when the time's right. Tae Woon, you can go now.

222
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,900
What? Me? Why would I?

223
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,900
I'll stay here. You can go now.

224
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,540
Ah, no... I have to be here though.

225
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,020
As a friend from the same class, I'm worried.

226
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,870
So you're the type to worry about your friends from class a lot, Tae Woon.

227
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,340
Yes... extremely.

228
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:34,060
Yes, Principal? I didn't get off work. One of the kids from my class-

229
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:42,960
Yes. Yes? Oh that file? Yes, yes. I'll send it to you immediately. Yes.

230
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,070
Then Tae Woon, I'm sorry but can you look after her for a bit? I'll be right back.

231
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,280
Yes! You don't have to come! I'll look after her well,

232
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,780
as a friend from the same class.

233
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,520
Alright, as a friend from the same class?

234
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,040
Yes.

235
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:19,150
She has no manners... even when she's sick, she's pretty.

236
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,550
Yes, don't worry, Teacher.

237
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,530
Are you really okay?

238
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,850
But really why am I like this lately?

239
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,450
I think the cafeteria food has gotten strange again.

240
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,500
Kids in other classes got stomachaches and rashes.

241
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,160
No wonder, when I ate it, the feeling I got-

242
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,520
It didn't get better. If they're like this with the cafeteria food, I really won't leave them alone!

243
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,430
Your face became half its size!

244
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,400
Do I look haggard? Do you feel sorry for me?

245
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,690
Don't do aegyo. It looks deliberate.

246
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,400
I love you!

247
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,240
They're pretty.

248
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,140
You want to receive flowers?

249
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,820
Let's go! I'll buy you meat! That suits you more.

250
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,380
I'll buy you marbled sirloin! Marbled sirloin.

251
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,130
I understand, sleep well.

252
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,080
Don't eat just anything because you're hungry!

253
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:54,020
I got it, I got it, I won't tease you. Okay, sleep well.

254
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,860
It's food poisoning. Her immune system was weakened a lot already,

255
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,450
So it was serious enough for additional complications to develop.

256
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,320
I'm 100% sure that it's because of the cafeteria food.

257
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,750
They dare feed us that kind of food?

258
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,090
I will pay them back the same way.

259
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,310
Excuse me, are you Principal Yang Do Jin?

260
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,100
Yes. So?

261
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Mr. Hyeong Kang Woo send you a lunch box.

262
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,880
Really?

263
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,130
They said you've suffered a lot all this time, so you should enjoy your meal.

264
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,700
Enjoy your meal.

265
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,750
Principal. Let's go eat.

266
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,060
You can enjoy your meal alone today.

267
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,660
Can you eat all that alone?

268
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,060
Strange...

269
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,920
He has to enjoy his meal.

270
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,840
Ugh, wasabi, wasabi!

271
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,190
Did you enjoy your meal?
Did you enjoy your meal?

272
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,630
I made it with only ingredients that were expired.

273
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:20,100
You also fed us a lot of cafeteria food too.

274
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,010
If you eat this and get food poisoning, that just means you're weak,

275
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,860
not that something is wrong with the food.

276
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,980
Like you always said.

277
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,940
Ambulance!

278
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,380
What's wrong?

279
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,540
- Food poisoning, food poisoning!
- Who, who?

280
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,650
- My entire body is hurting, so hurry and...
- Look!

281
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,760
Call 911!

282
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,170
We'll call them, but your complexion looks really good right now.

283
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,090
I'm having food poisoning symptoms!

284
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,520
With this kind of energy, you can go by yourself.

285
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,360
Hurry, hurry!

286
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,740
I'll die at this rate.

287
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,440
Why did you get so heavy?

288
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,420
Hey, he's holding his tummy...

289
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,570
What is this?

290
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,540
My stomach hurts from laughing!
What is this?

291
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,100
But isn't this too much? What if he really gets sick?

292
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,830
Hey, they're fresh. I just ordered it from the hotel.

293
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,480
Huh? Then the Principal is just being like this by himself?

294
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,430
He's scared and just overreacting!

295
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,300
What was this then?
He was itchy like this!

296
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,930
He just ate. What do you mean?

297
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,080
Ah, feels good.

298
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,050
I have so much work to do at school for me to be here...

299
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,860
It's better if you're not there.

300
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,850
Get up.

301
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,080
Doctor. This is an emergency patient though.

302
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,460
He's itchy all over and has diarrhea.

303
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,850
What patient? There's nothing wrong. Quickly get up.

304
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,880
This person, really.

305
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,710
I told you I ate expired food!

306
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,880
The charts don't lie. You're completely normal, really.

307
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,490
I have lots of urgent patients. Please hurry up and leave.

308
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,070
That doctor, really!

309
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,360
For a food poisoned patient, your digestion is pretty great.

310
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,120
You ate a lot of different things.

311
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,570
Those punks... I'll catch them and beat them up.

312
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,750
X, this punk.

313
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,060
Oh, you startled me!

314
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,190
I can recycle the trash.

315
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:40,210
So, are you saying I'm trash you can't even recycle?

316
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,840
How can I say that with my own mouth?

317
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,520
You're like that because your conscience is stabbing you.

318
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,250
If you're like this because I talked about the expired food,

319
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,630
that's a bit childish.

320
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,070
Childish? Then you shouldn't do that.

321
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,460
Where do you think-

322
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,090
Where do you think you're kicking garbage at?

323
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:10,280
Oh, my. The trash can was right next to you. I meant to kick it in there.

324
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,720
Oh my, I just copied how you kick trash like this.

325
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,780
Two at once... like cockroaches or something.

326
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,450
You're suspicious.

327
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,230
Extremely suspicious.

328
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,340
You two keep sticking together.

329
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,810
Custodian application

330
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,940
Do you know what this is?

331
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,680
These are applications applying for our school custodian position.

332
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,060
Even if I fire your mom, there are plenty of people to clean.

333
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:58,180
Teacher... my mom did nothing wrong though.

334
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:03,180
You know how much trouble she gave me over the cafeteria food issue. That's what she did wrong.

335
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,270
So just tell me who X is.

336
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,020
Then your mom can comfortably clean at school.

337
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,480
I really don't know who it is.

338
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,320
You stick with Ra Eun Ho all day but you don't know who X is?

339
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,380
I guess there's nothing we can do about it then.

340
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,350
Tell your mother to look for another job.

341
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,760
Teacher!

342
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,440
Hey, Ran Ke, look at this.

343
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,070
"Morals hit rock bottom!"

344
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,240
It's not funny?

345
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,100
How could he have thought of all of this?

346
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,690
Isn't he so innovative?

347
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,140
Does he not have any thoughts of turning himself in?

348
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,070
- Huh?
- Hyeon Tae Woon.

349
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:20,450
If he turns himself in for being X, everything is resolved.

350
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,810
Since he's Chairman Lee's son, he won't be harmed much either.

351
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:31,350
That... he must have a reason that doesn't let him do that.

352
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,560
Reason?

353
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,080
But why do I... think the whole X is a childish hero play?

354
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,530
I don't think that's true.

355
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,400
If Tae Woon heard, he'd feel sad.

356
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,800
What is he sad about?

357
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,280
It's the truth. Since he's Chairman Lee's son,

358
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,030
he's trusting in his Dad having his back and doing these things as much as he wants.

359
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,090
Ran Ke.

360
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,140
So annoying.

361
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,720
Sa Rang. Why are you like this?

362
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,760
Did something happen?

363
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,450
You're the same too.

364
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,550
Since when did you start dating Tae Woon to be like this to me?

365
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,450
You like it that much?

366
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,100
Then just go around with him!

367
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,840
You won't need someone like me anymore.

368
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,280
Oh Sa Rang! Your words went too far!

369
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,500
If you're angry about something, tell me properly.

370
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,350
Don't beat around the bush.

371
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,870
It must be nice for you.

372
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:33,240
To be able to say everything you want to say without having to beat around the bush.

373
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,160
Why are you not asking anything?

374
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,040
Are you not curious what happened?

375
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,920
I'm not curious, just worried.

376
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,720
Worried?

377
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:13,760
As for that something, wise Oh Sa Rang will take care of it.

378
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,190
Just... I hope you won't feel too hurt.

379
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,430
I'm worrying about that.

380
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:47,660
I mean... she has to tell me what her problem is for me to know.

381
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,560
If she just talks about her side like that, how can I know what the problem is?

382
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,820
Maybe she feels sad?

383
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,930
You suddenly got a boyfriend-

384
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,670
No.

385
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,850
I worked that out well with her last time already.

386
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,000
She even sincerely congratulated me.

387
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,840
Why suddenly?

388
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,440
Still, she's a very considerate person, so won't there be some kind of reason?

389
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,110
This is too much!

390
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,260
If you suddenly fire me like this, where will I go, President?

391
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,820
I'll do well, okay?

392
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,780
Let me go just this once! This is my livelihood.

393
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,090
Please let me go just this once!

394
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,690
Well it isn't suddenly. I'm still giving you a month's time.

395
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,820
That means you're going to fire me after a month anyway.

396
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,460
What did I wrong? You have to tell me for me to fix it.

397
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,130
No... we didn't have a choice either! The higher-ups told us to fire you.

398
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,380
Hurry up and leave. Don't make a fuss.

399
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,870
How could you do that?

400
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,830
You really fired my mom?

401
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:02,020
How dare you barge in here like this?

402
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,360
Then did you think adults joke around?

403
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,090
You're too much, really!

404
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,740
My mom works really really hard!

405
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:14,900
Even when she's not working, since it's a school for kids that has to be clean,

406
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,170
She can't even straighten her back because she's always sweeping and mopping.

407
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,550
What can we do? She'll have to work hard cleaning at home then.

408
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,050
- Thanks to such a loyal daughter.
- Teacher!

409
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,410
Hey, you punk. That's why I told you to tell me who X is!

410
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,260
It's your choice whether you do or not.

411
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,400
If you keep your mouth shut, your mom will never return to her job!

412
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,870
I don't understand you.

413
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,140
Is X more precious to you than your mom?

414
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,630
That would be great.

415
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:28,240
Since we'd just have to wander around without any concerns.

416
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,800
Yes.

417
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,160
I'm really envious.

418
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,030
You must have a lot of concerns.

419
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,260
I thought I knew her the best

420
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,510
and understood her the most, but...

421
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:54,040
what kind of relationship do we have?

422
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,510
I suddenly thought of that.

423
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:04,120
Normally with relationships, the deeper it gets, the harder it gets.

424
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,510
Yes.

425
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,220
Yes, I understand. I'll go back.

426
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,710
Yes.

427
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,790
Normally with a relationship, it's hard to protect it.

428
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,470
That's why you have to use all your strength and try harder.

429
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,570
Do well!

430
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:53,150
Go to Geumdo High School until the end of this month. You'll be transferred soon.

431
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,370
I understand.

432
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,200
I definitely gave you a chance.

433
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,810
It's your incompetence that you couldn't grab ahold of that chance.

434
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,900
Amazing Han Soo Ji who never lets go once she bites,

435
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,630
I'm so curious as to why you became so incompetent all of a sudden.

436
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,930
Since there's still time until you get transferred,

437
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,800
try to show off your hidden talent and turn the table around.

438
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,560
Okay?

439
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,990
The way I see it, you need something new right now.

440
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,970
Should I seriously put laxative in the Principal's food this time?

441
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,550
Hey. What are you going to do if the Principal gets mad and makes a fuss?

442
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,530
If he makes a fuss, it'll be even more fun!

443
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,930
Is what X does a joke to you?

444
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,780
Do you do it for fun?

445
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,630
You think there's a more grandiose reason than that?

446
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,780
So, we all turned out this way because we've been led by your childish play.

447
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,730
Hey, Oh Sa Rang. You're going overboard.

448
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,960
Do you have a problem with me?

449
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,320
Yea.

450
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,220
I have a lot.

451
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,010
I thought you had justice in your own way,

452
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,160
but I'm disappointed that you're living as X just because of that reason instead.

453
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,450
Because of you, I-

454
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,010
Hey, I'm not a hero or anything. What do you want me to do?

455
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,380
Why are you guys like this?

456
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:33,310
Ran Ke, Tae Woon also worries a lot about our school and other kids.

457
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,810
Do you only worry about him?

458
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,630
Really, why are you like this?

459
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,660
Truthfully, I'm having a hard time because of you lately.

460
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,920
I'm sorry for making you have a hard time.

461
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,120
What is this? Huh?

462
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,240
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, really.

463
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,600
You have to do this well!

464
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
I'm sorry.

465
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,190
How can you do your job this way?

466
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,750
No. I left it there and just for a while...

467
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,690
Ah, really. Do well!

468
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,070
Go ahead. I'll take this.

469
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,320
Couldn't you just accept what she said?

470
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,880
Did you have to argue like that?

471
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:53,120
She tried to start a fight first. You heard it too. She said I was childish.

472
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,200
She's my friend!

473
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,110
It wasn't even anything, you could have just lost.

474
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,680
I already suddenly told her about us dating and about X too-

475
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,950
I got it, I'm sorry.

476
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,280
But she also went overboard too.

477
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,930
That's true.

478
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,350
Why is she so sensitive lately?

479
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,130
If she has something she's sad about, she should tell me!

480
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:28,690
If she doesn't tell me, how am I supposed to know?

481
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,380
I should've nipped it in the bud.

482
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,130
I let it grow too much.

483
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,870
If you keep being like this to me without even being sure-

484
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,570
I'm saying it's going to be certain soon.

485
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:06,510
My spy said she'd bring me definite evidence.

486
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,580
Spy?

487
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,480
So, don't face turmoil later.

488
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,500
If you have something to reveal, I'm saying you should just do it.

489
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,130
Yay!

490
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,680
Teacher Joon Soo.

491
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,610
Why are you drinking here?

492
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:43,290
Oh, Teacher Sim. Have a seat.

493
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,230
Second round. How about a second round?

494
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,650
You got drunk like this over two cans of beer?

495
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,950
I'm weak to alcohol.

496
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:56,220
But! I can't not drink!

497
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:00,460
Teacher Soo Ji is leaving!

498
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,380
What?

499
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,710
She got fired because she couldn't catch X.

500
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,880
Teacher Soo Ji! Don't go, Teacher Soo Ji!

501
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,920
Don't go! Don't go, Teacher Sim!

502
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,510
Aish! Only I'm alone again!

503
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,760
Oh my.

504
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,440
What are you doing all the way over here?

505
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:40,000
Are you excited that you're leaving the school?

506
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:46,070
Since I couldn't do my job properly, I have to take responsibility.

507
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,060
It's because of me, right? Because you couldn't catch X.

508
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,660
It's my fault... for being blindly in love.

509
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,010
The man I like is protecting the kids. How can I catch them?

510
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,280
Teacher.

511
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,620
I am a bit upset about the fact that he wants to protect the kids rather than me.

512
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,670
But that, too, is that man's charm.

513
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,600
I must protect them.

514
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:23,990
I'll protect the kids... and also the woman l I like.

515
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:28,210
I'll find a way...

516
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,670
so just wait a bit.

517
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,190
Returning your kiss from last time.

518
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,430
The man should do this kind of stuff first.

519
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,110
And...

520
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,220
I'll do it first now.

521
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,840
Why are you guys like this?

522
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,830
Ran Ke, Tae Woon also worries a lot about our school and other kids.

523
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,820
Do you only worry about him?

524
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,880
Really, why are you like this?

525
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,200
Truthfully, I'm having a hard time because of you lately.

526
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,570
How is it? Does it suit me well?

527
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,940
Aigoo, it's so funny I'm going to die.
What are you so happy about?

528
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:49,450
I was getting tired of working at the restaurant anyway. Now I don't have to move around here and there.

529
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:54,260
Since I can see you often, I'm happy of course.

530
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:03,480
But... if I work at school... won't you be embarrassed?

531
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,010
I'd really love it of course!

532
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,850
I'll work harder looking at you.

533
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,690
Mom!

534
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,100
You're only coming now?

535
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,420
Why are you so late?
I don't know.

536
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,090
What's wrong with your eye?

537
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,260
You cried?

538
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,820
No! Why would I cry?

539
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,700
- Something did happen!
- No.

540
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,100
Mom. I will only think of you now.

541
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,220
Why is she like this?

542
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,000
I only need you.

543
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,440
Let's go!

544
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,090
Principal's Office

545
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:43,260
That's why I told you to reveal who X is!

546
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:49,110
If you keep your mouth shut, your mom will never return to her job!

547
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,230
What is this?

548
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,220
You're the spy?

549
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,710
How could you do this?

550
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:33,680
How could you be the spy? Really, why are you like this to me!

551
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:40,140
Whether I'm the spy or not, why do you care? You have no interest in me.

552
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,990
Sa Rang, why are you like this? Did something happen?

553
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:47,630
You can tell me. We're...

554
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,900
in a relationship that tells each other everything.

555
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,680
You're the one who first didn't tell me everything.

556
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,420
Who X is, what kind of relationship you're in with Hyeon Tae Woon...

557
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,750
You're the one who had secrets and didn't tell me first! Why are you like this to me? Why!

558
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,910
I told you already!

559
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:09,370
I even explained the situation to you but why are you like this?

560
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:14,860
Explain? It was a notice.

561
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,310
Since it already happened this way, you accept it!

562
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,700
I still didn't say anything.

563
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,870
I thought you must have a reason and tried hard to understand you.

564
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:26,170
Do you think I was at ease?

565
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,310
Don't you think I tried to tell you?

566
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:34,710
It's Tae Woon's secret so I can't just tell anyone that. But why are you like this?

567
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,400
Only he's important, huh?

568
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,990
I'm sure you didn't consider me at all.

569
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,390
You got a boyfriend,

570
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:44,650
so why would you need a friend!

571
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,770
Oh Sa Rang!

572
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,290
So?

573
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,580
You're going to reveal that he's X?

574
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,970
While being a spy too.

575
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,220
You only amount to this?

576
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,380
Yeah. I'm a person who only amounts to this.

577
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,730
So I'll do it. I'll reveal it and be a spy!

578
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,850
You only think of me this way, so I have no reason not to.

579
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,210
Good job, good job.

580
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,400
Your mom is important to you. Who cares about those guys?

581
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,840
You... want to meet X, right?

582
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,860
I'll let you meet him today.

583
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,790
In return, you must promise something.

584
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,100
You must come alone.

585
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,950
Then X will come.

586
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:33,720
I knew it.

587
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:39,720
I'm finally catching the culprit. X, you punk.

588
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,990
Huh? X?

589
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:46,730
You... Do you know X? Why did you come here?

590
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,940
Oh, you really.

591
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,190
I'm not X! I'm on my way home.

592
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,820
How dare you tease an adult, you punk?

593
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,900
You're X, right?

594
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,850
You said to meet in this location.

595
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:03,200
I didn't.

596
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,240
X said he can't appear because of Ra Eun Ho.

597
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:16,170
You're really not?

598
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,580
Hey. Quickly go. Go.

599
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,440
But Teacher, I definitely had something to say to you.

600
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,970
What was it? Ah!

601
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,270
Recently, I ate cafeteria food,

602
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,120
and went to the emergency room.

603
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,960
Truthfully, the cafeteria food is a bit-

604
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,190
Hey! Quickly go! I'm busy so quickly go!

605
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,930
I mean, it is something really important to me!

606
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:44,350
So I went to the emergency room, and they say it was food poisoning!

607
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:45,960
It was all because of the cafeteria food!

608
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,350
Hey! Please go! Quickly go!

609
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,060
No, the cafeteria food is a bit-

610
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,070
Go!

611
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,180
Hey, you should go home and clean up some chicken.

612
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,580
Your father is hard at work.

613
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,390
You're X?

614
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,450
X or Z, I don't really know about that stuff.

615
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:11,400
How dare you try to shut people up with such a measly amount of money?

616
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,270
It's a hot day. Take this and go buy yourself a popsicle.

617
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,930
A popsicle?

618
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:21,380
What do I lack that I would block your mouth?

619
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,810
You really... aren't you X?

620
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,080
I don't really know about that stuff.

621
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,630
Sa Rang just said I could see you if I came here so I did.

622
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:35,130
This punk, really.

623
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,250
I need to fire you for you to snap out of it!

624
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:40,290
You do whatever you want whether you want to fire me or what not.

625
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:45,230
What I saw that time... I was that close!

626
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,410
I won't stay still until the end, so be prepared.

627
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,610
What did you see? Do you have evidence?

628
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,930
What are you doing?

629
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,860
You said to show you evidence.

630
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,320
There are more boxes of expired food packages.

631
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,940
If you want, I can spread them all over the school.

632
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:14,020
The expiration date? Just because you eat an outdated product, you won't die.

633
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,480
With a measly amount of money, should I feed them a feast?

634
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,730
You don't even have a conscience.

635
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:24,970
Even when you look at this, you don't feel guilty? You don't?

636
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,520
I don't. I don't.

637
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,630
Do you have evidence whether this came from our cafeteria or elsewhere?

638
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:36,950
Look how dense you are. You're fired!

639
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,130
Don't do anything useless and quit immediately.

640
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,810
Furthermore,

641
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:47,490
since you kept making a fuss about evidence, I prepared evidence.

642
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,630
What is this?

643
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,690
What is this?

644
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,220
How could they feed kids this?

645
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,570
If you press this, it'll send.

646
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,190
Oh.
You just have to press this and send it to the Principal.

647
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,940
What are you trying to do?

648
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,470
On my way back after getting fired,

649
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:31,430
I'll stop by a TV station, the Ministry of Education, newspapers and deliver this video clip...

650
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,560
I'll relay it to them and leave. Then I'll be going.

651
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:40,630
Why are you like this?

652
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:43,030
What's going on?

653
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:09,700
You only think of me to be this much. I have no reaso not to.

654
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:23,010
Hey. You bad girl.

655
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:29,610
How can you make me into a bad person until the end?

656
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,610
Because of you, do you know how much I...

657
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,580
What? Do you think it was comfortable for me?

658
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,540
Do you know how sad I was?

659
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:47,270
You always reveal information and laugh among yourselves.

660
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:56,660
Why are you crying? You're a bad girl too.

661
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:09,240
Crazy Principal. He threatened you with that?

662
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,020
Hey, you should have told me sooner! I'm so frustrated, really.

663
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:19,040
If I tell you, what can we do?

664
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,750
Do we confess that Hyeon Tae Woon is X?

665
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,390
I had no choice either.

666
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:33,040
Still, like a fool, you... I could have helped-

667
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,610
I was bad.

668
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,350
I'm someone who doesn't even have the right to be your friend.

669
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:57,980
I don't, but... can you forgive me just once?

670
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:05,920
No, if it weren't for you too, I would have reported it.

671
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:13,640
Even if Hyeon Tae Woon is reported, it won't affect his life at all.

672
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:20,930
But for us, if we quit right now, living is very scary...

673
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:26,150
I justified a lot telling myself that it's okay for me to report him.

674
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:31,320
Sa Rang...

675
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:37,940
But, what do I do if my mom really gets fired?

676
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:44,210
Bad Principal.

677
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:48,890
How could he threaten a person using their weakness?

678
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:56,570
Don't worry. We'll do whatever it takes

679
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:59,080
and protect your mother.

680
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,340
You're talking like you're X.

681
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:07,530
Gosh. Did you laugh?

682
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,020
No.

683
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,460
You did laugh.
No I didn't.

684
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:15,490
You laughed. You laughed!

685
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,680
Don't do that.

686
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,420
Really...

687
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,570
Let's take revenge on the Principal.

688
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:29,080
Go to the Principal and pretend like you're a spy.

689
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:39,380
The relationship starts to waver from a minor detail of the heart gone awry.

690
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:43,990
But that waver brings an opportunity.

691
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:52,120
An opportunity for a new friendship. Confirmation of a long lasting friendship.

692
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:59,350
The best way to calm down a relationship that wavers ...

693
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:04,500
is to hold each others' hands firmly.

694
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,360
It must be good.

695
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,560
Are you having some party? What is all of this?

696
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,500
Starting from tomorrow, I'll pack Eun Ho's lunch.

697
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:25,170
Three level lunch box. I can't trust the school cafeterial food. She keeps getting sick.

698
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,670
How can you be so extreme? Why is there no middle for you?

699
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:32,070
Are you going to make money and invest it all into her lunch box?

700
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:35,090
Lunch box? That's a good idea.

701
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:38,210
Mom! I should start a lunch box business!

702
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,070
- Will you?
- Yeah!

703
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,220
- Then let's start with getting hit by a lunch box.
- Why?

704
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,330
- This guy!
- Why?

705
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,440
- Mom, ow!
- Hey, hey...

706
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,090
This guy! Come here!

707
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,930
Look at him...

708
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:52,910
The cafeteria food is still like that, right?

709
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:56,720
I know right. Yes, but...

710
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,670
Well, it also...

711
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:02,040
feels like it isn't.

712
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:30,570
♫ I guess that's it. I guess not yet. ♫

713
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:34,600
You said meat suits me better than flowers.

714
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:39,220
There were no flowers you liked there. You don't even know the basics.

715
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,620
What do you have to say?

716
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,230
What kind of flower do you like?

717
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,160
What the heck?

718
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:53,890
♫ Having tried to coax and calm it ♫

719
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:58,460
Today, even if I don't eat lunch, I'll feel full.

720
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:07,350
♫ Hope carries me to you ♫

721
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:15,830
♫ Even though this love which might hurt ♫

722
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:20,870
♫ is exhausting and not worthy of you  ♫

723
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:26,100
♫ To me, like that time ♫

724
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:31,970
♫ Like a habit I'm drawing in my eyes ♫

725
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:08,500
Didn't I tell you not to go around causing trouble?

726
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,630
X?

727
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,100
These things!

728
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:17,190
Father, about that...

729
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:22,370
I told you. No matter what, I'll only pull you out.

730
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:29,240
Instead, Ra Eun Ho is expelled!

731
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:58,540
♫ I'll believe in this moment ♫

732
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:03,900
♫ I occasionally don't have confidence and feel uneasy ♫

733
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,000
♫ but you came into my heart ♫
