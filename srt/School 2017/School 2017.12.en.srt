1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,880
The thing I need right now..

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,490
is not your generosity.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,950
Hey, Ra Eun Ho.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,360
So Hyeon Tae Woon... don't appear in front of me from now on.

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,650
Don't come near.

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,850
Don't worry or care about my business.

7
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,210
This is my answer to ...

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,020
your confession.

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:53,320
♬  Hope carries me to you  ♬

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,420
♬  Even though this love might hurt this love  ♬

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,360
♬  is exhausting (as it is) and wasn't worthy of you  ♬

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,560
♬  For me who has been hurt so much ♬

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,550
♬  Like that time (a habit) you fill my eyes.  ♬

14
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,330
Is it all that easy?

15
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,590
Who are you to make my pride, my dream into something trivial.

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,400
You said your computer's broken so you can't draw your webtoon.

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,210
Draw with this. Then you won't have to do your part time job.

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,110
♬  Hope carries me to you  ♬

19
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,450
♬  Even though this love might hurt this love  ♬

20
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,510
♬ and is exhausting (like that) and not worthy of you ♬

21
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,630
♬  Even if wishing is hopeless ♬

22
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:14,840
School 2017
Only you, not knowing me
♬  Like a habit I'm drawing in my eyes ♬

23
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,440
I stayed up thinking.

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,120
It's not that I don't understand your feelings.

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,310
You could have seen that I did it with sincerity.

26
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,870
What's so complicated about it? Why is your ego so twisted?

27
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:42,300
-Twisted ego?
-Just say thanks. It would have been fine to just accept it coolly and work hard on your drawings.

28
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,430
So sorry, that I couldn't accept it coolly.

29
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,880
So then just accept it, coolly.

30
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,850
If I accept it coolly? What will you do for me next?

31
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,540
A desktop computer? I can't catch the bus so are you going to pick out a car for me too?

32
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,870
Hey Ra Eun Ho.

33
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,220
Sincerity?

34
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,080
Your feelings are all that matters to you. That's why everything is so easy.

35
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,380
That heart that worried so desperately about me, was the same heart that confessed to me so easily.

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,990
Was that how it was? Did it look that easy to you?

37
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,630
You might have thought it was a spontaneous and childish confession.

38
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,300
I agonised over it hundreds and thousands of times up until that moment.

39
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,450
What would I do if you got uncomfortable, what would I do if you rejected me?

40
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,080
These hundreds of thoughts were swarming around in my head.

41
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,650
But that's easy? How can that be easy?

42
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,480
That's not what I'm saying. Your feelings were so sudden that it was bewildering.

43
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,220
That was my effort that I exerted a lot of restraint for. At least I made an effort.

44
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,920
I thought about what my feelings were for you..

45
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,640
What was worrying you, what was making your life so difficult..

46
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,370
I tried hard to understand what it was. But what did you say?

47
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,680
Have you even tried to understand me?

48
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,000
The thing that really makes me angry..

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,360
Is that those feelings I struggled with before I confessed, in one small moment..

50
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,720
you made them into something so trivial.

51
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,930
I came to return this.

52
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,740
I think there's no reason for me to accept this.

53
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,060
What are you doing?

54
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:00,780
You won't take it. I don't need it either. You can have it if you need it.

55
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,490
Why won't you give me a break!

56
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,650
Apologise or give a chance to apologise you could at least do that.

57
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,390
Did you have to be like this until the last moment?

58
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,180
I brought the tablet and hurt my pride to the very end and you ask if it's easy.

59
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,660
Do you feel good now?

60
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,900
Ah, cleaning for that jerk.

61
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,190
Let's be a bit more careful.

62
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,430
I am being completely careful.

63
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,730
Did you get rejected by Ra Eun Ho?

64
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,200
What?

65
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,320
I must be right. You're so self-centered.

66
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,460
It's more impressive that she's endured it all this time.

67
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,850
What do you know?

68
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,320
Are you a kid? You're trying to take it out on me.

69
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,860
As expected with your temper.

70
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,820
How much longer are you going to go about life by losing your temper?

71
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,000
If you're rejected or everything doesn't go your way, you go crazy!

72
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,020
That's why Ra Eun Ho couldn't stand you.

73
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,260
It's a relief now that she won't be involved with someone like you.

74
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,900
Are you kidding? Rather than a cowardly guy like you...

75
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,860
Why? How you found someone with better prospects than Hong Nam Joo? Is that why you dumped her?

76
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,120
What? Crazy bastard!

77
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,630
Hello, eacher.

78
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,530
Just leave them be.

79
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,010
They won't listen to anything I say. Just let them fight it out.

80
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,870
Maybe since all you do is study, your punches are soft.

81
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,760
You don't even study, why are your punches like that?

82
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,020
Are you nuts?

83
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:35,150
You and your temper. When will it ever cool down? This hasn't even been just once or twice.

84
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,840
Why? You feel wronged about getting hit back then?

85
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,920
I didn't even have time to feel wronged.

86
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,140
I know right. Why did you do that?

87
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,910
Please let our Joon Gi go around the classrooms just once.

88
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,790
We wan't do do that. But we can't. Sorry.

89
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,070
Why was there a test that day?

90
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,630
Of all days that day ...

91
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,570
Why was it Joon Gi's last day with us?

92
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,250
Then..

93
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,840
what was I supposed to have done?

94
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,390
Should I have cried like crazy while holding the funeral car?

95
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,790
Or ask to have him let onto the school grounds

96
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,410
and throw a punch at your father?

97
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,880
Even so that day..

98
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,730
taking that test wasn't right.

99
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,150
I thought at that time..

100
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,620
that I should gain strength and money to be a stronger person through my studies.

101
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,570
To not let money

102
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,450
make me forgot what was important again.

103
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:29,590
That was my promise to Joon Gi.

104
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,980
That's a cowardly justification.

105
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,170
Like me.

106
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,560
I thought my spiritless self was going to crazy.

107
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,690
Since there was nothing I could do...

108
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,490
I justified myself.

109
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,180
The punch that should have been thrown at me..

110
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,590
I threw it at you..

111
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,720
saying that you were a bigger jerk than me.

112
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,390
I was a jerk.

113
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,710
In the end my thoughts were a cowardly justification.

114
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,300
I...

115
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,860
I made my friend into a delinquent and

116
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,830
I'm the bad guy that got out of it. But for Song Dae Hwi...

117
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,730
I didn't like seeing you become that person.

118
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,500
That guy too...

119
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,500
what if he becomes a bad and cowardly guy like me?

120
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,800
If Joon Gi were to see us, we would each get hit.

121
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,800
Someone like Joon Gi wouldn't stop with that.

122
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,900
-Crazy bastard.
-Crazy bastard.

123
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,960
Hey, aren't you worried about Ra Eun Ho?

124
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,700
Speaking of which, what are you going to about Hong Nam Joo?

125
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,830
Hey Nam Joo.

126
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,770
What are you doing here embarrassing yourself in the neighborhood?

127
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,960
What's with how you look too?

128
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,500
You worked at a construction site wearing that?

129
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,210
I had an interview this morning.

130
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,930
I should just become a construction worker.

131
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,650
Since we don't need qualifications for that.

132
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,070
What a great idea.

133
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,770
If Mom and Dad heard, they'd be pretty happy.

134
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,800
The heaven is going too far too, really.

135
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,610
It's not like I'm even asking for billions of dollars.

136
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,860
The heavens are normally more harsh to the people who don't have anything.

137
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,600
It's not even a great dream.

138
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,900
I just want to be an office worker like other people.

139
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,080
I want to get gift sets from the company during holidays

140
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,570
and go home with them.

141
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,210
It's only that kind of dream.

142
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,960
What's with these shoes?

143
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,310
You're so sloppy. Straighten your shoulders!

144
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,640
It's not like the sky is going to fall tomorrow.

145
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,360
Seeing as how she's overly chic,

146
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,690
Ra Eun Ho, you must be having a really hard time too.

147
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,790
Even so what are these side dishes?

148
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,570
You should at least grill them some ham. Eun Ho's a senior.

149
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,310
You make me the bad guy. Only me.

150
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,360
-Do you want some?
-No. I'm okay.

151
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,380
Seaweed is so delicious!

152
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,020
Dad, why are you speaking like that?

153
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,980
This is all because of you, you punk!

154
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,920
If you just got a job-

155
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,390
Is he not getting one because he doesn't want to?

156
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,440
So why did you uselessly get scammed? Why?

157
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,180
Did I get scammed because I wanted to?

158
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,100
Would I have imagined that a friend of 30 years would scam me?

159
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,540
I ate well.

160
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,400
Aish, really.

161
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,320
Money's the enemy, the enemy.

162
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,300
Are you going to keep calling me like this?

163
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,840
Now that you've changed you've gotten scarier, Song Dae Hwi.

164
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,140
I don't have anything to say to you anymore. Don't order me around.

165
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,880
I think we still have a lot of deals to negotiate between us.

166
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,900
That's what you think.
I told you that time.

167
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,250
I need to get first place on the final exams this time.

168
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,400
Crazy bastard.

169
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,000
I found out.

170
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,610
Concrete evidence that Hyeon Tae Woon is X.

171
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,630
What is it? Tell me. Don't test me.

172
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,010
Am I crazy? Why would I show my card if there's nothing for me to gain?

173
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:13,360
Since I found a weakness, I should keep it to make good use of it. Am I right?

174
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,700
You don't believe me, right? Then don't.

175
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,940
Instead, it'll be the end for Hyeon Tae Woon with this.

176
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,280
So do whatever you want.

177
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,730
Whether you put an end to him or destroy him, I don't care.

178
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,210
It would have been good for you to believe me.

179
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,840
Aigoo, don't!

180
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
It'll get all over your hands.

181
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,530
Mum.

182
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,220
What?

183
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,280
I failed the civil service exam. I'm sorry.

184
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,150
It's okay.

185
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:06,470
Do you want to take this opportunity to just quit it all and study to get into university?

186
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,770
I might fail again.

187
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,500
I mean...

188
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,300
I just hope you can go to study with your friends in college

189
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,610
and meet new people.

190
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,070
I'd like you to live doing what everyone else has done.

191
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,270
It's okay. It won't work out anyway.

192
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,270
I'll earn a lot of money so you can live comfortably.

193
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,850
Why are you already talking about earning money?

194
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,900
You're just 18 years old.

195
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,470
I still should.

196
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,960
Considering our circumstances...

197
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,050
Aigoo, I told you not to do that!

198
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Don't worry about me.

199
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,380
You just think about what you want to do.

200
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,820
Why do you keep worrying needlessly over me?

201
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,750
How can I not?

202
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,990
How can I have a dream and a future with our circumstances?

203
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:18,140
I know it's obviously a luxury we can't afford. I'd just get false hope!

204
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,120
Sa Rang, you...
I'm sorry, Mom.

205
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,500
Oh. Your nose is running.

206
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,450
No.

207
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,910
Did something sad happen?

208
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,720
I was mean to my mom.

209
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,300
Then you must be very upset too.

210
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,210
Usually the person who hurt the other is more sad between family members.

211
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,420
I'm so upset that I could die, but I keep getting mad.

212
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,670
I'm upset because of my mom who keeps telling me to do something that I can't.

213
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,870
I'm really pathetic for feeling like this.

214
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,580
Then tell your mom the truth.

215
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,490
Isn't that how you made up with Ra Eun Ho?

216
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,070
Yeah.

217
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,870
Aigoo.

218
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,720
How much longer are you going to go about life by losing your temper?

219
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,490
If you're rejected or everything doesn't go your way, you go crazy!

220
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,020
That's why Ra Eun Ho can't stand you.

221
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,220
Hey.

222
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,570
"Is he an idiot. Does he have no pride?"

223
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,930
After being cursed out like that,

224
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,750
I kept thinking of you.

225
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
I have plenty of pride.

226
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,860
But rather than protecting my pride..

227
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,490
I came here to protect your dream.

228
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,770
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to protect it but..

229
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:49,760
in any case, let's work hard to protect it. Alright. That was hard.

230
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,750
Test prep.

231
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,920
Here, take one.

232
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,660
Take one.

233
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,780
Smile.

234
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,300
Okay.

235
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,300
Take one.

236
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,530
♫ When I think of you my heart jumps ♫

237
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:17,370
No, above that.

238
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,390
Next to that.

239
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,780
Next to the triangular rice ball.

240
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,200
Ah.

241
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,690
Here.

242
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,010
How many times do I have to tell you?

243
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,450
If you're as bad as this, you're going to get fired right away.

244
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,480
Ah, really? Okay, okay. Over here?

245
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,510
♫ Everything I wish for and want to happen ♫

246
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,580
Hey, hey. Not there. Beside...

247
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,510
isn't what I meant.

248
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,750
♫ My heart is thumping all day. ♫

249
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,870
♫ It's dreaming of tomorrow ♫

250
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,300
What?

251
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,980
Is it good?

252
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,100
This is the reward for hard labor.

253
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,240
Oh. But you have to admit this.

254
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,960
I'm working extremely hard to protect your dream.

255
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,360
Has your family's situation gotten any better?

256
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,760
Not yet.

257
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:37,830
But I don't think it was because of my family's situation.

258
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:43,070
My family's situation might have just been an excuse.

259
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,230
Excuse?

260
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,630
As you know, I only have 13 views.

261
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:56,200
Someone on the site that hosts my series has 4700 views and she's only a ninth grader.

262
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:02,620
But I don't know why they do well and I don't.

263
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,570
I don't really know the reason.

264
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,470
Eh, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

265
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:13,060
Yours is so fun! It's just because people haven't seen it.

266
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,900
If they see it once, they'll follow it immediately!

267
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,170
But do you know what's more sad?

268
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:26,070
It would have been better if I could acknowledge that I have no talent for it to make sense.

269
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,820
And I'm using that as an excuse to just give up.

270
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,700
Cowardly.

271
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,000
Are you really not going to do the series?

272
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,350
I don't get much views anyways.

273
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,700
If you don't do it this week either, you'll be automatically out.

274
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,280
I know.

275
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,060
But, I'm not confident.

276
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,120
Huh.

277
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,750
Wow. The tabloids were right.

278
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,870
Did you see?

279
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,130
He never had a presence and in the end, he's disappearing like this.

280
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,300
Oh Sa Rang. You saw the article too, right?

281
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,270
Yeah.

282
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,880
But they're a bit cruel to kick out a team member like this.

283
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,620
But honestly it was a bit ambiguous.

284
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,140
His face is ambiguous, his dancing is ambiguous, and his singing is ambiguous.

285
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,640
Issue should become an issue, but he didn't.

286
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,310
- He needs to become an issue.
- That's right.

287
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,840
- I mean, Issue-
-Stop it.
- What?

288
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,400
Give me one Sprite.

289
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,610
I heard you were cut.

290
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,430
You must be feeling like the sky is falling.

291
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,030
I'm okay.

292
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,900
How can you be okay? You probably never dreamed of being anything but a singer.

293
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,600
I said I'm okay.

294
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,100
You look like you'd cry If I hit you.

295
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,730
Ah, I said I'm really okay!

296
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,000
You'll suddenly feel really scared.

297
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,410
You won't know what to do either. You'll think that your life is going to end just like this.

298
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,140
I might as well just die.

299
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,570
You thought of all of that, right?

300
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,910
When I quit baseball because of an injury,

301
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
I was just like you.

302
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,510
But look. Did my life end?

303
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,850
As you can see, I'm living a very normal and good life.

304
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,270
As I lived,

305
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,660
there's no law that one person can only have one dream.

306
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,450
It's not like you can't switch your dream once you've decided on something.

307
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:58,980
Hey. You might get a new dream out of the blue.

308
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,800
So stop acting like you're going to die.

309
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,950
You'll scare the dreams that will fall out of the sky.

310
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,680
Fighting!

311
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,850
Why did you say you wouldn't go to the field study?

312
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,580
You didn't even show me.

313
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,850
About that... even if I go it won't be fun.

314
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,320
It'll be tiring with so many kids.

315
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,890
Is it really because of that? Huh?

316
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,320
Not because of money?

317
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,310
No. What do you mean money...

318
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,460
It's really not because of money?

319
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,060
Why can't you speak?

320
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,760
If I go to this,

321
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:48,020
How many days will you live on cup noodles then?

322
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,520
What are you talking about?

323
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,800
Did you think I didn't know?

324
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,920
I know you keep eating cup noodles in the washroom!

325
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,490
Aigoo.

326
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,600
Don't go to the study academy today.

327
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,220
Eat dinner with me later.

328
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,000
We'll get two steaks-

329
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,680
No, no. I'll get salad. I'm not that hungry.

330
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,270
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

331
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,290
- Can you give us two B courses?
- Two B courses.

332
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,450
Yes.

333
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,640
Mom... why are you like this? Did you not see the price? It's really expensive here.

334
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,810
Let's just go out.

335
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:49,770
I'm not okay. Your mom can buy this much for you.

336
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,420
I'm younger and healthier than you think.

337
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,950
I'll earn even more money going forward.

338
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,160
To feed my daughter delicious food,

339
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,720
to let her wear nice clothes, and to let her do what she wants. I can still do this for you.

340
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,370
Mom.

341
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:16,300
You're looking down upon me if you unnecessarily worry about me ahead of time.

342
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:22,240
So, believe me for now.

343
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:30,280
Just like every other kids, you can get annoyed or act stubborn sometimes.

344
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,860
Please let it out on me if you need to.

345
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,080
How can I do that?

346
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,270
You can. Kids can do this to their moms.

347
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,480
If you don't do it to me, who would you do it to?

348
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:52,660
So, from now on, don't worry about me.

349
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,210
Just think about yourself, Sa Rang.

350
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:00,020
If it gets too hard later on, I'll tell you.

351
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,610
Let me at least do a mother's duty without worrying.

352
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,000
Give me your hand, Sa Rang.

353
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,890
Do you even see the stars?

354
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:37,230
Yea. Over there shining.

355
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,260
Are you really going to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test?

356
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,110
Are you giving up on the Civil Service Exam?

357
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:52,320
It's not that. I'm just going to at least take the mock exam.

358
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:57,130
I just don't know myself that well still.

359
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:05,690
What am I good at? What is my dream? Can I even go to a university?

360
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,930
What would I even be good at when I go there?

361
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,450
I feel like we're dumb, and we're just wasting all your money on preparation books.

362
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,340
Let's solve all these problems on here and solve life together!

363
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,070
I'm not sure where we'll end up, but let's solve them together!

364
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,900
Let's do that!

365
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,930
This is way too much.

366
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,960
I don't think I can solve them.

367
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,570
Give me one.

368
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,260
What? Why are you so surprised?

369
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,610
You guys are allowed to smoke, but I can't?

370
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,610
You're a police officer, not a gangster.

371
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,690
I know right.

372
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:08,050
Do I really have to do gangster-like things like this?

373
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,340
This is so embarrassing.

374
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,420
You're so annoying, really. Why are you like this even outside of school?

375
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,720
Because I'm still a police officer outside of school.

376
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:24,410
I'm going to decide whether I should turn this over to Mr. Goo Yeong Goo or not depending on how you behave.

377
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,770
I think it'll be useless.

378
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,320
I'm still a police officer though.

379
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,700
Would I return this to you?

380
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,260
Those cigarettes are all mine.

381
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:58,920
So you want me to get Seung Eun and Hyun Jung out of this? I like that you're loyal.

382
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,280
A pickpocket!

383
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,990
Are you okay?

384
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,010
It's not a big deal.

385
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,370
It's not not a big deal.

386
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,690
Leave it. It doesn't hurt that much.

387
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,510
I also ran away from home and was confused about life in the past as much as anyone did.

388
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,690
But I also said what you said.

389
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,910
Leave it. I'm okay.

390
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,830
I said I'm okay.

391
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,060
You're not okay.

392
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,980
I also found out I wasn't okay later.

393
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,310
After I have been hurt enough.

394
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,020
So what?

395
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,730
I used to get into fights a lot and got called to the police station so many times.

396
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,150
Smoking was nothing for me.

397
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:27,080
So compared to my past self, you're an extremely naive, bully teenager.

398
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:38,060
You're doing well. The way you're living could be the right way.

399
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,460
Why?'You've never seen an irresponsible adult like me?

400
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:50,510
At least, you're honest about your emotions, anger, and failure.

401
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:58,950
Well..I just don't know what to do so I live whatever.

402
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,950
I don't know how to live well either.

403
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:05,860
I know. I was like that too before.

404
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,450
In any case, you're living well so don't worry.

405
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,970
On that note, do you want to get a part-time job?

406
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:13,950
Part-time job?

407
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:19,060
It's basically assisting my job. You just need to help me arrange some paper work.

408
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,390
I'd appreciate if you'd help me catch pickpockets just like you did today.

409
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,020
That's so childish.

410
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,330
Think about it carefully. Your salary is pretty decent!

411
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,480
You've worked hard.

412
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,900
Thank you.

413
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:51,380
Rang Kae! I'm thinking about buying you some spicy rice cake-

414
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,020
today... sorry. I'll call you again later.

415
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,350
This is my precious salary.

416
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,780
Until these shoes get worn out, don't give up.

417
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,540
Work hard in your interviews.

418
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,710
If they get worn out, I'll buy another for you. So don't feel down.

419
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,230
Walk confidently.

420
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,660
Let's go.

421
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,460
Today's fortune is so bad. Are you doing well in my room?

422
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,760
It's my room now.

423
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,850
By the way, how's staying in the vacant room? It seems like you're doing fine.

424
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:07,070
Mind your own business. I'll be reinstated soon.

425
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:10,650
Hopefully you don't get kicked out from the vacant room.

426
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:16,650
It seems like you really want to stay in my place.

427
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,280
If the students find out, they'd be happy.

428
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,090
Their vice president's true face: full of ambition and desire.

429
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:29,560
Human beings are creatures that aspire to desire.

430
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,190
I'm planning to pursue whatever I want when given opportunity like this because this is my dream.

431
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,780
Let's see if you can continue to stay in that spot until the end.

432
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,740
After since I became an adult, I've never lost anything that's mine to someone else.

433
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,290
That crazy vice president.

434
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,850
Crazy Principal.

435
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,730
I love eating the most in this world.

436
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,800
You eat nonstop.

437
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,610
I like chicken more than I like you.

438
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,500
A girl named Ra Eun Ho draws webtoons?

439
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,060
Yes. A webtoon about student X.

440
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:13,810
This is the kind of content that can't be drawn without knowing X personally.

441
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:37,110
It's... getting... really... fun.

442
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:42,060
How... can you know X's...

443
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,510
life.

444
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,870
No, no, no.

445
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,200
He told me to put "Yeom" at the end.

446
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,220
Add "Yeom" at the end?

447
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,100
Everyone these days put "Yeom" at the end of their sentences.

448
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,010
It's so fun "yeom". Please give me the strawberry milk "yeom".

449
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,720
Like this.

450
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,840
I got it "yeom".

451
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,890
Give me the strawberry milk "yeom".

452
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,810
I don't have one "yeom".

453
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:17,460
How "yeom".

454
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:23,290
Are you perhaps "yeom".

455
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,980
X's friend "yeom"? Yeom. Yeom.

456
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,460
You're in my hands!

457
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,600
Mr. Chairman! What made you to come to such a filthy place like this?

458
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,280
As soon as you get reinstated, please focus all your attention in capturing X.

459
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,990
Yes.

460
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,170
As soon as I am reinstated, I'll try my wholehearted best.

461
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,550
X.

462
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,090
Then do so starting tomorrow.

463
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,030
Reinstatement.

464
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,220
Really?

465
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,930
I missed you so much.

466
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,310
You must have worked hard all this time.

467
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:24,140
Are there any damages in your royal body?

468
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,310
Throw this away.

469
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,030
Principal Yang Do Jin

470
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:34,730
Hello everyone in Geumdo High School.

471
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:38,180
This is your reinstated principal Yang Do Jin.

472
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,660
Straight to my point. I will definitely and certainly catch X.

473
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,950
I will catch you within a week. Don't do anything rash and wait.

474
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,410
If you get caught this time, not only will be held responsible for all the school problems, but

475
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,610
you will also receive a strong legal punishment too.

476
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,410
What?

477
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,130
Tell me again, Student Hee Chan.

478
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,550
I know where X's hideout is.

479
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,640
Soo Ji, hold on.

480
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,440
What's wrong?

481
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,910
They found out where X's hideout is.

482
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,340
What?

483
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,810
Destroy this door immediately. Immediately!

484
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:10,700
It's X! X appeared! Stop right there!

485
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,940
Catch him immediately. Quickly catch him!

486
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:20,150
Hold on. You must check this place.

487
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:25,370
Hey. There's X and here's X too. What on earth is the truth?

488
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,300
What are you guys?

489
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,630
We just wanted to study quietly by ourselves...

490
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:09,650
This is a study room.

491
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,840
We can't study here?

492
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,970
Do you want to register?

493
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,960
You're no joke. We can't study here?

494
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,460
- You're so good at acting.
-I'm Seo Bo Ra.

495
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,600
Teacher Sim.

496
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,310
Even if you run away, it's useless. I know everything.

497
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,320
Aish. I'm screwed.

498
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,070
Where and how am I supposed to take all this?

499
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:47,070
First, you already knew who X was, right?

500
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:51,880
Then did you really purposely not catch him all this time?

501
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,870
I wanted to protect the kids. I'm sorry.

502
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,470
Even so, you can't help them out like this, Teacher.

503
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:03,620
Still, I can't just sit still and watch them get caught.

504
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,420
Technically, they did such things because of their flawed school.

505
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,490
I just didn't think isn't something the kids should get blamed for if nothing happens to the school.

506
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,370
If you put it that way, every crime has a reason.

507
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,020
Why are you making them into criminals?

508
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:21,730
Then what, are you going to put them all in jail? With X too?

509
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,460
Yes, of course.

510
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,600
Because I'm a police officer. I have to go by the rules.

511
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,590
If they did wrong, it's the law that they receive punishment.

512
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:37,190
Who's X? Who is X?

513
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:54,950
Alright then. Let's go until the end.

514
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,450
I have a plan too.

515
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:08,550
How on earth did they find out?

516
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,160
Hey, did you see Kim Hui Chan's expression earlier?

517
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,620
You saw it right? I cursed them with my eyes.

518
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,570
I could even hear it with my ears.

519
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,130
It was so nerve wrecking!

520
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,490
How did you guys find out?

521
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,710
Well...

522
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,860
I tested him for now.

523
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,380
But he definitely knew something.

524
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,400
It's obvious.

525
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,710
There's no other evidence to find. I think he knows this hideout.

526
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:47,640
Since four people already know, it's not weird for us to get caught any time.

527
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,990
Kim Hui Chan has been lurking around here a lot lately anyway.

528
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:53,070
How do you know that?

529
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,370
Should I just expose him at this point?

530
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:26,680
Awesome. Hey. You should study with this kind of brain.

531
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:32,470
I'm smart but it's just because I don't study. Right?

532
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:36,740
True. You're a little better than dolphins.

533
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:40,390
Hey hey hey! A bit lower or better?

534
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,050
Hey, dolphins are smart.

535
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,890
Hey, a dolphin is really smart. Of course I meant you're worse.

536
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:48,480
How dare you compare me to a mammal? Their intelligence level is only 80 to 90!

537
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:54,430
This will be our last time with X's hideout then.

538
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,440
Let's go.

539
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,730
If I study, it'll be the end for you being first place!

540
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,020
I was generous enough to compare you to a dolphin.

541
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,260
By the way, we almost got in a huge trouble. I don't even want to think about what could've happened.

542
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,910
It's a relief this time, but we shouuld be careful from now on.

543
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,520
Kim Hui Chan will not back away like this.

544
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,160
It seems so.

545
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,120
Hey. By the way, your recent work is really fun.

546
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,160
My recent work?

547
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:43,430
This content...

548
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:04,010
Hey. Why are you throwing this away?

549
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,180
The drawing is weird. Also the content is-

550
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,750
Hey! This is also really funny.

551
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:15,290
Don't you think you're too harsh on yourself? This is funny.

552
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,360
No no.

553
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:39,520
What... happened?

554
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:57,350
I just posted it the way you drew it. Why do you think you have no talent?

555
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,490
There are now two people who said it was fun.

556
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,420
How could you think of this...

557
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:16,320
These are all the drawings you drew all this time. There's a ton, right?

558
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,070
How could you...

559
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:22,590
Your hard work can't just be buried.

560
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:26,650
Just working hard doesn't mean it'll work out.

561
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:31,300
Like you said, no matter how hard you work, it may not go well.

562
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,970
What a person named Ra Eun Ho drew and what she tried to do all her life,

563
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,720
what kind of dream she couldn't fulfill,

564
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:42,260
people might not know.

565
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:47,330
But Eun Ho... I know.

566
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,670
I saw how hard you worked.

567
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:58,850
I'll stay be your side so... let's not give up.

568
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,010
Let's go until the end.

569
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:42,400
Thank you for always giving me courage ❤

570
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,450
What the? What is this?

571
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,920
Is this a heart?

572
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,330
Did she just send me a heart or what?

573
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:57,890
What does this mean?

574
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:01,620
Eun Pal: Thank you for always giving me courage ❤

575
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,500
Eun Pal!

576
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,990
What?

577
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,280
I received a heart.

578
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,220
So what? Why? What?

579
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,620
I mean... why did she send a heart?

580
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,530
There are a lot of other symbols, why did it have to be a heart?

581
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,580
What does this mean?

582
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:48,470
What? Why? It doesn't mean anything.

583
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,520
Sorry!

584
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,270
What is this? Is someone chasing after you?

585
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:05,640
No? What would?

586
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,340
Hey, Hyeon Tae Woon!
Hey!

587
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,660
You! Why-

588
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,920
Why? I called him because I have something to say to him.

589
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,440
It hasn't been long since you two were fighting.

590
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,020
Why are you guys like this now?

591
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:34,090
Ra Eun Ho, really.

592
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:38,450
Why do I keep thinking of her? Why do I keep wanting to see her!

593
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:41,010
What the heck is he doing?

594
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:47,880
But... why does she keep...

595
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,860
avoiding me?

596
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,000
Hey.

597
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:13,280
You heard what I just said, right?

598
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,490
I miss you.

599
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:27,520
So whenever I miss you, stay right by my side so I can see you whenever I want to.

600
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:39,990
What are you saying? How did you know I was here?

601
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:45,460
Can't we just stay close to each other? I had a hard time looking for you.

602
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,000
How could you only think about yourself?

603
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,200
I only think about you too.

604
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,030
Helen Keller said these words:

605
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:14,450
If you don't have a dream, your life is nothing.

606
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:22,780
True dream means just silently walking ahead.

607
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:32,730
At the end of that path, the place where we can meet isn't a luxurious destination,

608
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:36,560
it is the beautiful footprint that we walk on.

609
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,820
Hi, hi!

610
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,520
Hello.

611
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,790
You waited long, right?
Yes.

612
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,410
I will now reveal your report cards in the order of your ranking.

613
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,480
Go Jin Shik.

614
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,320
I found a good black bean noodle restaurant.

615
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,390
Seo Bo Ra. Song Dae Hwi. Ahn Jeong Il.

616
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,930
Congrats.

617
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:08,250
Seung Eun. Sa Rang. Byung Goo.

618
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,630
Yoo Bit Na. Yoon Kyung Woo. Yoon Jae Yeok.

619
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,020
Grade report: Rank #1

620
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,920
Grade report: Rank #1

621
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,330
Lee Myung Jin. Guk Dae. Eun Jeong Hui.

622
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:19,350
And up to Soo Yeoung and Chae Yeon.

623
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:22,120
Please come forward.

624
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:27,590
Deok Soo. Yoon Hee. Tae Woon. Nam Joo. Yeong Geon.

625
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,620
Heun il didn't show up today.

626
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:50,100
Fifth place? This is your rank?

627
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,900
How can you not do anything properly?

628
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,940
I cleared all the mess you made regarding the school violence and all.

629
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,890
But your end of the term grade fell even more?

630
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,710
So what?

631
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,970
What? What did you just say?

632
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,880
So what do you want me to do?

633
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,810
Kim Hui Chan! First the School Violence Conference, now you receive this kind of grade.

634
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:17,350
Are you not sorry to me at all? You didn't do anything wrong?

635
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,470
I'm not sorry at all.

636
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:22,990
This kid, really.

637
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:26,500
Mom always said this.

638
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,770
My son... didn't do anything wrong.

639
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,620
Hui Chan.

640
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,560
♫ I pray for you. To you♫

641
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,670
♫ I want to convey I'm sorry ♫

642
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:58,390
♫ I pray for you always♫

643
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:00,500
Did you miss me?

644
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,820
Are you crazy. Why would I...

645
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,530
♫ Because it was very sad you didn't know me. ♫

646
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:14,370
♫ Actually always right behind you ♫

♫ I pray for you ♫
Yea.

648
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,640
I missed you.

649
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,600
♫ When they fill up and overflows ♫

650
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:37,610
I think... I hid my heart all this time. So...

651
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,260
Your confession made my heart flutter.

652
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,050
♫ Why didn't you even know?♫

653
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:50,120
So... my feelings...

654
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,400
What I'm saying is...

655
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,800
♫ I want to convey I'm sorry. ♫

656
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:59,430
So what you're saying is...

657
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:02,100
♫ I didn't mean anything.♫

658
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,430
You like me, right?

659
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:09,170
♫Because I was very sad when you didn't know me. ♫

660
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:15,710
So what I'm saying is...

661
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,340
♫ I'm still far from it. ♫

662
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:30,310
♫ In becoming an adult. It seems I'm just growing taller. ♫

663
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:35,150
♫ I'm still young. ♫

664
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,980
Today is day one for us.

665
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:43,330
♫ I'm shouting to you I'm sorry again. ♫

666
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:48,620
♫ I hope it reaches you, I hope you know my true heart. ♫

667
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:54,860
♫ I miss you, my love ♫

668
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:01,420
♫ And I miss you, my love ♫

669
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:04,690
♫ If you can hear me like this. ♫

670
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:09,420
♫ Please call me. My Heart. ♫

671
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,520
♫You come running to me. ♫

672
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:19,420
♫ Don't be upset that you don't know me. ♫

673
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:24,930
♫ You fool, take care of me as you always have. ♫
