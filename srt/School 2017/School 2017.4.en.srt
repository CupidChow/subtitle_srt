1
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,390
Cowardly bastard.

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,570
Shut up before I expose the truth.

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,500
I'm thinking of that too. How could I waste this horrible school.

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,660
It would be really fun if the others found out what you did.

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,080
Shut up you murdering bastard.

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,950
Do you want to die, you punk?

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,650
Are you crazy?

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,680
Calm down!

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,940
What is this?

10
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,500
Rascals!

11
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,710
Song Dae Hwi.

12
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,450
And Hyeon Tae Woon.

13
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,700
You two performed serious violence against each other

14
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,270
in a classroom setting.

15
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,930
Do you admit?

16
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,400
Yes.

17
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,470
Yeah.

18
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:59,020
T-teacher... I only tried to stop them, you see...

19
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,760
Ra Eun Ho, even though you knew about them you didn't report it to the school.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,640
This is a sin!

21
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,830
What?

22
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,370
Teacher, Ra Eun Ho really didn't do anything wrong.

23
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,500
Right! I just ran in there to stop them.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,770
Do I need to talk to you about sinning again?

25
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,410
This is a serious misdeed within the school!

26
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,890
I will give you guys a special opportunity.

27
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,620
I will open up the school committee for violence or

28
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,410
you guys can receive punishment.

29
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,780
Song Dae Hwi. Hyeon Tae Woon. Do 50 laps in the gym.

30
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,250
And Ra Eun Ho, 20 laps.

31
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,970
You will be doing this for 10 days starting today.

32
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,730
Go!

33
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,240
You two were the ones fighting, why should I run-

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,660
I'm sorry. But no matter how much we tell him,

35
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,080
he won't listen.

36
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,030
You go and talk to him.

37
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,760
- Shut up.
- Come on.

38
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,730
You could just use your dad to get out of this again.

39
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,010
This bastard just wants to die. Don't talk rashly, you jerk.

40
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,490
Quiet.

41
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,140
That day, those two acted very strange.

42
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,110
They were indeed not nice to each other, but their running

43
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,220
seemed like they were bothering themselves.

44
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,040
The two of their edged stories

45
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
the fact that it was also hurting me,

46
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,650
I didn't know back then.

47
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:10,300
School 2017 - To meet on the way

48
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,870
Amazing!
Korea University
 Episode 4

49
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,380
Teacher, is it real? It's not a prank, is it?

50
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,200
I didn't know you were this good.
[Korea University Webtoon Media Final Examination Information]

51
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,540
Omg! Omg!

52
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,510
To think that you can get early admission privileges by placing in the top 3.
Transcripts: 25%, Student Records: 35%

53
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,100
Eun Ho, it seems like you can go to Korea University.

54
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,250
Well about that...

55
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,000
There is a problem.

56
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,860
Teacher, please help me.

57
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,890
If she gets in the top three of the competition, she can attend Korea University.

58
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,940
The reference ratio of portfolio and school records is quite high.

59
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,860
Please, please remove the demerits.

60
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,470
I really need to go to Korea University.

61
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,920
So, catch that guy.

62
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,430
You said that you will.

63
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,450
That didn't turn out the way I wanted either...

64
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,000
If you don't catch X or whatever his name is,

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,630
don't dream about removing the demerits.

66
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,450
Eun Ho. There's still ten days before the deadline.

67
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,650
Let's think about another way.

68
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,020
How?

69
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,560
Huh?

70
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,030
I mean, I don't think you guys are on good terms either.

71
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,610
R-right.

72
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,990
Anyway, let's think about it.

73
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,000
But what about your portfolio? You said that was important as well.

74
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,430
Portfolio?

75
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,000
I should talk about that.

76
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,870
I must be crazy. Teacher, I'll go get it.

77
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,240
Did it dissapear? My sketchbook?

78
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,180
No way, Teacher! I'm in big trouble if I don't have that.

79
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,960
Come find it when you have graduated.

80
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,330
It's not me.

81
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,930
You must have come to get it because it wasn't you.

82
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,380
It looks like he took off with it when he broke into the teacher's office.

83
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,790
X or whatever his name is.

84
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,200
That bastard, seriously...

85
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,350
Ra Eun Ho.

86
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,310
Don't forget to go to the gym with Hyeon Tae Woon and Song Dae Hwi.

87
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,420
I will kill Hyeon Tae Woon and Song Dae Hwi.

88
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,840
My life is so twisted because of some two guys.

89
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,380
I keep getting punished. It's annoying.

90
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,830
Hey. Think of it in a good way. Let's use this as our opportunity.

91
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,050
Find out who the real X is as you stick close to them.

92
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,880
Starting from today and 10 days onward, you will clean every nook and cranny of the school.

93
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,980
The punishment is your responsibility.

94
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,190
Once you're done, the three of you guys will be reviewed.

95
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,350
If any of you run away, it's nullity.

96
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,800
Can't I just get my punishment and be done with it.

97
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,880
Are you crazy?

98
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,650
The punishment is a little harsh...

99
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,570
You could just tattle to your father and get out of this situation.

100
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,780
If you just want to continue living off your father,

101
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,490
you are free to do so.

102
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,430
What are we going to do? What am I doing in this situation, all because of you two?

103
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,970
I'm sorry. Don't do any cleaning, I'll do it.

104
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,880
You shouldn't have tagged along, Dummy.

105
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,170
What?

106
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,520
Cleaning...

107
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,120
Then,

108
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,670
you guys should help me.

109
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,030
Let's find X together.

110
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,470
- Are you crazy?
- X?

111
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,470
You guys heard it right? I got to the final acceptance process for Korea University.

112
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,100
but because of my school records that's all out of my reach.

113
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,780
Also, that X bastard has my sketchbook.

114
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,600
What about that childish sketchbook...

115
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,390
Childish? It contains all the different ideas.

116
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,020
Why would X do that...

117
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,970
It's probably childish rebellion,

118
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,210
since they don't have the guts for their age.

119
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,200
Rebellion?

120
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,980
Maybe they have a childish inferiority complex

121
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,860
In my opinion

122
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,810
he's a psychopath.

123
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,400
X blends in with other students, and act normally.

124
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:09,030
But, X stores the corpses in school.

125
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,960
What does that have to do with X's doings?

126
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,500
To divert attention

127
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,930
Isn't a psychopath a little...

128
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:29,210
Oh really? It's not to that bad, right?

129
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,210
Yeah, right.

130
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,840
What? Are your feelings hurt? Why?

131
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,460
My feelings aren't hurt. Does that even make any sense, a psychopath?

132
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,150
Why not! He could really be as bad as I imagined!

133
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,910
Wow, your imagination's really running wild. Seriously.

134
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,280
That's why you should help me catch X.

135
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,130
You understand how desperate I am to be asking you?

136
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,980
Will you go out with me?

137
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,300
- What?
- You don't want to?

138
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,560
Then how about a kiss?

139
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,900
Are you...crazy?

140
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,700
I probably am.

141
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,940
That's what my heart is like, unbelievable and flustered.

142
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,800
Why do I have to suddenly find X with you?

143
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,180
Don't you dare leave!

144
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,920
Don't you know we have joint liability? You will die.

145
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,570
What am I supposed to clean with then? My hands? I need a broom!

146
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,870
Why do you throw?

147
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,430
- What are you doing?
- Ah, I'm sorry!

148
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,770
Come here!

149
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,080
I told you to wait outside!

150
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,900
What is that there?

151
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,180
That's just a storage room.

152
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,510
A storage room?

153
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,090
Do you have the key for it?

154
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,620
I'm not sure. It hasn't been used in a long time and is supposed to be demolished soon.

155
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,890
I think it got thrown somewhere in the study hall.

156
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,860
Try to find the keys for this.

157
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,100
Are you an elementary student? Why did you guys even fight...

158
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,550
Hey.

159
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,940
- What are you doing?
- Wait a second.

160
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,380
You're bleeding.

161
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,780
Blood?

162
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,670
When did that happen?

163
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,620
You were dilly dallying everywhere...

164
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,810
You scraped it badly.

165
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,630
I did...

166
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,690
Here.

167
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,880
It's not like you to carry around this stuff.

168
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,200
My friend bought it for me because motorcycle accidents can get you badly hurt-

169
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,760
A friend? Your friend rides a motorcycle too?

170
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,170
I'm going.

171
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,920
They were best friends.

172
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,900
- Best friends?
- Yeah, they were in the same class together in 1st grade.

173
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,960
They were totally best friends but after a big fight they separated.

174
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,880
Why'd they fight?

175
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,540
The rumor said that it was because of Im Joon Gi.

176
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,520
Im Joon Gi?

177
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,570
What? What is it?

178
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,210
That, that,

179
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:04,180
That Im Joon Gi guy died.

180
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,390
It was during that bus accident you experienced.

181
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,270
431?

182
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,980
The three of them were best friends but- was it the day of the funeral procession? They got in a huge fight that day.

183
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,290
Yeah so why'd they fight?

184
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,480
This was a rumor too,

185
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,140
but that accident was apparently caused by Hyeon Tae Woon.

186
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,020
But Hyun Tae Woon's father pushed it all onto Im Joon Gi.

187
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,890
Really?

188
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,970
Tragic Bus Accident's Main Culprit Is Dropout Student

189
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,140
One Year Ago

190
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,310
F-Father...

191
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,140
Joon Gi and I got into an accident...

192
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,480
What? Speak properly, what are you saying?

193
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,150
Joon Gi...

194
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,070
He...

195
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,310
Where are you? Where?!

196
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,810
Joon Gi. Let go of me... Im Joon Gi!

197
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,160
Tae Woon! Hyeon Tae Woon!

198
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,240
I said let go of me, Tae Woon, Tae Woon.

199
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,480
Hyeon Tae Woon!

200
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,840
Why do you keep looking at a picture of someone dead?

201
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,690
That family must have gotten a lot of compensation money.

202
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,840
I mean, I heard that the kid that was riding with him and survived was the chairman's son?

203
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,310
Every mention of him was taken out of the papers.

204
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,370
Since they ended up putting all the blame on the child who died.

205
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,570
They must have gotten a ton of money for it, huh?

206
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,220
Leave, I have to study.

207
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,470
What are you getting all prickly for?

208
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,070
You study every day!

209
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,560
- Do you really have to go this far?
- If I don't I'll be trampled on.

210
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,020
Because if you don't have power,

211
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,840
you take the blame for everything.

212
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,010
Take it easy, okay?

213
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,270
Teenage Dropout Takes Lives Of Citizens Through Reckless Speeding

214
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,840
There really is,

215
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,040
no mention of Hyeon Tae Woon.

216
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,410
Even though he's a rude jerk,

217
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,880
he didn't strike me as a bad guy.

218
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,080
What he didn't? He slipped out with money and his background.

219
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,150
Then what about what X did? Why would a bad guy like him do those things?

220
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:23,850
Just a joke for killing time. Anyway his father will protect all.

221
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,280
You can just use your father to get out of this, too.

222
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,720
This punk wants to die. Don't blabber anything, you jerk.

223
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,120
Ugh, having to clean cause of these jerks

224
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,810
That's right,

225
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,040
That guy and justice?

226
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,050
Nope. No way.

227
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,670
By the way, the upcoming demerits presentation event,

228
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,060
When was the presentation?

229
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,520
I think there's a week left.

230
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,040
Anyway, I want X to appear and flip the principal off. Real big.

231
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,110
-Big flip off?
- Secretly take a picture of the bad deeds he does..

232
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,140
and give him demerits just like us.

233
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,540
Don't you think it would be super funny if we made this into a video?

234
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,550
Oh yeah, it would be funny.

235
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,800
Song Dae Hwi is X?

236
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,450
I doubt the egotistical Hyeon Tae Woon would fight for justice.

237
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,950
If that's how you're going to look at it, Song Dae Hwi's not much different.

238
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,810
Song Dae Hwi does so much for all the kids though

239
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,210
Was it the funeral procession day? Im Joon Gi's coffin was brought to the school.

240
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,680
But Song Dae Hwi was taking a test and showed up for not one bit of it.

241
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,010
Really?

242
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,950
Yeah. Hyeon Tae Woon totally blew a gasket over it.

243
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,290
It's not even like it was someone else. His best friend was the one who died.

244
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:31,250
Could you take a test after that? Honestly? I think he's a bit like a monster.

245
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,550
What good did Tae Woon do to be able to cause such a fuss?

246
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:38,530
Something definitely went on between the two, but no one but them knows what it is.

247
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,850
But if Song Dae Hwi is X,

248
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,660
why would he do that? He who already doesn't have enough time to study.

249
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,730
To relieve stress? It must be stressful being number 1 in the school.

250
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,470
Hey, since we're talking about this, doesn't he kind of seem like a pervert?

251
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,950
I guess he wouldn't really fight for justice either.

252
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,350
Can we believe Song Dae Hwi?

253
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,610
We're desperate

254
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,910
We have to fix it quickly.

255
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,010
Ra Eun Ho - 55

256
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,300
If it goes on like this, I'm going to end up with 100 points.

257
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,760
I think this reward and punishment system won't go away until you catch X.

258
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,410
Class 2-1's current demerit points

259
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,300
Everyone, be quiet!

260
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,460
Kids, keep quiet.

261
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,780
Kids!

262
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,750
Keep quiet.

263
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,730
Ki- Demerits for everyone!

264
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,840
If I do that,

265
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,660
will you quiet down?

266
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,000
I'd like it if our class didn't report demerits from now on.

267
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,430
Really, Teacher?

268
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:13,230
Secretly accusing your friends...I'd like it if at least our class didn't do that.

269
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,420
How can we believe this, Teacher?

270
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,090
I believe in you.

271
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,870
So from now, for every report that someone from our class submits,

272
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,690
I'm going to run laps around the field.

273
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:33,730
I'm going to do it until not even one report is submitted.

274
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,980
Ehh that's nonsense.

275
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,410
The choice of whether or not to do this to your friends

276
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,870
is up to you all now.

277
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,490
Teacher!

278
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,650
Yes, Eun Ho.

279
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,760
Thank you.

280
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,760
Are you really going to run?

281
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,540
If you all don't report anything, it's possible I won't have to.

282
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,850
All the other classes are going to continue doing it. If only our class doesn't do it, what's going to happen?

283
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,260
Adults are pretty awful for making this kind of problem.

284
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,820
If you keep being like this...

285
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,200
Is finding X going well?

286
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,460
I'm close to getting him but... not yet.

287
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,700
Will you report your friend?

288
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,100
Teacher, if I end up not being able to go to college because of him,

289
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,280
the rest of my life is going to be ruined.

290
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,720
If I don't go to university, I won't even be able to find a proper job. So...

291
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,850
So I didn't do wrong...

292
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,450
Right?

293
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,330
Come get it when you graduate

294
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,180
Yes, the final.

295
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,650
My Eun Ho only has her final acceptance process left for Korea University.

296
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:49,560
What do you mean a prestigious college? Okay, I'll treat you.

297
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,650
"Let's make up." Doesn't it mean that?

298
00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:00,250
They know you're looking for their contacts, so they're scared.

299
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:05,800
Makes sense. Those two are the only ones who know how badly I needed this.

300
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,410
I'm sure X is one of those two though.

301
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,530
But, you know, both of them are kind of disappointing.

302
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,850
One of them pushed his wrongdoings onto his dead friend

303
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:23,620
And the other had his nose stuck in an exam during his friend's final sendoff.

304
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:30,260
Why would such selfish people do what X did then?

305
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,210
He did a big harm to the school, and rescued me with the drone.

306
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,980
I thought it was for justice...

307
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:46,250
"Justice", my foot! One of them was relieving stress from studying and the other was playing a joke!

308
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,930
Where? Where are you going?

309
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,410
You need to make a delivery!

310
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,430
Mother, I have a very important meeting with friends today.

311
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,540
I have a business too.

312
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,120
You're kidding. Have you been drinking with those unemployed punks again?

313
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,850
Mom..again, you're so precise. I'll be back!

314
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:22,040
Hey, hey! He never comes to his senses.

315
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,550
I'll be back.

316
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,580
Where are yo going?!

317
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,330
Ugh those punks. My orders are all delayed. I'm going crazy!

318
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,420
Is there a delivery to be made?

319
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,050
Where is it?

320
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:54,300
Really. I really mean it. Starting next month,

321
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,060
I'll pay the rent on time without missing a single one!

322
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,380
You actually have the nerve to say that?

323
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,080
Would I fall for this lies again?

324
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,160
Pay what you owe in full and vacate this shop by the end of the month!

325
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:13,120
Please wait! If you act like this all of a sudden- where are you going? Please overlook it just this once! Please just onc-

326
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,650
Mom!

327
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,400
What are you doing?!

328
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,350
Oh my, student. This isn't a time for a student to be raising his voice.

329
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:29,000
Why did you come out instead of studying? Hurry in and study.

330
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,780
Is that what's important right now?!

331
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,850
You must have been really shocked.

332
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:59,030
It's okay. Even my dad misused his house collateral.

333
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,160
It's always chaotic. They all live like this.

334
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,420
- Thank you.
- What for?

335
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:13,900
I mean, you even brought up your dad in order to make me feel better.

336
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,750
But still, you study well.

337
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,660
You're set for life. What do you have to worry about?

338
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:32,560
I wish that were true. Not having to worry about money just by studying.

339
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,850
I'm sure it'll work out that way. You're the most hard-working person I know, after all.

340
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,420
Hard-working...

341
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,420
Can you really break out of something just by working hard?

342
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,350
Even if you sprint like your life depends on it,

343
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,750
is it possible catch up to someone when your starting line is so different?

344
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,110
Total number of reports 62

345
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,720
Sixty-two demerits ...

346
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,180
I will be back.

347
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,810
Will he really run?

348
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,870
Ah. I told him not to do it...

349
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,870
He really will?

350
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,300
62 points

351
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,830
How is he going to run that much?

352
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:39,060
Hey, guys. The teacher is running so fast..

353
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,940
How many laps has he done so far...

354
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,420
36 and a half laps.

355
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,670
Isn't he going to pass out if he continues?

356
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,590
I doubt it. He'll stop soon.

357
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,650
Let's go out there fast.

358
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,630
Come out?

359
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,900
Why are they like this suddenly?

360
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,000
This wouldn't disappear by doing that.

361
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,870
Hey Eul..

362
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,300
You're not going to go out? Your boyfriend is over there.

363
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,450
I just feel like sitting back and watching for once.

364
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,080
- He looks like he'll collapse.
- He really does.

365
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,670
How many laps now?

366
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,800
He really did a lot.

367
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,390
He may be utterly exhausted.

368
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,640
He is already exhausted.

369
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,720
He really needs to stop.

370
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,100
Wow he finished

371
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,900
It's over.

372
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,550
Should he go to the hospital?

373
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,560
Please stop.

374
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,470
Teacher...

375
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,130
Ah, what to do?!

376
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,040
Oh my!

377
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,090
I think he's dehydrated.

378
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,840
Should we call a doctor?

379
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,550
Stupid

380
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,090
Ah, Teacher...

381
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,100
Why did you purposely suffer in this hot day?

382
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,750
Right?

383
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,580
But it's surprisingly not hard at all, Teacher.

384
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,960
What did you say, you punk?!

385
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,040
Say it again. What are you going to do? Turn youself in?

386
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,410
Is that lousy kid that great?!

387
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,780
"Lousy kid"?

388
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,370
Because you keep acting like this, Father, I can't even honor Joon Gi's memory.

389
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:49,610
I feel like even just the act of thinking of him is a crime. I feel so sorry towards him-

390
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,300
I did all I could!

391
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:57,010
I protected my son, and I took moral responsibility too. I paid enough compensation.

392
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,510
If you're going to live under me and my methods, then live as I tell you to.

393
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,510
Your methods? You mean buying off everyone?!

394
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,340
This punk...

395
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,290
Hyeon Tae Woon!

396
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,590
Hey! You said you found an awesome restaurant. Let's head over there fast!

397
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,610
I'm starving.

398
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,070
Hello!

399
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,610
Are you okay?

400
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:34,350
Would I be okay? I got beaten up by my dad.

401
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,050
Let's just tell your mom.

402
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,890
Mom's rank is way higher than dad's..

403
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,740
Are you joking about me not having a mom?

404
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,710
You don't have one... I'm sorry.

405
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,590
I'm really sorry.

406
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,210
If you just pity me so directly like this, I feel so miserable.

407
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,180
No, no. What is the pitiful?! You have huge money and you have huge rudeness as well.

408
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,630
Ru-

409
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,850
Get on.
- Huh? Where?

410
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,170
You said "let's go". I know a great place to eat.

411
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:20,040
Our summer days are passing by

412
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,120
Whatever you do, you're full of fighting spirit.

413
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,290
This is seriously really good. Can I have another?

414
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:31,210
Of course. Since you're paying for it.

415
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,250
Hey, what do you...

416
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,860
The dazzling blue sky

417
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,340
Eww, gross.

418
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,340
Trees dancing outside of the window

419
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,400
You said you were buying!
- When did I do that?!

420
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,310
I said it'd be delicious.

421
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:52,090
"If that's unfair, I'll pay for it." You can pay for it thinking that it's me.

422
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,240
I hope every wish come true

423
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,600
I saved you from troubles.

424
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,460
Bully...

425
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:06,440
Bully? I was going to buy you a good hand-made ice cream..

426
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,140
Hey...

427
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,520
Who do you think I am?

428
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,410
Do you think I will just fall for a hand-made ice cream... Where is it?

429
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,760
Let's go. Yay!

430
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,790
Do you want to eat ice cream with me that much?

431
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,040
Lose weight.

432
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,750
What?! What...

433
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,470
Over there. Did you fix it?

434
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,140
What?

435
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:54,170
That watch from earlier... It's broken, isn't it!

436
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,670
Just buy a new one.

437
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,980
It will be more expensive to get it repaired.

438
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,180
Just do it. He has a lot of money.

439
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,240
I'm not sure if we have the right faceplate for it.

440
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,280
Wait a minute.

441
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,910
I've seen this before.

442
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,010
You saw it at the class room.

443
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,410
On the bus...

444
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,910
Bus?

445
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,810
Hey Geum Do High School! Geum Do High School!

446
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,990
Wake up! Geum Do High Schooler! Geum Do High Schooler!

447
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:21,260
Come to your senses! Geum Do High Schooler.

448
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:37,280
You were saved by Joon Gi, huh?

449
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,460
Then when he saved me he...

450
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,820
Song Dae Hwi

451
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,010
Tae Woon! Are you okay?

452
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,510
I'm fine but the bus...

453
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,770
Please help me!

454
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,310
Are you alright?

455
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,220
Help!

456
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,320
Are you okay?

457
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,050
Geum Do High Schooler! GeumDo High Schooler!

458
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,450
Try to wake up!

459
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:43,740
Mister! Please wake up!

460
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,460
Joon Gi! Hey! Hey, Joon Gi!!

461
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,390
You nee- you need to get out!

462
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,440
Come back out!

463
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,420
HEY! Get the hell outta there, you bastard!

464
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,200
Oh no, what do we do...

465
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,640
No! Joon Gi! Joon Gi! Come out!

466
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,260
You have to come out!

467
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,530
Please!

468
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:42,270
Please come out! Please, please come out!

469
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,180
Are you okay?

470
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,370
My friend is in there

471
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,980
You have to come out, Joon Gi!

472
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,520
You bastard!

473
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:22,720
It must've been painful. Very.

474
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,440
You, too. It must have been painful.

475
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:50,480
Class 2-1 number of reports total: 48

476
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,500
If he continues, he will faint.

477
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,710
Still a lot left.

478
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:04,650
That's so much running

479
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,940
Teach! Hang in there!

480
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,130
Teach, Fighting!

481
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,100
Fighting!

482
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,630
Fighting!

483
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,560
Fighting!

484
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,160
Fighting! Fighting!

485
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,740
Fighting!

486
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,050
You're almost done!

487
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,310
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

488
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,000
Fighting!

489
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,450
What to do...

490
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:30,930
Ah, I feel so bad...

491
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:35,460
- Teacher, no matter how wrong it seems,
- Hang in there, Teacher!

492
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,080
- no matter how much I don't like it,
- Fighting, Teacher!

493
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,500
- turning in the culprit is the right thing to do, right?
- Fighting!

494
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,040
Don't faint!

495
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,400
I have to live too, don't I?

496
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:01,790
Eun Bbal! Get your head on straight! Is this any time to worry about Tae Woon and Dae Hwi?

497
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,770
I only have two days left until the turn-in date.

498
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:10,340
No matter which of them is X,

499
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,980
I feel like they both have their own legitimate reasons for it.

500
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,540
Have you forgotten what you've been put through already?

501
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:21,260
Because of those punks, your mother even had to beg on her knees!

502
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,000
You're right...

503
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,330
Korea University

504
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,230
Being in the 6th level in school,

505
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,910
it's a level where you even deserve to be treated like a human.

506
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,330
Drop out?!

507
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,620
Please let go of it this time. Please!

508
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,760
Why did you have to go into the Teacher's office and make this complicated mess just to annoy everyone!

509
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,640
You must have a death wish.

510
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,410
- It wasn't me!
- I oughtta!

511
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,590
Demerits.

512
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:57,990
Because of demerits or whatever, we're suffering..

513
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:02,090
Apparently it's all because of you! So you can catch that X or whoever he is.

514
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,310
You perfectly set a trap, right?

515
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:25,400
There will be no excuses whatsoever. Please watch, they'll perfectly get caught.

516
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,340
The student X .. will definitely show up on a day like this.

517
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,790
It's not even chasing some Bridal Mask.

518
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,210
What was that?

519
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,740
It was nothing. Let's go in.

520
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,450
This rodent-like rascal. Just wait till I catch you.

521
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,690
Let's go.

522
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,360
I should just stomp on him to death.

523
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,590
Starting now,

524
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:00,440
the students with the most demerit points, when you hear your name called,

525
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,170
please move to the edification chairs.

526
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:12,470
The one with the most demerits, 62 points: Ra Eun Ho. 51 points: Hwang Myeong Geun

527
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:15,170
Ra Eun Ho!

528
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:17,840
Come out immediately! What are you doing?!

529
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,210
Hwang Myeong Geun

530
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,080
Total of..

531
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,100
forty-five demerits..Park Jeong Hye.

532
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:41,120
Forty-three demerits...Bang Mi So. Forty-one demerits ... Chae Yeong Jeong.

533
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,960
Forty-one demerits.. Yeo Seung Won.

534
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,880
Forty demerits.. Jeon Ho Seong.

535
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,800
Thirty-nine demerits.. Jeon Sang Gil.

536
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,070
Thirty-nine demerits.. Han Na Rae.

537
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:58,180
Thirty-eight demerits, Do Si Ho

538
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,970
He took the bait!

539
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,050
Guards

540
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:32,560
Let's instroduce the one with the most demerits and Guemdo High School.

541
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,410
Leaving leftovers
10 demerits

542
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,190
Oh!

543
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,410
Do not laugh!

544
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,840
Apologize! Don't laugh!

545
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,630
Dress Code Violation
10 demerits

546
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,710
I told you not to laugh!

547
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,650
Unauthorized speculation: 15 demerits

548
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,110
fly-tipping 15 points

549
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,550
Total demerits: 85 points
Principal

550
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:14,210
You're expelled!

551
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,200
What is this..

552
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:21,550
You're laughing?

553
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:23,420
You're laughing?!

554
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,490
Hahahahaha Funny, isn't it?

555
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,440
But, how are you any different?

556
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,910
What is different?

557
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,080
You abandoned friendship

558
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,480
To all images of friends,

559
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:02,180
Are you happy, now that you've gotten merits?

560
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,180
He's over here!

561
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,600
Catch him.

562
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,660
You need to catch him! Catch him immediately! Hurry!

563
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,250
Why aren't you running?

564
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,580
Stop right there!

565
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,700
He went this way!

566
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,420
Catch him!

567
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,130
Hey!

568
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,760
I'm sure he went this way. You didn't see him?

569
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,580
I was debating.

570
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:53,280
If I just lift this fabric up, I will be able to prove my innocence and reveal who X is...

571
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,920
It was the perfect timing.

572
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,040
Come this way.

573
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:36,170
If you ask why I didn't catch X, which I very much looked forward to,

574
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,810
Do it, do it!

575
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,820
Could it be because in the process of finding X,

576
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:48,290
I gained friends first?

577
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:55,110
It's not a bold hero who bravely put the school through hell

578
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,260
Shut up, you murdering bastard!

579
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:05,450
They're just 18-year-old friends with pain and hurt.

580
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:18,740
Eighteen. An age where you can become friends with anyone.

581
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:28,180
Could we possibly gain true friends in this school?

582
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:34,940
What are you doing?

583
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,030
What is this?

584
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:37,460
What's that teacher doing?

585
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,310
Why's he going up there?

586
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,890
What's going on?

587
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:44,270
What is he doing?

588
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:48,010
Are they newly putting that up?

589
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,640
What?

590
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,610
Is the reward and punishment system over?

591
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,510
I think it's over!

592
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,610
Wow, that's awesome!

593
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,320
Have you lost your mind?!

594
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:21,850
You call yourself a teacher? All you do is do what the kids want.

595
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,860
Put the demerit chart back up immediately.

596
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,920
E-excuse me, sir

597
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:32,010
Put it up already! Don't do anything useless.

598
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,540
I can't do that.

599
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,350
What?!

600
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:53,190
I can't put that demerit chart back up.

601
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,480
Are you crazy?

602
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,700
Yes. I'm fine with being called crazy.

603
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:02,620
I can't teach the kids to rat out one another so they can be rewarded.

604
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,650
Above all, I'm a teacher.

605
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:07,060
Nice catch.

606
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:15,600
I will write an official apology if you tell me to do so.

607
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:30,410
Gosh, school's environment is so messed up!

608
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:34,880
The students and teachers are the same! Write an official apology immediately!

609
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,030
You're so foolish.

610
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:10,010
Board of Education

611
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,120
You lost a good opportunity.

612
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:16,920
I'll be chosen for this competition.

613
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,420
This time, I'm first. I have a feeling.

614
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:25,610
You're such a positive person, really.

615
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,040
I wonder who X really was.

616
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,670
Song Dae Hwi

617
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:39,640
Really?! Song Dae-

618
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:49,580
Why? Why is Song Dae Hwi X?

619
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:55,020
He did what I asked him to do.

620
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,650
But during the reward and punishment system announcement this time,

621
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:02,600
I really wish X would appear and put the principal through sh*t.

622
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,340
Sh*t?

623
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:08,470
Film the principal doing bad things, and then we can give the demerits.

624
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:12,300
Wouldn't something like this be so funny to make as a film?

625
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,030
Yeah. It sounds like fun.

626
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,530
Huh?

627
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,780
He's here!

628
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,750
Hurry! Hurry! It's X! X is here!

629
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,760
Hey. Hey!

630
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,520
I knew it! Song Dae Hwi is X!

631
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,330
Do you think I won't know just because you aren't wearing your hood?

632
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:00,600
You're really getting on my nerves.

633
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:16,070
♫  Believing now in this moment I ♫

634
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:20,500
♫  Sometimes feel insecure and uneasy but ♫
