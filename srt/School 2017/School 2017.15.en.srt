1
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,910
I told you not to go around doing careless things.

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,690
X?

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,460
This stuff!

4
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,150
Ah, why are you doing this?

5
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,580
What is going on here?

6
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,520
What are you going to do if that video clip is revealed in the media?

7
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,730
It won't go that far.

8
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,660
This is what you called incompetency.

9
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,070
What else do you want me to do?

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,330
Do you know how much I've suffered trying to find X?

11
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,500
X?

12
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,200
Look at this.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,140
Concrete evidence of X.

14
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,850
So.. who is X?

15
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,050
I'm not certain yet, but I'm suspecting Ra Eun Ho.

16
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,820
The problem is the accomplice really fits well with her.

17
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,440
Tae Woon.

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,090
Our Tae Woon?

19
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,950
I think Ra Eun Ho and a male student,

20
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,470
are doing X's work, and wouldn't that be Tae Woon?

21
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,350
I was really surprised.

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,770
Hey, you said you knew a place with good food, let's go.

23
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,150
Well there's no way Tae Woon would be doing X's work,

24
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,670
I was worried a lot.

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,400
It was dark, but it did seem like your son.

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,000
What is that?

27
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,510
Mr. Lee!

28
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,700
Please don't leak this information. Especially to the principal.

29
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,790
Yes, I understand.

30
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,620
I told you, if anything happens I'll pull you out.

31
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,480
Instead, Ra Eun Ho is expelled!

32
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,700
X is me but why would you do that to Ra Eun Ho who did nothing?!

33
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,130
You can't even keep your duty as a student and can't even take care of your own life. Is this the time for you to be dating a girl?

34
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,590
If you're going to use her to get me out I'm not going to stay still.

35
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,880
This is good, I can just confess that I'm X.

36
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,240
In front of everyone.

37
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,340
Really? I won't hold you back but think about who's going to get more hurt.

38
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,750
Even if she isn't X, I will find something to blame Ra Eun Ho

39
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,090
and expel her!

40
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,580
Hey Dummy,

41
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,320
Seriously.

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,780
It's been a long time so you must feel refreshed right?

43
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,190
The paint over there...

44
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,870
What? Is someone coming?

45
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,110
No, I just want to see your face.

46
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,480
That's so cheesy.

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,370
No, I want to see your face from up close.

48
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,120
Do you want to keep teasing me?

49
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,090
You're always cute...

50
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,920
That... do you always want to tease me?

51
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,350
For someone you cherish, there will be a time to make decisions.

52
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,650
Even if that decision sometimes hurts the other person.

53
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:49,260
School 2017
The Way to Protect You.

54
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,540
Episode 15
Really? He found out you're X?

55
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,140
He must've been suspecting me.

56
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,890
Then, what is he going to do?

57
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,450
You know what my dad does.

58
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,520
He's going to blame Ra Eun Ho.

59
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,480
I need to resolve this before it gets bigger.

60
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,210
The Principal... wasn't it totally funny how he created such a scene after eating that lunch box?

61
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,010
You saw how panicked he was by your mom right?

62
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,010
I know, when she said she was going to sell the story he was so frightened.

63
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,430
We really did something big this time, right?

64
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,330
Yeah, because of you guys my mom was rehired.

65
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,620
Thanks a lot.

66
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,970
Anyway, what a relief, it'd be nice if the school changed a bit.

67
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:56,140
It should. And it is.

68
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,040
But..

69
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,390
I think we should be more careful from now on.

70
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,780
Yeah, since I went and gave the drone,

71
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,330
they have to think one of us is X.

72
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,910
Let's stop then.

73
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,020
In any case, t's childish, going around in hoodies.

74
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,300
And it's about time we stop.

75
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,930
I'm gonna leave first.

76
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,820
What are you?

77
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,290
Your mind is working nicely.

78
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:00,300
You changed the hideout. Wow, as I expected. X sure is different.

79
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,520
Out of the blue, all of a sudden, why the study?

80
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,720
Was that creative?

81
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,280
There's no way someone with your brain can catch up with me, right, 5th in school?

82
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,340
Is that so?

83
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,490
That's why I have gotten proper evidence ready this time.

84
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:27,660
I wonder If you will be able to stop this.

85
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,900
Will Hyeon Tae Woon really be okay?

86
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,110
You're right. He was fine while he was doing things as X.

87
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,980
I'm worried about the aftermath. He seems like he has a lot of thoughts too.

88
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,330
Really, why is Hyeon Tae Woon so cool?

89
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,900
Hey, I totally acknowledge your boyfriend.

90
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,730
You just have to protect him well.

91
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,930
Yeah, don't worry.

92
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:19,650
I will take care of yy boyfriend, my best friend.

93
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:33,440
Stop it, you must be dizzy, what are you so worried about, dummy?

94
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,260
You should've stopped me.

95
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,550
I got angry at Sa Rang for no reason and she went to give the drone to the principal.

96
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,400
Dummy, that's why there's nobody who can compare to or replace X.

97
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,780
What if it gets dangerous from this?

98
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,700
The principal won't stay still.

99
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,080
What if you get caught?

100
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,560
Then... you can take responsibility.

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,470
What?

102
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:11,410
If X is expelled then Ra Eun Ho will be sorry and play with me forever.

103
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,500
Should I just confess now then?

104
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,290
Stop joking.

105
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,280
You'll die if your dad finds out.

106
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,590
He seems really scary.

107
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,880
Don't worry, if I get caught I'll handle it.

108
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,220
Those kids happened to be gathered there together.

109
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,690
I'm saying that the Chairman happened to show up at that time.

110
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,230
Whether it's the accomplice or the offender, it's between you guys. That's what I'm saying...

111
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,270
I'll catch them all and get them!

112
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,990
Are you going to continue like this? Won't you study?

113
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,760
There's a problem I'd like you to solve for me first.

114
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,480
Solve?

115
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,620
Could it be... you're in trouble again?!

116
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,350
No.

117
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,850
I can't focus on my study because of the uneasy atmosphere at school.

118
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,450
Someone called X...

119
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,610
Because of that X or whatnot they are saying that the academic atmosphere is dwindling.

120
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,520
If you give us some time..

121
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,160
We are doing the best we can regardless.

122
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,650
What do you mean best?

123
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,240
You need to get the police in so that they can investigate the situation properly.

124
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,830
That is..

125
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,540
If we use the government power hastily, it will hurt the school image.

126
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,670
We came to tell you about that image.

127
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,120
X or whatever. If the school's image is ruined, it will taint the kids' transcripts.

128
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,880
It's their alma mater.

129
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,410
We cannot stand by and watch this happen any longer.

130
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,340
Just how much more time do I need to give you?

131
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,690
I'm almost there now, if you give a bit more time..

132
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,020
Are you investigating Ra Eun Ho?

133
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,350
Even when I look at it, it's not just one or two things wrong about it.

134
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,640
For what reason is it being delayed so much?

135
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,490
Since I don't have concrete evidence..

136
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,160
Aren't you determined? If an incident arises..

137
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,620
either a culprit is revealed or a person responsible is revealed, there has to be one of those people.

138
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,370
Do you understand what I'm saying?

139
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,950
Yes, I understand.

140
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,050
Determination.

141
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,460
What would you have done without me?

142
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:06,070
In any case, you're quite high maintenance, Dummy...

143
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,940
I guess...

144
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,090
It will be quite depressing having to live without you in the future.

145
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,430
Hey, what kind of words are you..

146
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,450
You know what I mean. You're eighteen now. You'll have different..

147
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:30,150
There will never be something different! We can just happily see each other straight until 118.

148
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,550
You know, right? That I have really good endurance.

149
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,740
I also know that your tenacity is very good.

150
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,780
Hey, if you live decades into the future you can't meet another guy like me.

151
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,040
Good looking, cool, healthy body..

152
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,600
only cares about you.

153
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,180
Be sure to keep your promise.

154
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,420
But, seeing as nothing much has happened up to this point..

155
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,630
will the principal just let it go like this?

156
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,510
Since he's not calling anyone, it's more nerve-wracking.

157
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,300
Perhaps he's given up?

158
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,440
He's not a person who gives up that easily.

159
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,660
His silence is making me nervous.

160
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,800
Hi, Hui Chan.

161
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,640
I have something I wanted to ask you.

162
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,760
Isn't it a bit strange?

163
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,530
I too find this quite suspicious.

164
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,150
If she says she used her full imagination to draw this,

165
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,110
there's nothing I can say.

166
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,680
To say that, there are no holes logically speaking.

167
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,870
Ra Eun Ho is not that smart of a student either.

168
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,750
If we say that it is coincidence...

169
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,770
Well, it's possible once or twice.

170
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,970
At this rate, you can say she's got everything figured out.

171
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,150
It's not just one or two places where it's suspicious.

172
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,700
Utilizing the sprinkler system at the right time,

173
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,310
Especially making them go off all at the same time...
you can't find a way to do that anywhere on the internet.

174
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,630
And how they left the assembly hall,

175
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,030
He moved knowing the exact location of the CCTV.

176
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,310
How the blind spots are created for the CCTVs...

177
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,370
it's making me curious.

178
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,060
It's so elaborate.

179
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,820
And such an advanced story...

180
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,390
I was a bit suspicious.

181
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,450
It must be among the two of them, right?

182
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,190
Whether Ra Eun Ho is a very talented genius

183
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:12,220
or she has an intimate relationship with X.

184
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,250
Sunbae.

185
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,070
I worked very hard trying to gather these.

186
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,730
Thank you, Sunbae. I will make sure to pay back this favor.

187
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,830
But, it is very extensive.

188
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,470
I get pissed off whenever I work on this. But the corruption in the educational system these days is no joke.

189
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,460
Will you be okay with it? It is the school that you've been working at.

190
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,520
That's why I must properly catch them and make it into a good school.

191
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,350
It's the school that our kids go to.

192
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,740
Okay. Fighting!

193
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,190
Yes.

194
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,950
Why are you so surprised?

195
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,090
As if you were doing something bad in privacy.

196
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:15,590
I can't do things in privacy? You also hid X's identity without me knowing.

197
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:20,730
But, I still told you who X was right away.

198
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,940
And also... to the person I love,

199
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,000
It's my principle that I have to be honest to them.

200
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,760
L...love?

201
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,180
Yes, love.

202
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:50,060
Was it day 1 from the day we were in front of the police station?

203
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,770
To be exact, it was from the day that I first kissed you.

204
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,990
Please remember to celebrate our first year anniversary starting that day.

205
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,130
How can a woman be so confident... and pretty,

206
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,020
determined and so loveable?

207
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:16,390
Anyway, I'll do my best to remember our 100, 200, 300 day celebrations.

208
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,040
Teacher Soo Ji, have some coffee with me and

209
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,780
let's talk seriously about our future.

210
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,290
What is this awkward mood?

211
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,640
As if you two became day 1 couples starting from this morning.

212
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,110
I know. I'll enjoy drinking the coffee.

213
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,020
I heard the steering committee members came by.

214
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,390
I heard they demanded that the X is caught.

215
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,020
It seems like your father can move faster than we expect.

216
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,030
What do you want to do?

217
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,690
They're coming to get me. What can I do? I'll have to fight them head on.

218
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,100
Or else, that dense kid will take all the blame by herself.

219
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,330
Hey, the kids are all watching.

220
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,220
Perhaps, you see.

221
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,590
Huh?

222
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,370
If somehow, perhaps...

223
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,470
If you get wrongly accused that you are X like last time,

224
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:07,230
then, you must reveal that it's me and quickly escape, alright?

225
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,200
Of course.

226
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,570
After accusing Hyeon Tae Woon, I will quickly escape.

227
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,000
It's not a joke. You really must do that.

228
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,190
Why?

229
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,700
It looks like your father is gonna put it all on me?

230
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,880
Would I just let that happen? I will protect you no matter what.

231
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,870
So I'm saying that if something were to happen,

232
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,370
you must place it on me and quickly escape.

233
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,370
Aigoo, you are so dependable, my boyfriend.

234
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,020
Hey, wait for me.

235
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,490
You came to meet my Nam Joo, right?

236
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,050
Hello.

237
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,600
You didn't have to take me home.

238
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,180
I remember last time when we rode the taxi together with Nam Joo.

239
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,040
Yes.

240
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,500
But my Nam Joo didn't lie with a bad intention.

241
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,170
It's all because of me.

242
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:01,520
We lived pretty well before, but after my business failed

243
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,380
we suddenly became like this. I think it was hard for her to accept it too.

244
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,680
She had to stop playing the cello that she liked.

245
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:20,000
Nam Joo played the cello?

246
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,870
I'm sorry.

247
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,660
But please take care of my Nam Joo.

248
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,970
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry to the point where I can't say I'm sorry

249
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:41,330
I can't say anything when I see her face.

250
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,730
I'm sorry about a lot of things too.

251
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,510
Hey.

252
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,180
I heard you don't have a girlfriend right now.

253
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,770
Ah, about that-

254
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,490
Think about it and contact me there.

255
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,120
Enjoy your drink.

256
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,490
Welcome.

257
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,750
What are you going to do about the restaurant pager?

258
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,470
A customer took that.

259
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,720
Do you know how much one costs? Anyway it was your fault, so I'm going to take the cost from your part-time wage.

260
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,350
No, why is that my fault? A customer took it without me knowing.

261
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,350
That's what I'm saying, you should have made sure they couldn't have taken it.

262
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,730
Are you perhaps overexerting your power?

263
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,960
-What are you doing?
-What are you?

264
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,040
When someone purposely planned to secretly take it, how can she confirm every one of them?

265
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,800
Why are you putting the blame on a part-time? Why don't you check your CCTV instead?

266
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,880
Hey.

267
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,860
Anyway, if you don't want to be fired, take the blame.

268
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,690
Yes, I will.

269
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,240
Why would you do that?

270
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,810
What's the policy on theft and damages on the contract?

271
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:53,780
There's no way you would use an underage part-time worker without writing a contract, right?

272
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,320
What are you two?

273
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,810
I'm going to order.

274
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,400
Give me one Iced Americano and your phone number.

275
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,600
I heard you don't have a boyfriend right now.

276
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:25,550
♫ When I get home it's dark ♫

277
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:33,120
♫ So that my tired feet can take a rest ♫

278
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:40,950
♫ Like fluttering in the wind ♫

279
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,290
♫ Even my shaky mind can take a break ♫
Why are you following me?

280
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,310
Because it's late.

281
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,400
What does that matter?

282
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,310
Come to school.

283
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,330
I don't want to be called a liar and outcast and have fingers pointing.

284
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,670
I'll protect you.

285
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,940
I'll stop everyone who curses and points fingers at you.

286
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,950
So come to school.

287
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,990
Stop it.

288
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,790
I miss you.

289
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,920
♫ Like the time ♫

290
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,180
♫ which was painful passes ♫

291
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:35,290
Every time I looked at your empty seat, I really missed you.
♫ The white winter also ♫

292
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,890
So...
♫ which is piled up with sorrow ♫

293
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,830
come to school. I really miss you, Nam Joo.

294
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:49,500
♫  when spring arrives and the flowers bloom, will pass. ♫

295
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,790
- Hey...
- Like this...

296
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,960
- Ugh.
- You got hiccups.

297
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,330
Something is suspicious.

298
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,830
Who gave you permission to stay here?

299
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,540
10 people with highest number of penalty points who are called out,

300
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,810
This... I knew you would be like this.

301
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:48,660
No.. this is exactly what X did.

302
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,180
Buzz- Buzz- Buzz-

303
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,530
I said it's all my imagination.

304
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,680
There should be freedom of creative expression.

305
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,910
Hey, the storyline about highest penalty points, reporting on school records!

306
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:17,300
These are truly X's doings that really happened in our school.

307
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,650
I read your webtoon.

308
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:24,040
These are situations that you couldn't have drawn without knowing X in real life.

309
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,770
This sprinkler, how do you activate it?

310
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,000
How did you think of this?

311
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,000
That's really my imagination.

312
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,710
I said I'm not X.

313
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,350
Is this a drawing of me?

314
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,930
You are not X, but you know everything X did.

315
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,480
So you are saying that you drank, but weren't driving drunk.

316
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,080
You snored, but you weren't sleeping.

317
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,960
Teach.

318
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,500
Evidence that you can't deny is laying right here.

319
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,360
You punk, you're going to be expelled. Expelled!

320
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,040
Hey, hey, hey!

321
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,430
Let go, you punk.

322
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,890
Stop it, you punk.

323
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,980
We don't even know what they're doing in there right now.

324
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,850
And if you go? What are you going to do if you go in there?

325
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:40,290
Hey, Eun Ho is mistaken for being X right now. How can I not do anything?

326
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,210
-Move.
-I said to stop it, please.

327
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,360
Hey.

328
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,660
You can't immediately do anything about Ra Eun Ho.

329
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,990
Stop making a fuss like a crazy person and think of a solution.

330
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,870
That's right. It looks like the Principal is determined to pick on her.

331
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,670
We have to think as well.

332
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,340
She didn't even do anything wrong.

333
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,780
What did they say? Are you okay?

334
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:22,680
You fool, you should have denied it to the end. You should have said that Hyeon Tae Woon is X!

335
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,970
I'd feel so free if I can sell you out and get out of this mess, huh?

336
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,160
Is it because you really don't know the principal? You can't escape this situation all by yourself.

337
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,720
That's why I'm telling you to report me and get out of this situation, you fool!

338
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,570
Then, what about you? Do you want to be dragged by your dad and go abroad?

339
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,820
Then, what about me? Is it good having a boyfriend studying abroad?

340
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,470
Ra Eun Ho, think coolly.

341
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,350
Think about what coolly?

342
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,050
Aren't you telling me to sell you out to get out of danger?

343
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,410
Hey.

344
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,500
Don't hold on to me.

345
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:15,670
If you're going to be like this, why are you holding on? If you're going to let go of my hand so easily when things are hard, why are you holding on to me?

346
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:22,010
-Eun Ho.
-The moment you confess that you're X,

347
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,500
I am going to quit this school.

348
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:34,530
So, don't even dream of giving up on yourself to protect me.

349
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,500
Don't worry.

350
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:57,460
I've acquired the evidence. Ra Eun Ho can't get out of this no matter what.

351
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,330
Fast, accurately, and brutally, we'll expel X for sure.

352
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,880
Please take care of this well, so people won't talk.

353
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:18,090
Excuse me.

354
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,360
Disciplinary Action Committee Announcement
Who: Ra 0 0
When: 8-10-2017
Place: Multipurpose Room

355
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,510
Hey, isn't that Ra Eun Ho?

356
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:28,570
Yes, this is forcing her to drop out.

357
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,340
Drop out? What do we do?

358
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:36,750
She totally stepped out of our expectations to say that Ra Eun Ho is X...

359
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,190
No wonder... she has nothing to show for, yet she seem so full of it.

360
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,970
We should have known ever since she starting drawing those strange webtoons.

361
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,870
She'll probably be forced to drop out.

362
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,610
Hui Chan. What do you think?

363
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,140
The adults will take care of it themselves.

364
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,680
Confrontational just enough, and an opponent who can be buried just enough.

365
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,940
What do you mean be buried enough?

366
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:15,400
Do you really... think Ra Eun Ho did all of that by herself?

367
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,940
It doesn't make sense.

368
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,320
Then... are you saying the real culprit is someone else?

369
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,530
Even if there is, so what?

370
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,080
Ra Eun Ho will end up being blamed for everything anyway.

371
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:37,990
From the perspective of the adults, that's the cleanest conclusion.

372
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:53,470
You showed off so much, but in the end, you're just framing someone else.

373
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,770
What, you punk?

374
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:08,180
Hey. That's the "I had no choice" expression.

375
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,390
"I didn't know."

376
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:18,400
When you got involved with Ra Eun Ho and the losers, did you not think of this?

377
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,570
Shut up. You'll really die.

378
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,030
You're the most cowardly.

379
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,750
You always hide behind a mask, but you're trying to show off.

380
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,580
Should I take off my mask and throw one at you?

381
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,260
There you go trying to act like a man again; showing off again.

382
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,220
Don't act tough here and quickly tell them...

383
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,550
that you're X.

384
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,210
Why is a bastard that doesn't even have the courage to do that going around doing stuff like this?

385
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,430
You're only making Ra Eun Ho a pitiful sacrificial lamb.

386
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,070
Don't speak so rashly.

387
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,010
Even if a punk like you doesn't make a fuss,

388
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,330
I will reveal that I'm X soon.

389
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,060
Mind your own business and get lost.

390
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,770
Kang Hui Chan

391
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,060
Principal. There's a recording that you must listen to.

392
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,030
♫  Cosmos  ♫

393
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,830
♫  Fluttering and dancing, blooming  ♫

394
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:29,920
Like I said, if you just take care of Ra Eun Ho's disciplinary punishment well,

395
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,110
there will be no problem with guaranteeing your position.

396
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,370
If it's too hard, you don't have to do it.

397
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,970
I can get involved and wrap up things well.

398
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,080
Starting from that webtoon that draws the school's corruption...

399
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,880
snip, snip, snip!

400
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,390
What should I do? Can you take care of Ra Eun Ho's expulsion well?

401
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:54,410
Why should I expel that student?

402
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,890
What did you say?

403
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,450
You're still very young. You must be losing your hearing.

404
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:07,420
You can't hear me? I asked you why I have to expel her.

405
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,410
- Principal!
- Chairman!

406
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,310
X is your son, Hyeon Tae Woon.

407
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,020
Even if a punk like you doesn't make a fuss,

408
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,100
I will reveal that I'm X soon.

409
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,680
Mind your own business and get lost.

410
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,160
Why are you so surprised?

411
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,840
It's not even like this is the first time you found out.

412
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,240
If people find out that X is your son,

413
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,490
what would our steering committee members say?

414
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,370
Why? Did you think that I will just endure it everyday?

415
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,200
Dae...bak.

416
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:09,080
Faculty Hiring (Extension) Contract

417
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:15,920
Aigoo, you even extended my contract for three years.

418
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,500
You even raised my salary this much.

419
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,310
Aigoo, I wasn't expecting anything.

420
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,790
Well, it's only natural to award talent.

421
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,390
Don't worry.

422
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,420
No matter what, I will dump it all onto Ra Eun Ho and have her expelled.

423
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,070
I'll make sure that everything goes smoothly.

424
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,600
What good did you do for you to be going around stomping like that?

425
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,530
Walk around softly. The school will collapse!

426
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,980
The school will collapse not because of me but because of you and your strange teaching methods.

427
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,140
What? Coming from someone who goes around being X.

428
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,530
What about X?

429
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,870
Why do you think I did what X did?

430
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,680
I did it because the school is a mess!

431
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,270
You're also a mess!

432
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,170
You still haven't gotten your mind on straight!

433
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,000
Truthfully, the school did more bad things.

434
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,090
Oh, Mr. Goo.

435
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,270
Listen to what this kid is saying.

436
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,200
Well, I don't think she said anything wrong exactly.

437
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:45,120
Ah, my blood pressure is rising. Why is he like that too!

438
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,970
So, stop doing bad things.

439
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:54,970
Then your blood pressure will also decline.

440
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,480
You, X!

441
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,430
Really? The Principal really did that?

442
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:13,570
- It's such a shame, I should have seen it!
- Right! You should have seen it!

443
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,490
Where is he going again?

444
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:22,100
This jerk, this jerk. Hey!

445
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,810
Hey, why are you like that to Tae Woon?

446
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,720
Now he looks normal.

447
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,670
Who?

448
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,810
Them?

449
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,600
Of course, they're normal.

450
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:39,050
When he came to school, he must not have had any friends to joke around with.

451
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,950
He must have never gotten into trouble for talking during class either.

452
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:50,980
He must have had more painful memories than good ones.

453
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,020
You're talking about Hyeon Tae Woon?

454
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,000
You know, Sa Rang... I want Tae Woon...

455
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,150
to spend a normal 18-year old life like you and me just once.

456
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,180
Like how we're happy at school,

457
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:16,080
I wish Tae Woon to be like that too.

458
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,420
It looks like that now.

459
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,810
Yeah.

460
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,400
That's why I want to protect him more.

461
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,250
His normal 18-year old life.

462
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,100
He might lose that because of me...

463
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,280
I'm really scared of that.

464
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,810
In this school, I was happy enough,

465
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,250
and normal enough.

466
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,060
I'm super busy though!

467
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,880
You must really miss me, but I'm super busy.

468
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,890
Be quiet.

469
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,740
Oppa! Let's go!

470
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,410
O...Oppa?

471
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,190
Oppa. Let's go.

472
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,170
- One more time!
- Quickly go!

473
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,510
Ha ha.

474
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:09,600
♫ A wish is taking me to you ♫

♫ Not even knowing that this love is painful ♫

476
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:28,440
♫ To you, who was so exhausted, I wasn't enough and it hurt more ♫

477
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,510
What time is it right now?
♫ But like a habit, I'm placing you in my eyes ♫

478
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,300
It's raining outside too.

479
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,930
It rained since earlier. You're really immersed.

480
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,660
Even ignoring your boyfriend.

481
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,100
I'm sorry. Hm? I'm really sorry!

482
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,870
You like drawing that much? You didn't even know that time went by,

483
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,280
and didn't even know how bored your boyfriend was.
Yeah.

484
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,260
If I just draw this..

485
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,540
I'm so happy. So happy.

486
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:08,150
♫ But my heart still only wants you ♫

487
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:12,630
I'll protect your dream.

488
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:19,630
♫ Hope carries me to you ♫

489
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:28,190
♫ Like that time you fill my eyes ♫

490
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,660
Exchange student application form

491
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,980
If you continue to act noisily like this..

492
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,820
I can send you away as soon as tomorrow.

493
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,930
You locked me up when Joon Gi died.

494
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,990
Now, you're going to completely send me away and lock me up there?

495
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,210
I can do much worse. Ra Eun Ho, that girl?

496
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,150
It doesn't have to be X. I can have her mixed up in something else to expel her.

497
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,180
Don't try anything funny.

498
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,420
You know everything.

499
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,720
When Joon Gi died and this time too.

500
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,570
There is nothing that they have done wrong.

501
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,780
When you know it all why on earth are you doing this?

502
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,780
This is the way I live.

503
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,500
I can do anything to survive, to protect you.

504
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:31,520
I'll expel Ra Eun Ho right away, so don't get involved anymore.

505
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,800
I won't get involved again!

506
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,260
And I'll go on exchange if you say so.

507
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,650
She's a girl with a lot of dreams so.

508
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,640
please stop torturing her.

509
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:58,490
I'll do all of it.

510
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,920
I'll do anything you tell me to.

511

♫ When I get home it's dark ♫

512
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:22,890
♫ So that my tired feet can take a rest ♫

513
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:30,120
♫ Like a buttefly fluttering in the wind ♫

514
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:37,910
Eunho. Your uniform.

515
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:45,890
-Thanks.
-It's okay.

516

♫ Passing by ♫

518
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:08,330
♫ Like that painful time. ♫

519
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:17,300
♫ The white winter also which is piled up with sorrow ♫

520
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:27,320
♫ When spring arrives and the flowers bloom will pass. ♫

521
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,330
Ra Eun Ho

522
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,990
What? What did they do?

523
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:51,280
That's why I told you. It's because of that X or Y or whatever that you're getting kicked out of school.

524
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,580
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

525
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:00,310
No. Have you gone crazy? Why would a perfectly fine girl like you quit school?

526
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,810
In a short time it will be third year for you.

527
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:05,360
A school that you've been attending with no problems up till now.

528
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,090
No. Absolutely not.

529
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,630
Eun Ho, you should beg them.

530
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,780
Let's humbly beg for their forgiveness.

531
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,410
Dad will come with you and beg. A student is begging humbly for forgiveness.

532
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:21,700
Then they'll have to forgive you.

533
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,660
But Dad, I don't want to beg.

534
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,230
I don't think I've done anything wrong.

535
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:35,720
What do you mean nothing wrong? Giving up so easily like this..

536
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,360
What are you going to do now?

537
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,410
Oh, so annoying.

538
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:44,920
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

539
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,810
But I'll work harder than when I was at school.

540
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,810
I'll work harder at drawing webtoons and will take the high school equivalency exam, too.

541
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,370
Fine. What the heck. There are so many kids who quit school these days...

542
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,010
You should talk her out of it. Not encourage it!

543
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,060
Mum.

544
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,400
If I quit school. More than now ...

545
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,290
I think I can be happier. So ...

546
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,400
What the heck is going on here?

547
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:55,370
She said she would be happier than she is now.

548
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,340
Who knows.

549
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:01,100
No. It's nonsense.

550
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,440
This stupid school is always talking expulsion.

551
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,540
Hey Boyfriend.

552
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,970
You couldn't sleep because you missed your oppa right?

553
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:52,140
Yes. I missed you so much.

554
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,250
I'm not sleepy at all.

555
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:59,180
So you should stop thinking about me. If you think about me to the point of losing sleep,

556
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,510
that gets me excited.

557
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,630
I have to sleep.

558
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,520
All of a sudden I feel really drowsy.

559
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,140
Hey you wait a minute. Stop.

560
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:14,450
- How dare you try to sleep first? Put me down first.
- What?

561
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:18,030
- Tuck me in first. Hang up after I fall asleep.
- Hey!

562
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,390
That's something a girl would say.

563
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:24,330
"Don't fall asleep until I do"

564
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:29,280
"Sing me a song until I fall asleep. Okay?"

565
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,890
Like this. You're not romantic at all.

566
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:40,090
♫ When I say I love you ♫

567
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:44,130
♫ And become accepted ♫

568
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:50,750
♫ That I have nothing more to wish for ♫

569
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:56,300
♫ Is said so with confidence ♫

570
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:01,440
♫ But growing greed  ♫

571
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,660
♫ Puts me to shame ♫

572
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,410
♫ Once again, at thoughts of you ♫

573
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:15,400
♫ I cannot fall asleep  ♫

574
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:21,420
♫ Because I'm jealous ♫

575
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,040
♫ Because I'm scared ♫

576
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:31,020
♫ Because you're smiling by my side ♫

577
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:35,690
♫ It's unbelievable ♫

578
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:41,600
♫ Because it's too good, ♫

579
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,400
♫ Because it makes my heart too full ♫

580
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:52,850
♫ Because it might all disappear when I open my eyes ♫

581
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:56,370
♫ I cannot fall asleep  ♫

582
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,830
I miss you more.

583
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,180
Good night.

584
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,830
Hey. Yikes..

585
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:29,770
Ra Eun Ho. Your family's here again.

586
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,440
They're here again.

587
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,960
Oh!

588
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:40,140
You have no class.

589
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,670
How could you roam in here, not even properly knowing where this is?

590
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:47,630
Ra Eun Ho's problem will not disappear just because you do this!

591
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,830
There is no use in crying and begging. Leave!

592
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,330
Are you crazy? Do you think we'd beg like last time?

593
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,640
It won't work no matter how many times I curse!

594
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,610
Do you think Ra Eun Ho will be safe-

595
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:00,510
She does not need to be safe, so fill out a withdrawal form right now.

596
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,410
Right now!

597
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,030
That does not have to be right now-

598
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:08,110
We don't want to send her to this type of school, so fill out that form now.

599
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,510
This beggar like school.

600
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,230
Excuse me?! Beggar?

601
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:15,030
Excuse me. Hello.

602
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:18,430
Do you know what your daughter did?

603
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,930
Yes. I know well.

604
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,960
She did that X or Y kind of thing.

605
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,590
I told her that she did well!

606
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:27,490
Mom.

607
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:30,640
You set up competitions for rich kids.

608
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,540
You take money and alter their specs.

609
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,890
You feed students trashy food.

610
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:38,340
She did what she did to fix these problems!

611
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:42,120
You did well. You did totally well!

612
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,350
Well, not totally, just-

613
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,390
You guys are just a bunch of thugs!

614
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:48,550
Are you all crazy?

615
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:53,620
The crazy one is the school! How could a school function like this if it isn't crazy!

616
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,740
Does this school teach students to keep quiet when there is something wrong?

617
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,990
Does it teach them to ignore everything? Is it that weak?

618
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,640
It's true that a school shouldn't do that-

619
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,660
What?

620
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:09,050
So fill out her withdrawal form right now. I don't want to send my precious daughter

621
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,290
to this kind of beggar school.

622
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:15,690
What are you doing? Fill out that form!

623
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,350
Please fill it out.

624
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,630
Are you okay?

625
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,560
Eun Ho. Look at me.

626
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,380
You aren't okay, right?

627
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:04,480
I'm not okay.

628
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,610
I really like school,

629
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,860
but I can't come to school anymore.

630
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,670
I like talking to you,

631
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,410
getting in trouble with teachers,

632
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:32,610
learning,

633
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:40,130
joking around with Tae Woon.

634
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,440
I really like those.

635
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,900
Should we go beg them together?

636
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:01,470
No, lets go to Tae Woon's dad and ask him a favor just once.

637
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,130
We can't.

638
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,500
Why can't we? His son is X,

639
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,500
so what could he do to his son?

640
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:18,560
So let's go this one time and ask him.

641
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,730
I don't want to.

642
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,340
I don't want Tae Woon to go through a hard time.

643
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:09,260
There's nothing that you can do with your strength, so live quietly.

644
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:16,280
Okay. I'll live quietly.

645
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,820
Ra Eun Ho

646
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:34,290
School morals have hit rock bottom, that's what I'm saying!

647
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:41,030
I have gathered all of you here today to put a close to

648
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:45,690
Ra Eun Ho's actions as X.

649
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:51,980
This X case is not only a school issue, but it is also

650
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:56,240
an issue with law-

651
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:07,000
Why is this?

652
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,120
What is this?

653
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:24,810
Ah, seriously.

654
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,160
Daebak. Ah!

655
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,160
What's going on? <

656
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,000
X, this rascal.

657
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,420
Aigoo, you didn't have to.

658
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,820
The first place for the math competition will go to you, Tae Woon.

659
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:44,590
Just memorize the answers.

660
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,830
Wow...

661
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,930
Wow, even the Principal.

662
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:15,140
Even today, the Principal is up to no good.

663
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,450
I'll give that kind of Principal and all of you...

664
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,520
a special gift!

665
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:33,680
It's X! X is on the second floor!

666
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,070
I'll give it to you!!

667
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,680
That...

668
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,150
Oh?

669
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:44,020
It's X!

670
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,860
His face...

671
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,660
Whoa!

672
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,570
Oh, my!

673
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:35,790
♬  Believing now in this moment I  ♬

674
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:41,230
♬  Sometimes feel insecure and uneasy but  ♬

675
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:46,200
♬  As I think of you  ♬
