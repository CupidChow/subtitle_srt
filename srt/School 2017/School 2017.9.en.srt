00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,520
♫ I guess so. It must not be time yet. ♫

2
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,440
Don't smile like that.
♫ You are too far away. ♫

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,630
♫ I can't reach you. ♫

4
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,260
It makes me nervous.

5
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,770
♫ So I have no choice but to just watch over you.  ♫

6
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,240
♫  Though I tried to humor and calm it, ♫

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:53,300
♫ My heart already wants only you ♫

8
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:00,850
♫ The wind is taking me to you ♫

9
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,660
♫ Love does not know that this love is painful ♫

10
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,490
Hey! Why are you joking around like that?

11
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm not joking.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,700
Can't you see? I'm very sincere right now.

13
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,960
♫ I'm placing you in my eyes ♫

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,310
I'll be leaving first.

15
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:36,570
♫ Like a habit, I'm drawing you into my eyes ♫

16
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,360
Your friend?
Episode 9

17
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,130
Yea, it's about my friend.

18
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,460
So you're saying your friend confessed but he's worried about just making things more awkward?

19
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,840
Should he just say it was a joke and pretend that it never happened?

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,570
But taking back something you said isn't your style.

21
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,230
I know, right.

22
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,130
Ah, really! It's not about me!

23
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,890
- I'm talking about my friend!
- I got it.

24
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,010
You're very sensitive.

25
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,010
But it's probably going to be very awkward from now on.

26
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,820
Right?

27
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,460
First, try not to run into each other.

28
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,600
Because if you run into her after confessing, it should be extremely awkward as if you've just eaten a fruit of awkwardness.

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,490
Oh, how can they not run into each other?

30
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,640
Either go to school as early or late as possible. You shouldn't run into each other.

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,650
Ah! Ah, oh.

32
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:41,570
About your friend... he's really pathetic.

33
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,650
Why?

34
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,700
I mean, why is he asking for dating advice from you?

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,850
You can't even date properly.

36
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,330
Is he a fool, dumb, or just senseless?

37
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,090
Byeong Goo.

38
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,110
Hm?

39
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,700
Do you want to die?

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,520
This is yummy.

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,210
It's yummy? Huh.

42
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,060
Drink up. Yea, drink up.

43
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,330
Don't smile like that.

44
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,610
Hey! Give your oppa just 10,000₩-

45
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,750
What is this situation?

46
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,490
What?

47
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,000
Why is your face so red?

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,620
What were you thinking about?

49
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,030
Me? I wasn't. Think about what?

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,390
Why? Did someone say they like you?

51
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,920
No! Do you think I received a confession or something?

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,860
Confession? Ohhh!

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,720
But you can't be obvious about how much you like it from the start.

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,510
How can I make it obvious? It's already awkward to death.

55
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,310
So you did receive a confession. I'm right.

56
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,090
This young punk. Mom! Ra Eun Ho is dating!

57
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,000
She received a confession!

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,440
- Hey!
- Mom!

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,550
Ah, hey! Mom, it's not true!

60
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
Hey, eat before you leave-

61
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,260
Why is she leaving this early?

62
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,860
I'm leaving too!

63
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,210
Did all of them suddenly decide to turn over a new leaf?

64
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:25,680
Hey... you... what's with you?

65
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,290
Why are you here at this time?

66
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,520
What about you? You always came late.

67
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,970
I... uh... today...

68
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,460
I woke up early.

69
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,960
Me too!

70
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,490
I woke up early too.

71
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,610
So.

72
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,960
So... well...

73
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,220
I'm leaving first.

74
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,130
What time is it ...

75
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,190
Isn't he in the classroom alone right now?

76
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,470
It's so awkward. Just thinking about it is so awkward!

77
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,680
Ra Eun Ho is probably in the classroom by herself right now.

78
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,010
I'm going crazy.

79
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,390
Won Byeong Goo, this punk...

80
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,430
What's with you?

81
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,290
Why are you not going to the classroom?

82
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,860
No... I'll be going now-

83
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,270
Isn't what I meant. I lost something.

84
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,180
Ah, alright.

85
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,700
Rumors are born in random places.

86
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,350
Even if you try to kill them, they survive.

87
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,290
They show how heavy they are at unexpected places.

88
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:23,520
School 2017
The Weight of Rumors

89
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,060
Since this is your period of dropping out of school,

90
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,430
you're going to be taking drop-out classes instead of taking the normal classes.

91
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,770
Teacher, I'm going to quit eventually anyways. Why should I listen in class?

92
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:42,840
Bo Ra. It's still not completely over, so let's wait and see.

93
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,960
I'm okay.

94
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,260
I'm not okay. I'll do whatever it takes to find a way,

95
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,300
wait a bit longer. I'm sorry, Bo Ra.

96
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,350
Seo Bo Ra

97
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,690
Bo Ra!

98
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,800
Is this yours?

99
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,700
I found this on the path by the trees and thought it might be yours.

100
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,140
Ah, yea.

101
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,490
Thank you.

102
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,650
Are you taking dropout classes?

103
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,840
I have to until the end of the week.

104
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,570
It's been hard on you lately, huh?

105
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,140
If there's anything I can help you with, let me know.

106
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,780
No, I'm okay.

107
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,130
- H-hey dumm-
- Ra Eun Ho!

108
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Hey, you said you'd treat me to patbingsu (Shaved ice with red beans).

109
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,790
What patbingsu?

110
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,930
You said you'd treat me!

111
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,640
I fixed your bicycle though.

112
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,360
Do I have to actually say it?

113
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,480
Tell what?

114
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,200
- Fine. Buy it for me!
- All right. All right. I was just joking.

We were friends.

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,710
But, what is...this feeling?

142
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,480
Ugh, so frustrating.

143
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,680
Rang kke (nickname)! Rang kke! Rang kke!

144
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,190
What is it, you've seemed really busy these days.

145
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,790
What's wrong, Rang kke? Are you upset about something?

146
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,130
Well, it's not that I'm sad,

147
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,690
if you ask if I'm sad, I can't say that I'm sad.

148
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,860
And someone told me you have to say stuff like that.

149
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,370
That's right, I'm sad! I'm really sad!

150
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,440
I was very upset with you!

151
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
Me?

152
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,030
Oh really?

153
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,010
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:57,720
But if you apologize so fast, making me embarrassed, what does that make me?

155
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,260
It's just lately, I've been getting all these bombs thrown at me so I've been out of my mind.

156
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,470
You'll forgive me, right?

157
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,340
What bombs?

158
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:18,400
That's... aish, why am I such a mess?

159
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,140
It's because of Hyeon Tae Woon right?

160
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,940
What?

161
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,530
How do you know that?

162
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:34,090
It's obvious. The way he looks at you wasn't normal.

163
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,330
That Hyeon Tae Woon,

164
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,730
What?

165
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:45,800
bothers you right, he follows you everywhere and always looks at you.

166
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,940
He...always looks at me?

167
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,590
Yeah, it's like lasers are coming out of his eyes.

168
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,500
Shall I beat him up for you? Just like this- bam!

169
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,660
No, it's okay.

170
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,990
Stop being so nervous.

171
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,920
It looks like you think I'd eat you up.

172
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,320
That's not it.

173
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,910
This is too awkward so I can't do this anymore.

174
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,450
Anyway, I get what you mean, but I'm never going to take it into account.

175
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,730
What? This kid doing whatever he wants again.

176
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,020
I know, since I can't do what I want it's driving me crazy.

177
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,260
So from now on, I'll be doing whatever I want.

178
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,600
You should also do whatever you want.

179
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,800
Yeah, that's the Hyeon Tae Woon.

180
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,700
Rude.

181
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,140
Finals D-10

182
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,960
Ten days left is not a short time,

183
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,280
so let's please work hard and bring a successful conclusion.

184
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,610
Teacher, why is bringing to a successful conclusion only through studying?

185
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,580
She's right. Teacher!

186
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,840
I know right. But let's bring anything to a successful conclusion.

187
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,040
Have a nice day.

188
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,950
I'm going to bring to a successful conclusion (by sleeping).

189
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,540
Me, too! I'll sleep here.

190
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,120
No way, that makes no sense.

191
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,590
I'm telling you the truth, I heard you've heard of the rumor too.

192
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,430
Bo Ra and Hui Chan went out with each other first year.

193
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,100
Hui Chan and Bo Ra?!

194
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,670
If that's true, then it's a huge scandal!

195
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,850
I doubt it. Kim Hui Chan dated Seo Bo Ra?

196
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,840
That's definitely a rumor. Hui Chan is not crazy.

197
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,400
Now that I think about it, I've heard rumors about those two before.

198
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,850
Yeah, there's a rumor

199
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,040
that someone saw Bo Ra at the hospital.

200
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,550
Hospital? What hospital?

201
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,210
Bing Goo, can't you figure it out?

202
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,220
School campus couple. Hospital.

203
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,270
School campus couple. Hospital.

204
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,690
Woah.

205
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,720
Hey, am I crazy? You think I would date a nobody like her?

206
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,840
What...are you doing?

207
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,890
Can't you tell? I'm showing off my long legs.

208
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:55,010
Your show-off skill is very creative.

209
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:01,990
Hey, no matter how awkward you are, you can't use that as an excuse to not work on your dream.

210
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,730
- My dream?
- Why aren't you drawing your webtoon?

211
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,110
Publishing a series is a promise with your readers.

212
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,570
You need to update ASAP.

213
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,920
I am.

214
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,020
Also, now that I've seen it, you're too clueless about X's inner mind.

215
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,880
That's why you only have one reader!

216
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,320
His inner mind? What don't I know?

217
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,610
Everything! You don't get anything!

218
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:29,280
I'm saying this in a totally official manner only, but I'll teach you: how X's inner mind works.

219
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,610
Wow. Where would you be, if it weren't for me?

220
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:39,070
Eyy ... Follow me.

221
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,100
Move it.

222
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,880
What?

223
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,920
I said move it, you're too close.

224
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,190
Ah, you need more space?

225
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:19,610
Here. I'll always keep this not burdening distance for you.

226
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,040
At this part, you know how he runs away?

227
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,870
Yeah.

228
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,590
You said you'd keep a distance.

229
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,100
Hey, you..you. Why are you making me- distance?

230
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,790
Hey. Dividing work and love clearly and drawing the line between public and private matters

231
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,120
I'm not that kind of person.

232
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,460
I'm really vague at those things.

233
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,950
Draw while I'm stuck right next to you. I won't separate from you.

234
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:05,450
I'd like if you would separate far faaar away from me.

235
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,520
It's not that I don't like it...

236
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,490
I'm afraid..

237
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,600
to truly understand how someone feels.

238
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,140
It's the first time...

239
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,550
I received this kind of confession.

240
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,070
Since I can understand X's mind really well,

241
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,130
It's really fun. Exclamation mark.

242
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,160
It seems like the real X is giving you advice.

243
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,640
Question mark. X seems to be a really really handsome-

244
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,420
What am I doing?

245
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,740
Someone gave it to me.

246
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,060
Who?
Huh?

247
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,380
Oh... my secretary.

248
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,030
Half spiced, half fried.

249
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,290
Eat and study hard.

250
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,320
If you don't raise your grades this time, I'm not going to let it pass!

251
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,450
Oh, how frustrating.

252
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,940
Your dad is throwing a fit saying how you're dumb because you resemble me.

253
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,370
I'm sorry.

254
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,100
Anyway, if you can't even get a first place at a school like yours,

255
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,100
There is no way you can compete with the geniuses at Seoul Law School.

256
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,620
You even have a personal consultant-

257
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,220
You have a tutor for each subject and your grade point average.

258
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,020
What are you lacking that you're only second place?

259
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:34,200
You definitely have to beat Dae Hwi this time. No matter what.

260
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,890
Understood?

261
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,870
Oh my, you haven't eaten at all yet. Quickly eat.

262
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,840
You need to eat to gather your strength. Go on and eat already.

263
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,540
I'm sorry, but may I please see your notes for literature?

264
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,000
This is a summary note for the exam.

265
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,910
A summary note?

266
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,090
Oh my gosh.

267
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,730
Thanks.

268
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,000
Let's talk, Song Dae Hwi.

269
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,270
Did you run a background check on me?

270
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,450
I didn't do it on purpose.

271
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,260
Was it fun?

272
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,670
Seeing how I go around lying, did you laugh because of how pathetic I am?

273
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,890
Nam Joo. It's not like that.

274
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,200
That's why you should have said something!

275
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,880
That you know! That you know everything so I should stop!

276
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,180
Why?

277
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,920
Why did it have to be that day of all days?

278
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,750
Did you have to do that on that day?

279
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,700
Just like you said, it was our 200 day anniversary.

280
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,810
The time that we spent together...

281
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:38,680
Until the end, I contemplated on whether we should continue to spend time together or not.

282
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,940
Don't pretend to be nice now, Song Dae Hwi.

283
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,130
Your eyes that looked at me without any emotion... did you think I didn't know?

284
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,580
Then you shouldn't have done it at all!

285
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,790
Those pointless lies!

286
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,720
How do you think I felt suspecting you?

287
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,020
That's why I gave you a chance to tell me everything truthfully.

288
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,590
To tell me everything!

289
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,170
Chance?

290
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,450
Who are you to give me a chance?

291
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,540
You... are you real from your head to your toes?

292
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,840
Coward. What was I to you?

293
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,350
Wasn't I just someone you took around to show other people?

294
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,900
Hong Nam Joo. Why are you saying that?

295
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,910
Did you even like me?

296
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,970
Let's talk again later.

297
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:40,420
♫ As much as I am young, you too are young ♫

298
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:47,570
♫ During that time I forgot again and made it difficult for you ♫

299
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:54,860
♫  (Try to understand) I just complained. ♫

300
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,020
♫ (Why didn't you even know) You just hated  ♫

301
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,160
Dad! I told you not to look for me at school!

302
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,100
My daughter. You like this bakery's bread!

303
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,210
Take it before your younger siblings can eat it all. Go on!

304
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,890
Hong Nam Joo!

305
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:18,230
Isn't this your dad's company?

306
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,970
You're right. My dad's taxi... company.

307
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,870
I see.

308
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,460
Hey, your neighborhood is really nice.

309
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,380
I'll just go by myself from here.

310
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,990
Alright.

311
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,130
♫ I pray for you ♫

312
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,360
♫  You're too small yet to contain my tears. ♫

313
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,860
♫  Too small yet  ♫

314
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,990
♫  when they filled up and overflows somehow you didn't know  ♫

315
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,790
I feel like my image is all fake.

316
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,640
Filled with lies.

317
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,760
Hey. Is there anyone who doesn't lie?

318
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,130
They just have circumstances that call for that.

319
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,210
♫ (Why didn't you even know?) Then you hated a lot. ♫

320
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,850
Is that it?

321
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:14,920
♫ I pray 4 you. I want to convey this regretful feeling ♫

322
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,180
Congratulations on our 200th day.

323
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,510
I was thankful for all this time.

324
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,560
I was happy.

325
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,050
And from now on...

326
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:32,220
♫ I hope it reaches you, I hope you know my true heart. ♫

327
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:38,050
♫ I miss you, my love ♫

328
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,990
♫ And I miss you ♫

329
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,100
♫ My love ♫
-This is Sin Gang Transportation, right?

330
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,690
I'm friend's with the CEO's daughter.

331
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,900
What? Daughter?

332
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,180
Our CEO doesn't have a daughter though. Excuse me, but where are you?

333
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:02,160
♫ Don't feel upset with me without knowing me. ♫

334
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,200
♫ Fool, take care of me  ♫

335
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,760
Nam Joo.

336
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,600
♫  as you always have  ♫

337
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,300
Oh my god! I heard Issue is an outcast in Geum Sang Chum Hwa.

338
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,190
The rumor about his discharge must be true.

339
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,350
That must be true.
He hasn't come to school either.
That's right.

340
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,960
You're wrong. My oppa just came back from an overseas trip.

341
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,010
Hey, who's EC?

342
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,300
It's not EC, it's Issue!

343
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,440
That's what I'm saying, EC. Who is EC?

344
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,860
Issue! Issue!! Oppa's name is Issue!!

345
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,000
Seriously!

346
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,490
Hey. He's not an outcast.

347
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,830
Come on, the internet right now is full of people making a scene saying he's an outcast.

348
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,070
So what? So whatever is posted here is all true?

349
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,120
Do you want me to report you two to my Oppa agency

350
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,590
Do you want me to report you two to my Oppa's agency?

351
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,070
But... why would you report?

352
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,590
It's true. I'm an outcast.

353
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,270
And I would also be discharged soon.

354
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,890
What?

355
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,100
Didn't you know already?

356
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,290
No, but...

357
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,430
I already knew you didn't have much personal appointments and had many absences.

358
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:36,730
But, I didn't know you were an outcast.

359
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,330
It strangely feels like you're dissing me.

360
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,370
No, no!

361
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:46,230
Oppa, then are you really going to be discharged?

362
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,440
No. I'm quitting first.

363
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,930
Then it seems like you will have nothing to do from now on.

364
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,520
Hey!

365
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,630
Then let's-

366
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,930
Are you making things even worse? Do you want to die?

367
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,060
Oppa. Go.

368
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,590
I told you I'm not your Oppa.

369
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:11,260
I feel like it'd be fun if we did it together though.

370
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,000
I will definitely catch X with my own hands! Come here! To the principal's office!

371
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,100
Rumors?

372
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,300
Who is X?

373
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,390
These kind of rumors.

374
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,700
I can't do this though.

375
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,200
Hey, eat.

376
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,420
Rumors about X?

377
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,500
Ah, I don't drink that.

378
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,380
Soju?

379
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,560
I think he has a pale face.

380
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,540
That's why he uses a black hoodie.

381
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,000
Wow, this is totally CSI!

382
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,760
If it's not strawberry milk, I won't drink it.

383
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,790
So who do you think is suspicious?

384
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,990
My gut feeling is really good.

385
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,430
In my opinion, I think he's a really fast person.

386
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,550
He keeps escaping, and has never been caught once.

387
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,050
That's right! You are right!

388
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,250
The culprit is definitely

389
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,790
Super fast! 100 meters in 12 seconds!

390
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,900
Are you the one who runs 100 meters in 12 seconds?

391
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,620
Hey, Hong Nam Joo

392
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,150
What?

393
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,940
Is it true, that your family owns Sin Gang Transportation?

394
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,190
Huh?

395
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:45,650
I mean, my mom said the president was a bachelor or something.

396
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,110
That's...

397
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,410
She must have been mistaken.

398
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,760
I mean, it's not like it's a small company.

399
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,330
How could every employee know about the president's private life?

400
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,160
But isn't something like that natural for everyone to know?

401
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,730
Is it just a rumor?

402
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,460
I think he misunderstood because your dad doesn't really talk about his family much.

403
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,710
There's always been a lot of rumors.

404
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,950
Rumors are the problem.

405
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,960
Ahn Jeong Il, class is going to start soon. Go back to your seat.

406
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,350
Was it you?

407
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,790
What?

408
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,720
The rumor about us.

409
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,040
I heard about it and they say I became a pregnant woman.

410
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,580
Do you think I would start a rumor like that?

411
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,630
Did you call me out here just to talk about this?

412
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,580
If it wasn't you, who else could it be?

413
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,190
No one else knows about this but you and me.

414
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,350
Then there must be someone else who knows.

415
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,680
There is no such thing as a secret in this world.

416
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,390
Bo Ra

417
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,820
You know that if my mom finds out I'm dead!

418
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,190
What does that have to do with me?

419
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,180
You really didn't tell anyone else about us?

420
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,470
I didn't.

421
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,670
I'm begging you. You really didn't tell anyone?

422
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:33,450
Is this yours?

423
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,670
I picked it up on the path by the trees and thought it might be yours.

424
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,500
I lost my diary a while ago.

425
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,630
What are you saying?

426
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:50,990
The letters you and I exchanged.

427
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,460
Ra Eun Ho picked it up and brought it back to me but...

428
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,980
Are you crazy?!

429
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,160
How could you lose something like that!

430
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,830
Why were you even still carrying that around!

431
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,660
It didn't seem like she'd read it.

432
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,930
How could you know that? How could you?

433
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,340
Where's Ra Eun Ho?

434
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,890
Give it to me.

435
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,080
Hey! Dummy-

436
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,810
What are you looking at? Go.

437
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,780
She strangely resembled her.

438
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,660
Where'd she go?

439
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,170
Did you spread that nonsense rumor?

440
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,210
Why are you randomly asking this?

441
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,320
Didn't you read Seo Bo Ra's diary?

442
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,100
Me? What are you talking about?

443
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,370
You should've just shut your mouth if you read the diary without any permission!

444
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,390
She and I aren't in that kind of relationship.

445
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,940
She just followed me because she liked me!

446
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:27,340
What do you mean I read it without permission? This is ridiculous.

447
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,250
Where are you going?

448
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,560
Tell the others it's a lie.

449
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,450
I'm so bothered by it I'm going to end up failing my exams!

450
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,440
You really must be crazy.

451
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,430
Hey!

452
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,380
Kim Hui Chan!

453
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,080
Hey! It was you, wasn't it!

454
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,250
I told you it wasn't!

455
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,190
Hey, Seo Bo Ra, what are you doing here?

456
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,960
It was you, wasn't it!

457
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,600
I told you it wasn't!

458
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,670
-What's going on?
- It was you!

459
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,950
- I'm telling you it wasn't!
- There's no one else it could be!

460
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,170
It wasn't me-!

461
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,420
Y-you...

462
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,110
Kim Hui Chan!!!

463
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,310
Hyeon Tae Woon! I'm fine! I'm okay, really!

464
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,800
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm fine so Hyeon Tae Woon, stop.

465
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,580
I mean it, stop. Please just stop!

466
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,820
The nurse is always leaving the office without putting a sign on the door. I don't know where she went.

467
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,190
You always end up causing trouble.

468
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,640
This is why I told you I had to stick to your side.

469
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,920
Who said you could get hurt!

470
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,690
What about it?

471
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,800
Why did he do it? Kim Hui Chan.

472
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,420
I don't know.

473
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,070
He thought I spread the rumor that he and Bo Ra were dating.

474
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,520
They were dating?

475
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,150
I don't know either.

476
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,560
I picked up Bo Ra's diary a little bit ago and gave it back to her.

477
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,900
Something about it must have been written in there.

478
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,400
He misunderstood that I read it and then spread that rumor.

479
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,700
Wow, this bastard, seriously. Dating is just dating.

480
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,860
What's the point of making a ruckus over a rumor about something like that?

481
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,380
There are people who'd love a rumor like that to start.

482
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,920
What?

483
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,290
Give me your arm! Let's take a look at it.

484
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,600
Kim Hui Chan...

485
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,860
You just stay put right here.

486
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,110
Hyeon Tae Woon!

487
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,420
Why'd you come out? I told you to stay in there and rest! You're injured!

488
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,250
You aren't going to go beat Hui Chan up, are you?

489
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,170
Yeah, I'm going to beat him up. I'll hit him ten times as many times as he hit you. What's wrong with that?

490
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,240
Just stop.

491
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,650
How can you live by only doing what you feel all the time?

492
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,970
Hey! I'm angry for your sake.

493
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,280
Did I ever tell you to go fight around and get hurt?

494
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,650
Okay, I understand. Please stop losing your temper so easily. Please.

495
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,780
Ok I won't. I won't. I did that because of you.

496
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,170
How are you going to take responsibility for the mark on my child's face?!

497
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,760
My Eun Ho was hurt too, you know!

498
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,730
I saw that Eun Ho usually has a really terrible behavior!

499
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,970
Even the last time, she almost got herself expelled!

500
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:39,950
That was a mistake on the school's part! Isn't that right, teacher?

501
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,990
I'm not simply a teacher, I'm the current acting principal.

502
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,060
This person is currently suspended from duty.

503
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,450
Anyway, that decision was one made by the suspended from duty principal

504
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,340
But the fact that she entered the Teacher's Office was a wrong on her part.

505
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,520
It wasn't a huge wrong, but it was a moderate wrong.

506
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,660
- See? That child is a problem child!
- Problem child?

507
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,330
- Who was the one who hit my Eun Ho first?!
-You've got a response for everything! Seriously!

508
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,280
Don't you know who my Hui Chan's father is? He's the son of one our country Korea's prosecutors, Kim-

509
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,100
Who cares about his father!

510
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,870
What about you? Do you know who my daughter's father is?

511
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,580
- Don't you know who Ra Seung Bo is?
- Who?

512
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,940
Please calm down first.

513
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,570
What point is there to fighting over a mere children's fight? Let's calm down. There, there. Sit down, please.

514
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,620
Your morals are at the bottom.

515
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,360
Please stop mentioning about morals being at the bottom, Mr. Suspension.

516
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,910
Start a school violence committee meeting immediately! I'll prove to you without a doubt who the culprit is!

517
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:33,130
Go ahead and start it! Am I supposed to fear that? A stupid school violence committee meeting?

518
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,660
Stop disturbing me and go away.

519
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:59,790
Why? I came to see how badly you're hurt from getting hit by  me.

520
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,640
Are you crazy?

521
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,440
I'm so crazy I'm losing my mind.

522
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,590
Are you enjoying the idea of telling the school violence committee I was the perpetrator?

523
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,170
Stop bothering me and go away. Now.

524
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,040
The fact that you hit me

525
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,800
Until you properly apologize to me for it, I'm never going to go away.

526
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,530
I told you to go away! Now!!

527
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,300
It's almost exam time, so let's be quiet. You're disturbing the kids.

528
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,940
Dae Hwi. I don't think this is a situation for you to be meddling in.

529
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,370
Ra Eun Ho was the one who caused a disturbance first.

530
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,070
Look who's talking.

531
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,900
Let's go out for a moment.

532
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,560
What are you doing?

533
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,040
Now you hit girls too?

534
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,210
There was a misunderstanding.

535
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,100
A misunderstanding?

536
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:47,150
What? Should I misunderstand you?

537
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,450
Then can I beat you up?

538
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,060
What are you doing?

539
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,040
If I did what I wanted, I would have already beat you up, you punk.

540
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:10,130
Why are you interfering in Ra Eun Ho's matters? Why you?

541
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,680
Why do you think?

542
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:26,060
You... If you bother Ra Eun Ho one more time, you'll really die.

543
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,860
I'm not joking.

544
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,580
Give me that diary.

545
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,420
I don't want to. Why would I?

546
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,260
Everything about us is written in there.

547
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,190
And if it is? You're going to get rid of it?

548
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,520
What if the kids see it like this time?

549
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,510
Are you that embarrassed and regretful that you dated me?

550
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,050
Seo Bo Ra, you know that's not it.

551
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:38,160
Why? Are you afraid that what you did will come out?!

552
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,040
What did you just say? Huh?

553
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,040
Come here.

554
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,300
Now, you stalk me? Do you not know I'm going to be killed by my mom?

555
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,670
That's why you need to formally apologize.

556
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:05,060
What apology? What did I do wrong?

557
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,910
You were the one you started that rumor, weren't you?
No matter how things were, how could you spread a rumor like that?

558
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,960
I didn't lie though.

559
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,750
Right? You were acting wasteful behind my back. Weren't you?

560
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,020
You really are the worst. Let go, I understand.

561
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,070
Do you think I don't know that you go around flirting with guys behind my back?

562
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,230
Do you know why I asked to break up with you?

563
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,290
Because of this. Your obsession.

564
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,140
Now you don't even apologize after hitting me.

565
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,380
Your family doesn't know about your anger issues, do they?!

566
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,330
Shut your mouth.

567
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,020
I'm going to tell them everything.

568
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,330
I'm going to tell the school, your mom,

569
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,920
and all of the kids and you-

570
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,080
Tell them!

571
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,820
Alright. Try to tell them.

572
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:04,140
Then you'll find out what'll happen to you, if they know.

573
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,840
Stop it.

574
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,320
Bothering girls is a habit for you.

575
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,400
Aren't you going to let go of her?

576
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,090
You should mind your own business.

577
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:29,940
I'm sorry, but I am very interested in others' business nowadays.

578
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:34,870
No, I guess it's not others' business.

579
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,820
I told you to let go of her, while I'm talking nicely.

580
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,170
Stop now while you can.

581
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:07,720
If you want to keep going, go ahead. See what happens.

582
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:33,460
I lost my diary recently...

583
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,690
The one that we exchanged letters on..

584
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,780
Bo Ra. You are an important witness.

585
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:54,120
Saying something won't cause Eun Ho any harm.

586
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,830
You just need to tell me what happened between Hui Chan and Eun Ho that day.

587
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,490
I really don't know anything.

588
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,520
Is it easier to live like that? Not knowing anything?

589
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:09,740
What?

590
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,960
You said that you didn't know what happened last time too, and you became the perpetrator that hit Bit Na.

591
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,960
You also became the thief for stealing the summary note. I think it's a bad idea to live like that.

592
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,060
Teacher...

593
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:30,980
I'm telling you to judge wisely on what will make your life easier.

594
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,400
Bo Ra.

595
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:48,230
You saw everything, so why are you pretending like you don't know anything?

596
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,910
I don't know. I didn't see anything.

597
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:51,890
Bo Ra...

598
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:57,040
I really don't know anything, nor do I want to know.

599
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,960
I'm not even asking you to lie. You just need to tell them exactly what you saw.

600
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,390
You can tell them that much.

601
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,650
If I tell them, do you think anything would change?

602
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:15,030
If I told them, do you think you could win against Kim Hui Chan?

603
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:20,490
You... weren't telling them on purpose?

604
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:26,850
Is it possibly because of the rumor that's been going around about you and Hui Chan?

605
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,200
Seo Bo Ra.

606
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,270
Wait.

607
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,480
I don't have anything to talk to you about.

608
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,290
Did Kim Hui Chan order you again?

609
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:00,890
That's not it. I just came because I was worried.

610
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:05,700
Don't worry. I'm doing fine, doing what you told me to do a long time ago.

611
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,400
You told me to just be quiet because I'm going to lose anyway.

612
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,710
Bo Ra. Back then...

613
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:15,030
Back then, I thought you were sincere.

614
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:20,380
That's why I stopped. I didn't know that you were this cowardly and this much of a bad person.

615
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:25,950
Back then... I'm really sorry about what happened back then.

616
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:31,070
But not all of it was untrue.

617
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,290
Go and tell Kim Hui Chan

618
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:38,090
that I won't let anything happen to him, so to relax.

619
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:50,700
School Violence Statement. Ra Eun Ho.

620
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,550
School Violence Statement. Seo Bo Ra.

621
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,230
I don't know anything so please don't ask me any more questions.

622
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:05,400
This isn't even counselling, seems like we're conducting an investigation.

623
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,220
We're literally obtaining information by asking each individual.

624
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:13,590
Obviously we have to interrogate in order to find out the truth after each incident.

625
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,290
Rather than the truth,

626
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,880
I want to find students' sincerity from this.

627
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:26,880
I don't want to deal with these kids like a detective investigating a case.

628
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,660
You have to discover the real truth first to be able to know what's in someone's heart.

629
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:36,680
I think that the wounds you receive during that process is inevitable.

630
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,530
I know that too, but they're still young kids.

631
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,490
Kids that can resolve problems and make up through words.

632
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:45,950
What's young about being 18?

633
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,370
You don't know

634
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:53,960
how scary kids can become once they start becoming cruel.

635
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,690
Even so, giving up is a bit much.

636
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:02,030
It's an age where they can turn back, 18.

637
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,750
That could happen.

638
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,830
Teach Soo Ji, would you like to eat-?

639
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,030
Why are you working instead of getting off work?

640
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,190
Why did you come?

641
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,210
Teacher Jeong, have you ever been a guidance counsellor?

642
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,890
Am I crazy? Of course not.

643
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,320
Is this a crazy thing to do?

644
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,090
Yes, it's like holding a bomb.

645
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:42,210
Once the school violence committee is held, all the teacher's jobs are paralyzed.

646
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,080
Like that sick man over there.

647
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,300
It's really like a police investigation.

648
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:07,570
Looking at what the kids said, what and when things happened.

649
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:14,900
Eventually, there is no time for him to think after hearing and noting everything.

650
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,070
On top of that, he has to manage teacher's task,

651
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:25,200
meet with parents, and interrogate students.

652
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,600
In addition, he also has to organize everything into a document.

653
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,420
So the teacher in charge eventually is dying out.

654
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,100
I know right.

655
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:51,230
In saying that, it's not to the point where we have to look at them with pity.

656
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,350
I'm going to go patrol around.

657
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:59,040
Sure, just the two of us.

658
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,440
You can't go with just the two of you.

659
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,300
You can't.

660
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,460
Ah, seriously.

661
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:12,530
Han Ol Hair Gallery

662
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,300
Nam Joo

663
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,410
I can't break up with you like this. Was I the only one who lied?

664
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:48,790
How about you? Were they all sincere?

665
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:57,370
It wasn't fake.

666
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,620
I didn't have a choice.

667
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,770
I wasn't planning on lying from the start.

668
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:10,840
The kids thought that I'm from a rich family.

669
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,410
that I'm from a rich family.

670
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:20,640
But honestly at that time, I didn't want to say I wasn't.

671
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,220
Nam Joo

672
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,750
You're right, I was embarrassed.

673
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:30,140
When you saw my father's taxi and asked if he owned the business?

674
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,690
I was too embarrassed

675
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,640
to say that my dad is a taxi driver.

676
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:47,830
Nam Joo, I know. I know why you did that.

677
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,650
How could I judge you?

678
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:54,610
Then why?

679
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:59,510
Then why are you being like this?

680
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:04,620
Can't you forgive me just this once? I won't lie in the future.

681
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,660
I won't trick you for anything.

682
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:16,340
If you liked me, wasn't that feeling sincere?

683
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,600
I liked you.

684
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,630
When I first saw you, your smile was really pretty.

685
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:41,950
When you sat next to me, I was so nervous.

686
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:49,030
But, that wasn't the only reason I liked you.

687
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:54,810
Maybe, I don't want to acknowledge your lie.

688
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,600
Perhaps I liked the rich girl Hong Nam Joo

689
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:04,520
more than the poor girl Hong Nam Joo.

690
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:12,080
How could someone like me have the right to like you?

691
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:30,920
♫ When I get home it's dark ♫

692
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:38,500
♫ So that my tired feet can take a rest ♫

693
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:46,310
♫ Like fluttering in the wind ♫

694
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:53,900
♫ Even my shaky mind can take a break ♫

695
00:59:55,740 --> 01:00:00,850
♫ Let's go home ♫

696
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,740
What's lunch for today?

697
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,300
We have to deal with Ra Eun Ho quickly.

698
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,600
Like that time.

699
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,650
Why? You don't want to?

700
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,140
To be honest, I don't feel like doing that.

701
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:18,190
I don't want to get involved in these complicated matters anymore.

702
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:23,470
I hope you stop asking me to do these things.

703
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,610
So you want to survive alone.

704
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,180
Are you threatening me right now?

705
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,820
No I'm just telling the truth.

706
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,690
If what happened last year gets out, am I the only one who has a problem?

707
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:42,260
You'll get hurt too, is that okay?

708
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,860
It doesn't matter, so don't-

709
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:52,510
Don't act brave when you're shaking from fear on the inside.

710
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:59,620
To be blunt, even if I get ruined I can go study abroad.

711
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:03,360
No matter what, my family will restart my life for me.

712
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,350
But you, it's over for you.

713
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:11,810
We've done well up until now. Why are you being like this?

714
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:16,180
Let's fix this.

715
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,270
Are you not embarrassed?

716
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,590
Get out of my business.

717
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:48,570
You cowardly made a poor girl's life miserable by threatening her.

718
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:54,270
But when you're in front of the kids you put on act that you're kind, wealthy, and fight for world justice.

719
01:02:54,990 --> 01:03:00,390
Is it fun? Our school president's real face.

720
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:31,030
♫ Believing now in this moment I ♫

721
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:36,370
♫ Sometimes I feel insecure and uneasy but ♫

722
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:41,430
♫  As I think of you ♫

723
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:44,630
If Ra Eun Ho really is X's accomplice.

724
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:48,290
Eun Pal ! The wall poster is daebak !

725
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:52,140
I won't let you fight by yourself and I won't ever let you be lonely. Trust me.

726
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,550
Gather your strength and let's fight.

727
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:55,620
By chance, during first year

728
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,590
Bo Ra, are you okay?!

729
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:58,820
Did something happen with Bo Ra?

730
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:02,630
Do you want to see something really scary? I'm completely confident.

731
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,280
I have a different favor to ask of you.

732
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,460
But, Ra Eun Ho, are you perhaps...

733
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,650
You're full of confidence? I'm full of confidence, too.
