1
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,890
May Midterm

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,540
Tests. In that suffocating situation, in that prison,

3
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,520
we all think of the same thing.

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,470
Please, at least let the Earth explode

5
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,920
and ruin this test time.

6
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,630
English

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,190
However,

8
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,400
someone actually allows our imagination to become a reality.

9
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,400
My ordinary 18 year old life

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,500
made an unexpected turn.

11
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,490
School 2017
Grades Divided Society

12
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,480
5 days before

13
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,870
Episode 1

14
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,500
♬  I am going to trust this moment  ♬

15
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,720
♬  Although sometimes I'm not confident and I'm nervous  ♬

16
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,730
♬  Just like how you came into my heart. Oh oh.  ♬

17
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,490
♬  Expect an amazing event to occur.  ♬

18
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,540
Next, second grade (of high school).

19
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,620
Starting with Song Dae Hwi, the first place to tenth place people can enter.

20
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,900
You must be happy.

21
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,840
-Hello.
-Eat a little.

22
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,420
Next, eleventh place to twentieth place.

23
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,170
Why is the system like this.

24
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,260
Ah, this is annoying.

25
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,170
Since when did they let us eat according to our grades? So if we can't study well, we have to starve?

26
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,450
If the school gets bombed, then that's when this system will disappear.

27
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,390
Aish, today's menu is bulgogi (marinated beef or pork). What if they run out towards the front of the line?

28
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,250
We paid the same price, but how come our side dishes are the instant left overs?

29
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,370
I know.

30
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,800
What is this?

31
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,220
That jerk has special service again?

32
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,260
Leave them be. His dad is the chairman here and this school is his family's.

33
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,170
Let him eat a whole lot.

34
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,690
Bad jerk.

35
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,030
Why? Why?

36
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,190
Hey... Why is my face so round?

37
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,970
I got surprised. Hey, who said it's round?

38
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,020
Your face isn't round.

39
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,220
Really?

40
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,260
It's like a sqaure. It's totally a square.

41
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,990
I have to look slim. Oppa Jong Goon said he likes slim girls.

42
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,030
-Hey you 18 year old. Are you really going to skip school?
-Hey.
-Why?

43
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,560
Oh Sa Rang. Oh Sa Rang!

44
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,800
Should I really throw it?

45
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,500
One...

46
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,810
Are you okay? Sorry.

47
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,800
Oh Sa Rang... Because I trusted you...

48
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,110
Sorry.

49
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,000
Here.

50
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,900
Are you going to your part time job?

51
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,480
School President!

52
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,370
Are you really going to skip class for a part time job?

53
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,820
I have to go somewhere more important than a part time job.

54
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,400
Don't worry. I'll cover you if you get caught.

55
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,820
Really? Hey, then I'd be really thankful!

56
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,230
Bye!

57
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,470
It's an essay contest, right?

58
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,070
Yes. It's the Korea University Essay Contest.

59
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,330
If you do well here, Korea University might scout you.

60
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,440
But you're going to Seoyool University anyway ....
[word play on Seoul University]

61
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,730
Well, I should make an effort.

62
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,420
Okay then.

63
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,540
You must be nervous.

64
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,470
Hold on.

65
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,490
If you get nervous,

66
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,130
set your head back and loosen your body.

67
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,410
Breathe in deeply.

68
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,440
I'm not nervous.

69
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,570
- Huh?
-I'm not nervous, Teacher. I'll perform well.

70
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,410
You're not nervous?

71
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,500
If you're not nervous, then I'll teach you how to stimulate the brain when taking tests.

72
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,710
I'll be back.

73
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,630
Dae Hwi!

74
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,100
Here, ride a taxi.

75
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,700
Thank you, Teacher. I'll do well.

76
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,030
Stop patting that on. Your philtrum will be disappeared.

77
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,710
Hey! Are you skipping class too?

78
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,610
Hey, Ra Eun Ho. Do you think I was here to see you?

79
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,950
Ah seriously. If two people are absent then it's so obvious!

80
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,390
No no. You are not that meaningful person. Don't worry.

81
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,800
You make a person controlling her mind flare up.

82
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,970
I can't be tardy because even if I'm one minute late, the kids make a big fuss.

83
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,870
I have a great presence.

84
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,140
Really? You just seem crazy.

85
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,980
Hey.

86
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,640
Hey, do you want to die?

87
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,100
It's really loud. Go after I leave!

88
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,460
Let's go!

89
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,240
♬  Our summer days together pass by so quickly  ♬

90
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,200
♬  Between the shining sunshine  ♬

91
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:59,450
♬  When I think of you, my heart pounds crazily.  ♬

92
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,540
♬  With the blinding bright blue sky  ♬

93
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,520
♬  Trees dancing outside the window  ♬

94
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,330
Hey are you okay?

95
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,610
You.

96
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,850
What do I do? I have to get there fast.

97
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,930
Get on!

98
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,800
Aish. Hey!

99
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,020
You said you're late!

100
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,140
Hurry and get on! Aren't you going to get on?

101
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,370
Three, two...

102
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,060
Do I look weird? Hey, do I look weird?

103
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,280
What? Do I look too cute for you?

104
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,450
Awww you're so cute I wanna bite you and make you bleed. Are you in a kabuki, powdering your face with that much makeup?

105
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,150
Kabu– Hey!

106
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:40,700
Yes, you are right. Eighteen. But can't I do it without wearing my uniform?

107
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,010
I didn't seem to do that well in my uniform because it's embarrassing.

108
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,120
It's uncomfortable too. It can't be helped then.

109
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,540
You're giving the money as promised, correct?

110
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,960
Yes, I got it. Yes.

111
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,670
Why? What?

112
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,680
You? Ha.. In your uniform? Doing that?

113
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,130
Wow....How much do you get paid for you to do it in your uniform?

114
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,740
It has pretty good hourly pay. Lately, people prefer us in uniform.

115
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,550
Wow, Ra Eun Ho. Your personality is so cool. Can you just say those words like that?

116
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,200
This is a bit–

117
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:33,740
Yes, I'm here. You're in the front of the library? I'll be there in a second.

118
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,750
The library...

119
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,870
Tae Woon. Tae Woon.

120
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,620
You draw well.

121
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,940
Ever since first grade, I liked...

122
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,640
Aren't you hot?

123
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,420
Your helmet.

124
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,410
What about being in first grade?

125
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,740
Ever since first grade, I liked it.

126
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:59,950
But aren't you suppose to be studying hard right now? It'd be nice if you studied hard to come to my school.

127
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,500
That's true.

128
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,620
It's really nice to be in university.

129
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,190
My college dream was to be part of a campus couple.

130
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,070
Hey, really. Me too!

131
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,060
Huh?

132
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,720
Well, just work hard and come to my school.

133
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,640
But what's your school rank?

134
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:38,240
Hey, hey, hey, Ra Eun Ho! Your grades went up so much! You're now 270th place!!!

135
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,890
Well my grades went up a lot...

136
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,250
That's good. I'm not just saying this because the school's prestigious, but my school is really good.

137
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,100
Make sure you come to my school.

138
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,630
Why?

139
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,340
What are you?

140
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,580
- Who are you to do this?
- I'm Hyeon Tae Woon.

141
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,870
Hey, are you crazy?!

142
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,970
Do you like that?

143
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,100
Paying for sex with a young girl in broad daylight?

144
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,080
Sex with a minor?

145
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,780
It seems like you're misunderstanding something.

146
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,160
What, perverted jerk? Do you have a uniform kink?

147
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,130
Does my fist appeal to you too?

148
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,730
Are you crazy? Hey! Minor prostitution–The things I hear in my life....

149
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,400
- I apologized.
- Is an apology everything?

150
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,230
How scared would Sunbae Jong Goon have been?

151
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,050
If he gets a scratch on his face, I'll kill you!

152
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,430
Even if he gets a scratch on his face it probably won't be noticeable anyways. He looks like a skylark.

153
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:55,730
Huh? Skylark? You're funny.

154
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,660
Your face isn't that great looking to be so egotistical.

155
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,390
Why?

156
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,490
Hey, why are you like this? I'm sorry.

157
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,810
Aren't you going to go get your bike?

158
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:16,320
Right, my bike. Bike! Bike! Bike–

159
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,540
I'm fine. Go safely, Eun Ho.

160
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,700
When I go to college,

161
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,370
becoming a campus couple with you is my dream

162
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,760
Yes, Sunbae.

163
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,650
Tomorrow, second phase mock examination grades are being posted on the announcement board.

164
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,600
Move aside.

165
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,870
Hey!

166
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,500
Hey, hey.

167
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,400
If we don't get good grades, we eat lunch late, and we can't even go into the library.

168
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,670
Ah.... I'm pissed. Is happiness decided by your grades?

169
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,290
Wow. Is Song Dae Hwi first again?

170
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,430
Wow.

171
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,090
Are you happy, first placer?

172
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,200
Should I be happy even though I'm first place in the school? I should at least be first in the nation.

173
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,430
- Hey, hit him.
- It was just a joke.

174
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,860
Just hit him.
280th place: Ra Eun Ho

175
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,090
May's 3rd Mock Examination D-3.

176
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,330
Why are we taking three mock examinations in one month? We just got our 2nd phase mock examination grades back right now.

177
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,710
That's true!

178
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:14,470
So the thing is...There are a lot,

179
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,150
but don't feel burdened, and just do as you always do.

180
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,750
When school posts all of our grades on the announcement board, how can we not feel burdened?

181
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,190
She's right!

182
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,320
It's burdensome.

183
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,680
Okay, okay. I'll talk about reducing the number of tests this time.

184
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,260
- Class dismissed.
- What?
- Teacher!

185
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,830
Teacher! Teacher!

186
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,830
Hey! Apparently, next month, we're going to have four mock examinations.

187
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,120
What?!

188
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,220
Really? Hey, real story? really?

189
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,540
Hey, Yoon Gyeong Woo, keep quiet!

190
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,700
Who is it? Who took my notebook?

191
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,830
Hey, hey, hey!

192
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,750
Bring it back right now! Who took it?

193
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,530
Be quiet. How annoying.

194
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,130
Huh?

195
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,650
Hey, hey! Stop going around.

196
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,370
Hey! Because you're so loud, I'm getting everything wrong.

197
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,170
- Did you ever get any correct?
- You're louder, Yoo Bin Na.

198
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,730
Why is she acting as if she's the only one who studies?

199
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,750
What?! What did you just say to me?

200
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,550
Hey, is it you who took my notes?

201
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,210
- It's true.
- What are you doing?!

202
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,200
Where is it?

203
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,490
Hey! Hey!

204
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,480
Hey! Hey! Stop!

205
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,890
Let go and talk.

206
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,710
Let go.

207
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,830
The students' complaints are increasing.

208
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:38,400
Everyone complaining should be put into a washing machine to wake up.

209
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,840
Anyway, for next month, increase the number of mock examinations to four times.

210
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,270
Oh well, if we're going to do it this way, why don't we take mid-terms and finals four times each too?

211
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,280
We should take weekend examinations and vacation examinations too.

212
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,710
Excuse me. Even now, there are a lot of tests so complaints...

213
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,370
They're good.

214
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,060
We make our students study hard.

215
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,640
Every time, the grades come out that way.

216
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,350
These good results, have to be shown to the chairman-

217
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,970
Who even cares about this graph?

218
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,260
Oh, the bell has rung.

219
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,760
We hear the bell sound too.

220
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,480
Yes.

221
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,790
-Teacher Shim.

222
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,190
- Yes?
- Put up this graph at the center of the notice board,

223
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,710
because the chairman will come by soon.

224
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,340
Okay.

225
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,910
Does taking four mock examinations in one month make sense?

226
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:46,320
The students are going crazy, so why does what the chairman says matter....why couldn't I have said that?

227
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,550
This graph has been a great stimulus for the kids.

228
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,280
After grades were announced, the overall grades rose considerably.

229
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,330
We are all very proud.

230
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,130
What a relief.

231
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,840
No discrimination, Trustworthy Gumdo High School

232
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,720
287 No Seong Woo

233
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,710
288 Hyun Tae Woon

234
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,320
You should've removed Tae Woon.

235
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,610
The school is really going crazy.

236
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,600
I'm going crazy.

237
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,740
Pfft. Since when were you worried about tests?

238
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,190
It's okay.

239
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,220
I have to go to Korea University though.

240
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,950
Where?

241
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,370
D-2 to third mock exam

242
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,150
Korea University.

243
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,000
I have to get into Korea University.

244
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,340
Are you crazy? How are you going to go there?

245
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,070
If I go to his school, he said he wants to be a CC (campus couple) with me.

246
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,420
You're saying that Oppa Jong Goon really said that?

247
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,180
Yeah.

248
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,570
Anyway, he said something similar.

249
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,440
Are you sure he didn't say he just wants to try being part of a CC?

250
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,280
Not with you.

251
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,100
It's really fun when you come to university.

252
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,860
When I go to university, it's my dream to be a CC with you.

253
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,550
My college dream was to be part of a campus couple.

254
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,420
Anyway, I really want to go to Korea University.

255
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,510
Together with Oppa Jong Goon.

256
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,550
Anyway, how are you going to get in there?

257
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,800
- You can't.
- Why not?

258
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,330
I want to go. Korea University.

259
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:59,000
If I were you, I'd say that a little softer.

260
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,280
You.

261
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,820
In the Republic of Korea, the identity of a high school student is

262
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,150
determined by this one question.

263
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,260
What level are you?

264
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,120
Sixth.

265
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,080
You're level six. If I compared you in terms of meat levels,

266
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,050
you're not even qualified to be fed to dogs.

267
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,490
Being in level six at school

268
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,860
means that you can't be regarded as a human ever.

269
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,660
In this situation, you dare talk?

270
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,920
Is a person some kind of meat?

271
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,600
Dog food? Aishhh

272
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,520
That rat. Should I make him have a taste of death?

273
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,210
What's wrong with being level six, is it a crime to die for?

274
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,130
Hey, Ra Eun Ho, don't be discouraged. What's wrong with being level six?

275
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,930
It's okay, Level Six. It's okay.

276
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,170
I'm not discouraged...

277
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:13,210
but I'm about to die from embarrassment, so please be quiet, friend. Can we be quiet?

278
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,800
Mum.

279
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,840
Mother, hello.

280
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,830
You...

281
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,530
Ra Eun Ho.

282
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,150
You can get into Korea University.

283
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,880
Geez, you really..

284
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,390
I didn't see you as that kind of person, but you shouldn't tease someone about their weaknesses.

285
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,480
Why is your boyfriend like that?

286
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,140
- I'm going in first.
- Okay.

287
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,730
Okay.

288
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,720
Korea University?

289
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,880
Ah, starting this year, Korea University has a Webtoon Media Faculty.

290
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,280
They'll accept winners from their competition.

291
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,420
You draw well.

292
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,030
- Really?
- Yes, I heard about it at a Korea University competition.

293
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,840
Hey, she's level six. Six!

294
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,750
- Wait.
- Are you excited that I'm in level six?

295
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,300
A competition?

296
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
I sent you the link.

297
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,400
Do well.

298
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:22,130
Korea University Homepage

299
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,280
Webtoon! Competition!! Benefits!

300
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,820
Korea University.

301
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,590
Sunbae Jong Goon.

302
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,470
Who...?

303
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,980
So you got accepted into our school.

304
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,060
I knew you could do it.

305
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,230
I like you.

306
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,250
Sunbae, you have a girlfriend.

307
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,780
In love, there is good love and bad love.

308
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,420
I wanted to try that once. The bad love.

309
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,480
Since when did you... (like me)?

310
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,590
I drew a mole on you (picked you) a long time ago.

311
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,140
Why did you meet me?

312
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,850
Why did you only make me hurt?

313
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,020
Sunbae...

314
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,950
I gave you my everything.

315
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,550
What is this childish thing?

316
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,810
What? Give it to me.

317
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,420
Stop it. What are you thinking that makes the story so childish?

318
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,880
You're dead. Give it to me.

319
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,210
The story needs to extraordinary. Is it okay if only the female lead's nose bridge is extraordinary?

320
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,190
Her nose is so tall it looks like it'll kiss her forehead.

321
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,350
- Oh.
- Hold on, you can't look at that.

322
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,650
Ah, her name is Eun Hwa?

323
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,990
That's you, right?

324
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,600
Hm?

325
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,720
That's right. The story has to be extraordinary.

326
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,890
Ho. I'm Eun Ho.

327
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,880
Hey, hey. Eun Ho.

328
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,610
Okay. Eun Ho Ah (in Korean, Ho Ah together is Hwa).

329
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,770
Hey! That's not... me...

330
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,650
What's wrong with it?

331
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,520
- It is extraordinary, though.
- It's extraordinary.

332
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,090
The content is concentrating.

333
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,610
Mom!

334
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,470
An extraordinary story...

335
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,730
D-1 to the third mock exam

336
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,080
There are too many romance ones so it'll be hard to stand out. Action is hard to draw.

337
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,630
Medical ones... I don't want to study.

338
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,410
Should I do an erotic one?

339
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,220
You haven't even kissed once.

340
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,460
Ah really? Our Sa Rang already had hers in elementary school–

341
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,300
Mum!

342
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,750
There was that kid!

343
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,670
An extraordinary story...

344
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,150
Hong Nam Joo. Hong Nam Joo.

345
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,450
Let's go in earlier today to prepare for the exam.

346
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,710
You always go early.

347
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,480
Is that so?

348
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,930
Next time. Next time, when exams are over, I'll buy you something really tasty.

349
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,940
Okay. But...

350
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,340
You're going to give me all of the summaries for all subjects, right?

351
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,040
Wait a minute.

352
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:11,350
You don't need to look at everything. Just look at the ones checked in red.

353
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:15,150
They're all possible questions on the test. Thanks, Song Dae Hwi.

354
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,180
What to do? I have to go first.

355
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,350
Okay, you go first.

356
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,450
I'll go first.

357
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,530
Preparation for Different School's Exams

358
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,440
Pass!
100% Guaranteed

359
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,050
Get accepted into prestigious universities

360
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,710
Rocker English

361
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,030
Don't ever stain my reputation again with that kind of grade!

362
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,760
288 - Hyeon Tae Woon

363
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,800
Enroll in an academy immediately before I take away your credit card.

364
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,850
On page two, memorize this.

365
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:35,520
Example 2. You should study this. And this part will be in the test.

366
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,010
Memorize this.

367
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:43,300
As expected... Everything you pointed out for me came out on the last mock exam too.

368
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:49,470
Tens of private tutors? For school grades, Dae Hwi is better than anyone.

369
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,000
Korean, Math, English and Science, grade-A teachers are 3 million won per subject.

370
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,570
Essay class for teacher Lee Jun Seok is 5 million won.

371
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,900
Normal grade teachers price is...

372
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:05,370
Roughly best selling teachers, 5 or 6 subjects please.

373
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:11,080
But still, you should choose the subject that is most suitable for you... What is your ranking in school?

374
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,080
- I don't have to do it.
- What?

375
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,580
I don't really have to study that hard. My family has a lot of money.

376
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,820
So, please just choose everything. Make it look okay.

377
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,010
Thank you.

378
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,870
You worked hard.

379
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,540
I wish that our Hui Chan can beat you this time.

380
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,260
Yes.

381
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,990
Thank you.

382
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,720
Go inside.

383
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,500
- Song Dae Hwi!
- Oh!

384
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,710
Oh, you work here.

385
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:37,040
You're dead if you throw this away. My tears and sweat are in there.

386
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,320
Do you earn a lot of money?

387
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,860
Yes, they pay quite a lot for this.

388
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:46,110
Oh, I'm totally jealous. What are you going to do after earning all that money?

389
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,040
I want to buy a good tablet.

390
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,960
Tablet?

391
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,390
I'm a webtoon artist.

392
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:57,830
You're right! Korea University! Wow, I'm jealous. You even have a dream.

393
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,380
What about you? Don't you have any dreams?

394
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,960
My dream?

395
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,260
Rolling Admission to Seoul University
Total Responsibility!!

396
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,290
My son! You came?

397
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,810
How can even your looks be so great?

398
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,650
You must be full without even eating.

399
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,920
My kid goes to so many cram schools during the day.

400
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,960
Hey! The saying that you need to have money for your kids to be successful,

401
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,220
that's just what people say on TV.

402
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,870
Look at our Dae Hwi. Does he attend academy or have a tutor?

403
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,830
Ah, that's totally luck, luck.

404
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,690
Let's have a drink.

405
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,060
Here, drink!

406
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,070
You aren't hungry? You want to eat some chicken feet?

407
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,990
Ah, so spicy.

408
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,390
I will change it. It will be changed

409
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:54,250
A big bird flies against the wind. A living fish swims against the current.

410
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:40,870
English test for Seoul University, Perfect Score Guarantee!

411
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:50,370
Mom... send me to academy too.

412
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:56,750
Just for 1 month. I just need to attend for 1 month. If I just pick out a brilliant story, I too...

413
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,600
What kind of person goes to comics academy? You can't even study.

414
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,790
Not comics, but webtoon.

415
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,000
I said that I'm going to go to university with that. Korea University!

416
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,680
Eun Ho?

417
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,820
I like it that you're ambitious, but first let's go to the hospital tomorrow.

418
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,370
Korea University? At this rate, she's going to say that she will go to Seoul University.

419
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,310
Why? What? Why? What?

420
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,300
Mom, I'm saying that I can really go to Korea University.

421
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,920
These days, people can go to good universities just by drawing well.

422
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,240
There are 2000 ways to get into university.

423
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:43,880
Shut up! I can't run my business. One kid only plays around.

424
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,850
In our situation, what money do we have to invest in an animation academy?

425
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:53,240
Ah, I don't know! Because I didn't go to university, I won't even meet my first love and I won't even get married...

426
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,870
If someone kills a virgin ghost, then you have to take all responsibility for it.

427
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,360
I'm not going to get married my whole life.

428
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,930
That little...

429
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,740
She needs to go to the hospital.

430
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:08,380
What is it? Our Eun Ho wants to get married?

431
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,010
She's all grown up. She's all grown up.

432
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:18,370
What are you saying? What are you saying? Aigoo, my fate.

433
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,020
Literature

434
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,460
Let's do this mock exam well!

435
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,230
Hello?

436
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,990
Hey, I thought of a brilliant story.

437
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,070
Listen to this. This time, it's a historical drama.

438
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,040
Aren't you going to study? The exam is tomorrow.

439
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,520
It'll be quick. 5 minutes. Listen to this. You see...

440
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:38,280
Ah, really? She farted in front of the principal?

441
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,080
Is that so?

442
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,480
Oh? Oh!

443
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,490
How did an hour pass already...?

444
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,010
It's really true.

445
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,600
I'm dead. I didn't study yet.

446
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,300
Okay, I got it. Hey, yes, hang up.

447
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,220
Oh, I'm dead.

448
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,950
First of all, a plan. Let's make a plan.

449
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,100
Right now,

450
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,290
It's 9pm. 10,11,12... Until 7 am.

451
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:21,340
10... 10 hours. Yes, 10 hours. I have 10 hours.

452
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:31,200
Whenever time came for exams, we all felt like going crazy from anxiety.

453
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,290
For some people, the minute they let go of the pen,

454
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:41,870
they feel that many other contestants will catch up.

455
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:47,550
Until their hands start getting blisters, they clench their teeth,

456
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,730
and they clench their teeth once again.

457
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,790
Eighteen.

458
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,940
We are too young.

459
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,560
Even though it's sad,

460
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,440
it is us, not the adults,

461
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:16,610
who believe that our lives are decided at eighteen.

462
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,460
[3rd mock test, D-day]

463
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,600
What do I do? I can't remember.

464
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:57,850
Do well on the exam. When you're finished, I'll buy you spicy rice cakes.

465
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,730
Must be nice.

466
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,730
Hey, I should just drop college and take a civil service exam instead.

467
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:07,540
Don't raise the competition, and go to Korea University.

468
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,260
- Hey.
- Yes?

469
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,020
Are you really going to drop out of school? Don't do that, okay?

470
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,290
You're unexpectedly obsessive.

471
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,180
Just do well on the exam.

472
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:27,420
How is the exam important to me? Don't go.

473
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,960
You are a high school student.

474
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,390
I should go.

475
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,790
- I'll be at the library.
- Go.

476
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,790
Okay.

477
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,820
Pass them back.

478
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,960
From now on, your test scores

479
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,620
will determine your ranks within the school.

480
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,190
The lazy people will be discriminated against.

481
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:16,270
They will be anxious and in pain.

482
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,570
Start.

483
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,230
What's going on?

484
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:02,870
What is this?

485
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:25,050
It's been quiet recently. Now we got a big mess.

486
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,460
A complete hero.

487
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,540
Complete hero!

488
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,970
Hey!

489
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:34,030
Then we don't have to take the test right?

490
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,230
Now they're even sabotaging exams, they're amazing.

491
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:44,890
When they increased the number of mock exams to three, I was expecting it.

492
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,710
But this prank is too extreme.

493
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,790
♬ sail away with me ♬

494
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,270
♬ from the bay with me♬

495
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,270
♬ I can see your eyes again♬

496
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:59,320
♬ never find a place where to begin♬

497
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,540
♬your tear drops ♬

498
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,840
♬ ripples hit the waterfall♬

499
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,090
♬ your tear drops♬

500
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,950
♬ hit the beats on the wall♬

501
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,050
♬your tear drops ♬

502
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:25,810
Who...?

503
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,160
This school is amazing.

504
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,210
What?

505
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,960
It must be really fun.

506
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,400
Right?

507
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,520
♬ sail away with me♬

508
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,220
♬ from the bay with me♬

509
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,660
♬sail away with me ♬

00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:45,980
♬ I can see your eyes again♬

512
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,310
♬neer find a place where to begin ♬

513
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:54,920
♬I said I can see your eyes again ♬

514
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,760
This is blasphemy!

515
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,080
Is this a school?

516
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,900
If you are going to do things like this at school, the school won't just let it go.

517
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,940
Don't think that the mock exam is cancelled because of this.

518
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:15,380
It will be held again within a week as planned.

519
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,770
Be quiet!

520
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,300
Ah seriously.

521
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,940
I am the head of the school.

522
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:29,000
If something like this happens again, suspension!

523
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,200
Indefinitely!

524
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,840
This would be killer: hero romance in a cram school.

525
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,540
Isn't that awesome? And the evil villain is the principal!

526
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:56,290
But if I were you, I would have said it a little softer ...

527
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,200
The sprinklers turned on fully.

528
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:14,070
The news were fed water too.

529
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,870
Be careful.

530
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,110
Put the graph back up right now!

531
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,140
Oh what to do? Oh no.

532
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,770
It's been a real messy day

533
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:38,410
but let's greet to the police officer Han Sooji, in charge of our school..

534
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,430
My blood pressure is getting higher to death.

535
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,140
In this sacred school, the morals dropped to the ground.

536
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,310
If the foundation's fallen, we must pick it back up and dust off the dust.

537
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:53,340
In order to do so, we must shove bean rice into the mouths of children(this is an idiom for sending people to prison).

538
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,940
Come to your senses! What do you mean feed them bean rice?

539
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,470
Then you're going to leave students like that alone?

540
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:02,240
Are you crazy? I'm not going to leave them alone! I'm going to drag them into prison myself.

541
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,210
You're the same.

542
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,540
Do you understand, police officer?

543
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:10,660
Yes, prison. I'll do my best to catch them.

544
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,840
The kids are crossing the line too much lately.

545
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,270
It's not only one or two people either.

546
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,900
For this to be a simple prank,

547
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,650
it was planned too big and purpose-driven.

548
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,950
Well, it doesn't have to be kids from our school.

549
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:31,000
As an old proverb says, 'After you got stolen, you become guilty.'

550
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,470
If you just suspect someone innocent-

551
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:36,970
Be quiet. Teacher Sim, since you're in charge of school lifestyle,

552
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:42,370
help the police officer and catch the culprit quickly.

553
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:47,610
If the chairman finds out, he'll go crazy!

554
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,880
How this kind of thing could happen

555
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,490
He makes a real mess

556
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,800
Excuse me...

557
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,660
What kind of incidents have there been in the past?

558
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,270
Exactly who did this!!!!

559
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,880
Ah, how could this be...

560
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,190
Suddenly one day,

561
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:22,090
s series of many incredible incidents that made the school look bad occurred.

562
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,760
The culprit never got caught.

563
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,570
Who could it be? Why did the culprit do it?

564
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:35,440
I was curious about everything, but I could not find any answers.

565
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,350
Oh yes!

566
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:40,670
The school is quite amazing. But exactly who did it?

567
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:46,210
If it's to this extent, I don't think someone could have done it alone. It's too big.

568
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:49,000
I was wondering, what if it were a secret organization?

569
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,790
They don't know each other's identities but do their individual jobs without mistake.

570
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,030
Is it really a student from our school though? Isn't it a trespasser from another school?

571
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,300
But what is their motive?

572
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,680
Why are they like this?

573
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,530
How are we supposed to know that? They must have their reasons.

574
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,780
They must be great avengers.

575
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,600
They are just playing mindless tricks, so childish.

576
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,400
No!

577
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,140
In my opinion, this could be an amazing underground organization.

578
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,330
What?

579
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,300
Am I too sharp?

580
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,990
Hurry and drink up.

581
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,930
Drink it all up.

582
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:34,860
Hey! Let's go together!

583
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,930
One person did it.

584
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:39,840
What? Why did one person do it though?

585
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,850
My sense tells. All the heroes are lonely.

586
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,080
Hero?

587
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:52,040
Isn't he cool? He rescues us under pressure. A hero of justice.

588
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,510
In any case, please do more amazing things.

589
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:02,030
Let me go to Korea University!

590
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:06,520
Let's do it, let's do it!

591
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,720
Hide for a while.

592
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,160
Be careful till further contact.

593
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,960
-Ok.
- Ok, got it.

594
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,820
What a terrible day.

595
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,380
Are you happy living like that?

596
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,400
If the others knew, it would be pretty fun.

597
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,040
Our school president's real face.

598
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,370
It seems like you miss my fist.

599
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,880
I have no reason to deny it.

600
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,540
Crazy bastard.

601
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,890
Crazy bastard.

602
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,410
I'll give you ten minutes, so learn the poem perfectly.

603
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:00,810
And for the ten minutes after that, do an analysis. Understand

604
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,100
Got it?

605
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,140
Yes.

606
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,270
Teacher, it's not what you think. It is... what is it again?

607
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,760
So it's not that, but... Teacher...

608
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,890
Place 280.

609
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:38,060
You can't blame it on that you don't understand my words because you aren't that bright.

610
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:41,850
Come get it when you have graduated.

611
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,190
No, Teacher!

612
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:50,180
I am in big trouble if i don't have that...

613
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,260
No! Teacher!

614
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,160
Teacher, Teacher please.

615
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,020
Teacher! I was wrong, I really was wrong. I won't do it again, okay?

616
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,960
Please give it back.

617
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,710
It is really important to me.

618
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:29,780
Next time I'll take something bigger. And no matter how much you cry and beg,

619
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,950
there isn't any way to get it back. Pathetic thing.

620
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:38,330
I would appreciate it if you could give me my cellphone back.

621
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,320
I received it as a gift from my father.

622
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh, Teacher! What about me? Please give it back to me.

623
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,990
If you were going to return it so quickly, why did you take it...?

624
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,640
Because I should follow the rule.

625
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,610
You follow the rule but

626
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:15,880
This is unfair. If you give it to him, why can't you give it to me?

627
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,870
Then how about you, too, get a nice, sturdy background?

628
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:23,180
One with strength, one that can allow you to break rules.

629
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,580
What if you find it unfair?

630
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:30,580
That's the truth of this cruel society.

631
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:34,710
Then take it.

632
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:38,680
I find this so unfair, and I don't care about getting it taken away, but am I really supposed to just stand it?

633
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,470
You need to fight so that everyone has to abide by the same rules.

634
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:46,220
Hey! Don't you think so?

635
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:49,680
I don't think this is something for me to worry about.

636
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,870
Teacher!

637
00:55:54,950 --> 00:56:00,100
Say those kinds of things after you have power.

638
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,340
What power do you have in this school?

639
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,080
Place 280.

640
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,090
Don't. Why are you like this? Seriously, why?

641
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,070
Teacher.

642
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,610
You can't!

643
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:30,780
He gave it to you as soon as you asked, so please talk with him.

644
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,620
Why do I have to do that?

645
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:36,920
Because it is really important to me. I need it to go to college.

646
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:42,520
So, I make a webtoon and pass a civil service examination with... No, so I go to college, and-

647
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:47,360
Hey! But it's unfair, just giving it to you. Does it make sense?

648
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,450
He said that it did make sense. He just said that earlier.

649
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:54,480
Hyeon Tae Woon, are you serious? Your classmate is in a hard situation.

650
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:01,270
And even though you can't turn on the sprinklers like our hero, you could help me a little, no?

651
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,210
What hero? Childish movie fiction.

652
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:10,740
It's childish right? It's childish, so couldn't you talk a little with the teacher?

653
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:13,330
You are really noisy.

654
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:18,070
Wait, wait.

655
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,020
That jerk.

656
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,760
Did he leave?

657
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,460
Civil Service 3 years Workbook

658
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:53,270
I have to go to the academy, will you be okay?

659
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,870
I have to go to!

660
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,890
To Korea University..

661
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,280
[Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class 4]

662
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,560
Awesome!

663
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,400
Is it you?
