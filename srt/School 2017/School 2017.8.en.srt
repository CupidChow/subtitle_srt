1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,680
Hyeon Tae Woon, what did you just say?

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,590
It was me.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,760
The male student who entered the Teachers Office with Ra Eun Ho was me.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,980
If that's the case,

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,330
then why did you go in the teachers' office?

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,880
The truth is, it's because I thought I saw X.

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,470
You saw X?!

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,080
Are you two being serious?

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,230
That was the day before the math competition, wasn't it?

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,550
I saw someone dressed in black enter the teachers' office so I followed him,

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,250
but as soon as I entered he escaped through the window.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,120
Really? Did you see his face?

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,840
I...

14
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,240
didn't see it.

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,690
That guy also disappeared right after seeing us.

16
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,930
Ra Eun Ho, is Hyeon Tae Woon telling the truth?

17
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,090
You went in because you saw X, or you went in for some other reason,

18
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,550
whose story am I supposed to be able to believe?

19
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,000
In that case, you don't have any evidence either way that suggests we created a problem after entering the room.

20
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,230
That's why, for now, I'm just giving you a punishment for unauthorized trespassing in the teachers' office.

21
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:03,550
Whether or not something else happened, we'll find out in time.

22
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,190
Right?

23
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:21,290
School 2017
Lies, the aftermath

24
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,180
Episode 8

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,250
I told you because I trusted you.

26
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,080
I was trying to discuss with you about what the best course of action was.

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,500
but you turned around and told Teacher Goo. You really went too far.

28
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,030
Then is a police officer supposed to cover up something so suspicious without even trying to investigate?

29
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,890
Are the kids some kind of criminal?

30
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,370
I did it because they're not criminals.

31
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,410
Is always protecting and coddling them really what's best for them?

32
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,890
Even if it hurts now, ripping open the wound so you can heal it is what I believe is best for them.

33
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,820
Even so, they're just kids that are hurting. How can you hurt them even more here, in their school?

34
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,110
Is it wrong to just protect and comfort them?

35
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,160
Then what about later on?

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,670
After raising them like flowers in a greenhouse, what happens when they go out into a much bigger world and get hurt even worse?

37
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,860
Are you going to run to protect and comfort them then, as well?

38
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,650
For that reason, am I supposed to cut off their limbs now

39
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,370
and tell them to follow me to an adult's battlefield?

40
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,440
I can't teach them that.

41
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,600
Immediately running to shield and comfort them even though you can't take responsibility for their lives,

42
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,780
I'm having trouble understanding the point of that.

43
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,660
I think telling Dae Hwi is the right thing to do.

44
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,490
We should tell him the teachers know about it so he needs to be careful-

45
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,030
What is he going to be careful about? Is knowing about it going to change anything?

46
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,480
Did you see his face?

47
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,670
I...didn't see it.

48
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,660
Still, I think we need to tell Song Dae Hwi.

49
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,960
Stop talking about Song Dae Hwi. So what about that stupid jerk. Don't you feel wronged?

50
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,220
The fact that you're in this mess of a state is all because of him.

51
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,930
Then why did you do that?

52
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,410
Didn't you do it to help Dae Hwi?

53
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,130
Stop it.

54
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,150
I'm already regretting it like crazy.

55
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,250
Your pitying something you don't even understand.

56
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,340
Penalty Score and Discipline

57
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,440
Angry X! I'm sorry...

58
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,930
How about a refreshing lemonade?

59
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,520
Do you have something funny?

60
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,110
No.

61
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,000
I think you do. You were just looking at something.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,550
I wasn't looking at anything.

63
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,180
- What are you doing?
- Here it is!

64
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,350
- There's something there?

65
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,970
- Then what was it?
- Just let me sleep.

66
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,880
- What's this?
- Why do you keep bothering me?

67
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,430
If it's funny, let's look at it together!

68
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,310
I'm so tired. Why are you doing this first thing in the morning?

69
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,140
- Oh, here it is! This is it! This is it!
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

70
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm sorry. I didn't think about your feelings.

71
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,890
What happened to the dumb?

72
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,990
When you think about it...

73
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,760
Coming out like that wouldn't have been easy.

74
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,290
I took your caring for granted. I'm sorry.

75
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,010
It's because it's true that we went into the office together.

76
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,980
I'm worried about us but I'm also worried about Song Dae Hwi.

77
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,400
Worrying about him again!

78
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,090
He will get out of it himself so stop worrying about him!

79
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,910
We just received discipline punishment!

80
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,540
Really? Already?

81
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,230
How many demerits? Ugh, my poor school record!

82
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,210
What should we do about cleaning? It's so hot we could die.

83
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,680
2nd year Ra O O and Hyun O O , School Service 7 days. Reason: Breaking into teacher's office.

84
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,600
What's with them?

85
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,260
Why did they break into the teacher's office as a couple?

86
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,900
Tae Woon's spectacular.

87
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,650
What happened?

88
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,140
I don't know either.

89
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,830
You guys are best friends.

90
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,850
I guess not.

91
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,740
I expected it, but the demerits are overwhelming.

92
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,290
So why did you have to meddle in someone else's business.

93
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,490
What am I supposed to do now?

94
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,930
Am I not going to be able to go to university forever?

95
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,130
Ah, seriously. Why did I even folow Song Dae Hwi?

96
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,320
My school record...

97
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,750
Let's go.

98
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,680
Huh?

99
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,270
Let's tell them the truth. That Song Dae Hwi went to steal the test answers.

100
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,460
Are you crazy?

101
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,810
It's the truth!

102
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:46,540
Why do we have to lie? The one who did it is completely fine and nothing happened to him at all.

103
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,330
Song Dae Hwi must be upset too.

104
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,390
What a saint you are.

105
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,140
Hyeon Tae Woon!

106
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,950
Hey, you trash-like bastard.

107
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,250
What did you just say?

108
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,560
I don't have time to mind you too so get lost.

109
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,700
What?

110
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,390
Hey, let's go.

111
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,340
Should I just reveal it here?

112
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,280
How much of a trash-like bastard you are?

113
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,590
Go first.

114
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,860
I'll talk a bit and then go.

115
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,540
Are you ignoring it?

116
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,620
While someone is crying bloody tears because of it?

117
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,880
Then go and report it.

118
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,890
Why take the blame just to be condescending?

119
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:03,140
Really? Then how about you personally do it?

120
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,650
I'm not scared of this at all.

121
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,530
You're not scared at all?

122
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,490
Someone like you who wants to have everything isn't scared at all?

123
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,530
That's good then. Then go and confess that you did it right now.

124
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,450
Ra Eun Ho got her record and herself messed up trying to protect you.

125
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,540
And yet she's stupidly worrying about you. Which is why!

126
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,460
If you feel sorry for Ra Eun ho at all,

127
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,070
go and confess right now.

128
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,620
There's nothing I can't do.

129
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,350
Really?

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,980
Then shall we take this opportunity to witness our model student's revealing his ugly true face?

131
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,880
Don't worry. I won't break down from something like this.

132
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,890
Is that rotten inferiority complex of yours your pride?

133
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,900
Pitiful bastard.

134
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,510
Is there something wrong?

135
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,750
What's wrong?

136
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,460
I just...

137
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,020
hate myself.

138
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,890
Hey... Why do you hate yourself? You're ranked first in our school.

139
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,820
You're the coolest man in our school.

140
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,380
Everything about me just seems fake.

141
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,550
It's all lies.

142
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,160
Hey... Who doesn't lie?

143
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,530
Everyone has their own reasons to lie.

144
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,380
Is that so?

145
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Summer Vacation Special Lecture

146
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,990
Well, I was going to tell you anyway...

147
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,580
it was urgent, so I had to use your money.

148
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,130
I'll pay you back next month.

149
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,990
Is that alright?

150
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,010
That's okay.

151
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,850
Right?

152
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,210
It was good that we at least had that money.

153
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,650
It was very useful when it was so urgent.

154
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,330
It turned out for the best.

155
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,860
Now matter how hard I work

156
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,770
I'm back where I started.

157
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,050
Dae Hwi, Mom will pay you back.

158
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,420
So don't worry about it, and just study hard.

159
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,220
I won't do it anymore.

160
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,010
It wouldn't have worked out anyway.

161
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,320
Do you know what I gave up

162
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,220
just to protect this stupid thing?

163
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,150
Dae Hwi.

164
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,160
It's good that you're here, I was going to call you anyway.

165
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,530
- Teacher.
- Let's go in.

166
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,570
It's a scholarship fund that Seoul alumni run.

167
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,310
If you get in, you can get a two-year scholarship.

168
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,320
I'm going to recommend you. Just fill out the application.

169
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,020
Okay. Thank you, Teacher.

170
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,040
Dae Hwi. There's nothing going on, right?

171
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,880
You don't look well.

172
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,770
Statement of Reason for Discipline

173
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,080
Statement of Reason for Discipline
Ra Eun Ho, Hyeon Tae Woon

174
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,780
Excuse me, Teacher.

175
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,010
Yeah, Dae Hwi?

176
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,110
I really want to go to Seoul University.

177
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:12,710
So I won't look back and do whatever I can to get in.

178
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,260
Please help me get this scholarship.

179
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,490
Alright.

180
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:30,450
Teachers' Office

181
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,350
You pathetic loser. I told you not to do anything stupid.

182
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,510
Why did you go into the teachers' office?

183
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,480
You heard everything already.

184
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,510
Is it because of Ra Eun Ho?

185
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,340
An X suspect and breaking into the teachers' office.

186
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,870
She's a trouble maker with many problems.

187
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,170
- She's not like that.
- That's something I'll decide.

188
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,510
If you want to cause trouble, go ahead.

189
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,150
I'll do whatever it takes to pull only you out.

190
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,320
Father.

191
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,450
You pathetic bastard.

192
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,590
It's dangerous!

193
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,450
Hey, hey, hey!

194
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,720
It's dangerous.

195
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,460
Hyeon Tae Woon, you acted all tough.

196
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,250
What? Are you scared?

197
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,650
Who's scared? You punk.

198
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,510
'It's dangerous.' You sounded like a total goody two-shoes.

199
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,570
Want me to shove a foot up your ass?

200
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,420
- Come up
- No
- Come up
-No

201
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,200
But it's really not that high up here. It's only as tall as a person's height. Come and look.

202
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,510
- Really?
- Come and see.

203
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,850
It's hella high

204
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,740
- Are you okay?
- Are you pushing me saying it's hella high?

205
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,690
- you go up
- Stop

206
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,690
Stop! Stop!

207
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,440
You both look like you're about to pee your pants.

208
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,530
What? Pee?

209
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,630
Let's pee on him

210
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,500
This isn't it! I'm sorry!

211
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm sorry.

212
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,750
You little punk

213
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,850
It's dangerous!

214
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,650
What you're doing is more dangerous.

215
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,500
Stop it, you punk.

216
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,360
Why should I? Why should I stop?!

217
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,050
Aren't you embarrassed in front of Joon Gi?

218
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,290
Living so dirty and cowardly like that.

219
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,750
No. I'm not embarrassed at all!

220
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,930
Those cheap and dirty things you mentioned

221
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,290
I did all of that, and this is how far I got.

222
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,790
Just this

223
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,320
So

224
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,170
how am I supposed to stop here?

225
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,480
You won't regret it?

226
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,410
I won't. I definitely won't!

227
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,190
So you mind your own business!

228
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,860
And live your own life.

229
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,840
Aren't you embarrassed in front of Joon Gi?

230
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,470
Oh, Dae Hwi. What's the matter...?

231
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,890
What's the matter?

232
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,420
The one that entered the teacher's office the other day was not Hyeon Tae Woon.

233
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,070
It was me.

234
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,920
What did you say?

235
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,940
I went in to steal the answers for the math competition.

236
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,210
Why would you, the 1st ranked student in the school?

237
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,300
Dae Hwi, what are you saying?

238
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,520
Why would you steal the answers?

239
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,590
I'm sorry.

240
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,360
Let's investigate the fact first

241
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,010
Oh my god

242
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,530
I am, unlike the person who used to sit here, very fair.

243
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,100
and famous for abiding strictly by the rules.

244
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,260
If you're wronged or if there's any misunderstanding,

245
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,930
please tell us everything as it is.

246
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:46,460
Unlike somebody, I'm briadk open minded.

247
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,550
I don't.

248
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,410
And he's ranked 1st in the school.

249
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,190
It's because morals have fallen to the ground.

250
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,350
We already know morals have fallen to the ground, Mr. Suspension.

251
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,540
Okay. According to the Geumdo's Rule 3

252
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,740
Rule 3...

253
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,180
-2
- Rule 3-2

254
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,960
Wait.

255
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,650
Please get rid of

256
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,850
Ra Eun Ho and Hyeon Tae Woon's punishment.

257
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,600
Since I'm the one who broke into the teachers' office,

258
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,150
they didn't do any wrong.

259
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,510
But the two already confessed...

260
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,280
It was because of me.

261
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,150
They saw me break in to steal the answers

262
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,290
so they lied

263
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,620
to cover my fault.

264
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,600
Why did they lie to save you?

265
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,100
I don't know. It was stupid.

266
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,210
Did you come because you were concerned?

267
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,840
Am I crazy?

268
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,530
Is it over?

269
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,100
It got resolved well.

270
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,150
Did Dae Hwi know?

271
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:12,270
That we lied to protect him?

272
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,490
Hey, come look at this.

273
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,420
2nd year Song O O
School service 7 days, penalty points 70
Reason: Breaking into teachers' office

274
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,890
It's true.

275
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,760
I heard that was Song Dae Hwi!

276
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,570
Huh?

277
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,130
Hey! Watch your mouth.

278
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,730
I heard that was Song Dae Hwi.

279
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,270
Ehhh

280
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,120
No way...

281
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,130
Really?

282
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,870
He's screwed.

283
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,650
He broke into the teachers' office?

284
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,580
Why would he do that?

285
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,980
That night... you protected Song Dae Hwi, right?

286
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,390
Well, I didn't know for sure that it was Song Dae Hwi but...

287
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,710
So that confession was probably a lie then

288
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,880
in order to protect the kids, you quickly said that.

289
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,250
Well, that's true

290
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,290
but it wasn't a complete lie.

291
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,200
So...

292
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:23,780
I think that lie is becoming the truth.

293
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,040
What happened? Why were you disciplined?

294
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,760
Why did you break into the teachers' office?

295
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,860
I stole the answers to the math competition.

296
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,110
Why would you?

297
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,710
I couldn't get to where I wanted on my own strength

298
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,440
so I think I chose the easiest way.

299
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,440
I heard that competition was made for Hyeon Tae Won.

300
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,080
So that's why you stole it.

301
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,280
No matter how hard you tried, you wouldn't be able to get it.

302
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,460
After stealing that,

303
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,170
I had a really tough time

304
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,470
and I was lonely and scared.

305
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,590
I wanted to tell you everything

306
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,780
about why I did it,

307
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,730
and how I felt,

308
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,300
and

309
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,080
how much I regretted it.

310
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,630
I see...

311
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,510
It's good that Dae Hwi's problem got resolved well, right?

312
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,590
Resolved well?

313
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,390
Anyway, everything went well, considering.

314
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,260
Comments, comments.

315
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,890
My #1 fan, how cute

316
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,780
But why did they leave a short one?

317
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:14,680
' Interesting', 'Funny', 'Fun'
( Comments posted by "niceguy")

318
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,670
They left it well. It's straightforward.

319
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,040
It would have been nice if they left longer ones.

320
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,580
Like what exactly was fun. You know.

321
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,980
You really want a lot.

322
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,610
Hey.

323
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,380
Have you ever written comments before?

324
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,080
Comments?

325
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,240
I'm a total pro.

326
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,200
Do you want mean comments or nice comments?

327
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,840
Nice ones. How do you write?

328
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,220
Something long and it has to be touching.

329
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,020
It should get a point across but witty and insightful.

330
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,850
That kind of long comment.

331
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,200
'Honey funny'

332
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,390
'Hella honey funny'

333
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,980
'Strawberry Rice Bravo' ?

334
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,340
That's not it, right.

335
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,680
Oh, hey.

336
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,710
- Hey!
- Really!

337
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,160
Oh Sa Rang

338
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,540
- Are you going home?
- Yeah.

339
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,650
What about your guitar? You used to carry it around all of the time.

340
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,810
I just needed a break.

341
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,790
What about you? Ra Eun Ho, whom you always used to hang out with, is gone.

342
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,440
Maybe we are in a break too. Evil girl.

343
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,530
Ra Eun Ho is the evil girl?

344
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:04,580
No. Why would she?

345
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,920
But to be honest, friends shouldn't have secrets between them, right?

346
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,670
Tell her. Tell Ra Eun Ho that you're sad.

347
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,020
Hey! It's not Ra Eun Ho!

348
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,350
But you...

349
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,230
Have you eaten ramyun at a convenience store before?

350
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,120
Huh?

351
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,930
Oh!

352
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,990
Look. Ta-da!

353
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,660
Mix it.

354
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,130
Mix it. Mix.

355
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,760
This is fun.

356
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,150
That's right. You said you lived abroad, right?

357
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,750
Yeah. So

358
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,990
I'm trying to experience Korean high school life.

359
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,120
If you want to experience Korean high school, just study like crazy.

360
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,000
Don't meet your friends, don't cry or laugh as well.

361
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,660
Don't waste your emotions

362
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:25,000
Just study a lot.

363
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,880
Then I won't bother experiencing Korean high school.

364
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,210
But you... make sure to tell Ra Eun Ho.

365
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,050
If you let the things upsetting you build up inside, you'll really grow apart.

366
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,220
It's not her, Ra Eun Ho.

367
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,220
It's not.

368
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,810
You... really can't lie.

369
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,720
I told you to tell me properly.

370
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,210
Bit Na's mother, the kids already resolved their matters so...

371
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,790
My kid didn't do any wrong, but I heard that you made her write the same reflection letter as her!

372
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:44,720
She did nothing wrong! Will it go on her student records?

373
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,420
No. A reflection letter wouldn't...

374
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,630
I won't permit anything that will taint her life.

375
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,050
Let's hold a disciplinary hearing to figure out right and wrong.

376
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,450
The girl that hit my daughter should be punished too.

377
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,860
This lawyer will represent Bit Na.

378
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,780
Lawyer?

379
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,550
Ma'am, for just a fight between children, this is...

380
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,740
Hangook Law Firm

381
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:33,760
If we report kids for fighting rather than having them make up first, we'd be police officers, not teachers.

382
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,640
They made a big deal bringing lawyers here. Is this a school or a court?

383
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,500
The kids can't solve the problem on their own.

384
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,650
The school can't solve this problem either, so this is what happened.

385
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:52,650
If the school or teacher meddles in a personal fight, there's a fear of being sued.

386
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,700
Oh how embarrassing.

387
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,710
First we should remove recording on school records.

388
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,080
They want legal action because they admit it, it goes on the records.

389
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,100
Student Violence Hearing

390
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,470
I don't think this is what a school should be doing.

391
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,510
Student Violence Hearing

392
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,260
Bo Ra.

393
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,410
This is your last chance.

394
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:32,710
Tell me. I will help you no matter what.

395
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,570
I will help you no matter what.

396
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,660
Teacher.

397
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,480
I don't have anything else to say.

398
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,860
I will go now.

399
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,800
Bo Ra!

400
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,260
Watch what you say during the school violence committee meeting.

401
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,430
Don't make me annoyed by pulling us into it.

402
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,270
School Violence Committee Meeting

403
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,440
That's right.

404
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:26,070
It was a one-sided fight where I hit her.

405
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,510
Bo Ra!

406
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:38,840
Yoo Bit Na thought that I took her pen...

407
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,810
I...

408
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,100
got into a one-sided fight with her...

409
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,130
and hit her.

410
00:36:52,200 --> 00:37:00,500
I admit what I did, ... I will accept any punishment.

411
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,370
Since she admitted it, we have no choice.

412
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:13,040
Alright. Let's wrap things up.

413
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:31,960
Notice of Discipline

414
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,440
Seo O O
Suspended for one week

415
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,660
This...

416
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,500
I keep fixing it but it keeps falling off.

417
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:17,770
This is simple, so if you learn a bit, you will be able to fix it immediately. Wait a minute.

418
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,740
- It worked.
- Wow!

419
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,200
That was simple.

420
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,470
You're cool for being brave.

421
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,620
It must have been hard for you all this time.

422
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,690
It was hard for you too, Ra Eun Ho.

423
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,240
Thank you.

424
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,890
Then treat me to ice cream.

425
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,080
Of course I will! Tell me any time.

426
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,690
Okay!
Okay.

427
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,480
I'll be going now.

428
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,130
Don't eat ice cream..

429
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,600
What nonsense are you saying?

430
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,050
Don't eat ice cream with him!

431
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,020
- Why?
- Because I hate that!

432
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,700
- Why do you hate it?
- Do I need a reason for hating it?

433
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,390
I just hate waking up in the morning.

434
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,220
I hate bean-mixed rice. It's similar to that. I just hate it. So don't go.

435
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,520
I'm going to go!

436
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,380
You're laughing?

437
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,880
I'm being serious!

438
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,680
So what?

439
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:46,410
Why is he like that? Yay, this is fixed!

440
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,430
Snap out of it.

441
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,550
What?

442
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,490
♫ That must be it. It must not be time yet. ♫

443
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,200
Why?

444
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,010
What?

445
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,350
♫ You're still too far for me to reach ♫

446
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,810
It can't be.

447
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,900
What?

448
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,130
You look really dull.

449
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:18,360
Dummy

450
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,190
That's right. There's no way.

451
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:26,310
♫ At some point, my heart started wanting only you ♫

452
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:32,980
♫ The wind is taking me to you ♫

453
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:42,420
♫ Love doesn't realize this love's pain ♫

454
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,440
Do you want to watch a movie?

455
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,440
This movie's fun- ugh.

456
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,000
Let's watch a movie.

457
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,080
- Oh, movie tickets.
- Ah you startled me!

458
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,020
Were you going to ask me out on a date?

459
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,180
- No!
- No?

460
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,410
No, not no to that...

461
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,260
About that... the kids...

462
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,170
I feel sorry and thankful.

463
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:17,770
I'm em-embarrassed. So... just

464
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,940
- Let's watch-
Oh my gosh, you startled me.

465
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,230
Do you want to watch a movie?

466
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,020
Teacher Jeong, how do you cut into all of a sudden?

467
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:32,740
Does watching a movie need a reason? Just answer yes or no.

468
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,430
Right.

469
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,750
Let's watch a movie then. It'll be fun.

470
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,460
Give it to me.

471
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,700
Oh! Teacher Jeong you have overtime though!

472
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,750
When are you going to watch a movie?

473
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,300
Not today.

474
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,640
Kids!

475
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,160
Do you guys want to go eat something yummy?

476
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,480
Really? Yes!

477
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,020
Dae Hwi must want to eat something good too, huh?

478
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,840
Will you go with us too?

479
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,760
Alright then.

480
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,060
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

481
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,820
This worked out well. I should eat and then do overtime.

482
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,840
Let's go! Let's go!

483
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,660
Thank you, Teacher!

484
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,070
How about the weekend?

485
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,980
Movies? Are there any good movies out right now?

486
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,530
I've been too busy to know.

487
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,330
You must really like sandwiches.

488
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,720
Yeah, totally. Right?

489
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,370
Eat mine.

490
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,600
Oh, thanks.

491
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,690
Aren't you a man?

492
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:26,100
♫ When I think of you my heart jumps ♫

493
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,930
♫ The sky is dazzlingly blue ♫

494
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,060
♫ The trees are dancing outside the window ♫

495
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,210
Take care!

496
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:40,300
Thanks for the food, Teacher! Good-bye!

497
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,840
Bye!

498
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,710
♫ Everything I wish for and want will happen ♫

499
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:54,170
Hey Ajusshi, I told you. Make it straight!

500
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,510
Do you have eyes or not? Are your eyes just decoration?

501
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,700
He's going overboard.

502
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,460
I know, right.

503
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,880
Don't come from tomorrow onwards.

504
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,210
I can't see that well, but I can still work.

505
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,380
- Let it go. I'm sorry.
- What do you mean let it go?

506
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,510
- I'll do well!
- Dad?

507
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,560
Eun Ho!

508
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:20,220
Why are you like this to my dad?

509
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,440
How dare you, little girl!

510
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,500
Little girl? Watch what you say.

511
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,170
Aigoo. What a great pair.

512
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:35,260
Want to talk to a little man?

513
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,190
W-why would I talk to you?

514
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:43,930
I said you just make it straight. Kids these days are scary.

515
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,950
What's with your face? You're making me upset, why are you doing this?

516
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,110
Is a lot stuck? Wipe it.

517
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,520
It's so hot out too.

518
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,510
I'm Okay. You must be so hot coming back from school.

519
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:11,450
Do you come home late all the time because of work? Mom thinks you're out drinking.

520
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:15,680
No. After work I go out to drink too.

521
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,440
I work because of that fun.

522
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:25,390
I will earn money to buy ice cream for you and send you to an academy.

523
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,480
You're doing this to send me to an academy?

524
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,770
It'd be great if you could attend that summer program, wouldn't it?

525
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:39,700
I don't have to go to an academy, Dad.

526
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,680
I don't like it when you're having a hard time, Dad.

527
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,290
Don't get ahead of yourself.

528
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,430
It's not just because of that.

529
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,460
Then what?

530
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,140
About that...

531
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,370
That's the path you take to school.

532
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:07,510
Even if this Dad of yours can't pave your way in life for you like other dads can,

533
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:14,630
I want to make the path that my daughter takes to school pretty.

534
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:19,330
So I put down sidewalks and planted flowers.

535
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,380
Dad.

536
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:30,130
I want to let you walk on a flower path for the rest of your life.

537
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:35,460
Aside from small paths, I can't do anything else for you.

538
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,370
I'm sorry.

539
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,000
Thanks to you,

540
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,280
I'm only going to walk on a flower path.

541
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,590
You're the best, Dad!

542
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,460
The best?

543
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,310
♫ Again today ♫

544
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,450
I'm sorry.

545
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,140
♫ The day is passing ♫

546
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:14,360
♫ Like a parting of a past love from long ago ♫

547
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,480
♫ Even though the winter was cold with frozen tears ♫

548
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,540
But about Ra Eun Ho, I think she's really amazing.

549
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:29,130
I mean when I was young, I was really embarrassed about my Mom working at a hair salon.

550
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:35,360
So I even told people that Mom was a school teacher.

551
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,830
That could happen.

552
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:41,520
But Ra Eun Ho doesn't care about what other people think.

553
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,300
She checked to make sure her dad was okay first.

554
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,480
Truthfully, that should be a given-

555
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,480
Song Dae Hwi.

556
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,190
Who do you keep talking to?

557
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,940
You only kept talking about Ra Eun Ho.

558
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,000
I don't find it fun talking about her at all.

559
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,420
I'm sorry.

560
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,400
But hey, your neighborhood is really nice.

561
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:17,530
I'm just going to go by myself from here.

562
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:20,400
Okay then.

563
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,830
You know it's almost our 200 day anniversary, right?

564
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,660
Of course.

565
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,430
I'm leaving.

566
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,050
Oh, Tae Woon!
Ah, Teacher.

567
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,390
I have something to say, it's good that I ran into you.

568
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:25,330
When the inspector of Education Office comes, you should write the report.

569
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,650
Yes, I know.

570
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,680
Truthfully, it's the adults' fault-

571
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,610
No. I should have said I would never do it.

572
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,300
I'll receive it well so don't worry.

573
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,920
Alright.

574
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,630
It's hot.

575
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:42,730
Want a drink?

576
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,670
Thank you, Teacher.

577
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,750
Do you have something frustrating you?

578
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,890
No.

579
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,370
I have something that's bothering me.

580
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,780
It's not even any special feeling.

581
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,660
I want to have drinks with her.

582
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,090
I want to eat with her.

583
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,720
I want to see her face for even a bit.

584
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,990
I want to talk to her too.

585
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,220
If you see a nice scenery, you want to see it together

586
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:25,080
You want to be with her for even a bit longer.

587
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,660
You want to do even trivial things with her too.

588
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,020
This means you like someone.

589
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,460
Me?

590
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:56,280
I have to study!

591
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,980
I got it. Just this once.

592
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,790
These people are never here when I need them.

593
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:05,430
I'll give you a lot of allowance. Just this once.

594
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:07,160
- A lot?
- A lot.

595
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,220
You promised.

596
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,620
Your chicken is here.

597
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,090
Is it a tree?

598
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:45,630
You!

599
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,430
This was your house?

600
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,740
Then do you think I ordered chicken at someone else's house?

601
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,330
I think you could definitely do that.

602
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,580
Psycho.

603
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,630
I can hear everything, you know.

604
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:16,440
- Dummy!
- What!

605
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,650
Give me a coupon.

606
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,060
Psycho.

607
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:37,390
Is a coupon too trivial?

608
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,470
Then what should I do? They ordered; do I say we can't deliver?

609
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,040
This jerk, really.

610
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,490
You must really like chicken.

611
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,290
Didn't I tell you? I hate chicken.

612
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:18,590
But teasing an idiotic girl is pretty fun.

613
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:22,290
If you tease me one more time, you could die.

614
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:26,660
Just stuff yourself with chicken, Sir.

615
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,830
Coupon?

616
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,980
Stop ordering now.

617
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,820
Didn't I tell you?

618
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:39,220
I have only two hobbies. One is reading.

619
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:44,050
The other is collecting chicken coupons.

620
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,020
Psycho.

621
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,840
Psycho! Psycho!

622
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,300
Collecting chicken coupons!

623
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,540
Chicken Coupon
Collect 10 and get one order free!

624
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:12,070
If I collect ten, you were going to come again?

625
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:30,760
Take. It. All. Take it all!

626
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:37,200
If you order one more time, you're really going to die!

627
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,410
I want to do that too.

628
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:44,740
But since I collected ten, if I don't order again, it'll just go to waste.

629
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,740
I'm really prudent.

630
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:51,310
Tae Woon. Let's have a serious and honest talk.

631
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:56,190
You hate me right? Is teasing me fun?

632
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,340
Do you get excited?

633
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:04,430
Hey. I'm not even a kid, If I tease you- it''s really fun!

634
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,560
Didn't I tell you?

635
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,100
Go.

636
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,910
You wanted to eat chicken?

637
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,250
I... hate chicken.

638
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:58,990
How'd it go? Did you stuff your face full with chicken?

639
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:02,330
I told you I hate chicken.

640
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,860
Yes. Please continue to hate chicken from now on.

641
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,480
Don't ever order for delivery.

642
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,960
I told you that time, didn't I.

643
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,910
I still have ten coupons left. Mwuhaha!

644
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,050
You're crazy. Give it back.

645
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:24,130
Give it back!

646
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:27,820
'I still have ten coupons'

647
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:36,030
Dae Hwi. I can't believe it's already our 200th day.

648
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,630
I know right.

649
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,310
- I'll see you later.
- Alright.

650
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,890
- I'll call you.
- Go.

651
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:48,550
It's Song Nam Joo. She's so pretty.

652
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,980
The person you have reached is not available

653
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,400
Dae Hwi

654
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:45,500
Dae Hwi. How did you come here?

655
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,250
Dae Hwi. About that... so...

656
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:15,130
This is... this isn't my house. So...

657
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,690
It's just for a really short while. There's a problem at home right now so...

658
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:20,780
Just for a bit...

659
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,750
Nam Joo.

660
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,380
I really liked you.

661
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:37,770
But why do you keep lying to me?

662
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,240
This is Shin Kang Transportation, right?

663
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,860
What? Daughter? Our President doesn't have a daughter though.

664
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:17,990
We all...

665
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:21,130
That's right. It was a one-sided fight where I hit her.

666
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:22,590
Lie.

667
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:25,270
How many times do I have to tell you? Line it up properly!

668
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:28,690
To protect something.

669
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:32,550
Or to hide something.

670
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:41,960
And... we have to take responsibility for the consequences of lying.

671
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:43,770
My number 1 fan

672
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:48,910
Sometimes there's even greater truth

673
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:52,010
within their lies

674
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:54,770
Go around like this. This is pretty.

675
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:57,000
that they couldn't even realize

676
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,780
This is driving me nuts. Why is he like that?

677
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,010
What? What's wrong, dummy?

678
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,430
About me publishing webtoons...

679
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:10,820
Yea?

680
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:15,970
Why would X lie after saving her?

681
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,490
He probably couldn't believe it.

682
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,160
Believe what?

683
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:26,550
He didn't know he'd feel this way.

684
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:32,440
Feelings? What feeling?

685
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,250
Huh?

686
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:16,630
♫ The wind is bringing me to you. ♫

687
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:25,070
♫ Not even knowing that this love is painful. ♫

688
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:30,850
♫ To you, who was so exhausted. ♫

689
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,840
♫ I wasn't enough and it hurt even more. ♫

690
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,940
Don't smile like that.

691
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:40,120
♫ But like my habits back then, I'm placing you in my eyes. ♫

692
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,390
It makes me nervous.

693
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:51,030
♫ Because this foolish stubbornness blocks me. ♫

694
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:59,400
♫ I know everything but I can't help it. ♫

695
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,360
♫ Because I'm only watching over you. ♫

696
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,060
♫ I try to throw away my empty heart. ♫

697
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:16,990
♫ But my heart still only wants you. ♫

698
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:27,220
♫ The wind is bringing me to you. ♫

699
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:34,660
♫ Not even knowing that this love is painful. ♫

700
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,530
♫ Not even knowing it's painful. ♫

701
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:41,620
♫ Even if you run away. ♫

702
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:46,700
♫ Even if it's not time yet.

703
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:52,640
♫ Like a habit, I'm placing you in my eyes.
