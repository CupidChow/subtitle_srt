1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,890
Even today, the Principal is up to no good.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,650
To that kind of principal and to you guys,

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,810
I will give you guys

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,070
a special present!

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,520
It's X. X is on the second floor!

6
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,350
Oh, my!

7
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,900
What are you doing right now?

8
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,340
I was X.

9
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,160
- The school is making the innocent Ra Eun Ho into the culprit.  That's not so.

10
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,620
What?

11
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,190
We did it together.

12
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,620
See, I told you.

13
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,930
What are you doing? Stay back.

14
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,550
What are you doing? Why aren't you taking care of this right now?

15
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,940
You're dismissed for now.

16
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,480
Everyone please leave.

17
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,820
Quickly, go back to your classrooms.

18
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,520
As for this issue, we'll decide on another day.

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,990
Hurry and go.

20
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,390
Oh...

21
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,520
You're cool, X.

22
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,790
X is awesome.

23
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,240
X, fighting!

24
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,600
X! X!

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,720
You're cool!

26
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,510
You're cool!

27
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,590
School 2017
I'll go meet you, the real you

28
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,310
Final Episode
Ra Eun Ho, why would you come out at that time?

29
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,790
-What about you? Why would you confess?
-Because I am X.

30
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,340
I also did it together.

31
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,870
Let's go. Let's go and tell them that you did it as a joke just once, without knowing what you were doing.

32
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,750
I don't want to. It wasn't just once,

33
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,610
and it wasn't something I did as a joke.

34
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,920
Ra Eun Ho, do you want to get expelled? You want to go to school.

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,900
Exactly, so to protect me why did you...

36
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,200
Such a fool.

37
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,600
Hyeon Tae Woon. Follow me.

38
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,050
I warned you not to do useless things.

39
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,300
Do as you have warned. The students and parents won't stay still.

40
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,930
If this gets out to the media, you'll be in a more difficult situation. You should take care of this somehow.

41
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,400
Do you like it now that you've made my reputation like this?

42
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,190
Is this what you were hoping for?

43
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,530
I won't change because of this.

44
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,520
So it'll be good for you not to have any hope.

45
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,940
It's awesome.

46
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,750
How could this be?

47
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,590
I had no idea...

48
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,070
What the... I"m so surprised.

49
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,460
Tae Woon was X.

50
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,530
Then, reporting the principal back then is like reporting himself to the authorities.

51
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,760
Wow, how terrible is this school for him to report his own dad's school?

52
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,950
Hey. It wasn't just one day that we had problems with the school.

53
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,940
Shouldn't we tell this to our family?

54
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,800
But is it okay for us to not do anything?

55
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,770
Should we do something?

56
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,610
I can't hold it in.

57
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,480
Let's just go and report everything that happened so far.

58
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,650
- Yeah, let's go put up some flyers or something. The kids are eager to start a protest.
- Great.

59
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,270
If this gets released to the press or the education office, the principal and everyone will go crazy.

60
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,020
Let's just try it.

61
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,940
The school is going crazy because Eun Ho and Tae Woon confessed that they're X.

62
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,740
With this opportunity, let's not leave the principal and the foundation head alone.

63
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,210
This is ridiculous.

64
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,720
What will happen if someone leaks this into the press?

65
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,830
If the day comes when the foundation head is accused and gets investigated,

66
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,300
Stop saying such terrible things!

67
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,100
If that happens, it's the end for both you and I.

68
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,230
We have to stop it no matter what.

69
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,860
When they are purposefully causing a scene, how can we block that?

70
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,980
We should just go and report ourselves to the police.

71
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,430
Ah, seriously! We must find a way to survive, a way to survive!

72
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,050
It may have already been posted to the media.

73
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,310
Ah, seriously! I told you to stop!

74
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,040
How did you cheat so much all this time as nervous as you are?

75
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,410
To be honest, you're the one who cheated more than I ever did, Principal. How could someone take so much...

76
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,630
Geez!

77
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,860
We have to stop it. We have to stop it no matter what.

78
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,770
If things get bigger, there will be investigations from here and there.

79
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,090
We need to utilize strength that we have and don't have to prevent it from getting out.

80
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,640
We must throughly stop it.

81
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,380
Do I not know that?

82
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,260
Aren't we like this because a lot has seeped out before we can even stop it?

83
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,340
Exactly where did it leak from?

84
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,400
Because of your son, the school is absolutely spectacular.

85
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,670
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,810
The parents are going crazy calling each other through the emergency contact network right now.

87
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,860
After watching how the situation progresses, we will decide whether to stop it or not.

88
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,150
If the Steering Committee doesn't help us, we're in big trouble.

89
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,160
If the school image is tainted, the students will be the ones to suffer the most.

90
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,450
If it comes to that, we can transfer our kids out of the school.

91
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,820
If rumors spread and it gets known to the press, will the school be able to operate?

92
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,240
I believe that you will find a good solution.

93
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,470
But, I don't think we can wait long.

94
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,740
The school is going crazy.

95
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,170
We have to handle it quickly.

96
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,280
I'm not sure, I don't think you'll be able to handle it quickly.

97
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,750
Expel them immediately.

98
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,020
Both Ra Eun Ho and Hyeon Tae Woon.

99
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,200
Even so, going to that point is a bit...

100
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,940
I won't repeat myself. Go with the rules.

101
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,640
If we fumble around trying to save a kid, the students and their parents won't stand back and watch.

102
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,460
You should have done well.

103
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,680
The Chairman is insisting that I expel you guys.

104
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,000
I think it will be decided as a drop out.

105
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,420
There's a week long drop-out reconsideration period. Come to school for two days and...

106
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,240
attend the drop-out program class.

107
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,220
There's no need for you to go to class. Do you have any questions?

108
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,080
No I don't.

109
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,080
I don't know what you did wrong.

110
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,140
Principal.

111
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,330
Is he sleeping?

112
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,110
Where could he have gone

113
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,930
after making normal kids like that?

114
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,320
Is this the principal? It's broken. (play on words)

115
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,830
What are you doing right now?

116
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,970
To someone's sacred face.

117
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,720
How can you eat sausages

118
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,510
after doing that to the kids?

119
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,080
Do you know what those punks did?

120
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,420
Since the school is so cruddy. Why do you think the kids did that?

121
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,860
You should be relieved that a bomb didn't explode at this kind of school.

122
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,290
Are you crazy? Leave immediately!

123
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,620
You talk however you please these days.

124
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,390
If you don't want to be fired, shut your mouth and deal with the kids' matters.

125
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,680
I think we'll have to see who will get fired first.

126
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,540
The teachers will not stay still.

127
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,920
Is the Office of Education there just for looks?

128
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,010
Are you threatening me?

129
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,590
Aigoo, the trash...

130
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,130
Why is there so much garbage at this school?

131
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,980
Here and there. It's just filled with trash!

132
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,970
This trash-like guy...

133
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,780
Your guts are really something! Who would think you weren't X's girlfriend?

134
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,100
I know, right. Being X's girlfriend is pretty rough.

135
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,070
Do you regret it?

136
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,120
If I do regret it, will you take it back?

137
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,970
Are you crazy?

138
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,840
You're a girlfriend that was so hard to get.

139
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,740
I'm going to hold on to your hand tightly and never let go.

140
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,520
How are we so alike?

141
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,180
Our tempers flare up without any consideration of consequences.

142
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,240
Look how happy you are when you're about to be expelled from school.

143
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,420
First, what should we do tomorrow?

144
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,690
We're not going to school. It's so stuffy...

145
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,200
Should we run?

146
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,370
-Shall we?
-Sure.

147
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,630
Oh run like this?
Yeah.
Hey, I don't really like this...

148
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,420
But will you really be okay?

149
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,090
Even if you can't come to school forever?

150
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,760
Then what can I do?

151
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,490
If I want to go there, can I go?

152
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,010
The breeze is really nice.

153
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,270
Ah, I don't know what I didn't know this when I went to school.

154
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,910
You just need to know from now on.

155
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,690
But what happened to Hyeon Tae Woon and Ra Eun Ho?

156
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,680
They'll probably be expelled.

157
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,210
They won't be safe after what they did.

158
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,000
Something smells like trash.

159
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,080
What did you say?

160
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,780
Ah, sorry. I can't really control my expressions these days.

161
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,120
Ah, go to the Principal's office and tattletail again.

162
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,670
That's right, I just need to go to the Principal's Office.

163
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,570
What are you going to do without Hyeon Tae Woon?

164
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,910
You're worrying about useless things.

165
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,870
Like you said, what are you going to do? You don't have someone to tell you what will be on tests now.

166
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,210
I think everything will be hard.

167
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,050
A**hole, you've got nothing to show for...

168
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,360
Those kinds of people should be expelled.

169
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,650
Don't worry about it.

170
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,330
I'm okay.

171
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,780
It's nice to not have to go to school.

172
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,310
I'm with Ra Eun Ho all the time.

173
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,110
In any case, you're so immature.

174
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,310
Just hurry and order.

175
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,530
One lemonade... and you can drink herbal tea. One herbal tea please.

176
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,220
Add a hot chocolate too.

177
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,720
What?

178
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,170
And one lemonade and one grapefruit-ade too.

179
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,650
What the? Are you crazy? Are you not going to tutoring?

180
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,630
Did you guys text me asking where I am to do this?

181
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,800
- We can't watch just you two having fun.
- That's right.

182
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,770
Hey first place student. Are you not studying?

183
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,570
Yes, I do well even if I don't study.

184
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,720
Aren't you crazy?

185
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,950
You have a lot of money, why are you doing not paying? Quickly pay.

186
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,120
Then... should I eat some cookies and cake too?

187
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,460
Since the rich you, are going to pay.

188
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,430
She isn't sane either.

189
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,330
Ah, that cake! Should we buy it all?

190
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,400
- Did you come to shop?
- Give us everything.

191
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,190
I got introduced to a guy.

192
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,710
Hey, really?

193
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,660
Don't lie.

194
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,180
- Tell me who.
- It's a secret.

195
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,620
- How old?
- It's a secret.
- Ah, how old!

196
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,910
- You know...
- What are you going to do?

197
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,590
- Tell me his age.
- The same age?

198
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,540
Is he cute? Is he cute?

199
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,370
Of course...

200
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,320
What, what? What do you think will happen?

201
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,780
Thanks. Ra Eun Ho got really excited seeing you guys.

202
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,020
Her friends that she likes so much...

203
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,370
and the school that she likes so much...

204
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,740
You just have to come back.

205
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,790
Is there really no way?

206
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,190
At least kneel and beg to your father.

207
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,080
Do you think I didn't during Joon Gi's case?

208
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,550
I think he's determined.

209
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,000
His reputation has always been more important to him than me.

210
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,270
I thought I could do everything for her.

211
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,010
Why is there nothing I can do for her?

212
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:55,080
Since you hate my method, tell me yours.

213
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,460
Let Ra Eun Ho go to school.

214
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,790
No.
Then starting tomorrow, I'll go around looking for the education office, police station, and broadcast stations.

215
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,540
Cafeteria food scandal, math competition corruption, exam corruption...

216
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,660
If the son of the chairman reports the school personally,

217
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,700
it'll be a very interesting article.

218
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,430
This punk... are you going to be like this until the end?

219
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,060
So let Ra Eun Ho go to school!

220
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,110
This is a clear equivalent exchange!

221
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,300
- The way you want!
- How dare you...

222
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,810
do this to me because of your childish love emotions!

223
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,480
If you ruin Eun Ho,

224
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,530
I will never stay still!

225
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,770
It's not on the emotion of childish love...

226
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,500
but for a classmate and a student of my school.

227
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,600
Really? Then it'd be good for you to prepare to go abroad.

228
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,280
I should also have something to gain.

229
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,320
That's the principle of equivalent exchange.

230
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,860
Really... is it really true, Teacher?

231
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,760
Eun Ho can go back to school?

232
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,000
If you were going to be like this, why did you make such a fuss!

233
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,640
- That's because I was frustrated!
- Teacher... how can this happen suddenly...

234
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,240
It's the way it should be. You only objected to the unfair treatment by the school. Your punishment was too severe.

235
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,670
In any case, you've suffered a lot, Eun Ho.

236
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,650
I've suffered the most-

237
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,590
Teacher. What about Tae Woon?

238
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,530
Then, he'll be coming back too, right?

239
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,170
About that Eun Ho... Tae Woon...

240
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,030
So about that...

241
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,180
You're going abroad? Suddenly?
Hey.

242
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,330
My talent is too valuable to waste.

243
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,430
Did you tell your father that you'd go abroad on the condition that I can go back to school?

244
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,640
No! It's not like that.

245
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,120
Like you said, I want to properly study design.

246
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,290
In many ways, the timing and the opportunity are good.

247
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,320
If I design a killer motorcycle, I'll let you ride it first.

248
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,580
Your reason for going abroad...

249
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,060
you're saying it's because of that?

250
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,930
Yeah! A new life is opening. I'm really happy.

251
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,000
But why do I keep feeling like...

252
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,360
you're lying?

253
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,020
What lie...

254
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,400
Who would lie about going abroad?

255
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,190
You said you want to go to school.

256
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,350
Isn't it good for the both of us?

257
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,170
Do whatever you want.

258
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,910
You won't listen to me anyway.

259
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:48,550
Since it's your life, whether you go abroad or quit school...

260
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,870
do whatever you want.

261
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,480
♫ From some time, I started wanting only you ♫

262
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:07,790

265

♫ Like a habit, I'm placing you in my eyes ♫

266
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,840
Stay quiet until you leave. Don't do anything rash.

267
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,930
Are you not curious?

268
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,990
Why did I do that kind of stuff at school?

269
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,350
As a father, shouldn't you be curious about that first?

270
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,370
I'm not interested in your useless acts.

271
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,180
Do you know what I fear of most?

272
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:09,260
When I become an adult... what if I become like you?

273
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,770
Request to Withdraw

274
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,290
Request to Withdraw From School

275
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,700
Will you be okay?

276
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,570
Anyhow, since there's still a waiting period,

277
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,450
it'll be processed after the waiting period.

278
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,130
Okay. But Teacher...

279
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,150
please make sure Eun Ho can come back to school.

280
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,710
I'm asking this favor.

It looks good!

286
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,420
The noodles will get bloated.

287
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,680
Oh, my goodness!

288
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,230

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,180
You're courageous, our Ra Eun Ho.

296
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:21,100
Of course. I've lived my 18 years by being courageous alone.

297
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,950
Are you really okay?

298
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,010
♫  When the spring comes  ♫

299
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,280
Yes. I'm okay.

300
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:38,030
Eun Ho. Can't you just say it?

301
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,510
What?

302
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:43,270
Don't hide your feelings and put it away inside a drawer of your own.

303
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,010
Don't smile on the outside...

304
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:52,810
"I'm having a really hard time. I'm really hurting." Can't you say that?

305
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,720
I don't think I should.

306
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,400
If I say I'm hurt, I don't think it'll be good.

307
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,920
Then other people will have a hard time because of me.

308
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,750
♫ It passes ♫

309
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,360
What about you? It's hard for you too.

310
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,670
You have to say that you're having a hard time and hurting...

311
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,750
so other people can also say the same thing,

312
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,660
and lean on you. Like Tae Woon.

313

♫ The white winter which is also piled up with sorrow ♫

Ra Eun Ho...

317
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,350
I don't think she's okay.

318
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,550
She's as bright as usual...

319
00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:00,110
positive and courageous.

320
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,090
I think she's really having a hard time.

321
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,440
She's not coming to school yet either.

322
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,760
She'll be okay when time passes.

323
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:25,700
Think again whether it's really good for Eun Ho for you to go abroad.

324
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,970
I've already made my decision.

325
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,230
Can't you come to school again?

326
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,020
I'm not going to school.

327
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,620
Hey, if you just decide that you'll come back to school, I'll gather the kids...

328
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:44,000
Whether it's protesting or writing a letter to the Office of Education. I'll do anything! So...

329
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,220
Hey. Can you just let me resolve my problem by myself?

330
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,920
You're already having a headache with your problem.

331
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,880
See you at school tomorrow. I'll be waiting.

332
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,100
Dae Hwi.

333
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,730
Let's go to school, Hong Nam Joo.

334
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,140
I'll stay with you. Let's go.

335
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,720
Let's go!

336
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,410
Oh, Hong Nam Joo!

337
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,850
You came.
I know right.

338
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,520
If it was me, I would have wanted to die from embarrassment.

339
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,630
Your mental is good.

340
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,630
Speaking of which, do you want to die?

341
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:18,160
I warned you, didn't I? If you bother her again, I won't leave you alone.

342
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,130
What is this, Song Dae Hwi? Didn't you guys break up?

343
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,270
Who said that we broke up?

344
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:28,910
Hong Nam Joo is my girlfriend, so if you bother her again, know that you guys are all dead-

345
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,290
I wanted to die. I thought about just dying too.

346
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,330
Because I was so embarrassed.

347
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,430
Of course.

348
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,030
I'm sorry for lying.

349
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:45,590
I know that no matter what reason,

350
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,750
the fact that I lied doesn't disappear.

351
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,310
But from now on, I'll never do that again. Just watch.

352
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,560
You're brazen. You want to cover it up with just this?

353
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,410
No, I want to face it head on.

354
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,630
In regards to my lies.

355
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:07,700
So, if you want to curse me out, do it. If you want to point at me, do it all you want.

356
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,330
My girlfriend's cool.

357
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,560
Gosh...

358
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,780
Can you unfold my hand?

359
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,480
These are the drawings you drew all this time. There's a ton, right?

360
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,720
What a person called Ra Eun Ho drew...

361
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,000
What she tried to do all her life...

362
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,170
What kind of dream she couldn't fulfill...

363
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,920
People might not know, but Eun Ho... I know.

364
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,810
I'll stay next to you, so...

365
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,310
let's not give up and go until the end.

366
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,530
Application

367
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,020
Applying for language school in US

368
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,320
This is the chicken store.

369
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,910
You're our most valuable customer.

370
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,180
We're having an anniversary celebration right now.

371
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,980
What kind of person says "I miss you" this way?

372
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,670
I don't miss you!

373
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,830
I hate you to death. Miss you? Pft.

374
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:57,320
Really? Then I'll eat the chicken well. You can go.

375
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,550
I'll... go back to school.

376
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,120
Really?

377
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:19,810
I realized... how much I like school.

378
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,540
At school, there are my friends that I really love...

379
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,550
My 18 year old daily life is there.

380
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,350
and my dream that I definitely want to fulfill.

381
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,700
So I'll go back.

382
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,410
You thought well, Ra Eun Ho.

383
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:42,180
And, I'll wait for you.

384
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,600
I just think it's my turn to do something for you now.

385
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,670
I'll stay by your side.

386
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:59,370
So, I hope that you also seriously think about your life.

387
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,050
Eun Ho... you-

388
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,720
Not that you're going abroad because you had no choice if you wanted to rescue me...

389
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,350
But a choice just for you.

390
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:17,450
About what's really important in your life.

391
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,770
It might take a long time... to find that answer.

392
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,080
You know I have really good stamina, right?

393
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,660
I'll wait.

394
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:37,310
No matter what you decide, I'll understand you and cheer for you.

395
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,940
Your reason to go back to school, your way to go back to school...

396
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,380
I hope you find that all on your own.

397
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,850
You can do that, right?

398
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,660
Anyhow, you make me concerned to death.

399
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,740
Joon Gi.

400
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,520
Really, what am I going to do?

401
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,160
I don't know at all.

402
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,230
I started the whole X thing to be less sorry to you.

403
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,340
Please let Joon Gi go around the school once.

404
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,930
Father, please let him go around once.

405
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:39,640
Just once, please! To Joon Gi, I...

406
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:53,630
Does this make sense for all the student evaluations to be made public?

407
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,000
Silence!

408
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,720
I wanted to land one on the school properly at least once...

409
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,320
and quit that kind of school.

410
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,630
But... that kind of cruddy school...

411
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,580
I've started to want to go back now.

412
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,370
What should I do?

413
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,780
So what are you saying you're going to do?

414
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,010
I came to give you an opportunity. Before I report it, confess.

415
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,680
If you submit evidence, I'll keep that in mind.

416
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,590
Evidence?

417
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:51,030
I didn't do anything, so how could there be evidence? I don't know why you came here looking for me without evidence either.

418
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,880
Yes. To be honest, I don't have definite evidence yet.

419
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,540
I may be stepping over the line, but for Tae Woon and Geumdo High School...

420
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,520
don't you have thoughts of resolving this problem?

421
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,430
You did step over the line.

422
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:10,920
I hired you in our school because you were a young person with ambition. But you're getting carried away.

423
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,790
I should rush the transfer.

424
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:32,030
There will be a math competition soon. This is the answer sheet, so you must memorize it.

425
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:38,920
Instead rather than being X, I'll implicate Ra Eun Ho in other things and have her expelled!

426
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,280
Why did I do the whole X thing?

427
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,240
I thought about why I hated school so much...

428
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,140
but it was all because of my father.

429
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,160
I have to resolve something with my father,

430
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,680
but I didn't have courage to face it directly to resolve it.

431
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:10,500
So by hiding under the X mask, I let out my anger.

432
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,010
I hope you can resolve things with father as Hyeon Tae Woon instead of X now.

433
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:29,290
Work hard cheering me on beside me.

434
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,720
Of course.

435
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,550
This punk...

436
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,050
Hey, Hyeon Tae Woon!

437
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,990
Hyeon Tae Woon!

438
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:18,400
What is all of this? What are you doing right now?

439
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,990
You saw all of it. This time, you'll have to take responsibility no matter what.

440
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,440
Even when there was a bigger problem, I endured. Do you think I'm going to collapse with just this?

441
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,660
Why? You're going to cover it again? You're going to dump your sins on someone else and stay out of it again?

442
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,420
Hey, Hyeon Tae Woon.

443
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,430
Hyeon Tae Woon!

444
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,570
It could have almost been a headache, really, thank you.
No problem.

445
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,660
Let's eat some time later.

446
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,590
There's all kinds of evidence against my father in here.

447
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,840
I heard you're investigating. It'll help you.

448
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,190
Will you really be okay?

449
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,770
About that...

450
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,760
Yes. No.

451
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,420
No...

452
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:38,330
I'm not okay, Teacher. Not at all.

453
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:43,700
To be honest, I hate giving this to you more than death.

454
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:50,660
Than take it back again. I didn't hear anything.

455
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,150
But then...

456
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,570
my father won't change.

457
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,690
He won't change at all.

458
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,860
I'm more scared of that, Teacher.

459
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,260
That I might lose the father that I know forever...

460
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,180
- I'm more scared of that.
-Tae Woon.

461
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:21,960
So Teacher... do something about my father using this.

462
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,960
I like my father.

463
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,380
He's the only person I can call my family in this whole world...

464
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,460
it's just me and him.

465
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,300
So...

466
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:46,040
help me using this...

467
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,430
so that I won't lose my father forever.

468
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,230
I have a bad feeling about this.

469
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,290
If we're really investigated by the police at this rate, what are we going to do?

470
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:10,060
Ah, don't jinx it!

471
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,500
I mean, it's not like we killed a person.

472
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,130
You're right. That is a very wise thing to say.

473
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,600
We just... so that the school could improve...

474
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,240
- What is this?
- You should know.

475
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,260
You have to be receive an investigation in regards to the school's corruption. I don't know whether you'll be a victim or suspects though.

476
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,250
Ah, is that something you should say in this sacred school?

477
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,280
I'm saying it because it's a sacred school. What should we do?

478
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,140
Are you going to go now or get caught later?

479
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:52,320
Once we get a search warrant, you can't get out of it at all.

480
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,740
It's not like I did it alone...

481
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,220
Why are you looking at me? I just did what you told me to.

482
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:06,750
I don't know anything. Let's go.

483
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,100
Let's go.

484
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,930
Ah, yes. What's the matter?

485
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,700
Lack of evidence?

486
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:43,980
Yes. I saw it, but it's not definite evidence enough to prove anything illegal.

487
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,000
I can't do anything about it.

488
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,540
That's a relief.

489
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,060
- Then I'll be going.
- He was very scared...

490
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,750
that he'd lose his father.

491
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:03,300
If he didn't do this, he said his father would never change at all.

492
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:11,390
I just hope that you'd think about how Tae Woon felt when he came here with these files of evidence just once.

493
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,920
Tae Woon likes you a lot.

494
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,930
Even though he shows off, he's just an 18-year old boy.

495
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,700
One who really needs his father.

496
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,430
What are you so unsatisfied about?

497
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,100
I said I'd do it.

498
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,360
I know right.

499
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:28,340
I just... wish that you'd scold me by saying "lying is bad," "don't curse your friends,"

500
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,810
and "if you did wrong, take responsibility," just like other parents.

501
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:40,000
Not always "I'll block it all, I'll make it so that it never happened."

502
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,220
I understand.

503
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,640
What?

504
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:55,060
I said I got it. I'll do that for you from now on.

505
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,220
Why so... suddenly...

506
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:29,060
When did you grow up like this?

507
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:36,120
You are saying that you will accept a police investigation?

508
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,840
I think I have to take responsibility for a situation that I caused.

509
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,880
I heard you avoided being indicted though.

510
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,790
Did you perhaps think about it?

511
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,410
If perhaps I become the principal,

512
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:59,740
you will have to give up a lot of things. Will that be okay with you?

513
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:03,330
The college entrance rate might drop immediately.

514
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:08,000
The donations that come through the Steering Committee will decrease quite a bit.

515
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:15,720
To be honest, I plan on donating Geumdo High School to society soon.

516
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,000
I purchased a small school in the countryside.

517
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,060
In a calm and orderly way, I want to become a true educator.

518
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:29,950
Until then, please make Geumdo into a proper school.

519
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,250
Is your father doing okay?

520
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:46,930
He's working hard in being investigated. I think he's prepared to some extent.

521
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:51,190
Then, you don't have to be X anymore.

522
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,290
I know.

523
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,360
Don't wear black clothing anymore.

524
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,650
From now on, wear this.

525
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:11,080
Not as X Hyeon Tae Woon, but just be my boyfriend Hyeon Tae Woon.

526
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:30,170
Did you buy this because you thought it was pretty?

527
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,240
From how I see it, not at all-

528
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,940
What? Don't wear it then!

529
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,900
Ay, how can you give and take it back?

530
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,100
- Don't wear it then!
- Ah, why?

531
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,110
Say "Noona, give it to me".

532
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,420
Ah, then I'll buy and wear it.

533
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,390
If you don't want to, then don't.

534
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,750
Noona, give it to me.

535
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,560
No.

536
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,420
Come here!

537
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,180
Yes, that is correct.

538
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,890
You admit to the other charges too, right?

539
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:12,210
Yes, I admit to everything.

540
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:17,730
Principal Yang Do Jin

541
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:24,160
The car is here, why are you dragging your heels?

542
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,370
Why are you making a fuss to take care of these things?

543
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,750
You don't need any of this. Throw it away.

544
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,210
What are you doing right now? Put it back right now!

545
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:37,120
Don't yell. I'm in a very close place.

546
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,530
Please talk quietly, quietly, Yang Do Jin.

547
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:48,590
What? Yang Do Jin? How dare this person-

548
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:52,260
Yang Do Jin. We've been colleagues for 10 years.

549
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,770
Our face has a difference of ten years but our real age difference is not even two years.

550
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:59,230
Why I oughtta-

551
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:04,320
Hey, Yang Do Jin. If I meet you outside, be careful. You'll die, really. Why I should just-

552
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,760
You little punk... don't even try it.

553
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,800
You've really lost your mind. Do you think it'll be over for me like this?

554
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,190
I'll clear my name and come back. Got it?

555
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:19,820
Yang Do Jin. You will never be able to come back.

556
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,320
I bet my right wrist on it.

557
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,840
I bet my neck that I will be able to come back.

558
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,060
Your neck has already been sliced already.

559
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,030
I'll return even as a spirit.

560
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,740
Yes.

561
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,260
Will you really be okay?

562
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:56,700
Now that you're not the chairman's son anymore, don't go around showing off at school.

563
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:01,660
How can I not when I'm awesome?

564
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,740
This punk. You're awesome because you resemble me.

565
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,750
I resemble Mom though.

566
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,410
I folded it.

567
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:23,290
Chain. Why don't you have a conscience?

568
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,200
How could you always break?

569
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,490
What is that?

570
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,710
I have a lot of money so I bought one.

571
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,750
Is this easy too? Am I prohibited from approaching you again?

572
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,780
Really, your grudges.

573
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,300
Come here. When the chain is broken,

574
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,020
if you know this, you'll be able to fix it by yourself.

575
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:10,190
Why are you suddenly like this? You can just fix it for me all the time.

576
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,770
It's because... I might not be able to do this for you for the time being.

577
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,620
I'm sorry.

578
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:51,720
I debated a lot about it... but the only family my father has is me.

579
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:59,790
My dad just showed off but... he can't even cook ramen by himself.

580
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,060
My boyfriend has matured.

581
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:12,200
I'll let you go then.

582
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,260
Don't even dream about doing anything else because I'm not around!

583
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,760
I've planted a ton of spies.

584
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,530
If you even meet eyes with another guy,

585
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:27,360
Geumdo High School will become a sea of blood that day. Got it?

586
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:33,270
Speaking of which, if you smile at other girls...

587
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:38,410
you'll die. Know that I'll come find you.

588
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,210
- I'll definitely come on the weekends.
- Okay.

589
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,520
I'll go during holidays.

590
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,860
- I don't think you'll be able to come.
- What?

591
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:02,430
Only... buses can go there.

592
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,440
Only buses can go?

593
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,130
I'll come.

594
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:12,910
I got it. I'll work hard too.

595
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,590
- Stop.
- Okay.

596
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,490
Just a minute.

597
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,300
You're nervous to death, aren't you?

598
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,960
Thank you to Channel Manager babyinspiritestar1

599
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:35,650
Thank you to segmenters; Pilarvelasquez, AmyPun, bjohnsonwong, cgwm808, bagy

600
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:42,120
Thank you to segmenters, cont.: ashnita_cherry03, fizban, kimosah1, gina007, wafaahs

601
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:54,260
Thank you to English subtitlers: jenarrtee, ccindylim1, saturn, grrrcat,

602
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,600
Thank you to English subtitlers: miaishere, staewithme, imashl3y, StarlightO, lid_bacci_93,

603
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:06,730
Thank you to English subtitlers: dramadwarfie, jane_yu_4, aoh705_vip, and yaniex3

604
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:12,930
Thank you to Editors cgwm808 (chief) and jieun_rhee

605
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:19,660
Thank you to coverpage designer babyinspiritestar1

606
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:26,420
Thank you to the entire Class of 2017 Team

607
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,990
That's how we became 12th graders.

608
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:51,110
Sa Rang's mom!
Aigoo, hello!

609
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,270
Aigoo, give that here.

610
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,330
I'll help you too.

611
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,310
Thank you.

612
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:04,720
Where we stood together, the ivy on the wall became even greener.

613
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,360
The school is still as rowdy as before.

614
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,090
Like us before, the sky is...

615
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,770
as blindingly bright and clear as ever.

616
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,560
Yeong Geon has a police exam ahead of her...

617
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,390
but a 100m record isn't coming out at all so she's training.

618
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:51,540
Teacher Soo Ji has gotten both her job and love...

619
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:57,390
while Teacher Joon Soo suffers from dry eyes.

620
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,710
I think of you.

621
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:09,010
Issue. No, Hyeon Il and Gyung Woo perform out on the streets.

622
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:16,330
They still haven't found what their dream is, but they're enjoying today.

623
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:22,730
Our Ran Ke now has an ordinary dream rather than studying for a governmental position exam.

624
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:25,440
The sunlight is too strong, I'll cover it for you.

625
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,820
This is covering it?

626
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,020
It isn't?

627
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,610
It isn't.
Nam Joo and Dae Hwi...

628
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:31,170
Why isn't it covering me?

629
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:33,520
Why isn't it-
Why are you running away?

630
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,300
You dumbo!

631
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,990
They really... give me goosebumps.

632
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:47,670
And I am now drawing a story about me and my friends.

633
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:53,150
And my grades are still in the sixth tier as usual.

634
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,930
Hanguk University will probably end as a dream.

635
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,780
Kapow!

636
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,120
You know...

637
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:13,150
From some time, the school started to be filled with kids wearing hoodies.

638
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,770
And every time I see those kids...

639
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:25,180
♫ As much as I am young, you too are young ♫

640
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,660
I... think of someone I miss.

641
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:35,500
♫ During that time I forgot again and made it difficult for you ♫

642
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,670
Oh my gosh!

643
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:39,000
Because it's my dream.

644
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,910
There's still stuff like that these days, so tacky.

645
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,850
♫ Why didn't you even know? ♫

646
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:47,160
How could you only think of yourself?

647
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,000
I only think of you too.

648
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,520
♫ I pray for you ♫

649
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,940
My heart flutters and I feel pleasant when I see you.

650
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,330
Hey, stop right there!

651
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,120
Then are you my dream?

652
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:07,600
♫ I pray for you always, I didn't mean anything serious, oh ♫

653
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:14,320
♫ Because it was very sad you didn't know me ♫

654
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:20,950
♫ Actually always right behind you ♫

655
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,290
Don't laugh like that.
♫ I pray for you ♫

656
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,120
My heart flutters.

657
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:37,470
These days, I really miss Tae Woon.

658
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,840
What happened to us during this time?

659
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:52,360
Here.

660
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,180
We're out of rice and you like chicken.

661
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,220
But still, chicken in the morning is a bit...

662
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,270
and I'm a senior though.

663
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,570
Here. Let's eat.

664
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:18,880
Ah, chicken is a bit...

665
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,630
This punk. Are things going well with Eun Ho?

666
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,870
Yes. It's hot.
Aigoo.

667
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,450
Who do you resemble to be this handsome?

668
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,690
Mom.

669
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:37,730
Huh? Eat here.

670
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,050
Go. I'll see you tomorrow.

671
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,920
See you later.

672
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,720
Excuse me, Oppa! Since you have a mock exam tomorrow...

673
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,660
What? Oppa?

674
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,490
Good luck on your exam.

675
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:01,340
Thank you, but... I have a girl-

676
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:04,200
You must love her to death.

677
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,970
Get rid of it.

678
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,390
I said get rid of it.

679
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,200
Oh, here.

680
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:32,320
Oppa! Since it's our school anniversary today,

681
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,340
I came to see you!

682
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,020
If you're like this, I'll be very upset.

683
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,500
Excuse me... who...?

684
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:47,280
Oppa! This female person is asking who I am!

685
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,560
She's my girlfriend.

686
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:56,640
Oppa! That's too soft. Say it louder!

687
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,730
She's my girlfriend! Pretty, right?

688
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,390
Louder!

689
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:06,800
She's my girlfriend! Go! Go!

690
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,920
How did you come here?

691
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,640
You missed me, right?

692
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,810
But do you want to die?

693
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:13,650
Huh?

694
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,390
Did you like that?

695
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,150
Huh? What?

696
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,120
First, follow me.

697
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,360
It's a misunderstanding.

698
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,750
Your viewers increased a lot last week.

699
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:34,940
Yay! The male lead confessed to the girl.

700
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,590
They went crazy!

701
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,560
How about you? Did you finish the motorocycle design?

702
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,730
No... about that...

703
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:51,640
You said you'd finish it all by this week! You said it'd be awesome!

704
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:55,160
It's because I'm not getting inspiration.

705
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:02,100
The bus is coming. It's coming!

706
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,360
Are you okay? Really?

707
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:48,500
I still haven't overcome my bus trauma.

708
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:54,280
Wounds don't heal easily...

709
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:59,370
The true feelings hidden inside the shell are still fragile.

710
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:06,570
However, the fact that you don't stop walking right now...

711
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:09,540
is just as important as your arrival at your destination.

712
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:16,210
The shell called X. I took off the shell I was hiding under...

713
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:19,900
and became a more courageous true me...

714
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,560
to face you and the world.

715
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:31,340
That is the truth that I learned at school.

716
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:40,740
♫ Believing now in this moment, I ♫

717
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:46,020
♫ Sometimes feel insecure and uneasy, but ♫

718
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:52,010
♫ As I think of you ♫

719
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:58,570
♫ Something wonderful will happen; yes, I'm expecting it ♫

720
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:02,520
♫ The moment you smiled ♫

721
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:08,160
♫ in the bright sunshine ♫

722
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:13,750
♫ I'm becoming addicted ♫

723
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,220
♫ and being dragged into the gravity which is you ♫

724
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:24,800
♫ Come, come, on the approaching ♫

725
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:31,060
♫ amazing tomorrow, the future's serenity ♫

726
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:34,100
♫ Everything that I ever dreamed of ♫

727
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,800
♫ one or two, will come true ♫
