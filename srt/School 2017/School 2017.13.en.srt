Episode 13

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,770
Did you miss me?

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,930
Am I crazy? Why would I...

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:22,670
♫ As much as I am young, you, too, are young ♫

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,060
I missed you.

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,900
♫ More than trying to understand, I just complained ♫

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,000
I think... I hid my heart all this time so...

8
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,960
Your confession made my heart flutter.

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,890
So... my feelings...

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,550
What I mean is-

11
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:00,480
♫ Pray for you, always, I didn't mean anything serious ♫

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,430
So what you're saying is, you like me, right?

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,010
♫ It must have been very sad ♫

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,020
♫ Actually, I'm always right behind you ♫

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,890
So what I'm saying is...

16
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,860
♫ I pray for you ♫

17
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,230
♫ Because you're still too small to contain my tears ♫

18
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,020
Today's day 1 for us.

19
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,310
♫ when they filled up and overflowed, you somehow didn't know ♫

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,650
♫ More than trying to understand, all you did was complain ♫

21
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:53,130
♫ Why didn't you even know? You hated a lot then. ♫

22
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,100
♫ I pray for you ♫

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,900
You came?

24
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,270
Why are you guys drinking again?

25
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,330
Don't worry, we're drinking today because we're happy.

26
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,920
Why? Did we win the lottery or something?

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,160
I found my friend that scammed us.

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,620
Really? Then we can even find the money?

29
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,640
No... not that.

30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,940
He had no choice but to do that because of his children's tuition.

31
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,060
So he promised me to pay me back monthly.

32
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,330
So they're going to pay us back a bit every month, right?
Yes.

33
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,960
Get your mind on straight and you must receive it. Don't let your heart weaken again.

34
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,360
I got it.

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,310
Day 1 of every month?

36
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,300
Day 1?

37
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,690
Today's day 1 for us.

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,840
I don't know, I don't know. What's day 1?

39
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,560
What do you not know? Do you not like getting paid back on day 1?

40
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,660
Your face reddened too. Do you like it so much that we caught the conman?

41
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,420
Yes!

42
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,480
I like it.

43
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,220
He went like this and then whoosh!

44
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,220
♫ I'm hungry for your love. I want to be your Oppa ♫

45
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,250
♫ Your Oppa. I'll have you, just watch ♫

46
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,930
♫ Why are you shaking up my heart? Why are you shaking up my heart? ♫

47
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:02,730
Did you miss me?
Yes.

48
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,970
I think... I hid my heart all this time.

49
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,300
♫ Are you that great? Why do you keep teasing me? ♫

50
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,000
♫ Just stop now and hold up, hold up ♫

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,060
♫ Hold me tight before I make a move on you ♫

52
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,390
♫  My heart could lose you ♫

53
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,330
♫ Say what you want, say what you want ♫

54
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,870
♫ What do you really want? ♫

55
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,940
Hyeon Tae Woon

56
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,280
Why?
What do you mean why?

57
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,650
Isn't it obvious?

58
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,570
Why would I call you in the middle of the night?

59
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,970
Why did you?

60
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,290
Your sense, really.

61
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,540
Why do you think I did? Deliver some chicken to me.

62
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,540
What? What!

63
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,530
Normally I'd just go to sleep.

64
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,600
But I really craved chicken so I couldn't fall asleep.

65
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,880
Deliver just one to me.

66
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,180
Are you crazy? Do you wanna get smacked by the chicken drumstick?

67
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,490
Hey. I just really wanted to eat it.

68
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,800
Please do it for me, hm? If I don't eat chicken tonight, I don't think I can sleep at all.

69
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,110
Just one.

70
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,030
To celebrate day 1, just one.

71
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,130
To celebrate day 1, do you want to die?

72
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,160
Just sleep.

73
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,720
Chicken? Huh!

74
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,840
Are you stealing chicken and selling it?

75
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,810
Mom-
Allowance!

76
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,120
10,000 won!

77
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,700
Agreed!

78
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,720
10,000 won!
Eat!

79
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,580
You have to make sure you give it me. Where's that being delivered to?

80
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,760
- Eat.
- You eat one too.

81
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,940
Eat.

82
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,160
Are you going out to deliver?

83
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,090
- What the heck?
- Did you take that out to give to me?

84
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,280
No!

85
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,720
Then you're going for a delivery at this time?

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,970
Yea, why? What?

87
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,080
- Where is it? Let's go together.
- Forget it!

88
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,540
So you did bring it out for me.

89
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,990
You shouldn't keep teasing a person like that!

90
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,880
I wanted to see you.

91
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,800
I can't sleep... because I missed you so much.

92
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,420
I can't sleep... because I missed chicken so much.

93
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,770
- You really!
- Oh, hey!

94
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,020
Let go. Let me go!

95
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,200
Hey, now that I see you closer, you're prettier. Really pretty!

96
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,810
Since I'm pretty, let me go!

97
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,690
Why are you not letting go of me?

98
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,840
Let go!

99
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,600
Let! Go!

100
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,720
Let go, let go!

101
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,500
In a relationship between people,

102
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,110
it tells you what kind of person that person is.

103
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,110
Someone said this.

104
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,240
When a relationship is shaken, it isn't a big case,

105
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,300
But it is caused by a small crack in the heart.

106
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,520
School 2017
The grain of two people

107
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,630
Truthfully, you're not extremely handsome.

108
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,490
Not extremely handsome?

109
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,890
You're not extremely handsome.

110
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,360
Oops.

111
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,720
It's because you didn't look at me

112
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,770
in a detailed, deep, and desperate way.

113
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,890
- If you look at me closely...
- Isn't that Eun Ho?

114
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,720
Stop it.

115
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,640
Mom! I'll be going first!

116
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,360
Don't come any closer.

117
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,090
Hey! Won't you get off her!

118
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,080
What the? What? What, what!

119
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,850
What, what! Are you crazy? Are you a psycho?

120
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,630
You! I didn't like you from a long time ago.

121
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,510
You always bullied my Eun Pal only.

122
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,590
Today, I will destroy-

123
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,110
- Why?
- He's... my boyfriend.

124
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,230
Boy... boyfriend?

125
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,810
Boyfriend, for short., "Namchin" . (Namja Chingo = boyfriend)

126
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,460
Is Hyeon Tae Woon really X?

127
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,700
And you and he are dating?

128
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,030
I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner. Sorry.

129
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,780
How could you keep that a secret?

130
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,310
For Hyeon Tae Woon's case, it was his secret so I couldn't help it.

131
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,050
For us dating... it started yesterday.

132
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,300
Still, I shouldn't have kept any secrets from you. I'm really sorry.

133
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,270
Well, you couldn't do anything about it.

134
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,770
Is Hyeon Tae Woon okay?

135
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,630
At first I thought he was an ass in the beginning.

136
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,750
But as I got to know him more, he's pretty okay.

137
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,060
Even though he acts like he ignores me, he's surprisingly kind. He takes good care of me.

138
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,560
His voice is really nice!

139
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,880
Also he's really caring. Last time I got sick-

140
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,570
He suddenly asked me about where I got hurt.

141
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,990
The formula for this is ...

142
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,370
Rang Kae!
Hi Sarang!

143
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,250
This is our hideout. Visit us more often from now on.

144
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,910
Sit.

145
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,250
Look, look.

146
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,910
The formula-

147
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,100
Hey, are you not going to study? The exam is right after break.

148
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,630
I don't study. I don't do that kind of stuff.

149
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,910
Ah, right. You always don't study.

150
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,530
Wait, wait. I can't remember.

151
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,320
Are you crazy?

152
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,700
I drew you here.

153
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,450
So what?
Look at it.

154
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,790
Let's see it

155
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,270
You drew me?

156
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,240
Oh, you drew it well.

157
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,480
Are you complimenting me?

158
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,630
Yeah. You drew well.

159
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,000
Why are my eyes like this?

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,650
Can't you tell me I did well?

161
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,220
Hey, Hong Nam Joo. Did your father's business move?

162
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,370
I heard it's right next to our building.

163
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,340
I wonder. I don't really know.

164
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,560
Since it's my dad's problem.

165
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,940
That's right, since it's the adults' problem.

166
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
By the way, where did you say you went for training last winter break?

167
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,150
U.S.A? Canada? Where was it again?

168
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,780
Why are you asking about that?

169
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,880
Trying to see how much you can make things up.

170
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,430
- We were curious.
- But we're a bit tired of your lies now.

171
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,260
Your imagination is lacking.

172
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,400
If you kept lying, did you think we wouldn't know?

173
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,270
That's right. Why did you lie?

174
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,270
You don't even have much.

175
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,750
Lying is the easiest way to overcome her inferiority complex.

176
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,800
What are you guys doing?

177
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,340
What about us?

178
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,770
It's true that Hong Nam Joo lied!

179
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,980
Why are you overreacting?

180
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,180
Nam Joo.

181
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,320
Let go.

182
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,750
I look great, huh? That was what you wanted to say!

183
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,540
What they're saying will die out soon anyway.

184
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,330
- So tell them the truth-
- Mind your own business.

185
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:05,000
It's the end... if I just quit this school anyway.

186
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,640
Did you know about it?

187
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,540
But why ...

188
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,790
Hey Song Dae Hwi, did you break up with Hong Nam Joo because of her lies? Did you find out?

189
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,900
All this time, she hid it from you and deceived you too? She's a total psycho.

190
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,100
Are you crazy?

191
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,470
Is this fun for you guys?

192
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,120
Cowardly bastards. Try mouthing off one more time.

193
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,920
I'll destroy all of you.

194
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,570
Ugh, it's cramped.

195
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,130
What the heck!

196
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,640
Why are you acting like this at school. So annoying.

197
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,310
Quit it, Hyeon Tae Woon.

198
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,240
Want to try me once?

199
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,070
Hey, Song Dae Hwi.

200
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,850
It's nice seeing you often.

201
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,850
We're so unlucky-

202
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,770
I know that too. You have to work part-time.

203
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,210
I don't want to.

204
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,030
Really?

205
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,820
Well I can't tell you to do something you hate, so I'll just have to force you.

206
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,130
Would smoking amount to a threat?

207
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,580
You're really annoying. Do you think you're a teacher?

208
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,290
Then should I act like a police officer to you?

209
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,390
Do you want to try being watched to see what you're doing all day?

210
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,220
I'll go, I'll go. I got it.

211
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,610
I heard you caught a pickpocket. I saw it on the school website.

212
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,170
So?

213
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,440
Well, just...

214
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,850
Don't act like you know me. You're so annoying.

215
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,080
I liked your attempt.

216
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,630
Well, she will open up someday if you keep on knocking.

217
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,580
Oh Sa Rang.

218
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,950
What the? Why do you look so depressed?

219
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,890
I don't know. I just feel depressed.

220
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,750
I found it. A way to comfort you.

221
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,050
Hyeon Il,

222
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,620
Let's go. I definitely need you.

223
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,080
Huh?

224
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,470
Do I need to keep sitting here?

225
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,090
You can stand if you'd like.

226
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,090
I'm an idol. I can't just sit here in the-

227
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:19,420
So, you give someone a dream, hope, and comfort.

228
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,610
I know right. Looking at you,

229
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,730
it feels like my depression flew away and I feel better.

230
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,420
I knew the presence of an idol can be comforting to the typical Korean high school students.

231
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,550
They mean so much to us.

232
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,360
How are you? Do you feel better now?

233
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,520
You really have a talent for making someone feel more comfortable.

234
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,300
Thank you. Thanks to you, I feel a lot better.

235
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,850
Why did you guys really call me? Hm?

236
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,800
Don't you think the meal service is becoming poorer recently?

237
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,590
It is becoming seriously poor these days.

238
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,610
I don't really know.

239
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,010
You don't need to know. Eat a lot.

240
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,690
Hey, just eat.

241
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,230
I want to eat something good...

242
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,430
- She's being bold in front of the kids.
- What are you talking about?

243
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,100
You said you want to eat something delicious,

244
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,760
Then that means you want to meet up and eat something good together.

245
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,200
It's not so be quiet.

246
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,460
What do you mean it's not?

247
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,390
Since the kids are around, you're embarrassed right?

248
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,770
Okay, I'll grant your wish,

249
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,730
wear something pretty tomorrow.

250
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,290
There's not going ti be a tomorrow for you.

251
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,850
Come here.

252
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,580
Hey, motorcycle.

253
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,450
Hello.

254
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,910
I'm seeing you in front of our house often.

255
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,630
I have something to do with Eun Ho.

256
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,880
Don't just do something but look at her face!

257
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,340
Is your vision bad?

258
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
How much was this?

259
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,300
♫ Our summer days are flashing by ♫

260
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,790
♫ In between the spilling sunlight ♫

261
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,140
Isn't my way of walking weird?

262
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,870
Why are you saying weird things? By the way, why are you making me carry this popcorn?

263
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,110
You like it so you told me to buy it for you!

264
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,740
Hold it, it suits you.

265
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,500
What? I hold it? Why do I have to hold it?

266
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,350
- Why? Are you curious?
- Yeah.

267
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,200
♫ While looking at your profile next to you, I smile  ♫

268
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,360
So I could do that.

269
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,750
Hey this is going too fast!

270
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,250
Too fast? Come here!

271

274
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,870
You complain every single time.

275
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,160
Hey, it's because I'm not focused right now.

276

♫ It's amazing I'm okay when I think of you. ♫

- Hey hey!

278
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,400
How are you so good for a beginner? This isn't your first time right?

279
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,020
Right? I'm so good for a beginner!

280
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,950
You didn't even get one but I did,

281
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,710
unlike you~

282
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,120
Thank you~

283
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,080
Thank you~!

284
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,340

289
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,160
Where are we?

290
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,620
My mom is right here.

291
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,930
Song Mi Yeon,

292
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,150
Her name is pretty.

293
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,530
She passed away when I was in elementary school.

294
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,970
I promised my father

295
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,020
that I'd visit Mom whenever something really happy happens.

296
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,450
Is today a really happy day?

297
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,240
Yeah, it is a seriously happy day.

298
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,250
What are you doing, not gonna say hello?

299
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:25,080
Hello, I'm Ra Eun Ho.

300
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,150
My girlfriend

301
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,590
Because of X, meal service by grades is gone now. I really like it!

302
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,060
Wow, I'm going to become X's fan.

303
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,510
What do you mean you like it? I always ate it first back then.

304
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,850
That time?

305
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,720
Ah, that's right.

306
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,760
But isn't the food lately

307
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,380
really weird? Is it expired?

308
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,680
What's weird? I think it's perfectly delicious.

309
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,120
If you're not going to eat your sausage, can I have it?

310
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,620
Eat it.

311
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,450
Thanks.

312
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,760
Here. Baek Nam-ryong's life. It's simple.

313
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,750
This is a short story. And it is also an epic story.

314
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,520
Teacher!

315
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,960
I... I have to poop really bad so I'm going to the bathroom...

316
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,780
You're going to poop in your pants on the way.

317
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:15,980
Today's topic. When people are conflicted between human attachment and being principled,

318
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,620
it is not the subconscious tendencies, but rather

319
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,690
the importance of conscience that the author is hinting at.

320
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,110
You worked well!

321
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,670
Hello, hello.

322
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,200
Really.

323
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,660
They left it a mess, really.

324
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,830
They need to start getting trained about how to sort waste.

325
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,010
Expiration Date
Until May 15th, 2017

326
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,660
What's with the date?

327
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,900
X's migration pattern is discovered now.

328
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,940
Auditorium to the main building..

329
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,270
Principal!

330
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,120
What is it?

331
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,740
This trash came from the lunchroom,

332
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,230
but the food, it's been expired for more than six months!

333
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,270
So what? It's from the trash, the trash.

334
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,060
What's weird?

335
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,840
Principal, this came just now from the cafeteria.

336
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,270
The kids might've eaten this stuff.

337
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,100
You can't just leave them be!

338
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,040
I really can't let you be.

339
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,420
Your job is to clean.

340
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,300
Why would you come into the school with something ridiculous?

341
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,890
How is this ridiculous?

342
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,340
This stuff is going into the children's stomachs...

343
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,100
That's what I'm saying! Only do what you're supposed to do!

344
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,480
Cleaner! Is any random person allowed to barge into the principal's office?

345
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,470
Get out right now!

346
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,490
She should've properly clean this type of mess.

347
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,090
Why is she making it a big deal when it's not?

348
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,190
Is she X?

349
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,140
So are you okay? Did you eat medicine?

350
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,120
The days are hot these days so food poisoning is really dangerous.

351
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,020
Is the food okay? I heard it's the only thing you can eat at school.

352
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,600
I don't know either.

353
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,740
Not all the kids are like this.

354
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,690
There's a lot of school lunch corruption lately. What if your school has that problem too?

355
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,990
Looking at the news, it seems like they use ingredients that have been expired for a long time already.

356
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,120
We wouldn't know.

357
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,250
But, the food lately is weird.

358
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,320
Anyway any human garbage that messes with food like pesticides in eggs or whatever,

359
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,820
they should rot in prison for 500 years!

360
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,380
That's what I'm saying, why would they joke around with what people eat? Do they have nothing else to do?

361
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,100
What is this now? Are you not cleaning?

362
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,340
It's my day-off today.

363
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,320
I'm here today as a parent.

364
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,680
I can't tolerate expired food any longer.

365
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,200
I'm going to explode and die knowing that the kids are eating this.

366
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,700
I'm really going to explode. Why are you still holding onto those?

367
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,440
Throw those out immediately and leave. Don't say useless things.

368
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,350
I can't leave.

369
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,800
After becoming a parent, how can I sit still seeing this?

370
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,260
Until you tell me that you will do a proper investigation on this matter,

371
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,970
I can't leave.

372
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,600
While you are taking every paycheck that the school pays,

373
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,400
what parental rights are there?

374
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,390
Why are you saying that here?

375
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,170
Should I let you go?

376
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,980
What are you going to do when you suffer from the consequences of your actions?

377
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,480
I.. that's not what I meant... this is-

378
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,570
This is going to be a pain.

379
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,630
If I fire her, she's going to make a fuss.

380
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,950
Please have me talk to President Kang of the cleaning services.

381
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,550
Hello.

382
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,400
It's your day-off so you should rest on a day like this.

383
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
I had something to do.

384
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,320
You're suffering a lot lately, right?

385
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,380
There's surprisingly a lot of stuff to do at school.

386
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,500
That's expected with work.

387
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,690
This is a bonus. At least buy the kids some meat with it.

388
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,170
It's not even a holiday, what's with the bonus? It's okay.

389
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,390
No, you're suffering a lot lately.

390
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,190
Also, to be honest, you need to be careful.

391
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:49,160
If you don't mess with them, it'll be peaceful. If you do, things will just get rough.

392
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,120
Isn't this a good thing?
Oh, why are you doing this?

393
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,460
This isn't it.

394
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,750
I heard your child also goes to this school.

395
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,360
Yes, that's true but...
Then...

396
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,800
Oh my goodness. I'm speechless.

397
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,340
They were all expired.

398
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:25,390
She must have suddenly felt mad knowing that her daughter was eating this kind of stuff.

399
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:31,150
Of course! What kind of parent would sit still knowing her child is eating that stuff?

400
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:36,880
Imagine if it was Madam Kim. She would have yanked out all his hair.

401
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:42,010
Eun Ho must have been sick yesterday because of the cafeteria food too.

402
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,470
So?

403
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,130
If you investigate the subcontractors that supply food to the cafeteria,

404
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,780
Our subcontractors are a well-known corporation.

405
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,350
As you know, they're a long-time business partner of mine.

406
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:15,410
There's not much a problem so don't mind those useless things and just study properly.

407
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,070
Is this enough to eat for lunch?

408
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:39,950
Yea. After being sick, I don't crave cafeteria food.

409
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,700
This is a worry. Eating anything else you can for lunch.

410
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:50,060
Are you perhaps pretending because you want to eat with just me?
Aigoo.

411
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,400
But what if there really is a problem with our school's cafeteria food?

412
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,480
I'm done with just this much. But what if something bigger happens to the other kids?

413
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,760
I know right.

414
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,820
We can't sit still.

415
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,620
Hyeon Tae Woon!

416
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,860
What? What is this?

417
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,650
What do you see us as

418
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,100
for you to do this alone?

419
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,390
You're making me concerned.

420
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,930
Expiration Date
Until May 15th, 2017

421
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,160
This is ridiculous. They're three months expired.

422
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,630
They're amazing.

423
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,960
It's worse here. It has been expired for a year.

424
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,240
Expiration Date
Until May 15th, 2017

425
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,800
Same here.

426
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,760
Hey!

427
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,580
You heard that too, right?

428
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,680
I think I heard something.

429
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:35,310
Go up! Go up! Hurry!

430
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,950
What do we do?

431
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,680
For now, let's go in here. We'll go the opposite way.

432
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,660
Go in. Quickly!

433
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,330
Quickly hide!

434
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,820
Hey, don't stick so close.

435
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,740
Be quiet! Do you want to get caught?

436
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,600
You look like you're quite up to do X-like activities, today.

437
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,730
I don't think there's anyone.

438
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,590
Teacher!

439
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,540
It must be this.

440
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,790
Let's go out.

441
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,960
You should have been careful!

442
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,160
I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

443
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,180
My heart was shaking.

444
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,020
I really thought we were going to get caught.

445
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,100
I was so nervous I thought I was going to die too!

446
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:15,490
Why were you nervous when you've done this kind of thing plenty of times already?

447
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,350
Why was I nervous?

448
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,720
We can slowly go out. Let's go.

449
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,320
Let's go.

450
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,230
Ehhh, I wouldn't be X if I just left.

451
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:46,980
What is this? Who did this?

452
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,660
What in the world...

453
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,400
Xs out of garbage.

454
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,070
Let's not joke around with food - X.

455
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,310
This is ketchup that was squeezed out ten hours ago. It's sweet and savory.

456
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,910
X this punk, why I really-

457
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,120
By the way, what's more serious is-

458
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,470
What can be more serious than this?

459
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,390
On the first floor.

460
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,790
I'm telling you a call definitely came from here!

461
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:59,490
I'm positive it was the phone number for this room. You asked for 100 pork cutlet lunches!

462
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,660
You even said there was a school event.

463
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:06,530
You rascals! There's no way I did that! That is what I'm saying!

464
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:11,410
Wait! That's right, that way of speaking. "That is what I'm saying," that was the way of speaking.

465
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,500
"That's right", my ass!

466
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,620
"Since I'm ordering so much, make sure you don't forget the free service! That is what I'm saying."

467
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,130
I'm saying make sure to fry the pork cutlets thoroughly.

468
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:26,100
The way of speaking is the same! Just quickly pay.

469
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,860
Quickly pay.

470
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,570
I'm saying I didn't order it!

471
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,170
I wish we could eat this every day.

472
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,990
Do you think so?

473
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,330
It tastes like honey.

474
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,400
What happened?

475
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,800
It's good to eat something yummy.

476
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,460
This is Geumdo High School.

477
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,320
I'm saying to quickly deliver my order.

478
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,820
Eat a lot, a lot. My Eun Ho should eat a lot-

479
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:18,440
You eat a lot... too much.

480
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,690
Even though I eat a lot, I'm still pretty, right?

481
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:25,500
Black bean noodles there and pork cutlet here, dumplings ...

482
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,650
Just you ...

483
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,710
Do you not see the school going crazy?

484
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:34,100
If you're going to just let everything go the way they do, what's the point of law and order?

485
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,000
You can just resolve everything by doing as you feel and making a ruckus then.

486
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,500
It's not that I wrecked anything.

487
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,480
The students wanted to exact justice on their own.

488
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,060
Still, this isn't something we can just sit back and watch!

489
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,680
This won't do. I need to officially wrap up the X case.

490
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,000
You can't. If you do that, the whole school will find out.

491
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,250
If the Principal finds out that X is Chairman Lee's son,

492
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,630
he won't be able to mess with X and he'll only mess with innocent people nearby.

493
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,050
The moment you reveal it, many things will give us a headache.

494
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:08,010
We have to try to know whether it gives us a headache or not.

495
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,740
How can you be so cold?

496
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,200
What about you, then? How can you only think about that?

497
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,980
Think about my perspective or the school's perspective just once, please.

498
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,560
You didn't capture him in a week.

499
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,350
How is there another incident?

500
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:40,770
I apologize and am at a loss for words.

501
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:43,760
School lunch is something that the parents are most sensitive about.

502
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,560
If any tail of it is caught by outsiders, then it'll be a situation that'll be completely unmanageable.

503
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,060
I'll take care of it whatever it takes.

504
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,050
So that the situation doesn't get any bigger, make sure you find a solution right away.

505
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:01,520
So that X guy cannot do anything any longer, set up private security guards if you have to!

506
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,200
I understand. I'm sorry.

507
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,620
This is a strategic alliance.

508
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:29,660
I'm saying that this case has to be resolved well for you and I to be safe.

509
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,990
Of course. Would my mind only be playing around?

510
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,340
The fact that Chairman Lee and we are in the same

511
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,660
situation. And if the issue of school lunch gets let out

512
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,830
What do you mean we're in the same situation.

513
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:49,620
Whatever. We must be sure to put suppress this situation.

514
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,720
Isn't the method simple?

515
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,510
What you see...isn't everything.

516
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:20,120
Is this a dream? Does this make sense?

517
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:25,960
We're actually getting both bulgogi and sweet and sour pork for lunch?!

518
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,010
Thank you!

519
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,170
Please give me a lot!

520
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,790
Eat a lot. Yes, eat a lot!

521
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,260
Eat a lot and study!

522
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:43,730
Did we overreact a bit?

523
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,960
It was definitely food that was way past its expiration date.

524
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,470
Isn't it that the principal changed his tactic because we made such a fuss?

525
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:59,040
That could be it. If the problem gets bigger and the school parents find out about it, it can be troublesome.

526
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,200
But why do I feel this is even more unsettling?

527
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,060
Unsettling?

528
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,310
I hope braised short ribs come out tomorrow.

529
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,230
Right? Right, right?

530
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,310
Just eat.

531
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:12,290
Eat a lot.

532
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,180
Why, do you guys all hate braised short ribs?

533
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,730
Just eat. Eat, eat.

534
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,930
Should I eat yours too?

535
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,290
Eat a lot.

536
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,150
Like people who are awaiting fortune at your door...

537
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,970
Look at the color of these egg rolls.

538
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,100
We didn't have this in our day.

539
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:36,890
Girl. Why are you here at school at this time?

540
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:39,970
I was studying.

541
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:47,270
Your back must hurt. As exercise, wouldn't you want to make rounds around the block for patrol?

542
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:56,110
Since you worked hard today, I'll treat you to a late night snack.

543
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,050
There's nothing going on. Why would you go on a patrol?

544
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:02,540
Normally a case explodes during a time where you think nothing will happen.

545
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,420
Teacher, are those handcuffs real?

546
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,710
Of course they're real. It's your first time seeing handcuffs, right?

547
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:16,510
They look like toys, childishly.

548
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,890
How are they? They don't seem like toys, huh?

549
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:31,930
Ah, really. What are you doing? Quickly free us.

550
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:39,700
Oh no, what to do? I don't have the key with me. I think we'll need to go to the station for that.

551
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,830
What?

552
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:45,170
What kind of- then let's go together. We have to quickly unlock this.

553
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,190
It'll be hard for the two of you to go around together like this. I'll just go first and come back.

554
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,520
What kind of police officer doesn't go around with keys to her handcuffs?

555
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,600
That's what I'm saying. Or do you want to report to 112?

556
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,980
Teacher.

557
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:02,170
Spend a cozy time together. I'll be right back.

558
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,200
They have to be stuck together in order to make up with each other.

559
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:38,540
Ah, really. Why did she do this to us?

560
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,110
I'm okay though.

561
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,600
What?

562
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,900
If we aren't tied together like this, you won't listen to me.

563
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,140
I don't have anything to say to you.

564
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,150
I... don't regret back then.

565
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:07,050
I feel relieved rescuing you that way.

566
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:11,330
Shut up, you betrayer.

567
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,970
You're right. I betrayed you.

568
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,570
But even if the same case were to happen again, I would have betrayed you

569
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:23,190
and told the police station that you guys were fighting.

570
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:26,090
Do you know what happened to me because of that?

571
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,380
I've been labelled as the troublemaker in school.

572
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,850
I think it's better than letting you fight and ruin your life!

573
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:40,260
If you fought then, you wouldn't have become the troublemaker, but you might have become a criminal.

574
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,160
Do you really want to die?

575
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,140
Stand up, quickly.

576
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:09,270
♫ When I get home it's dark ♫

577
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:14,130
♫ So that my tired feet ♫

578
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:19,230
♫ Can take a rest ♫

579
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:20,530
You do it.

580
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:24,110
♫ Like fluttering in the wind  ♫

581
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:29,490
♫ Even my shaky mind can take a break ♫

582
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,990
Ah, really.

583
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,720
Oh!

584
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,660
You're so sickly. You should eat well.

585
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,150
I eat well and it's still like this.

586
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,750
Eat more. Eat a lot!

587
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,290
Why did you hit my butt!

588
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:53,800
♫ Like the time ♫

589
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,620
It makes me think of the past.

590
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,590
♫ which was painful passes ♫

591
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:02,460
Every time I had a nosebleed, you took care of me.

592
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,910
Shut up.

593
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:11,520
♫ The white winter also which is piled up with sorrow ♫

594
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:17,920
♫ When spring arrives and the flowers bloom ♫

595
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,540
♫ It will pass  ♫

596
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:26,610
Have a fighting spirit--

597
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,110
What is this?

598
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:32,360
Instructor Soo Ji was showing us her handcuffs.

599
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,880
What? But why do you still have it on?

600
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,310
She forgot the keys at the police station.

601
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,160
Police station?

602
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,490
No. She was just at the office a while ago-

603
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:50,530
Follow me and I'll free you guys.

604
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:59,920
Teacher Su Ji. What on earth did you do to the kids?

605
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,950
You said you were going to go to the police station!

606
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,150
I went like the wind and came back.

607
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,830
Did anything change between you two?

608
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,060
I'm speechless, really.

609
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,350
I was okay though.

610
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,390
Quickly free us.

611
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,400
Quickly release them.

612
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:30,690
You're gonna get hurt.

613
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:36,620
Hwang Yeong Geon, take Bo Ra home safely. It's an extension of your patrol duties.

614
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,380
I don't know.

615
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,660
Go carefully.

616
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,600
Teacher Su Ji. Let's talk for a bit.

617
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,090
Teacher Su Ji!

618
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:57,940
The kids aren't even criminals, how can you think of putting handcuffs on them?

619
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,420
I did it to have them make up with each other.

620
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:06,120
Because I think those two had a misunderstandings and lost the timing to make up.

621
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,630
Even so, how could you have used such a bad method like that?

622
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:13,610
That's what you think. It could be the right way to someone else.

623
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:17,490
To put something that's not good to be anywhere near during a lifetime on the kids is just--

624
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:23,190
Teacher. Your method isn't always right.

625
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,250
I don't say anything about your methods,

626
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,410
but why do you always make a big deal when you don't like mine?

627
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,860
That's not what I meant.

628
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,570
Because you criticize me every time,

629
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:38,450
I feel like I've become a thoughtless person and I don't feel that great, you know.

630
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,310
Hold on a minute.

631
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:50,060
I don't know why I'm like this.

632
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:56,120
I don't actually feel that way, but I don't know why I keep making you mad.

633
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:02,950
I... just want to see your smiling face.

634
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:08,070
I don't know why I keep making you mad and making myself feel bad about it.

635
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,900
But...

636
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,360
are you apologizing or confessing?

637
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:22,120
Umm...

638
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:53,790
What's wrong? Did you fight with Oh Sa Rang?

639
00:56:53,790 --> 00:57:00,360
No, her mother had objected to the school lunch and it seems that she really got it bad with the principal.

640
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:05,460
I'm worried about her a lot so I don't feel good.

641
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,500
There is some kind of problem.

642
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,760
It's a bit suspicious for the cafeteria food to suddenly get better.

643
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,820
There's some kind of deception for sure.

644
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,260
They're probably very attentive because the mood is absolutely terrible.

645
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,200
Because the market price of the lunch is fixed, it's an obvious ploy to deceive.

646
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,740
So you're saying eventually the quality of the food will drop.

647
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:27,310
Whoa, Hyeon Tae Woon.

648
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,070
I told you. I'm smart but I just don't study.

649
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:31,730
Forget it.

650
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,390
What are we going to do now?

651
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:39,830
What do you mean what are we going to do?

652
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:43,330
We need to make a good punchback. So that they don't ever mess with edible things ever again.

653
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:47,570
If they make our Eun Ho get hives and be sick, I'm going to scold them good!

654
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,460
You can't. Don't do that!

655
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,260
Why not? You just said you were worried about her.

656
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,430
It won't be resolved through doing what X does.

657
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:59,060
The principal is watching like a hawk these days.

658
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,860
I'm X. It's okay.

659
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,630
If I tell you not to do it, then don't!

660
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:07,160
Do you know how many people you've been caught by since then?

661
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,190
- I said I'm okay.
- I said don't, PLEASE.

662
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,730
Are you mad?

663
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,740
The owner isn't answering the phone. After the beep-

664
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,890
We need to throw back a good punch so that they never mess with anything edible again.

665
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:04,270
If they make our Eun Ho get hives and be sick, I'm going to scold them good!

666
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,290
Stay still!

667
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:46,760
You've been caught. You're caught red-handed!

668
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,990
This rat-like punk.

669
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:57,460
Did you think you wouldn't get caught by hands, punk?

670
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,950
♫ Believing now in this moment I ♫

671
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:51,310
♫ Sometimes feel insecure and uneasy but ♫

672
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,570
♫  Just as you entered my heart ♫

673
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,170
School 2017

674
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:59,680
Teacher Su Ji is leaving!

675
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,990
It seems that the principal is moving more concretely.

676
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,720
It'll be good to be careful for the time being.

677
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,230
Are you crazy? This is school!

678
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,890
So what?

679
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,310
Is doing what X does a joke to you?

680
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:13,210
We all got dragged to this situation because of those childish pranks.

681
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:18,200
I should've put an end to it from the very beginning, but I had let the bad weed grow too well.

682
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,770
How could... How could you do this?

683
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,830
Why are you doing this to me?

684
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:27,690
