00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,640
Episode 11

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,570
The location has been changed.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,740
It's not at the auditorium, but at the entrance of the music room.

4
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,820
The security!

5
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,660
-What are you doing?
- Let go of me.

6
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,660
What are you doing?!

7
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,870
Let go.

8
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,160
Kim Hui Chan already took the hint.

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,400
Was Kim Hui Chan the one who sent the text message?

10
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,720
Did you think no one would notice your fake, heroic game?

11
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,320
Then what are you?

12
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,320
What is this attire?

13
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,080
Are you perhaps..

14
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,560
Don't get me wrong. I just didn't want to owe you.

15
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,460
I know you'd be taking credit for yourself for covering for me forever. That's why.

16
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,390
Because of you, Ra Eun Ho is also in danger.

17
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,100
How much of this does Kim Hui Chan know? Is he certain? Or did he just sound me out?

18
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,650
He is definitely aware of it. Since he does not have any evidence, I think he just sounded you out.

19
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,750
He was shocked at the moment because I showed up.

20
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,150
But, since he's very quick-witted, he wouldn't 100% believe it.

21
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,370
Also, don't tell Ra Eun Ho that I know all about this.

22
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,040
Don't make her worry unnecessarily.

23
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,780
Since when did you know about this?

24
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,880
You don't need to know.

25
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,180
Will you be okay? The whole school is trying their best to catch X.

26
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,830
I know right? Everything will be better if someone stopped getting into trouble.

27
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,630
I'm so dumb-founded. Who's the one that started this whole childish 'X' game?

28
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,080
Are you speechless?

29
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,500
Just dumb-founded, not speechless.

30
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,270
Do you understand?

31
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,360
What are you looking at? You've been watching the whole time. Come in if you want.

32
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,560
Your liver is definitely big. (You're not scared of anything)

33
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,270
Then, do you think my liver is the size of your timid liver?

34
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,440
What is all this? Why are you even doing-

35
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,280
None of your business.

36
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,260
Perhaps, is this all because of what happened to Joon Ki?

37
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,810
Be quiet.

38
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,130
Did you at least want to compensate for whatever wrong you and your father committed?

39
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,760
-What did you say?
-Am I wrong?

40
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,920
You just want to feel less burdened by doing all sorts of cowardly things like this!

41
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,580
This bastard really.

42
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,710
Do you still not get it?

43
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,530
Whether it is in the past or it is in the present, your cowardly actions are getting others in trouble.

44
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,710
Shut your mouth now.

45
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,830
It is true that Ra Eun Ho is in a difficult situation because of you.

46
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:56,760
I mean, this time again, even if Ra Eun Ho gets hurt, you can just escape by yourself.

47
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,250
Watch your own behavior. Who is the one who jeopardized Ra Eun Ho in the first place?!

48
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,380
It's Kim Hui Chan whom you've done disgusting stuff with.

49
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,180
Who are you to tell me what to do? How dare you-

50
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,260
How dare you worry about Ra Eun Ho?

51
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,730
Then, this time you should confess to the school that you're X.

52
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:50,980
People already suspect that Ra Eun Ho might be the accomplice. Then she should be free.

53
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,820
Kim Hui Chan

54
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,170
Kim Hui Chan

55
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,120
Then, this time you should confess to the school that you're X.

56
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,880
Then she should be free.

57
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,080
I already know you're X.

58
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,230
Come to the auditorium at 10 p.m. If you don't show up, Ra Eun Ho will be hurt.

59
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,770
Where did Kim Hui Chan go?

60
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,220
He went out with Dae Hwi earlier.

61
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,040
Song Dae Hwi, you're quite funny. You really are X?

62
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,550
Right, you saw it all.

63
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,390
You already know I won't believe you anyway.

64
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,660
You were even with me until dawn on the day before the school portfolio was disclosed.

65
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,110
-Are you trying to prove me wrong with such a trivial detail like-
-Would I really?

66
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,320
Me?

67
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,720
Someone who brown-nosed me in order to desperately escape your inferior background

68
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,200
and endured it all, how can you possibly be X?

69
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,610
This is ridiculous.

70
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:52,070
Maybe I endured it all this time in order to back-stab you like this.

71
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,520
Don't you think this is way too ineffective?

72
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,870
Why did you do this even by faking?

73
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,680
I can't be suffering all the time.

74
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,630
Like you said, I need to protect what's important to me.

75
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,640
So I realized I need to at least know your weakness.

76
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,650
You've grown up a lot.

77
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,970
Why Ra Eun Ho?

78
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,640
What are you going to gain from bullying a weak girl like her?

79
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,860
That's why I'm bullying her!

80
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,950
To tell her that she is weak.

81
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,030
How dare she annoy me.

82
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,310
Someone so inferior like her?

83
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,080
Do you still stutter in fear

84
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,900
whenever you get calls from your father?

85
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,410
I dare you to expose my weakness.

86
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,640
I will also visit your father with your weaknesses.

87
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,400
Anyway, let's be careful.

88
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,970
Is it because of Kim Hui Chan?

89
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,870
Well, there's nothing bad about being careful.

90
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,590
Ra Eun Ho!

91
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,960
You came again.

92
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,800
I saw that results came out for the School Violence Conference.

93
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,800
I'm so relieved that you won.

94
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,540
I know right.

95
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,140
Here.

96
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,450
Thank you!

97
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:09,470
-Did you write the letter? This is so touching.
- What do you mean touching?

98
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,700
Who are you? Why do you keep on following and bothering her?

99
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,430
Did Eun Ho even accept your confession?

100
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,410
No!

101
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,450
-Then, why are you making such a fuss?
-Fuss?

102
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,750
Do you think you and I are on the same level? From now on, don't show up in front of her.

103
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,590
Eun Ho, do you want to go watch a movie with me?

104
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,020
A movie?

105
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,520
Recently I saw there are a lot of good movies.

106
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,910
I'll call you after I buy the tickets.

107
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,650
What are you looking at?

108
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,620
It's been so long since I watched a movie.

109
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,100
A movie?

110
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,340
You're going to go watch a  movie when there is just you two sitting close together in the dark?! A movie!

111
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,630
I don't think this is something you should care about.

112
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,420
Why are you stealing my food?!

113
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't eat it! You're going to get a cavity!

114
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,400
I- I dare you to watch a movie with him.

115
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,100
By the way, why are you not answering me?

116
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,810
What answer?!

117
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,030
I think I did it before that bastard.

118
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,530
Confession..whatever it is.

119
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,520
Why do you not have an answer?

120
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,260
-A-answer?
-Answer.

121
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,580
-Do I have to answer that?
-Yes you do!

122
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,910
I'll tell you once I find it.

123
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,640
Notice: Results from the School Violence Conference Results
2-1 Kim 0 0 , 2-1 Yoo 0 0

124
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,520
Woah! Ra Eun Ho, you're impressive!

125
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,200
Results from Yoo Bit Na issue are also flipped! You're like a cider!

126
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,440
Of course, justice triumphs. Very cider-like!

127
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,930
Notice: School Violence Conference Results
2-1 Yoo 0 0

128
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,670
What is this?

129
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,760
-Is there something living in your stomach?
-I just heard a growling noise.

130
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,820
Even the results came out. So apologize.

131
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,500
You're so stupid. I'm going to attach an another file to prove you wrong.

132
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,370
What do you mean an apology when there isn't even a proper result yet?

133
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:37,660
You're so shameless. Is it that hard for you to apologize?

134
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,340
I didn't do anything wrong.

135
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,700
Even if you deny like that,

136
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,660
things you've done wrong won't make you stand out nor disappear.

137
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,660
How come you don't know how to apologize?

138
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:59,160
You're so skilled at making an innocent person think malicious thoughts.

139
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,490
That punk!

140
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,260
Hope he falls over while walking.

141
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,360
Don't worry about anything and just focus on your studies.

142
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,260
The fact that you're only the 2nd place means you're lacking effort.

143
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,630
Yes.

144
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,430
What are you even lacking? This is stressing me out!

145
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,110
I'm also stressed out.

146
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,270
-What?
-Please..

147
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,380
Please stop.

148
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,720
Why do you always belittle me?

149
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,780
I'm extremely stressed out too. I'm barely holding on. But why?!

150
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,170
I'm trying to perfect your life!

151
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,070
How is my life going to turn out perfect when it is already so worthless now?

152
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,140
I want to live too. I want to breathe!

153
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,870
Why do your corner me to death?! Why do you keep on preventing me from breathing?!

154
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,810
- Kim Hui Chan!
- Why!? I'm going crazy too.

155
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,470
i'm going crazy too!

156
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,630
Anyway, since we're trying to reform the school system,

157
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:34,370
you can think of this as a way of making the school fair and righteous, Teacher Jang So Ran.

158
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,030
Thanks to you, I've received 6 months of salary reduction and punishment.

159
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,640
Forever leaving a mark on my record.

160
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,150
I feel bad, but not that much.

161
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,470
What I'm saying is,

162
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,820
We need to give performance assessments not only to students, but also to teachers. To see if they are performing their teacher's duties.

163
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,620
What are you saying?

164
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:09,760
You're right. The school needs to be assessed more on that. Same with snack bars in front of the school.

165
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,470
Dream Talk

166
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,470
This is all I have prepared for this talk.

167
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,730
Finally, I want you to tell you is that-

168
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:32,590
I want you guys to do what makes you happy rather than trying to get a stable job all the time.

169
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,120
The end. I'm Joo Dong Jin.

170
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:48,810
We'll talk about what you want to do later in life,
so think about what your dream is.

171
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:56,340
School 2017
Dream, The Uneasiness Which Shines

172
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,740
Hey! I got more views. What If I become famous?

173
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,300
What do you mean famous with 13 views?

174
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,790
The feedback is unreal. Very funny. Super funny.

175
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,270
Who would this be? This person must be a loyal viewer of my webtoon.

176
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,930
loyal vie-

177
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:30,110
What do you mean a loyal viewer? He's an ardent reader.

178
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,010
-Hey, @niceguy.
-What?

179
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:54,700
"Hey, @niceguy." "What?". Are you shocked to get caught?

180
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,890
Wh-what do you mean get caught?

181
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,570
Mr. Niceguy, why are you acting like this?

182
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:09,240
Wow, really.

183
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,760
I'm so dumb-founded.

184
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,060
Are you d-d-dumb-founded, Mr. Niceguy?

185
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,730
I'm not a Chimpanzee. When did I do that?

186
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,600
Anyway, thank you, my number 1 fan Hyeon Tae Woon.

187
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,660
I did that because I had nothing better to do.

188
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:39,200
Whatever you say. By the way, do you not have a dream?
-No. That's so old-fashioned.

189
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,000
You were so good at drawing the last time I saw you.

190
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,370
I told you. As soon as you have a dream, your life becomes miserable.

191
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,050
It seems like you're right.

192
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,970
Why? What's wrong?

193
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,770
Thirteen views are my reality.

194
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:19,250
There are many new webtoons being published just on the website I use.

195
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,180
My work has to compete against hundreds of other webtoons.

196
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,030
Now, I'm not even sure if I'm talented at this.

197
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,360
But through tough competition is how everyone else achieves their dreams.

198
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,920
Would I be able to survive among those people?

199
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,060
What I like and what I'm good at are definitely two different things.

200
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:55,220
I'm scared I might just disappear

201
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,430
after imitating others for long.

202
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,930
Very funny. I think the author is a genius.

203
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,560
Woah!

204
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,590
If there is one flaw, it would be that the girl character

205
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,430
doesn't seem to know very well about liking someone.

206
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,350
I think her character would be better once she's in a proper relaitonship.

207
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,690
By Nice Guy.

208
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,560
Bit Na, Happy Birthday!

209
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,960
I'm glad I told you about it.

210
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,700
This is so pretty!

211
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,040
Woah!

212
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,090
Are you postponing your birthday party to after the finals?

213
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,850
Yes.

214
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,600
Where are you going to hold it?

215
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,200
At a hotel. My mom told me she made a reservation.

216
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,600
Bit Na.

217
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,150
Hong Nam Joo!

218
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,650
What is it?

219
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,860
It's a scentt candle...

220
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,130
I've never seen this brand before. Is this from France?

221
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,520
I mean. Well..

222
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,350
This is being sold on the internet.

223
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,620
Basic. Cheap.

224
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Perhaps, Hong Nam Joo is trying to irritate you on purpose.

225
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,240
Woah! Along with Seo Bo Ra. One, Two, Punch!

226
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,420
It's not like that. There was a good review on it. And I heard it's really popular.

227
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,620
Does your dad really own Sin Gang Transportation Company?

228
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,340
What? Why are you asking that again?

229
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,770
I heard the CEO of that company is single.

230
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,240
I'm just wondering if the CEO changed for that company or something.

231
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,860
It must be a rumor again.

232
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:15,380
Hey, did you really break up with Song Dae Hwi?

233
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,020
You two broke up?

234
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,840
Song Dae Hwi, did you really break up with Nam Joo?

235
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,180
Why?

236
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,120
Why do you guys care?

237
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,200
So are you saying you broke up or not?

238
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,880
We broke up.

239
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,300
We did break up, so mind your own business.

240
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,030
What happened?

241
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,520
Were you really dumped?

242
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,830
How could she possibly?

243
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,920
Were you dumped?

244
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,460
I think she really was dumped.

245
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,150
Song Dae Hwi!

246
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,970
Are you relieved now that you exposed me like that?

247
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,830
Nam Joo, I just wanted to be honest-

248
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,350
Right. You like being honest.

249
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,740
That's why you don't care even if your ex-girlfriend's pride is being crushed.

250
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,670
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

251
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:28,100
I'm thankful that you didn't mean it.

252
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,950
Wait, wait!

253
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,660
So you're saying,

254
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:51,310
You father loves chicken from our restaurant?

255
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,620
Yes.

256
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:58,530
So you're saying you're coming to our restaurant to fry the chicken yourself?

257
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,880
Yes.

258
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,660
Can't you just order it from-

259
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,650
Should I? Should I go home and order chicken? Maybe order five of them?

260
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,200
Never mind. Since I have a coupon, six of them!

261
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,510
You're going to order all six of them individually, right?

262
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,870
Of course!

263
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,840
I told you already that ordering chicken is my hobby.

264
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,110
Okay! Just one chicken.

265
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:32,300
You're ordering only one, frying only one, taking  only one home. Delivery service not allowed.

266
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,280
Okay!

267
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,960
Double the allowance!

268
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,350
I get it, you chick!

269
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,640
Your friend's chicken might take a while.

270
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,480
I can just give it to him after. I'll be back.

271
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,000
This is not yours.

272
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,810
Are you leaving?

273
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,960
No. I'm delivering.

274
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,730
Why are you delivering?

275
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,870
Are you going to deliver by yourself? You can't. There are so many weird people these days.

276
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,870
They keep ordering chicken, joking with you, and

277
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,000
threatening you to give them coupons.

278
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,340
It's dangerous to meet people like that. Let's go together. It's dangerous.

279
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,280
I think I've met a person like that before.

280
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,640
I think I know him too.

281
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,140
He's pretty good looking. Let's go.

282
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,450
Go.Go.

283
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,820
- He's super hot!
- Really?

284
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,750
Woah!

285
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,850
I didn't know the delivery man from this chicken place was this good looking.

286
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,470
-I'm only going to get deliveries from here!
-He's from Geumdo High!

287
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,720
You're so handsome!

288
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,980
I hear that a lot.

289
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,000
Please order more from now on!

290
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,830
Okay!

291
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,510
- Good bye.
- Bye!

292
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:10,130
Who are those girls? Are you excited?

293
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,350
You must be in a good mood.

294
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,660
Are you jealous?

295
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,790
No I'm not.

296
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,390
Hey,hey,hey. It's true that you are jealous.

297
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,580
You're jealous. Are you mad that cute girls are falling all over me?

298
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,910
Does that make you angry?

299
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,410
If they're cute or don't have ears, just meet up with them!

300
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:34,350
Meet up with them! Just go! Go!

301
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,700
Is that all you can say?

302
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,020
Hey! Because of who am I now delivering?

303
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:48,430
I wanted to see you. I wanted to keep you by my side and see you.

304
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,760
Yes! I'm going to look at this by myself.

305
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,430
Hey!

306
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,730
-Why? why?
- Give it to me!

307
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,750
Give it to me!

308
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,530
What's wrong?

309
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,920
Why is it like this?

310
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,550
Can you get off?

311
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,380
What's going on. I can't start the engine.

312
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,620
Aish!

313
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,920
We don't have this in the nation. It might take a while to ship it from abroad.

314
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,420
Hurry!

315
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,660
You can quickly fix it for me, right?

316
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,960
The fastest it'll take will be three days.

317
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,080
Look around while I try calling them.

318
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,130
Thank you, Hyung.

319
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,730
Long time no visit.

320
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,100
Hey, these are so cool! They all look different.

321
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,650
Of course. The model is different for each.

322
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,670
This is the real man's motorcycle.

323
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,040
This was made when the engine first came out in 1909.

324
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,670
Ever since the angle is 45 degrees.

325
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,710
By the way, you've probably seen this before.

326
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:15,780
These guys in leather jacket ride them like this in the summer.

327
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,270
AH! This!?

328
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,190
Why?

329
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,620
Is it "Are you Mi Shik?" thing that was famous long ago?

330
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,370
Who is Mi Shik? Your friend?

331
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,680
I guess he is my friend..

332
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,620
Woah.

333
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,470
This is very cool. Each part is made by hand.

334
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,160
Really..

335
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,630
There is a flaw though.

336
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,620
If I had made this, I would've raised the saddle a little bit to make it edgy.

337
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:59,420
And I would lower the handlebar, and overall make the motorcycle-

338
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,660
Then, the overall balance collapses..

339
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:53,500
By the way, you know motorcycles very well.

340
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,890
I was interested in them in the past.

341
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,630
I was curious.

342
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:14,590
To be honest, I can't really ride buses after that incident.

343
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:22,160
I thought I overcame the fear externally. But it was that I've stored it in another cabinet all along.

344
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,970
That scar. I was too scared to face it.

345
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:33,240
So I was curious as to how you

346
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,290
were able to ride motorcycles again.

347
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,300
I know right.

348
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,480
I thought of the motorcycle as Joong Ki.

349
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,050
I learned to ride motorcycle because of Joon Gi.

350
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:55,410
I was able to dream of becoming a motorcycle designer because of him.

351
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,070
I see.

352
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,780
After what happened to Joon Gi,

353
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,020
I was too scared to ride motorcycles for a while.

354
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,330
I really couldn't ride it anymore.

355
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:23,850
But, It felt like I was abandoning Joon Gi by not riding it.

356
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:32,160
Times spent with Joon Gi memories, and all.

357
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,670
So I just rode it.

358
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:42,100
When I was riding my motorcycle it was like I was there with Joon Gi.

359
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,560
Why did you give up on your dream?

360
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:55,750
Riding motorcycles and designing them. You can dream of both of those things.

361
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,760
A dream.

362
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,740
At some point I no longer understood what it meant to have a dream.

363
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,460
If my dream came true would I be happy?

364
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,480
How would my life change?

365
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:25,780
Well, I don't know about that stuff either.

366
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:33,490
I just want you to do something...

367
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:41,100
that makes your heart flutter, makes you excited, and makes you feel pleasant.

368
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,970
I just wish you'd do that.

369
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm already doing that though.

370
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:01,560
Did you get another dream?

371
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:10,620
I told you already. My heart flutters. I feel excited and pleasant when I see you.

372
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,020
Then does that mean you're my dream?

373
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,120
Eat, eat.

374
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,980
Beef and abalone. Our household can't afford that.

375
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,430
Mom, don't you think our home conditions would improve?

376
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:45,260
What if I suddenly get a job at some public enterprise?

377
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,660
You dream big.

378
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,510
I don't wish for a big company. I would like you to get a job at the neighborhood government office.

379
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,990
Ah really, just wait and see.

380
00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:02,550
Who knows? Our son might get a job after working together with me!

381
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,760
What are you saying? What do you mean get a job after working together with you?

382
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,360
Don't worry and eat this expensive abalone.

383
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,240
Ah, it's big.

384
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,450
You eat too, Eun Ho. Have more.

385
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,880
It's so delicious!

386
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,800
It's yummy, right? As expected from my dad!

387
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,100
Just as you don't forget Joon Gi, I hope you won't forget your dream either.

388
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:43,690
Just as you don't forget Joon Gi, I hope you won't forget your dream either.

389
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,700
You. This is super expensive.

390
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:52,120
So, work hard as though you're going to war

391
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,860
try your best, and dream.

392
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,420
She increasingly makes me crazy.

393
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,800
Did you fight with Hong Nam Joo?
Mind your own business.

394
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,060
I am minding my own business. But what can I do when I can just keenly feel it?

395
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:00,890
Then how about you? When are you going to turn yourself in for being X?

396
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,930
You don't have that kind of courage, right?

397
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:10,720
Ra Eun Ho needs to quickly find out how selfish you are.

398
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,190
Being selfish is better than being trash.

399
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,060
Get out of the way.

400
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,860
Are you crazy?
You hit me?

401
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,120
Stop!

402
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,370
All... of this?

403
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:00,900
One that's the school president steals the test answers.

404
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:07,740
The other is the Chairman's son and commits corruption.

405
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:12,060
Now the two of you are even fighting?

406
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,310
Before you get more demerits,

407
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,300
I'll give you a chance to cut them all at once.

408
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,320
I will slowly cut them down.

409
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,660
Do it once like a man. Starting from this art room,

410
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:39,800
I expect that the science room, lunch room and the store room are all meticulously cleaned!

411
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,940
Teacher... do I have to do it with him?

412
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:49,240
Certainly, in a group of two with joint responsibility!

413
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,840
I don't think he'll help with cleaning at all.

414
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,500
Who should be talking?

415
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,910
Keep your mouth heavy and your hands fast. (Saying: Keep quiet and work quickly.)

416
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,480
Starting from now. Begin!

417
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:15,160
Every so often try and reconcile.

418
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,850
Give it a shot.

419
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,020
What is he saying?

420
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,930
What are you staring at?

421
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,020
You..

422
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,890
Oh, sorry.

423
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,890
To the left over there.

424
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,600
The left.
Not this way, but my left you dumbo!
Hey!

425
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,240
Hey!

426
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,690
Do you think the world revolves around you?

427
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,460
Why do I have to choose left and right from your perspective?

428
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,530
Shut up and move this.

429
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,060
You should just cooperate.

430
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,050
Art department, Hyeon Tae Woon.

431
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,500
What are you doing?

432
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,570
Bring the Teacher.

433
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,850
Oh. Okay.

434
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,490
Are you worried about Ra Eun Ho a lot?

435
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:45,490
I get so annoyed when she gets hurt. It's not like I'm the one who gets hurt instead of her.

436
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,660
Kim Hui Chan.

437
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,340
Have you sorted out Kim Hui Chan? Are you putting it off?

438
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:14,310
Well... since I hung out with him here and there, I know some of his weaknesses.

439
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,820
Kim Hee Chan, that psycho.

440
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,240
I feel like something big is going to happen. It's way too quiet these days.

441
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,460
That's right.

442
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,360
The probability of this punk being X is the highest.

443
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,870
I finally see the answer!

444
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,890
Principal.

445
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:59,680
Hui Chan. What's up for you to come all the way here?

446
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:09,550
It's because I have a conclusive clue to who X is.

447
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,950
A conclusive clue on X?

448
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,420
Yes.

449
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,850
A girl named Ra Eun Ho is drawing webtoons?

450
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:27,560
Yes. It's a webtoon on student X.

451
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:33,430
This is content that someone couldn't have drawn without knowing X.

452
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:42,120
If you reinstate me as principal, I will catch X with a week for sure.

453
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:47,210
You're saying you just caught the tail, right?

454
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,590
Yes.

455
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:04,860
Dae Hwi. Are you going home right now?

456
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,200
Get in. Let's go together.

457
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,410
I'm okay. I'll walk.

458
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,490
Hey. Why are you following me?

459
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:47,150
Am I crazy to follow you? I'm going home, home.

460
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,530
Home?

461
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,210
Hey, your home isn't in this direction.

462
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,420
It's not in this direction...

463
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,120
But anyway, this direction seems good too.

464
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:15,550
You... that... what about your motorcycle?

465
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,710
Since I've been recklessly riding it around, it says that it hurts.

466
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:24,220
If it needs to be fixed, it should be fixed in time, so that there's no issues.

467
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,640
Hey, where are you really going?

468
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,950
I'm going home, home.

469
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,190
You said your home is that way.

470
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:35,340
I'll find my way! I wanted to go this way today.

471
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,220
Drink up.

472
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,170
Yeong Geon, are you going to keep being absent without notice? You will really be kicked out like that.

473
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,120
Then just kick me out.

474
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,560
What?

475
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:56,690
Even if I keep attending, I won't learn anything anyway. I will take care of my own life.

476
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,570
No...

477
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:01,760
Then, why don't you go ahead and really try something

478
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:09,810
Because you feel uneasy, you are leaving one foot in school.

479
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,670
- Because you still want to be associated with school.
- Teacher Soo Ji.

480
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,890
That's cowardly. If you're going to go to school, try your best.

481
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:22,330
If you aren't, try your best to play around or rebel.

482
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:27,730
Things worked out well then. I'll start trying to rebel properly from now on.

483
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,180
What? Where are you going?

484
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,430
Hey, Yeong Geon. Hwang Yeong Geon.

485
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,540
Did you have to speak harshly like that?

486
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,350
How can she improve if I don't?

487
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:49,520
You said when they hurt, we should hold their hands.

488
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,180
Huh? Yes, that's right.

489
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,260
I think you said that.

490
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:01,980
Hello.

491
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,960
Hello.

492
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,790
Where are you girls going?

493
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,740
What's it to you?

494
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,740
Why wouldn't I care? Next period is my class.

495
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,310
The next period is gym class.

496
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,330
Exactly.

497
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:24,630
Instead of attacking, self-protection. But to be honest, running away is the best.

498
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:28,130
Well, since learning isn't a bad thing, we'll try it once.

499
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,570
- Teacher Joon Soo.
- Yes?

500
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:34,240
Try to embrace me from behind like a real drunk.

501
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,760
Hey!

502
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,610
What kind of pervert is like this? Do it harder!

503
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,140
If I do it hard, you'll get hurt though.

504
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,240
It's okay. Harder.

505
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:09,020
Next, the pervert is running toward me.

506
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,650
What are you doing?

507
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,620
Yes, just a second. Hold on.

508
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,360
Hold it, okay.

509
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,870
Alright. Now who wants to try first?

510
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,940
Hwang Yeong Geon, to the front.

511
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,170
Hwang Yeong Geon, Hwang Yeong Geon.

512
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,520
Push hard, Teacher.

513
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:21,480
You have talent. You could even be a police officer. Good job.

514
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,710
I'm back from school.

515
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,160
You're crazy! You know what kind of money that was!

516
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,230
You blew away all our security deposit? Are you out of your mind?

517
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,370
It's not that...

518
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,460
Ah, Mom. We were really sure.

519
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,470
We even confirmed the identification card of the official. How can you not believe that?

520
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:49,650
Would a conman not even prepare for that much?

521
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:54,110
You fools! You idiots! Hurry up and go get it back!

522
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,780
Oppa, you got scammed? With dad too?

523
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,900
Aigoo, my fate.

524
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:06,860
It would have better if you got that money stolen or wasted it playing around.

525
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,560
If that happened,

526
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:15,830
Since it would have been spent on our family, it wouldn't have been such a waste.

527
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:18,150
Mom.

528
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:26,890
I know your circumstances, but if you help me once-

529
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,210
Hello?

530
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,760
Of course she just hangs up whenever I need help.

531
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,860
Mom.

532
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,320
You're upset, aren't you?

533
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:56,160
We need to change our house to a rental option.

534
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,940
You're too young to know these type of adult things.

535
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,740
Don't worry. I will take care of it.

536
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,360
What are we going to do if you break down too?

537
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:11,460
Why would I break down? Our family members are standing up firmly.

538
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,450
Quickly go study.

539
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,360
I got it, I got it.

540
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,670
Oh, it's me. Did you look into it?

541
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,710
That's right. I can even work at dawn too!

542
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:35,380
Whether it's peeling garlic or something, if you just give me work, I'll do anything.

543
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,870
Yes.

544
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,460
Your skills have just gotten to a level that's worth a shot. Why are you quitting?

545
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,310
I'm not completely quitting...

546
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:54,210
I'll register again within the next few months.

547
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:58,880
Sensation is really important. Even if you took a break for three days, you won't be able to get it back.

548
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,300
If you come after a few months, your skills will be dead then.

549
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,990
If you quit now, it's almost the end.

550
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,680
Are you going somewhere? From dawn?

551
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,080
I don't know.

552
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,570
I have to do something. I'll try for today.

553
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,980
Or I'll quit.

554
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,730
Have a good time at school.

555
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,750
Is he doing some physical labor or what?

556
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:48,310
Even more?

557
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:51,540
Yes. Please give me double the amount right now.

558
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:55,470
Will you be okay? A student should study too.

559
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,700
I'm okay. I'll just quickly do it.

560
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:04,850
♫ Like fluttering in the wind  ♫

561
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,550
I don't want to go to tutoring. I'm dying.

562
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,530
My mom signed me up for more lessons.

563
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:13,060
♫ Even my shaky mind can take a break  ♫

564
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:21,530
♫  Even my scattered dreams ♫

565
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:28,900
♫ are bearing a tough day today ♫

566
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,050
♫ Like the time  ♫

567
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:44,390
♫  like the painful time  ♫

568
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:53,100
♫ The white winter also which is piled up with sorrow ♫

569
00:53:53,110 --> 00:54:00,490
♫ Just as the flowers bloom when spring arrives  ♫

570
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:05,220
Why are you taking so many things? Like you're not going to come back here again?

571
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:09,930
For the time being, I'll be busy, so I don't think I can come here often.

572
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,440
Why? What's wrong?

573
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,650
At home,

574
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,540
My computer broke too.

575
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:24,120
I'll take this opportunity to take a break from drawing webtoons and learn about life instead.

576
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,150
How can I learn anything about the world in this tiny place?

577
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:31,710
If I want to draw webtoons well in the future, I should experience the world a bit too.

578
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:37,160
Hey! So you're not going to come back here again?

579
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,710
I will. I will come...

580
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:45,590
but I just can't come for the moment.

581
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,490
Noona's a bit busy.

582
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:52,050
I have to work a lot of part time jobs too.

583
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,400
♫  Even though the winter was cold with frozen tears  ♫

584
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:06,150
♫ When spring arrives the flowers bloom ♫

585
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,780
I'll do it for you quickly.

586
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,210
Please do it quickly.

587
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,370
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

588
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,510
Here?

589
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,140
Beside it.

590
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,990
No, no! To the left.

591
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,400
To the left! The left!

592
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,000
No!

593
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,980
Why are you not paying close attention?

594
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,990
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

595
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,950
♬  When spring arrives and the flowers bloom. ♬

596
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:42,150
Hey. I searched through all of the convenience stores in this neighborhood.

597
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:56,640
Why are you suddenly working part-time? It's hard working at the convenience store.

598
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,550
I told you already. To experience life a bit.

599
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:04,650
What kind of high-schooler experiences life so harshly?

600
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,380
A high-schooler usually does this kind of part-time job

601
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,320
You probably haven't thought of it even once though.

602
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,060
Don't work part-time.

603
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:18,470
It's hard, and it takes so much time from you drawing webtoons.

604
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
You don't have time to study either.

605
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,960
I also know about it.

606
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,400
So don't do it.

607
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,810
I don't want to do it either.

608
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:32,720
But I'm not doing it because I can't not do it.

609
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,760
Do you think everything's as comfortable for me as it is for you?

610
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,580
Hey, Ra Eun Ho. W-why are you like this?

611
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,950
Are you not going to draw webtoons? You said it was your dream.

612
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:46,070
But why are you here wasting time like this?

613
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,250
I'm sorry, but...

614
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:59,170
Something happened in my house, so I can't so freely...

615
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:03,630
So... my computer broke.

616
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,800
So I can't keep drawing webtoons either... never mind.

617
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,300
Nevermind.

618
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,910
Can't you just leave me alone?

619
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,450
I'm sorry. I'm going to leave first.

620
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,670
You like honesty. right?

621
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:42,340
So it probably doesn't matter to you even if your ex-girlfriend's pride is crushed.

622
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,530
Drink this.

623
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,080
Can I perhaps get your number?

624
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,450
She's my girlfriend.

625
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,150
Ah, I'm sorry.

626
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:31,770
Sit in front. This will be uncomfortable for you studying.

627
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,920
No. I'll sit next to you today.

628
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,850
Aigoo, my boyfriend's so dependable.

629
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:46,780
You... it's because you're so pretty!

630
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,520
Every time I leave, it bothers me.

631
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:56,000
Starting from tomorrow, wear glasses, a mask, and a hat.

632
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,300
Go around like that.

633
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,860
Huh?

634
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:52,460
Did you get another dream?

635
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,520
I told you, my heart flutters.

636
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,750
My heart flutters and I feel pleasant when I see you.

637
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:03,820
Then does that mean you're my dream?

638
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:09,330
♬ I can't reach you because you're too far away. ♬

639
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,390
♬  Because I can't do anything except look and watch ♬

640
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:18,960
♬ Having tried to coax and calm it ♬

641
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:26,980
♬ my heart already only wants you♬

642
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:34,750
♬Hope carries me to you ♬

643
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:39,640
♬Even though this love which might hurt love ♬

644
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,560
After she told me to never give up...

645
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,380
♬ To me like that time (a habit)is exhausting (like that) and not worthy of you♬

646
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:54,620
♬  To me like that time (a habit)♬

647
01:00:54,620 --> 01:01:00,120
♬  which hurt so much you fill my eyes. ♬

648
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:06,780
♫ In every situation, it can't be with you not there ♫

649
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:11,010
♫ I won't let you go  ♫

650
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:15,850
♫ Even if wishing is hopeless ♫

651
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:25,900
It's not like someone is going to die tomorrow or the sky is going to fall down.

652
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,630
What is so hard for you?

653
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,780
You said your computer broke so you can't draw webtoons.

654
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,290
Then draw with this.

655
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:51,180
Then you... you don't have to work part-time right?

656
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,820
What is so easy for you?

657
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,750
What?

658
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:09,650
Another person's hurt, pride, and hard work...

659
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,280
is it all so easy?

660
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:19,500
Who are you to make my pride and dream into something so easy?

661
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:27,800
I didn't mean that. I just wanted to help you.

662
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:35,060
All the dreams in the world... don't get protected so easily like yours, Tae Woon.

663
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:42,680
I'm saying that what I need right now... is not your generosity.

664
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:45,250
Hey, Ra Eun Ho.

665
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:50,060
So Tae Woon... don't appear in front of me ever again.

666
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,870
Approaching me is banned.

667
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,920
Don't worry or meddle into my business.

668
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,600
This is my answer

669
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,500
to your confession.

670
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:29,150
♫ As much as I am young, you too are young ♫

671
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:35,810
♫ During that time I forgot again and made it difficult for you ♫

672
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:41,190
♫ I pray for you, to you ♫

673
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:44,360
♫ I want to convey I'm sorry  ♫

674
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:48,230
♫ Pray for you. Always  ♫

675
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:52,350
♫ This was not my sincerity, Oh ♫

676
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:59,120
♫ Because it was very sad you didn't know me ♫

677
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:04,520
♫ Actually you too were probably hurting a lot ♫

678
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,380
♫ I'm still far from it.  ♫

679
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,930
School 2017

680
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:15,050
Just think about what you want to do.

681
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:18,240
How can I dream and draw my future?

682
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,250
Were you dumped by Ra Eun Ho?

683
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:27,000
That's why Ra Eun Ho can't endure it.

684
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,200
You can be reinstated tomorrow.

685
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:39,400
I'll find concrete evidence that X is Hyeon Tae Woon. It'll be the end for him.

686
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,270
I came here because I wanted to protect your dream.

687
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:50,300
♫ And I miss you, my love ♫
