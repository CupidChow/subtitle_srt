1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,300
Mind your own business.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:12,010
You cowardly ruined a life of a poor girl by threatening her,

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,780
but then you act innocent, kind, and righteous

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,750
in front of everyone else

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,810
Are you having fun?

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,540
Our student president's real face.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,780
I told you to mind your own business.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,940
I'm not going to get involved in this problem anyway.

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,290
I am not going to let what happened to Seo Bo Ra reoccur again.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,820
You're going to be killed by me if you get Ra Eun Ho involved.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,860
Kim Hui Chan

12
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,530
The number you've called is not answering.

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,040
Yes, Teacher.

14
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,670
Hui Chan, are you really going to be like this?

15
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,270
I'm sorry. My lawyer will be talking on my behalf anyway.

16
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,270
So I don't see a point of saying anything right now.

17
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,980
What is your lawyer going to talk about with me?

18
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,770
Did your lawyer fight with me?

19
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,850
What you should be saying is so simple. That you pushed me.

20
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,270
You only need to admit that!

21
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,370
I can't admit it and that's why I am here right now.

22
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,890
Hui Chan, what about just talk about it frankly among friends?

23
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,670
Your action might have occurred because you were too emotional.

24
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,470
If that's what it is, you can just simply apologize.

25
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,710
Teacher, do you think this an elementary school where an apology will be enough?

26
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,170
Why do you think there is school violence?

27
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,200
Do you really have to do this among friends?

28
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,110
I'm sorry, but I have tutoring for exam.

29
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,840
No, you can't leave.

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,630
I'm also fact-finding about this school violence.

31
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,690
So you may leave to go to tutoring or academy after the investigation.

32
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,220
And I also think that today's time will be much more important to your life

33
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,130
than tutoring or exam.

34
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:48,310
School 2017: How to endure the weight.

35
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,300
Ready Raw!
Episode 10

36
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,300
I'm finished.

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,430
I'm finished checking all the anticipated questions for the final exam.

38
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,930
Aish. I said I got it.

39
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,190
Are you not going to check them?

40
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,810
Whatever. You probably got them all checked.

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,180
I'm leaving.

42
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,650
What are you going to do with Ra Eun Ho?

43
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,180
Don't let her get in my way anymore.

44
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,420
I can't convince her.

45
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,910
Why can't you convince her?

46
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,610
You convinced Seo Bo Ra in the past.

47
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,900
It would be easy this time as well.

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,780
Even if you tried, you can't do anything. Don't you know Kim Hui Chan?

49
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,350
I know. That's why I am not giving up.

50
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,730
Bo Ra, only you will be hurt in the end.

51
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,860
How much more would I be hurt from now? How much is there here?

52
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,940
Kim Hui Chan told me to give this to you and to tell you that

53
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,890
He was just too emotional at the moment, and he feels sorry.

54
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,460
Kim Hui Chan told you to lie to me like that?

55
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,230
If he's that sorry, why is he not apologizing to me once?

56
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,150
Why is he not showing up in front of me once?

57
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,280
It's just a small fight.

58
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,730
Please handle it since I'm already at the hospit ...-

59
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,750
Hospital.

60
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,590
What is this?

61
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,430
Hyeon Tae Woon.

62
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,580
Can you deliver this to your friend, Song Dae Hwi?

63
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,740
Also tell him to live well by demolishing all of his soul and conscience.

64
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,070
What does this all mean?

65
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,700
Kim Hui Chan?

66
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,210
You're so embarrassing, bastard.

67
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,090
This is a special summer program at Seoul University.

68
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,680
This is a membership card. So please convince Ra Eun Ho.

69
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,980
Seoul University Special Summer Program

70
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,230
Even if you don't convince her, you'd be winning anyway.

71
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,050
But things will get really complicated.

72
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,540
Seo Bo Ra will get involved, and Ra Eun Ho might spread something.

73
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,810
Ra Eun Ho is not a type of person to do that.

74
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,790
Consider it carefully.

75
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,150
How can each one of you lack such refinement?

76
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,890
I'll say this bluntly. Just apologize, then we will be done.

77
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,260
So you're going to apologize?

78
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,830
No. Make Ra Eun Ho apologize.

79
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,680
Then we won't report it as school violence and we'll simply let go of this problem.

80
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,040
Our Hui Chan's final exam is coming up and I also do not want to be stressed over this menial matter.

81
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,740
Honey, am I the only one hearing a dog barking somewhere?

82
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,640
Right I hear it too. Did our neighbor ever have a dog?

83
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,410
You two. Your statement has become defamation.

84
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,720
But why is it a defamation when they didn't relate it to her?

85
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,550
They just said a dog was barking.

86
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,520
I thought you were a lawyer. Do you not know much about laws?

87
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,470
I'm back from school.

88
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,180
Eun Ho.

89
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,650
Do you want to experience something scary?

90
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,260
We're confident about it.

91
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,100
We are confident about dragging it all the way to the end and getting Eun Ho punished.

92
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,670
Are you really that confident?

93
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,710
I'm also confident to prove that Kim Hui Chan hit me.

94
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,590
Oh my my. Look at her!

95
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,200
This girl has no manners.

96
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,480
What's wrong with her saying what she's supposed to say?

97
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,020
Just know that I'm never going to back down.

98
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,540
Also, don't shame yourself by

99
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,030
coming to my house and doing this.

100
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,620
Oh my goodness!

101
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,300
Do you want me to escort you on your way out?

102
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,860
Good bye.

103
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,960
We usually don't escort people out.

104
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,060
Ra Eun Ho

105
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,840
This is really sudden.

106
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,550
Well..Partly because I failed to keep my promise of buying you shaved ice last time.

107
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,480
That's why.

108
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,020
Did you just remember that?

109
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,720
My thinking was really confused anyway.

110
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,670
And I wanted to eat ice cream too.

111
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,290
Thank you.

112
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,220
Do you have a lot to worry about?

113
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,840
I didn't want to lie.

114
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:44,020
To be honest, I have so many worries.

115
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,290
And I have a pain in my heart.

116
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,090
I understand.

117
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,360
What about you?

118
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,750
Are you alright these days?

119
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,410
How are things going with Nam Joo?

120
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,150
These days..

121
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,160
It's really not okay.

122
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,450
We're only 18,

123
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,160
but our life kinda sucks.

124
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,430
I know right.

125
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,480
But, Ra Eun Ho,

126
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,800
Well. Perhaps..

127
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,630
Perhaps..

128
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,030
Nevermind.

129
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,140
But,Daehwi,

130
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,590
why is Bo Ra like this?

131
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,400
She definitely saw everything, but she's not saying anything,

132
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,300
so what happened between her and Hui Chan?

133
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,430
The number you've called is not answering

134
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,890
The number you've called is not answering

135
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,180
Be serious. You're always joking.

136
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,560
I meant it.

137
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,850
Hey, even just as a joke, can't you ask me if I can do it well?

138
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,050
Did you come here to persuade Ra Eun Ho?

139
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,290
You don't need to know.

140
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,250
I warned you, bastard.

141
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,060
I warned you you'd be killed by me if you try to pull something on Ra Eun Ho like you did in the past.

142
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,270
Are you making me trash again?

143
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,440
If you guys fight today, I'm not going to see any of you in the future.

144
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,380
I'll leave first, don't worry too much.

145
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,600
Song Dae Hwi.

146
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,380
Bye.

147
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,680
You're so affectionate. Very affectionate.

148
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,310
Do you really have to say it like that?

149
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,700
But, why are you here so late?

150
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,180
What did he say?

151
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,690
I asked why are you here so late.

152
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,500
I came because I knew you'd be doing this, talking with another man.

153
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,530
Go ahead and laugh and meet eyes with another man again.

154
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,030
Do you want your eyes to meet my fist?

155
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,460
Like this? If you can, try.

156
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,100
What, you wanna go at it?

157
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,790
What are you doing!

158
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,720
Hey! Hey!

159
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,220
-I think I just..
-Are you okay? I'm sorry.

160
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,870
Stop, stop!

161
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,850
Don't block me.

162
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,100
Seoul University Special Summer Program

163
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,100
Stay right there.

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,210
Oh, you did well. You did well. Are you okay?

165
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,950
Should I just give up on the school violence issue?

166
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,700
If I just apologize to Kim Hui Chan, then nothing will happen and it'll end.

167
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,080
Are you the Ra Eun Ho I know?

168
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,030
Why would you, who did nothing wrong, apologize to Hui Chan?

169
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,110
Are you crazy? Are you sick?

170
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,030
It's probably just because it's my fault.

171
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,990
Our family is in a mess.

172
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,760
They are going crazy saying that they will sell the house in order to pay for a lawyer and fight.

173
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,210
It's your family so of course they'd do that.

174
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,950
But,

175
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,480
my heart really hurts.

176
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,110
Why am I always like this?

177
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,510
I just don't want to see my family suffering anymore.

178
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,330
So what? You'll give up now?

179
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,470
There's nothing I can do about it.

180
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:35,060
If I keep going, we'll end up in court.

181
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,850
Even if you give up, I won't ever give up.

182
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,530
I can't see you suffering for no reason.

183
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,530
I'm not going to make you fight alone, or make you lonely by yourself.

184
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,270
So,

185
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,930
trust me,

186
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,770
and let's gather our strength and fight, together.

187
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,130
Can we really do that? Till the end?

188
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,400
Where did she go?

189
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,180
The boastful Ra Eun Ho who fight's even when she bleeds?

190
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,790
I like that Ra Eun Ho.

191
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,570
I said don't smile like that! It makes me nervous!

192
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,780
Look at it! My heart is going crazy!

193
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,190
Be strong.

194
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,470
Bo Ra,

195
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,200
you still don't have any intention to be a witness?

196
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,860
Sorry.

197
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,820
I really don't want to be involved in this stuff anymore.

198
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,850
Eun Ho, you should give up too, you can't beat him.

199
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:14,800
No. I will somehow redress unfairness to me.

200
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,370
If you feel that my efforts are credible,

201
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,940
then, be the witness for me, you must.

202
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,150
What are you doing here?

203
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,640
Bo Ra,

204
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,020
Why did you come here?

205
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,600
I told you, I'm not giving up.

206
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,020
I can't seem to understand why you were punished

207
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,840
because of the school violence issue in the past. You probably have a reason.

208
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,470
I don't have anything like that.

209
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,230
Bo Ra, can't you just trust me and tell me the truth?

210
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,610
Teacher, I don't trust any teachers anymore.

211
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,590
I'll leave now.

212
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,260
Bo Ra...

213
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,370
Attention, Kim Hui Chan.

214
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,900
Isn't it too much to write his name?

215
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,650
What about it?

216
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,850
That's not it.

217
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,150
No.

218
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,340
You're definitely Ra Eun Ho yourself whenever you fight a bloody battle.

219
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,900
If people overhear, they're going to think I'm achieving some victory at a battle or something.

220
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,800
What do you mean a bloody battle?

221
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,570
At least I inherited my parents' confidence for sure.

222
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,660
You've inherited way too much of that. Definitely.

223
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,520
You wanna die?

224
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,510
How should I die? I should die while fighting a bloody battke,

225
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,300
No matter how much I think, there needs to be more impact.

226
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,400
Impact...then think about it.

227
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,290
Is there nothing else?

228
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,980
Hey, you ... you're pretty good at drawing.

229
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,370
Wow, I'm handsome, and my drawing skills are nice,

230
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,760
whichever girl has become friends with me

231
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,510
probably saved the universe in her past life.

232
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,150
To you whom are lying without any shame.

233
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,770
09 (Yeong Gu)

234
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,370
To you whom are lying without any shame.

235
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,470
Ra Eun Ho.

236
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,390
Eun Pal! Eun Pal!

237
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,720
The handwritten poster! The poster is dae bak!

238
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,220
To some, they say that you met good parents.

239
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,570
But, I'm not envious.

240
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,210
Of your brazen face nor taking shortcuts which mock justice.

241
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,520
Rather, I am now thankful.

242
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,120
Because of you, you can tell how much my life shined.

243
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,340
I don't succumb to injustice.

244
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,160
I was able to fight together with my friends,

245
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,830
So I'm happier and prouder.

246
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,030
To you whom are lying without any shame.

247
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,040
Woah! The handwriting!

248
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,370
Woah! Ra Eun Ho!

249
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,910
Why? Her handwriting is just pretty.

250
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,500
Whose signature is this?

251
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,170
Nine. Nine. Sixty? Class number?

252
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,690
Why did someone scribble there?

253
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,730
I've liked you for a long time. Fighting!

254
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,360
A moment!

255
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,270
I'll be checking for your hand-writing everyone.

256
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,960
Continue what you were doing, ok?

257
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,760
Give it back!

258
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,860
Okay, it's not you!

259
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,650
Wait, wait!

260
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,880
Move, move.

261
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,030
You really have to work on your handwriting.

262
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,010
Today's lunch menu

263
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,390
Carbonara..

264
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,810
Why are you hiding?

265
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,180
Whose note is it?

266
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,250
Byeong Goo?

267
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,600
Pass!

268
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,780
Ji Yong, come here!

269
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,200
Is this it for this room?

270
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,550
Onto the next room!

271
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,270
What are you?

272
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,340
I don't want to make you uncomfortable in anyway, but I hope this cheers you on.

273
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,510
Anyway, thanks.

274
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,400
What are you thankful for? Is it you?

275
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,420
Are you the one who confessed to her? My Eun Ho likes lemonade.

276
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,690
How did you confess when you don't even know the basics?

277
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,790
What is your problem when I just want to care for her?

278
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:04,690
Why do you care for her? Especially when she's having a hard time, why are you caring for her?

279
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,200
Ra Eun Ho has so many other guys who care for her. What?

280
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:14,070
She has many guys?

281
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,360
Yes.

282
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,630
Stop it. Let's stop.

283
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,940
Recently, a really good-looking guy confessed to her.

284
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,960
Mind your business because she has so many guys who can care for her even if you didn't.

285
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,590
Don't listen to what he just said.

286
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,830
Thanks for this. I'll see you later.

287
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,690
Why shouldn't he listen to me?

288
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,490
Why are you seeing him later? Don't meet him!

289
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,770
Stop it!

290
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,710
What did he say? Since when did he like you? When?

291
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,500
He said he likes everything about me. From my head to toes.

292
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,100
That bastard has high standards. Are you happy he gifted you?

293
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,610
He looks extremely feminine.

294
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:05,930
Hey, he gets so many calls from agencies.

295
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,730
Do you know why? Because he is super good looking.

296
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,910
All the good looking guys are dead to me.

297
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,950
I should make a rule so no one confesses to you.

298
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,370
Starting from tomorrow, should I threaten all of them?

299
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,600
Hey. How do you come up with stuff that no one else is normally able to think about?

300
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,770
Aren't I petty?

301
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,280
Perhaps, what if other guys besides him all..

302
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,340
decide to confess to you?

303
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,550
I'm not that special.

304
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,020
What do you mean you aren't special?

305
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,090
You say that you can't even be late for even a minute because the students will go insane. Your crazy presence.

306
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,920
My presence is crazy.

307
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,250
Oh. Hey!

308
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,930
I think I've heard of it somewhere.

309
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,530
You're good at remembering such things.

310
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,140
Wh-what?

311
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,620
Go in. Hurry and go.

312
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,320
-Good bye.
- I'm going to leave after I see you going in.

313
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,450
Hurry in!

314
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,520
Could this bastard have followed her home?

315
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,920
That bastard.

316
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,240
Nam Joo: Let's talk for a little.

317
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,860
Do you still have something left to say?

318
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,460
I'll just ask you one thing.

319
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,780
Why did you meet me?

320
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:01,760
I always wanted to ask you why such a cold person like you

321
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,190
even met me.

322
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,900
I didn't have any courage.

323
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,490
I met you because I liked you.

324
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,950
But ever since,

325
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,470
your lies made me start to doubt you.

326
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,670
my feelings toward you changed.

327
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,130
I'm sorry.

328
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,860
If you didn't have any feelings for me, you should've stopped meeting me.

329
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,000
Why did you continue to meet me?

330
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,390
Because I didn't want to believe it.

331
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,050
You. who cotinually lied to me

332
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,970
just like me

333
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,880
because you also looked exhausted.

334
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,740
- Excuse me, Teacher Jang.
- What is it again?

335
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,250
During the 1st year, did you perhaps have an issue with Bo Ra?

336
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,390
No.

337
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,100
- Why are you asking this all of a sudden?
- So...

338
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,030
Because it seems that Bo Ra is avoiding you.

339
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,330
So, are you saying that I did something wrong?

340
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,280
It is a little odd that she said she didn't know anything despite the fact that the whole situation was very clear.

341
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,530
Also, she easily admitted that she abused Bit Na. There's definite something abnormal about this.

342
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,700
It seems that the student is particularly uncomfortable around you.

343
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,170
So I was just wondering if there might have been any misunderstanding between you and Bo Ra.

344
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,940
Did you like every teacher while you were attending school?

345
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,860
What?

346
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,360
There was no misunderstanding. And I don't really want to become a popular teacher.

347
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,440
So, I wish that you would stop asking me questions.

348
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,930
Teacher, still. I don't know about other things but Bo Ra became a perpetrator unfairly because of Bit Na.

349
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:43,150
You can at least help us with that. So if you have seen anything, please tell-

350
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,920
I really didn't see anything clearly!

351
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,690
-Evidence?
-Yes, that's what I know.

352
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:03,110
That's what I heard after I was assigned to work here and was being educated.

353
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,790
So even the deleted documents would be stored for at least two years.

354
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,830
That's right. But there's a code for that.

355
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:16,330
So you'd have to check each of them individually. Additionally, there are way too many documents.

356
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,660
There's definitely Bo Ra's past counseling record in that document.

357
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,630
Wait, I found it. I found it!

358
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,690
Added: After additional meetings with Hui Chan, a different story was found.

359
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,700
Bo Ra's incident was not a unilateral assault.

360
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,470
Bo Ra also committed verbal and mental violence to Hui Chan. Testimony from two friends are attached.

361
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,700
Counseling Record

362
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,600
How can you do this?

363
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,940
Bo Ra probably trusted you enough to talk about her difficulties.

364
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:39,060
That was only Seo Bo Ra's perspective. Hui Chan's side of story was different.

365
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,240
So did you even investigate about it properly?

366
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,050
Of course. I investigated properly.

367
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:49,990
The first counseling record and the additional record has a difference of only a day when they were written.

368
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:55,570
So you're saying you figured out the perpetrator, witness, and the victim in a day.

369
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,900
In fact, the result was 180 degrees flipped.

370
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,990
Was I not allowed to do that? We're not some police officers.

371
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:07,090
We can't solve anything out by listening to every individual. Are teachers some sinners?

372
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:12,000
Teacher Jang, why did you even become a teacher then?

373
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,540
Is it because the job is great and stable?

374
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,660
Teacher Sim! I think you're going too far.

375
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,760
Even if that was the case, you shouldn't have done that.

376
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,190
If you really concealed the case or changed a lie to a fact,

377
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,720
then I wouldn't be able to forgive you, Teacher Jang.

378
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,850
I'm definitely going to uncover the truth from Bit Na's school violence issue to Hee Chan's violence case from last year.

379
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,540
I'm fine.

380
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,890
It's raining. Use the umbrella as you go.

381
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,610
There's a different meaning behind you doing this.

382
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,730
There isn't.

383
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:51,910
Why do you tend to close yourself up and

384
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:55,000
make others mourn for you?

385
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,300
What do you know?
Yea.

386
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,060
I don't know.

387
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,760
I don't know why you've closed your heart so much,

388
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,470
or why you're having such a hard time. I don't know anything.

389
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,540
But... I've thought about it.

390
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,550
How hard it must have been...

391
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,160
for you alone.

392
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,920
How lonely...

393
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,500
you must have felt.

394
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,440
Then just leave. Don't mind me.

395
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,080
That's why I'm saying we should do this together.

396
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,980
It might be hard for you by yourself,

397
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,590
but if we're together, there might be another way.

398
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,260
I'll...

399
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,910
take care of my own business.

400
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,770
- You don't need to know.
No.

401
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,170
I need to find out.

402
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,990
Testify? Don't do it. You don't have to.

403
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,790
Let's just be friends.

404
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,820
Let's eat delicious food together,

405
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,120
and listen to each other's concerns.

406
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,560
Let's be the kind of friends that can laugh over little things.

407
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,920
♫ A tough day to bear ♫

408
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,730
I...

409
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,510
don't believe in those things.

410
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,680
Friends... Friendship...

411
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,670
People saying they'll protect me.

412
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,400
So you shouldn't appear in front of me ever again.

413
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:38,760
♫ The white winter also which is piled up with sorrow ♫

414
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:48,820
♫  when spring arrives and the flowers bloom will pass. ♫

415
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,700
What do you want?

416
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,700
It's raining.

417
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:15,610
♫ With your frangrance leaving ♫

418
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:24,770
♫ Today again is a day of shedding tears ♫

419
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:37,650
♫ Like parting from a love from long ago ♫

420
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:47,020
♫ Even though the winter was cold with frozen tears ♫

421
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:57,750
♫  when spring arrives and the flowers bloom. ♫

422
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:05,710
♫ Let's go home. ♫

423
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,150
Bo Ra!

424
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,280
Her immune system got weaker due to an extreme stress.

425
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,660
So even if she gets discharged, she needs to take care of herself.

426
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,990
Yes. Thank you.

427
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:52,700
And among her belongings, we discovered anti-depressants.

428
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,900
She seems to have been taking it for over a year. She can't take it from now on.

429
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,290
Okay.

430
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,250
Hyun Tae Woon! Can you deliver this to your friend, Song Dae Hwi?

431
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,700
To eat and live well while selling your conscience and soul like this.

432
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,870
- Fighting!
- Have strength!

433
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,620
Kim Song; Sln Joon Gwang ...

434
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,760
Seo Bo Ra.

435
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,570
Bo Ra!

436
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,900
Thank you.

437
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,440
About what?

438
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,660
I saw it. Your name.

439
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,490
Well...

440
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:22,170
I just... well... it has no special meaning. Everyone was doing it.

441
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,900
No.

442
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,500
To me, it has a huge meaning behind it.

443
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,320
You're cheering for me.

444
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,550
People who have nothing ...

445
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,260
I don't know why they don't know their place.

446
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,100
We should have stepped on their sprout from the beginning, right?

447
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,620
Hui Chan.

448
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:00,590
Do you really not feel apologetic towards Seo Bo Ra at all?

449
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,590
What did I do wrong?

450
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,820
I've done so much for her!

451
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,100
Seo Bo Ra... after what happened,

452
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,030
she seemed to be receiving psychological treatment.

453
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,430
What does that have to do with me?

454
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,340
I'm scared.

455
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,750
About what?

456
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,300
That your image right now...

457
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,910
will be what I look like.

458
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,530
It's not your fault that things got complicated like this. So don't worry about anything.

459
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,970
You just need to prepare well for the finals.

460
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:48,660
I will take care of the rest. Got it?

461
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,890
I don't pay attention to it either.

462
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,860
By the way, there was a meeting

463
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:58,530
and it seems like the director passionately dislikes Ra Eun Ho.

464
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,890
What about her?

465
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,520
I heard Tae Woon goes around with her and gets into trouble.

466
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,290
I think he really wants to separate the two somehow through transferring or expelling.

467
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,900
X. X. X! I'm definitely going to catch you.

468
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,290
Night Duty Room

469
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,090
X is a Year 2 student?

470
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:53,060
Is this even possible!? How could the whole portfolio have gotten out?
Class 2-1 Room 12 Song Dae Hwi

471
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,430
X is in our class!

472
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,970
What?

473
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:00,180
X is in Year 2 Class 1.

474
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,230
Troublemaker Eun Ra On?

475
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,730
Then Ra Eun Ho who was the only suspect for being X...

476
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,700
if she isn't X...

477
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,680
that means she could be someone's accomplice.
 Director's son

478
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,420
And what X did recently with reporting the math contest...

479
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,290
First place of this math contest will go to Tae Woon anyway.

480
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,500
Is X the best student ... Song Dae Hwi?

481
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,940
Then X is... Song Dae Hwi?

482
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,060
Dae Hwi!

483
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,130
I've been pushing you too much lately, haven't I?

484
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,900
I'm sorry.

485
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:08,130
I don't want to be involved in your problem with Seo Bo Ra anymore.

486
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:16,520
That's why I'm thinking of asking you for a different favor...

487
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,640
Who do you think X is?

488
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,400
Who knows...

489
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,700
I have no clue at all.

490
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,890
Our class's school portfolio was leaked and

491
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,830
Ra Eun Ho who was once misunderstood for being X

492
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:34,710
is drawing webtoons about X.

493
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,520
Don't you feel anything?
Huh?

494
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,110
Oh... right.

495
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:47,390
If Ra Eun Ho wasn't framed but really is an accomplice with X...

496
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,400
I don't think it's necessary to drag it to the school violence conference.

497
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,870
She'll be expelled right away.

498
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:59,760
If what I suspect is right, there's a high chance that X is really close to Ra Eun Ho.

499
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,580
So, you should look into it.

500
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,520
There seems to be a lot on your mind these days.

501
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:15,520
The old Song Dae Hwi used to be pretty cool.

502
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,410
Student X?

503
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,510
That was fun.

504
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,530
You... saw that?

505
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,820
You publish that on public for anyone to see.

506
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,970
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

507
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:52,260
About X that appears in your webtoons... did you draw everything based on your imagination?

508
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:00,980
The idea wasn't mine... but the content was from my imagination of course.

509
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,490
It looked so realistic for something from your imagination.

510
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:09,280
Hey Kim Hui Chan. Are you saying Eun Ho is X?

511
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,130
What the... That's ancient issue.

512
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,690
Of course, Ra Eun Ho isn't X.

513
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:21,290
X is some guy who is carefree.

514
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,770
Ra Eun Ho just happens to be drawing Student X.

515
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,320
She must definitely have a model.

516
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,450
If you bother Ra Eun Ho one more time, you'll really die.

517
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,360
Notice for disciplinary punishment

518
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,060
The two even trespassed into the Teachers' Office together recently.

519
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,170
But X reported Hyeon Tae Woon...

520
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,960
X... reported Tae Woon?

521
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,920
What are these bastards looking at!

522
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,700
If that exposure was all fake, intending to disguise X himself..

523
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,220
Ra Eun Ho and X...

524
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:27,220
If this is true, this is going to get really fun.

525
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:37,960
If Ra Eun Ho wasn't framed but is actually accomplices with X...

526
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,560
I don't think it's necessary to drag it to the school violence committee,

527
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,720
because she would be expelled anyway.

528
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,350
It was so cute!

529
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,470
Lately... I've been curious about something.

530
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:11,300
What kind of type do you think X is?

531
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:16,160
They say he's in our class. Who do you think he is?

532
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,320
What kind of man keeps beating around the bush?

533
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,310
Why? You're curious to see if I'm X?

534
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:33,090
If I am, what are you going to do about it?

535
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,850
Nice.

536
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,040
What if he was just assuming?

537
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,610
You have to especially be careful of Kim Hui Chan.

538
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,510
It clearly says it on his face: 'I am a very wicked person.'

539
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,230
Then I can't come here for the time being.

540
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:24,050
Why? Are you worried about the two of us not being able to spend a cozy time together?

541
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,720
If you're like this to this extent, it's an illness.

542
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,080
Go to the hospital, please.

543
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:36,330
Anyway, it won't be bad to be careful for the time being.

544
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:40,060
Why is Kim Hui Chan suddenly trying to find X?

545
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,510
He's already so annoying.

546
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:46,120
He must be after something.

547
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,380
After something?

548
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,520
How should I put it... something important?

549
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:12,260
Oh... your eyes are totally swollen. You didn't get any sleep last night?

550
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,970
Today's the school violence committee meeting. Would you have slept well if you were in my shoes?

551
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:24,340
What kind of worry do you have to sleep like that? Everything's going to go well.

552
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,350
Don't worry. Got it?

553
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Let's go.

554
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,420
School Violence Coommittee

555
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:48,240
As a result of gathering the opinions of many committee members and teachers,

556
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,580
To take account your perspective of things...

557
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:55,420
it has been decided that there is no evidence at all.

558
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,390
Therefore, we have decided that Student Ra Eun Ho

559
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,480
is the perpetrator of this school violence incident.

560
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,430
Wait a minute!

561
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,610
So Seo Bo Ra, there isn't anything to take into account besides your testimony?

562
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:39,180
She was a student at the scene. If you don't believe a student's words-

563
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,920
I have a video that I recorded.

564
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,600
Where?

565
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,300
It's not me!

566
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,430
It is you!

567
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,650
I told you it isn't!
It can't not be you!

568
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,790
It wasn't me!

569
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:59,990
Hey!

570
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:05,140
Kim Hui Chan!

571
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,480
Come here.
No no, I'm okay.

572
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,030
In addition, I have another something to suggest.

573
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:27,140
I request to re-investigate

574
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,030
which was dealt with at last school violence committee.

575
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:58,120
Really? You told Bo Ra everything?

576
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:04,100
Since she made a difficult decision too, I wanted to show her my sincerity.

577
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,700
You're... really...

578
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,870
Do you believe me now?

579
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:38,810
If I deceive you or can't protect you, report me.

580
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:42,690
This is my sincerity that I can show you.

581
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:47,180
Hey, what are you thinking to do that?

582
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,290
You don't know?

583
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,390
I want to do well with you.

584
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:06,030
You shouldn't smile either.

585
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,820
Why?

586
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,410
Ah, don't smile.

587
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,110
Why not?

588
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,490
Ah, don't smile!

589
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,680
Why? Does your heart flutter when I smile?

590
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,130
Don't smile.
Huh?
Don't smile!

591
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,130
Why are you like this? Hey!

592
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:30,410
I am reporting Geum Do High School's school violence incident.

593
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,770
I am Seo Bo Ra of Year 2 Class 1.

594
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,030
Although I was the victim,

595
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:56,170
I became the perpetrator. So I want to report it.

596
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:00,030
What's going to change from you doing this?

597
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:03,780
What can you gain from this?

598
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,620
I'm not trying to gain anything. I just want to put back what you stole.

599
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,740
Hey, if anyone heard, they'd think all I do is bother you.

600
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:23,600
Anyhow, give up. If you don't want things to get more complicated.

601
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,500
I can't. I won't give up.

602
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,340
Are you joking? You aren't going to quit?

603
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,210
Kim Hui Chan.

604
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,170
Song Dae Hwi.

605
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,470
This is an apology that I should have done before.

606
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:03,170
It was too ... It has become too late.

607
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:07,000
I know... that you couldn't do anything about it either.

608
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,960
With the excuse of not being able to do anything, I think I came too far.

609
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:18,870
Someone said this, must you have hit rock bottom like that?

610
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:21,790
Asking if that was the only solution.

611
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,040
Someone said this,

612
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:33,350
it may be hard by yourself, but if we are together, there might be a solution.

613
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:42,470
This is probably the timing to become courageous, right?

614
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,380
You already did.

615
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:50,310
During the time it took for you to get here, thinking of how hard it must have been by yourself,

616
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:52,300
I already know.

617
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:56,380
Dae Hwi, thank you.

618
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:00,680
For saying that you are sorry even now.

619
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:08,250
Now, I too am trying to be courageous.

620
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,740
The matter is more serious than we thought.

621
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:29,810
We'll keep an eye on the Seo Bo Ra case to see how it ends.

622
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:34,620
I ask you not to let the victim be the perpetrator, Director.

623
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,550
Yes, I understand.

624
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,810
Seo Bo Ra.

625
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,870
Did you report it to the Office of Education? Do you think you will win like this?

626
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:58,410
Are you afraid that you'll get caught for the things that you've covered up?

627
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:02,080
Are you crazy... to become frightened by someone like you?

628
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,120
Then, look forward to it.

629
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,690
How your lies will become punished.

630
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:12,690
This time, I too won't easily give up or continue suffering.

631
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:16,000
- What?
- Why? Are you going to tell your well-off mother again?

632
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,530
Do you really want to die?

633
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:29,590
I told you that I won't continue to suffer anymore.

634
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,300
Just watch.

635
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:42,280
Wow she is still alive. Seo Bo Ra has returned.

636
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,390
Is it fun?

637
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,360
I know that you guys spread the rumors.

638
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,370
What are you saying?

639
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:56,720
Should I too spread a rumor of just how much of a trash you guys are?

640
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,320
W..wh...what about us?

641
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,320
As you guys said, I dated Kim Hui Chan for a bit.

642
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,410
So, I know many unexpected fun facts.

643
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:12,500
Hey, what is she saying? I'm so really dumbfounded, really.

644
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,920
Let's go.

645
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,810
- Wow, Bo Ra.
- Oh...!

646
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:26,580
Bo Ra, you did really well.

647
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,750
You are so cool.

648
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,870
It seems like I just drank a full can of sprite.

649
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:31,690
- It was so good.
- Very cool, Seo Bo Ra.

650
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,520
- The best!
- You should have done that before.

651
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,570
I couldn't stand them.

652
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:40,500
A rumor is born from an outrageous place.

653
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,870
It shows it's weight in unexpected place

654
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:53,120
Just as a rumor is not born alone, in the end, we are not alone.

655
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,710
We can't solve everything just because we are together.

656
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:02,070
But, we can endure it because we are together.

657
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,760
You sent a message to X?

658
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,500
Yes, I have decided to meet him at 10pm at the assembly hall.

659
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:16,550
Because I told him that I won't leave Ra Eun Ho alone if he doesn't appear, so he'll appear for sure.

660
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,580
What's wrong? Did something happen?

661
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,930
No.

662
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:34,410
Your expression doesn't look good. Why? Did something happen?

663
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:38,270
What about my expression? Now, you are now concerned about my expression?

664
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,650
Should I just not say anything?

665
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,270
No.

666
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,570
I'm getting tired.

667
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:51,260
Hurry up and go inside. You probably suffered all this time.

668
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,280
- What about you?
- Me?

669
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,280
You are speaking as if you need to do something.

670
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,980
What do I have to do?

671
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,770
Thinking of you?

672
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:06,650
I want to leave.

673
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,330
Let's go together.

674
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,820
10pm. Come to the assembly hall.

675
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,690
If you don't come, Ra Eun Ho will get hurt.

676
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,520
We finally met.

677
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:42,760
There's no point of running away now. I'm recording everything here.

678
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,920
Why are you so surprised about?

679
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:16,330
Perhaps... it doesn't make sense.

680
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:18,980
Are you playing a joke right now?

681
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:22,490
A joke?

682
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:27,150
The incidents that I caused as X,

683
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,880
If they find out that I had no choice to do it because you threatened me,

684
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,660
how will people react?

685
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,190
What?

686
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,290
10pm. Come to the assembly hall. If you don't come, Ra Eun Ho will be hurt.

687
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,820
The meeting place has been changed.

688
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:13,320
Not the assembly hall, but the entrance to the music room.

689
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:50,270
♫ Believing now in this moment I ♫

690
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:55,700
♫ Sometimes I feel insecure and uneasy but ♫

691
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:01,420
♫  As I think of you, oh oh  ♫

692
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,300
♫ Something wonderful ♫
