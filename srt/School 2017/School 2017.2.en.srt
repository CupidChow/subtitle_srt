1
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,940
Awesome.

2
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,970
Y-you?

3
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,850
School 2017 - About problem children who are not problematic

4
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,490
Episode 2

5
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,020
Hey, Ra Eun Ho is coming.

6
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,800
She is so pitiful, what do we do about her?

7
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,080
- Wow, wow.
- It's really Ra Eun Ho.

8
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,220
Is the culprit really her?

9
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,950
Are you kidding?

10
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,380
What? Is she the culprit? No way.

11
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,640
Ah, Ra Eun Ho is really unbelievable.

12
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,720
I always thought you were cool.

13
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,920
It is strange though.

14
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,190
That she would break a window with a chair.

15
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,200
It's strange. Although it seems like the school found the culprit.

16
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,490
Did she do it by herself?

17
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,750
How is she the heart shocking Avenger? (nickname)

18
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,820
She didn't do it.

19
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:47,080
Hey, Yeong Goo. Is that something a girl would do alone? I would never imagine it.

20
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,790
So? Did she do it together with someone?

21
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,430
Didn't I just say she didn't-

22
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,520
What to do about you?

23
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,210
Are you a student or a delinquent?

24
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,930
This is something only the reds would do. ("Reds" are communists).

25
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,940
It really wasn't me. I went there to get my drawings.

26
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,980
That bastard just ran away that day.

27
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:19,440
There is no one who saw him running away, and you were the only one at the scene.

28
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,170
Um....there was this saying about

29
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,670
Just like the saying that you catch the thief from his front, not from his back.

30
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,560
Suspecting someone without proper evidence is a bit...

31
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,040
Why are you saying there isn't evidence? Crime scene.

32
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,810
She was caught in the act.

33
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,950
Don't get excited. Hurry up and spill all of it. The truth is going to come out anyway.

34
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,350
We have all seen from hearings, that the people who say they don't know, don't remember and it's not them.

35
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,010
You're just delaying the time you're going to eat your beans in your rice. (going to jail)

36
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,020
- But I said it's really not me!
- What do you mean by not?

37
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,910
It's fitting. A student who is not good at studying equals a student who causes trouble.

38
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,610
Not being good at studying does not make you cause trouble.

39
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,030
Nowadays, the adults who do really bad things were very good at studying!

40
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,950
So what? Are you saying you did well by going into the teacher´s office?

41
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,690
If you're not going to turn yourself in, at least reflect on what you did.

42
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,830
By reflecting, you can choose either to drop out of this school or be "loyal."

43
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,080
Drop out?

44
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,770
Drop out.

45
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,980
That'll be good!

46
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,620
Eun Ho, you know...

47
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,310
Ah Teacher, it really isn't me!

48
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,240
Of course, I know. Your teacher knows, but-

49
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,670
They said I had to drop out!

50
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,120
Hey, who is dropping out?

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,960
If you use common sense it isn't definitely you. Is everyone at the crime scene culprits?

52
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,880
Then is everyone at a murder scene a murderer, and everyone who smellsof alcohol a drunk-driver?

53
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,320
Isn't the possibility of that quite high though...?

54
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,180
That isn't what I meant. But anyway,

55
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,000
does this make sense with so little evidence? It is really unfair in a democratic country.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,250
Teacher.

57
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,280
You should have said that earlier, now is a little...

58
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,990
I know.

59
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,380
I know, I know.

60
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,080
It's "I know" again. It is always "I know", always.

61
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,320
Okay, okay. Look, Eun Ho.

62
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,850
Just try to calm down a bit. I'll try to figure it out.

63
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,340
What will happen to Eun Ho?

64
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,110
She really isn't that kind of kid, to even think she would do that alone-

65
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,580
It doesn't make sense, right?

66
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,530
Exactly! In my opinion, Eun Ho doing that-

67
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,150
There could be an accomplice.

68
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,070
An accomplice?

69
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,470
It could be that the accomplice ran away first, and Ra Eun Ho never had the chance to get away.

70
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,130
Well, nothing is for sure yet.

71
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,950
Isn't making her drop out too harsh?

72
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,170
Is being a teacher some kind of service job?

73
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,680
Unconditional defense or protection. So what will you do?

74
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,900
I´m the homeroom teacher but...

75
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,650
I seem so weak.

76
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,420
How are you going to prove that she isn't a kid who would do it?

77
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,880
Trying to prove she's not the culprit is more weak.

78
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,140
Drop out? Ha!

79
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,800
They even know how to say that.

80
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,260
Do you have to drop out?

81
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,910
No!

82
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,380
I know. You wouldn't do that kind of thing.

83
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,980
Right? You think so too?

84
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Of course. Would the perfect crime be possible with your head?

85
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,940
Hey! Aish-. Worry about your own head.

86
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,450
You're pissed, right?

87
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,680
How about a refreshing lemonade?

88
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,540
Who would want to drink it with you?

89
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,550
Who said I was drinking with you?

90
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,900
How about a lemonade? I know you buy and drink that a lot.

91
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,460
None of your business. Whether I drink it or not.

92
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,950
She ruined the whole mock exam. Wow, a huge thank you to Ra Eun Ho.

93
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,690
It was a total Waikiki cider refreshing feeling.

94
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,120
It felt like one of Go So Mi's high notes.

95
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,590
Speak so that people can understand you.

96
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,280
Are your ears bad?

97
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,020
What is he saying?

98
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,450
But was it really Ra Eun Ho? Was she that brave?

99
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,420
You don't know a person just by her looks.

100
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,570
Like you?

101
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,580
Huh?

102
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,910
Get closer to your inner heart.

103
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,450
His words are even worse to understand.

104
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,350
The situation is going to get worse.

105
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,540
Why? Which situation is getting worse?

106
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,160
Right, we didn't have to take the mock exam. It's so nice though.

107
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,100
Do you think the principal will just stay still?

108
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,590
Security will be more tight during exams right? To prevent that kind of situation again.

109
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,350
In this kind of situation, you can still draw?

110
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,850
I draw well.

111
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:07,620
I'll draw hard. So that I will win the contest and will go to the Korea University for sure.

112
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,280
Dropping out? Ha, I am never doing that.

113
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,390
Of course, why would you?

114
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,150
How are you the culprit? With those rock-bottom grades,

115
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,840
you don't have the brains to come up and pull off that kind of spectacular prank.

116
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,040
Your grades are rock-bottom.

117
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,110
You are comforting me, right?

118
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,070
Of course.

119
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Starting right now, there will be an inspection of your belongings.

120
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,210
What?

121
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,860
All of you, stand up from where you're sitting and go to the hallway.

122
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,910
Start moving now!

123
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,830
Oh, man!

124
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,430
All the students who were caught, come to the gym right after class.

125
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,210
Hey, what is this? So annoying.

126
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,810
You should've dealt with this issue by yourself. Why are you causing trouble for us?

127
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,440
It's not me!

128
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,370
Hey!

129
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,460
- You really want to die, right?
- It isn't me.

130
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,390
Whether it was you or not, why did you have to enter the office and make things so complicated?

131
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,970
So annoying. Why? Why?

132
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,050
I said it isn't me!

133
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,890
I should just-

134
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,110
Let go.

135
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,820
Stop it. She says it isn't her.

136
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,200
If you keep doing this, I have to call the 'Jordan River' teacher.

137
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,060
Right? So stop it.

138
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,610
Where are you going?

139
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,080
Why isn't this working either? Why not?

140
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,300
Why can't even this go the way I want it to?

141
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,510
Annoying!

142
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,000
Hey! This is all because of you,

143
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,650
because of you the pedals aren't working.

144
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,630
There you go again.

145
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,050
I can't even go home now. Take responsibility for it.

146
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,510
Why is the notebook so important you even entered the office?

147
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,190
Because it is my dream.

148
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,150
Dream?

149
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,050
So you even have that kind of thing lately? How childish.

150
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,620
Even though it is childish, it is everything to me. Without it I'd probably be dead from frustration.

151
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,650
You have that kind of thing too, the motorbike. Because you are so frustrated you could die.

152
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,250
Exactly. I ride it because I get frustrated, but it's a problem that I'm so cool when I ride it.

153
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,260
Really big trouble, huh?

154
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,910
But thank you. Whatever the situation is, right now feels good.

155
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,420
Chicken

156
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,150
This is my place.

157
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,330
Chicken?

158
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,180
My chicken place.

159
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,450
I'm leaving.

160
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,030
Wait a second.

161
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,680
- Here.
Chicken coupon

162
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:31,640
It's in your neighborhood, right? Our chicken is really good, try ordering it once.

163
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,430
Well, thank you a little for today.

164
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,310
Do you come if I order this?

165
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,220
Ah well, this pretty Noona will deliver some to you.

166
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,300
I don't like chicken.

167
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,300
What a jerk.

168
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,380
You! Come here, you wench!

169
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,010
Hey, you sat on that motorbike, right?

170
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,800
You can't do that!

171
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,090
Stop it! Why are you doing this?

172
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,350
High School

173
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,670
Tae Woon is here.

174
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:49,530
Come back and greet him properly. How are you acting towards the principal?

175
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,410
Yes. Tae Woon is spending his school life-

176
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,840
Not well. You came to the police station a few days ago.

177
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,290
If he causes any problems, have him drop out.

178
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,440
Ah, what do you mean drop out? How dare I?

179
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,290
Just leave his problems to me.

180
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,230
You should have too many things to worry about anyway, Chairman.

181
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,890
I'm very sorry. Anyway, please solve that problem quickly.

182
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,550
Yes, even if we have to make someone a sacrifice,

183
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,860
we will show that students cannot go against the school.

184
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,500
Even if we have to expel a student, we should clean up the roots of the problem.

185
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,930
I will trust you, principal. Next year, you should be promoted to the superintendent of education.

186
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,510
Are you rebelling?

187
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,170
Don't you dare ride a motorbike again.

188
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,140
Are you a delivery girl? Never take off your helmet, the customers will be shocked.

189
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,980
Do you want to die?

190
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,960
I'll die then! Father, the side dishes are such quality today!

191
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,420
If we have this many side dishes, (soju) would be nice, right?

192
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,720
Soju sounds nice-

193
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,050
Are you an old man?

194
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,460
How much is it?

195
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,940
Mom, are you giving me money?

196
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,870
Father and son are okay to drink, right?

197
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,390
I have to buy books. I haven't spoken up lately, but I have a lot of things to spend money on, Mother.

198
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,100
You said an old man can drink.

199
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,700
That comic academy or whatever!

200
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,390
Who am I talking with right now?

201
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,060
Can you go to university like this?

202
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:53,590
Well, but you know, Mom. At school today, I, you know-

203
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,760
I should go to your school.

204
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,890
You are in your second year, we should get some admission consultation.

205
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,600
Should I bring some chicken and give you some support?

206
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,210
No, never come.

207
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,810
Our principal doesn't like it when moms come to our school.

208
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,300
- Really?
- Yes. Don't come, never.

209
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,370
Should your dad go instead?

210
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,750
- Why should you come suddenly?
- Did you get into trouble at school?

211
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:25,490
No! Never mind. Why would you think that?

212
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,820
Why are you yelling?

213
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,200
Don't joke too far.

214
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,710
I got it.

215
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,270
He puts me through trouble?

216
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,730
I'll do this!

217
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:19,730
You just wait. I'll find you and break you down.

218
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,390
I'll also clear my name.

219
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,050
You´re done for.

220
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,660
Stop. Come here.

221
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,330
Let's see.

222
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,790
- Nope.
- Pass.

223
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,700
Pass.

224
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,150
No, just come.

225
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,120
Pass.

226
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,490
Pass.

227
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,990
Do you know me?

228
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,420
Go.

229
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,510
Stop.

230
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,150
Why? Wait, am I also a suspect?

231
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,090
Hey, but this isn't it.

232
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,210
Is it childish? I know.

233
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,070
How desperate would I be to be doing this childish thing. I'm not even a grade schooler.

234
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,150
Right, let's just do whatever we can. Satisfied?

235
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,930
Hey, Ra Eun Ho. Stop looking, one would think you were going to kiss him.

236
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,240
Pass, pass.

237
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,410
- Come here.
- Stop.

238
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,430
- Nope.
- Nope?

239
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,200
- Yeah.
- Pass.

240
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,280
- Stop.
- Stop.

241
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,530
- Move.
- Wait a second...

242
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,670
They are similar! It is similar!

243
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,200
Wait a second, just a second.

244
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,830
Hey.

245
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,900
You...

246
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,850
Your heart is fluttering so much you could die, right? So move.

247
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,160
Did you see? At this angle?

248
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,420
Hey! Is the angle important right now? It did look good.

249
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,760
But will we find the culprit like this?

250
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,000
I told you I remember it clearly. That guy's lips...

251
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,490
Someone would think you'd kissed him.

252
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,140
Hey, you have never even kissed someone. What's with you?

253
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,860
Holy! Strawberry, 	glutinous rice, bravo! Really?

254
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:02,090
Treat culprit as an innocent person No. Treat an innocent person as a culprit.

255
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,990
This doesn't make sense! How can a school suspect a student like this without any clear evidence!

256
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,670
Exactly! I think so too, Teacher.

257
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,600
I feel so sorry for Eun Ho, she would never do that.

258
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,440
So take responsibility for it, bravely.

259
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,900
The principal is coming. Do it in front of him bravely.

260
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,600
Are you saying that withdrawal is impossible even with the principal's authority?

261
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,420
Please don't yell. They are just next to us. They may hear.

262
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,580
Your authority isn't that big.

263
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,650
You're saying expelling is not possible, withdrawal isn't either.

264
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,900
- What's withdrawal they're saying?
- That's what I'm saying.

265
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,780
Should we do a signature-collecting campaign?

266
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,980
Clearly and meticulously. Fast pace isn't a fast thing.

267
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,320
It's good, right? Loot at this.

268
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,400
Hand this out.

269
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,830
Why is he giving us a test paper?

270
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,310
A petition for Ra Eun Ho?

271
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,970
Teacher, why should we do this?

272
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,730
Kids, Eun Ho is being treated unfairly.

273
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,320
So, I think it would give her a lot of strength if we helped her a little.

274
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,080
Holy! Then, Ra Eun Ho isn't the culprit?

275
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,660
Did anyone said she wasn't? Why are you so sensitive about it?

276
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,270
But she could be the culprit.

277
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,570
But since nothing has been confirmed, we should help her.

278
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,960
Teacher, I have to go to the academy now though.

279
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,090
Oh yea. I have a tutor.

280
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,610
You could just go and write there.

281
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,500
I think it would be fine if you just wrote on it quickly before you go.

282
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,550
Bye.

283
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,440
Teacher, I'll write.

284
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,340
- Thank you, take care.
- Yes, goodbye.

285
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,340
- You came?
- Petition for Ra Eun Ho?

286
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,830
I couldn't think of anything else.

287
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,640
Punish her and end it.

288
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,720
She will continue to create incidents and bother you.

289
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,380
Still.

290
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,080
Do you really think students these days respect their teachers?

291
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,540
Do it moderately, moderately.

292
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,300
If I upload it online, it'll get some attention.

293
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,440
Seo Bora. You did a job.

294
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,490
I'm not doing it. I can't anymore.

295
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,460
What is she saying?

296
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,130
If you need money, I'll just get a part-time job. So-

297
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,270
Are you crazy?

298
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,640
What? Part-time job? Part-time job?

299
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,450
How do you dare?

300
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,270
- Hey!
- Who are you?

301
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,900
Hey, you!

302
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,650
Look here. What are you doing to the students? Use words!

303
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,440
What is a police officer doing right now?

304
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,270
Kids, are you okay?

305
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:20,180
Hey, girls. When fighting, isn´t one versus one the norm?

306
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,080
Three versus one isn't stylish, is it?

307
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,540
What are you saying? What are you going to do about them being hurt?

308
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:35,350
They'll be fine in about three days. I hit people particularly well- it's my specialty.

309
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,240
I mean, if a police officer is going to hit kids like this-

310
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,320
I'm doing my work properly. Educating delinquent students.

311
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,720
How you educate delinquent students by violence? As to that ...

312
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,340
What is your department? I'll report you immediately.

313
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,040
♫ You are my everything  ♫

314
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,280
♫ In a fate which is like the cascading stars ♫

315
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,440
I couldn't just do nothing.

316
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,590
Girls, if I catch you again you'll die by my hands.

317
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,780
2nd year mock exam - Key summary

318
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,510
Look at this. You stole this not to study it yourself but to sell it?

319
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,750
I did wrong, Teacher.

320
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,460
Study? Is it fine to steal it if you study?

321
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,280
No, that isn't what I meant.

322
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,420
Anyway, give this back and apologize quickly.

323
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,790
Really annoying.

324
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:47,110
Hwang Yeong Geon. Do you guys really want to be punished?

325
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,520
If you guys get one more warning, expulsion is next.

326
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,870
Got it, Teacher. It's fine if we just give it back and apologize, right?

327
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:59,470
Really? Right, Bit Na will forgive you if you apologize.

328
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,180
Okay, then I'll give it back and apologize.

329
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,860
We can go now, right?

330
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,940
Sure, go.

331
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,520
You have to apologize!

332
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,610
You fix it.

333
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,510
Did you help them? You must have gone crazy, huh?

334
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,340
I'm sorry.

335
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,750
You're sorry? Is that everything? Do you know how much this cost, you thief?!

336
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,150
You are going to die by my hands today!

337
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,030
Yoo Bit Na, do it with words, with words. She is sorry, okay?

338
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,910
What are you doing again? So annoying!

339
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,600
- She said she was sorry.
- Move aside.

340
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,910
I'm going to call the police right now and send you to jail!

341
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,420
Don't go overboard and calm down!

342
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,550
Who are you to intervene?

343
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,340
- Let go!
- It was you!

344
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,180
Bi Na, stop it this instant!

345
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,250
And your friends are fighting, but look at you.

346
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,660
Mom! I'm so annoyed I could die!

347
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:04,820
What were you doing, a teacher?

348
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,760
What were you thinking? I can't believe this.

349
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,560
Bi Na´s mother, please leave this problem to me.

350
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,770
- Expel her instantly.
- Sorry?

351
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,310
Moreover, expel Ra Eun Ho who also fought.

352
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,380
I heard she did something big.

353
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:31,040
While being with stealing and problem students. What would you do if my daughter get hurt?

354
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,770
No, they are not that kind of kids-

355
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,450
And teacher, what is this?

356
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,210
A petition? To the busy studying students.

357
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,010
What are you doing with kids?

358
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:49,220
This child seems like someone who doesn't study, causes trouble, and makes the mood bad.

359
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,220
The kids will be troubled going together with her, and it is not long until the exam.

360
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,370
If you do not get rid of these two problems instantly,

361
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,070
I will make all of the kids of steering committee members transfer.

362
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,900
Sure

363
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,780
T-transfer?

364
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,640
Aigoo, how could you say something so upsetting?

365
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,340
Don't worry, I'll get rid of all the problem kids.

366
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,950
What are you doing? Apologize now!

367
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,910
I'm sorry.

368
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:29,150
But they are not problem kids.

369
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:33,050
You let them do this kind of thing while they lack time for study.

370
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,080
Eun Ho isn't that kind of kid,

371
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,810
- but they are friends-
- Friends?

372
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:47,030
Is there something like a friend right now? They are all competitors.

373
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,370
All of the problem kids have to be removed for there to be a good academic environment.

374
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,150
Bring them and punish them right now!

375
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,920
Letter of apology
It was my fault...

376
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:19,100
I'm sorry. Because of me...

377
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,380
No. They always dislike me.

378
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,820
But, what happened to you?

379
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,500
Just, somehow.

380
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,990
I don't think it was you.

381
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,360
But there must be a reason.

382
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,950
Just.

383
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,660
But...

384
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,790
we'll get kicked out, right?

385
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,970
Nonsense.

386
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,300
What did we do to get kicked out?

387
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,440
They're threatening us they should kick us out.

388
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,690
Because it is better if kids like us aren't in school.

389
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,890
We can't study, and we don't have money.

390
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,340
Is someone who is not being good at studying and lacking money a problem kid?

391
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,490
Who are the ones who has that foolish idea?

392
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,110
Ah, screw it.

393
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,000
Teacher!

394
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,420
Yes, Dae Hwi?

395
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,410
Here, Teacher.

396
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,150
Thank you.

397
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:07,350
For what? But, Teacher, Eun Ho and Bo Ra, they'll be okay, right?

398
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,230
They should.

399
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,200
I understand.

400
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,330
It seems like the culprit was aware of the security cameras when moving.

401
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,990
That bastard is pretty good though, he can't be an amateur.

402
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,940
If he isn't an amateur, he might not be a student, right?

403
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,210
Right. Eun Ho can't be this professional.

404
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,260
Rather, students can be aware of the locations better.

405
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,320
And even more a student who goes there often...

406
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:52,230
Ah, I'm hungry. Did I have ramen at home?

407
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,200
- Do you want to go eat ramen?
- Ramen??

408
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,970
Why would I eat ramen with a girl this late?
(Equivalent with netflix and chill)

409
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,110
I'm not that kind of person. I only see you as a colleague.

410
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,260
I said having ramen at the restaurant over there.

411
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,670
What were you thinking?

412
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,230
Ah right.

413
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,930
What are you doing?

414
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,700
The culprit is in this school.

415
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,740
You should quickly take action.

416
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,550
There won't be a problem for us, right?

417
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,440
Go into hiding.

418
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,420
Girl.

419
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,790
Won't this be the culprit?

420
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,060
The culprit?

421
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,310
The owner of this blood.

422
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,810
Oh, right!

423
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:07,420
Oh, that startled me. What is that?

424
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,260
You startled me more.

425
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,290
I thought it was a ghost.

426
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,900
Pass!

427
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,700
The side, the side

428
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,640
The side

429
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,930
I should see his side.

430
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:50,290
Hey. You played basketball really well. You passed the ball by your side.

431
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,730
What?

432
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,090
What are you doing?

433
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,800
Doesn't it hurt?

434
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,650
What is she saying?

435
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,910
Song Dae Hwi! You were so good. Just with your form!

436
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,280
Watch, I'll show you how it's done. Grab it.

437
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Your left hand is for assisting only, you know?.

438
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,340
Show me one more time.

439
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,030
Look

440
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:25,450
Hey! Ra Eun Ho, what are you doing?

441
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,470
I wasn't looking or anything, just you know...

442
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,200
Actually he has nothing to see, right?

443
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,650
Oh? Does it hurt? Let's see, where does it hurt?

444
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,670
I have cramps.

445
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,990
Wow, look at that sweat. When are you going to wash? Remove it, and-

446
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,010
None of your business whether I wash or not.

447
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:10,430
Aw dirty. You smell terrible.

448
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,380
What do you want?

449
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,910
What do you take me for?

450
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:22,100
Let me see it.

451
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:27,710
No. My body isn't one you can just see like that.

452
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,760
Are you a pervert?

453
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:40,000
Hah! What did he say? Pervert, me?

454
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,510
Just carry on.

455
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,050
Leave.

456
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Leave!

457
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,700
I got it, I'll leave.

458
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:01,400
Hey, hey! Are you satisfied now? Done?

459
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,530
You startled me. You're too much.

460
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,690
Ra Eun Ho.

461
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,180
Follow me.

462
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,530
I told your parents that the disciplinary committee meeting will be held.

463
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,490
Please let it go just this once.

464
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,790
She's normally immature, so this is something she did without knowing.

465
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:22,280
She is drawing cartoons day and night. So she lacks a sense of reality.

466
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:26,170
I'll never let this happen again even by breaking her legs.

467
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,060
We have a cooling-off period for three months.

468
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,110
Withdrawal will be better in many ways than discipline.

469
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,900
- Teacher.
- There is no need to do this.

470
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:43,470
What do you mean dropping out? In this day, if she can't even graduate from high school, she can't even be a person.

471
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:46,080
Please, I beg of you. Please.

472
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,110
Mother...

473
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,590
- Please just let her graduate!
- Mother

474
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,380
- Teacher.
- Stand up.

475
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,180
I said stand up.

476
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,720
I didn't do anything wrong.

477
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,610
I didn't do it. I didn't!

478
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,340
I didn't do it, so why are you on your knees?

479
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,120
I can just quit this stupid school.

480
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,130
What good did you do to say this?

481
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,830
How dare you?

482
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:33,570
I said it isn't. It isn't me!

483
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,500
I'm saying it isn't me!

484
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:43,080
I didn't do it. It isn't me!

485
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,810
I didn't do it!

486
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,180
Mom.

487
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,810
Mom!

488
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,040
What are you doing? Go to class quickly.

489
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,880
Doesn't she know Kim Young Ran's Law? (Improper Solicitation and Graft Act preventing gifts to teachers)

490
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,340
Only the disciplinary committee's final decision is left for Ra Eun Ho.

491
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,220
Even if she did get caught on the scene,

492
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:08,460
It is true that there's only a circumstantial evidence that Ra Eun Ho is the culprit.

493
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,880
It is the problem that there's no decisive evidence.

494
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,210
Do you have proof that it isn't her?

495
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:18,300
If you hear a gun sound 'Bang' suddenly, and you see a person having a gun standing there.

496
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,830
Then of course you should suspect that person having the gun!

497
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,820
There is the chairman's order. Do it right now, either expel her or make her withdraw.

498
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,800
In this situation, a culprit or a hero should show up.

499
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,340
Because of that person, an innocent person has to drop out.

500
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,830
Shouldn't we do something?

501
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,500
Yes, we should.

502
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,800
Right now, the principal is too stubborn. No words will work.

503
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,140
- Hey.
- We can't.

504
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,540
I could go crazy, seriously.

505
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,900
What hero? Just a childish kid acting like a elementary school kid.

506
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,670
Hyeon Tae Woon! Hyeon Tae Woon!

507
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,640
Couldn't you talk to your dad a little?

508
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,150
Eun Ho really isn't the culprit, it is unfair.

509
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,880
You're doing useless things.

510
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,110
What a merciless punk.

511
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,660
Mom, I'm sorry.

512
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:53,640
But I really want to stop going to that school.

513
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:59,310
If you stop going what are you going to do? What about university?

514
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:06,280
I draw a webtoon, so I just have to make it famous... I'll work hard.

515
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,900
Let's sue that school right now! They laid false charges on her and defamed her.

516
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,430
Sue right now. We can win. I will do it.

517
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,140
Just do your work instead of blabbering.

518
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,770
Exactly.

519
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:23,650
They always differentiate and discriminate, I don't want to go to that school either.

520
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,380
It is because I can't study.

521
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:34,650
- Because I can't study, they think I'm a pushover.
- Exactly, so why?

522
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:39,980
You should have studied properly. Don't you know you can't be treated as a human if you can't study?

523
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,580
It's a shame for our school.

524
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,250
We should kick her out.

525
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,920
♪ Spring, spring, spring is here ♪

526
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,050
♪ The same scent is in the air ♪

527
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:14,980
♪ As the time we first met ♪

528
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:23,980
♪ The tree next to the bench on which you sat then ♪

529
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,680
Reason for withdrawal:

530
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,460
Rather than writing,

531
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,450
I like drawing though.

532
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,880
Why do they keep telling me to write?

533
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,780
This stupid school.

534
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:26,910
Teacher Sin.

535
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,190
The fact that I am bad at studying,

536
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,870
meant that I wasn't qualified to attend school.

537
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,250
In front of that vicious discrimination, the thing that made me despair the most.

538
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:01,640
I never met one single adult

539
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:11,080
who said the school shouldn't be that kind of place. That they did wrong.

540
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,300
If you get out, the world you will experience

541
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:30,450
is much more brutal.

542
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:35,020
I know.

543
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:42,450
The school is pushing kids to that brutal world too easily.

544
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:10,820
If the school chases kids out of their classrooms this easily,

545
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,030
it's not right.

546
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:17,810
Then the kids have no place to go.

547
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,900
I'm sorry.

548
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,460
Ah, what are you sorry for?

549
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:30,220
I know, Teacher.

550
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,530
I know you use your heart a lot.

551
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:39,420
You handed a petition to the students then you had your salary reduced.

552
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,650
Thank you.

553
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:48,470
I'm really thankful that a person like you was in charge of my daughter.

554
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,220
No.

555
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,140
Someone like me isn't even a teacher.

556
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:56,920
Someone like me should just die.

557
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,710
No, why do you keep saying you should die?

558
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:06,010
An incompetent person like me! Who isn't even a good father should die first.

559
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,590
No, Father. No!

560
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,800
I should just die!

561
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,140
No, I'll die. I will.

562
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:16,510
Hey Teacher, you go back to school. And I will die.

563
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:20,600
Why are you on your knees, why?

564
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,710
Please sit down, Father.

565
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,020
Is this a school?

566
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,210
Morals have fallen to the ground!!

567
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:34,670
I'm warning I won't idly standby for all those improper incidents happening in this school!

568
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:40,320
The major culprit of all recent incidents,

569
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,810
Ra Eun Ho of second grade Class 1...

570
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:58,350
♫ Believing in this moment now  ♫

571
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,220
- Is that the culprit?
♫ Sometimes feel insecure and uneasy but ♫

572
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,230
♫ I sometimes feel insecure and uneasy but ♫

573
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:10,010
♫ Just like you entered my heart ♫

♫ The moment you smiled in the bright sunshine ♫

576
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:27,930
- Why is the principal there?
♫ The moment you smiled in the bright sunshine ♫

577
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:33,290
♫ I'm becoming addicted and being dragged into the gravity which is you ♫

578
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,050
Police officer Han! What are you doing? Catch him!

579
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:41,390
- Wow, this is sick!
♫ Come Come On the approching ♫

580
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:44,700

♫ I want to become a good person ♫

585
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,990

♫ So that I can do everything for you ♫

586
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:14,050
Now he is revealing his identity.

587
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:22,020
♫ Alright, I'll be looking forward to it, we can do well ♫

588
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,130
Back to your position!

589
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:41,030
It's going, it's going!

590
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:34,830
Even the best drone can't fly more than 15 minutes. We shouldn't miss it.

591
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:36,520
I'll go the other way.

592
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,050
Yes.

593
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:44,520
The culprit was you?

594
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,220
Culprit?

595
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,000
I came to get this though.

596
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:00,920
Is it really not you?

597
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,680
It isn't.

598
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,050
It really isn't you?

599
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:14,170
I told you so. I'm leaving.

600
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:40,060
Eun Gyeong Woo...

601
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,620
It really isn't him.

602
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,900
Oh wait.

603
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:11,120
Why did you suddenly stop?

604
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:16,500
Even though I don't have ability to do something,

605
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,880
at least I have the ability to not do something.

606
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,480
Ra Eun Ho.

607
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,570
Ra Eun Ho.

608
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:14,640
Song Dae Hwi and HyeonTae Won were not in the auditorium.
