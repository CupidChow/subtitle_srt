1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,390
You mean things like school contests?

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,960
Before the students take their final exam, I'm thinking about assembling all the school contests together at once.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,060
Are you really going to participate?

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,140
I'm going to try.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,730
Even if we give them opportunities, they can't even go to college."

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,220
This is not a place for you to meddle .

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,930
Do you have the answer document?

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,610
guess he got upset since it's predetermined..

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,140
Please stop!

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,400
Everyone in Geumdo High School

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,690
has his own important life and is desperate too.

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,900
School 2017
Real Record of Our Lives

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,610
Episode 6

14
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,340
You scared me!

15
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,400
You're so cute.

16
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,760
Are you calling a man cute?

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,800
You're getting off work late.

18
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,560
Yes. I am in charge of the school for the night time.

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,310
Oh.. Nice timing! Why don't we patrol around school for a bit?

20
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,120
What do you mean?

21
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,660
Let's go.

22
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,590
School Math Contest

23
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,940
2017 2nd year, Math Contest Questions and answer sheets

24
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,120
Didn't you hear something?

25
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,260
I'm not sure.

26
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,590
I think the sound came from that direction.

27
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,380
- What are you doing?
- Stop meddling in others' problems!

28
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,600
- What?
- Stop meddling!

29
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,200
- But..
- What do you mean 'But'? Who is it?

30
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,590
I couldn't see his face. But I feel like he is from our school.

31
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,690
Answer Document

32
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,600
Oh my!

33
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,680
What do we do? We're going to get in trouble if we get caught.

34
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,560
School Math Contest

35
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,600
What kind of 'X' action is this?

36
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,580
Someone's coming!

37
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,560
Who is in here at this time? The school is so troublesome these days.

38
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,810
Would it be X?

39
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,680
What kind of bastard is this expert?

40
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,540
If someone's coming, then we need to get out.

41
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,090
Staff room?

42
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,960
What do we do? It's our teacher!

43
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,640
What do you mean? Be quiet.

44
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,050
Do you want to eat Ramen?

45
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,600
What? Ramen?

46
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,100
What about a movie?

47
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,610
- Why?
- I mean..

48
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,990
Ah...I-

49
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,300
I like you!

50
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,960
I like you.

51
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,670
You're quite suspicious.

52
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,110
What? What is?

53
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,740
The fact that you confessed in this situation.

54
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,800
Should I accept or not?

55
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,190
Ramen sounds good.

56
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,540
How did you do this every day? This is so nerve wrecking.

57
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,570
If anyone is able to do this, would I even be cool?

58
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,500
You show off despite the situation.

59
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,190
Anyway,

60
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,910
did you really not see his face?

61
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,000
I couldn't see. When I first caught you also in the staff room

62
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,390
I didn't know who you were either.

63
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,570
He's probably a copycat of yours. Many do that.

64
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,570
Or..

65
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,630
he's someone who desperately needs the test.

66
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,450
What do we do? It's our teacher!

67
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,160
What would we do? Shut up.

68
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,280
They were definitely kids from my class.

69
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,150
Why did Song Dae Hwi do that?

70
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,730
Song Dae Hwi..

71
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,950
The test?

72
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,710
Why?

73
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,730
Geumdo High School

74
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,920
I forgot to give you the Master Key.

75
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,370
Why is he giving you the Master Key?

76
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,420
I have different places to go to, including the Staff room.

77
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,510
The president and the vice president each have one.

78
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,750
Are you looking for this?

79
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,870
Crazy bastard.

80
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,870
Why do you live like that?

81
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,850
If someone becomes a crazy bastard, that would be me. So mind your business.

82
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,980
You are a bastard who can't live your own life properly.

83
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,140
If you give me a kindly warning like this, I get mad.

84
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,570
Is this fun to you?

85
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,160
This is funny huh?

86
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,700
To you, I probably look pathetic doing this stupid thing.

87
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,460
Yes. Very.

88
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,090
You can report me or tell everyone. Do whatever you want.

89
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,390
Are you crazy?

90
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,040
I don't care a single bit about you.

91
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,790
Why would I even bother?

92
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,660
Quit meddling in my life.

93
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,560
You're disgusting.

94
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,360
My life has to be like that piece of light.

95
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,620
I keep on having to climb up.

96
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,910
As the time passes by

97
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,350
our future keeps on slipping away.

98
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,780
Ra Eun Ho.

99
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,770
Can we talk for a moment?

100
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,430
What talk?

101
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,220
What are you two talking about?

102
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,710
Uh.. that is

103
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,570
Ah! About the contest, right?

104
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,700
You asked me to participate in the contest with you.

105
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,500
A contest?

106
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,190
Oh yeah! I remember. The contest. You're right.

107
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,410
What kind of contest?

108
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,090
Are you preparing for a contest with Ra Eun Ho?

109
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,570
Yes. Well..

110
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,770
Actually, I am preparing for a contest, but I asked her to help me with the drawing portion.

111
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,700
You're right! That-

112
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,100
Song Dae Hwi, I'm leaving first. Call me later.

113
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,160
Bye

114
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,750
Where are you meeting Ra Eun Ho?

115
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,640
What do you mean 'Where'. I'm meeting her at school.

116
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,700
You don't need to worry about it.

117
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,430
What do you mean I shouldn't worry about it?

118
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,540
When my boyfriend is privately meeting up with another girl?

119
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,600
It's just for a moment.

120
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,640
It's not something you should worry about.

121
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,550
Heey... come on!

122
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,320
Yes. The new cafe by the bus stop?

123
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,700
Yes, I know.

124
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,470
Ok. See you later?

125
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,360
When are you meeting him?

126
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,720
You do not need to know.

127
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,540
Don't go.

128
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,870
What?

129
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,950
Don't leave to meet Song Dae Hwi.

130
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,600
Mind your own business.

131
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,250
Stop meddling in others' issues.

132
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,080
How is preparation for the contest considered meddling?

133
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,800
It's my business.

134
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,880
What would you like to drink?

135
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,130
W-what? I'm fine with anything.

136
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,950
Anything...

137
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,280
♬ We both are not alone now. The two of us. ♬

138
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,710
♬ You and I are not someone else who is alone. ♬

139
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,210
♬ I want to leave behind all the past days which were lonely ♬

140
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,670
What is this?

141
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:47,550
Huh? Earlier you kept looking at it.

142
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,120
I'm the kind of person who loves materialistic things like this.

143
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,080
Thank you.

144
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,550
You're welcome.

145
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:16,980
Song Dae Hwi, when I was falsely accused you were the only one who wrote a petition.

146
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,660
What?

147
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,060
Yes.

148
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:29,100
Then, I was very thankful for you.

149
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,140
Because you believed in me.

150
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,960
That-

151
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,730
I assumed you had a reason behind your actions yesterday.

152
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,230
An inevitable reason.

153
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,160
At least, that's only Song Dae Hwi I know.

154
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,860
Thanks.

155
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,130
I thought a lot about

156
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,860
what and how I should

157
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,950
explain to you all night.

158
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,160
Tell me whenever you feel comfortable.

159
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,470
Accepting truth is

160
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,020
not as easy, but it's not impossible.

161
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,440
Thanks.

162
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,760
Right.

163
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,020
I put the

164
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,660
test back in place. Don't worry about it.

165
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,700
Thank you, really.

166
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,920
Hyeon Tae Woon

167
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,970
Ra Eun Ho

168
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,030
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

169
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,170
Hyeon Tae Woon?

170
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,340
Did you request her to shut her mouth on the subject?

171
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,650
What?

172
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,300
Do you want to desperately hide your disgusting two-face?

173
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,530
Why do you care?

174
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,310
What's wrong? Let's not fight between friends.

175
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,360
This is becoming fun.

176
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,760
Because of whom is Hyeon Tae Woon meddling in others' problem?

177
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,110
Understood? Then stop getting on my nerves.

178
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,200
Stop.

179
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,800
If you don't want me to get on your nerves

180
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,300
-Then stop meddling in my problems.
- You're mixing up something, but

181
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,870
I don't care if you live carelessly or poorly.

182
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,230
You were already out of my life long ago.

183
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,360
- What's up with you?
- I have something to talk to you about.

184
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,520
Bye, Song Dae Hwi. Don't worry about anything.

185
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,220
Follow me.

186
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,170
How did you find out where I was? I mean- did you already know?

187
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,300
Then, why did you act like you had no idea?

188
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,750
Nevertheless, don't ever meet Song Dae Hwi again.

189
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,260
He had a reason..a.. complicated one.

190
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,950
Why does that concern you?

191
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,860
Mind your own business!

192
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,790
You said you're not going to continue with 'X' stuff.

193
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,520
Stop meddling in others' problems. Who meddles in others' issues these days?

194
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,780
Your friend!

195
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,450
Your friend saved me once, too.

196
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,170
Righteous and honest, hardworking effort, diligent in studying.

197
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,860
Goodwill, good relationship with mates. Keeping strict study plan, outstanding study achievement.

198
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,770
Coward and nasty. He does whatever

199
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,040
to fulfill his desire

200
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,010
You are Gum Sang Cheom Hwa, right? I'm a big fan!

201
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,650
- This is...
- This kind of thing is a little...

202
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,370
Please give it to Oppa Ho Eun for me! I'm a huge fan!

203
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,600
Mine is for Oppa Ra Eun. Make sure you tell him I really really like him.

204
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,620
Do it for sure!

205
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,540
Oppa!

206
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,500
This is a present for you.

207
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,680
I love you, Issue

208
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:43,780
I'm sorry, but this kind of thing is a bit too burdensome.

209
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,170
Also, having a same-age friend call me 'oppa' is a bit...

210
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,280
Wow, this is perfect. How did you know about my hemorrhoids?

211
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,650
Thanks, Sa Rang!

212
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,260
But Teacher, that's-

213
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,100
This isn't burdensome for me at all. I'll put it to good use!

214
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,730
Teacher! Drat...

215
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,270
Dad! I told you not to come to my school!

216
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,850
My daughter, you like this shop's bread, don't you?

217
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,070
Take it so your younger siblings don't eat it all.

218
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,060
- Go on, already.
- You're really...

219
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,310
Hong Nam Joo!

220
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,720
What are doing here? Are you catching a cab?

221
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,590
I was going to go to my tutoring academy.

222
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,700
Isn't it not yet time for you tutoring academy?

223
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,160
That's...ah! My school record!

224
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,830
I was going to get a consultant to look at it.

225
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,590
Then let's go together. I'll ride with you there.

226
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,820
No, no! There's no need.

227
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,130
Get in.

228
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,190
I have a urgent business at Daechi-dong too.

229
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,980
Go on, get in already.

230
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,220
Singang Transportation
Hong Won Seob

231
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,930
This taxi is one of your dad's taxis!

232
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,950
W-what?

233
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,460
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

234
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,050
N-no. That's... the thing is...

235
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,530
Isn't that your dad's company?

236
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,320
Singang Transportation

237
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,840
That's right. My dad's taxi...company.

238
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,170
- Did you do your volunteering hours at your dad's company, too?
- Huh?

239
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,750
- Oh, yeah... for volunteering...

240
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:34,310
Must be nice. You don't have to worry about your school record.

241
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:43,190
♫ I'll never forget how I loved it ♫

242
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:56,400
♫ Under the shade of a pining away roadside tree the fragrance added to it. ♫

243
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,430
Your chicken is here!

244
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,280
Just a moment!

245
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,870
Hello

246
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,030
That would be 13,000 won, please.

247
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,570
Yay! Chicken!

248
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,310
- Oh! I see you go to Geumdo High!
- Yeah...

249
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,170
Ah, thank you. My daughter goes there, too.

250
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,960
Good-bye.

251
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,720
That was a lot of kids.

252
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,900
Will it be enough with just one chicken?

253
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,700
T is this.

254
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,380
It is to find velocity and acceleration.

255
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,520
I'm sorry to ask you to guess at the questions for the final exam.

256
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,730
when you must be upset because of the Math Competition.

257
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,630
I'm going to participate in the Mathematics Competition.

258
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:18,200
- Really?
- I should try whatever I can

259
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,130
It's not even started yet.

260
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:29,070
Right. You should try whatever you can.

261
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,860
Differentiate it one more time to get acceleration.

262
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,980
Ah you're really like a beggar.

263
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,550
Why?

264
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,920
Does this drink taste bad?

265
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,490
How childish! Who toasts with coke? Punk.

266
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,990
Tada! Abalone food!

267
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,700
I specially asked to our chef to celebrate birthday of our school top.

268
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,420
Look at this quality! The Wando island is in it.

269
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,800
Wando or whatever. Aren't you coming back to school?

270
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,320
Even if I don't go to school, I don't die.

271
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,970
Here. My birthday gift.

272
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,100
What is this?

273
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,190
I am always receiving.

274
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,830
That adult face again. So annoying.

275
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,310
Hey. Whoever has more should give more, whoever has less should receive more.

276
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,790
A good looking guy should flirt with girls, a funny guy should cheer up the mood. right?

277
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:52,930
Then... I am the guy who should flirt with the girls.

278
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,150
Hey what did this punk say?

279
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,020
That's why we have a good custom called 'Birthday treat'. Right?

280
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,860
Hey wait a moment!

281
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,810
- Hold him still!
- Joon Gi! Stop!

282
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,630
Come here, you!

283
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,680
H-help me...

284
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,160
Then what is it, you originally wanted to do ?

285
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,220
I was interested in it since long time ago. Now I think it's now or never.

286
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,820
Jae Wook, you'd better increase the volunteering.

287
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,420
Thank you.

288
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,090
- Um, Teacher. I have something to tell you.
- Ah yes, Sa Rang's mother.

289
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,840
Take a seat.

290
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:24,400
Does our Sa Rang not need to come in for a Student Evaluation consultation?

291
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,200
Uh... Yes, since she is preparing for the civil service exam.

292
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,080
But since she can go to college,

293
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,220
can you take care of her Student Evaluation as well?

294
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,490
It's not like Sa Rang can't study,

295
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,720
she's just being stubborn because of our living circumstances. Like others...

296
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,220
Like her friends...

297
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,010
she must have a dream.

298
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,710
I'm sorry, Teacher.

299
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,670
I'm asking for this favor.

300
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,440
My dream?

301
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,720
To let my mom live in better circumstances.

302
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,750
No, not something like that, but your real dream. Something that you really want to do.

303
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,730
I haven't thought about it before.

304
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,400
What I want to do...

305
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,740
I just thought what path I should follow according to my reality.

306
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,570
You're such a nice daughter.

307
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:46,700
To draw webtoons, I need a scanner, tablet, and the tutoring fees aren't cheap.

308
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,940
I feel like I'm immaturely dreaming even though I am clearly aware of the financial problem of my family. O

309
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,230
I'm pathetic.

310
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:01,040
The world is so unfair where poor people have to even feel bad for dreaming.

311
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:07,060
So I don't want my mom to know about the word, "dirt spoon".

312
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,740
Because my mom might blame herself for the grief in my life.

313
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,090
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

314
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,730
Modification not allowed!

315
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,880
You can't modify a single bit of this.

316
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,470
Jeong In, I told you to write things I might miss.

317
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:51,460
I didn't tell you to rewrite it all.

318
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:56,680
I spent so much money to write that with the help from a professional.

319
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,020
Still, this is not allowed. This is coming from my inherent authority as your teacher.

320
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,850
Teacher, you can't even write better than that anyway.

321
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,500
I'll take care of that. You can leave now.

322
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:34,010
Aw. These days, everyone is doing like that. Just Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. (Copy and Paste)

323
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,540
It's so easy since they write it on their own.

324
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,800
Still, this is my role.

325
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,960
No modification

326
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,890
Um, Teacher?

327
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,410
I have a favor to ask...

328
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,260
I don't know what kind of a person I am.

329
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,800
I feel like I'm less than a consultant in private institute.

330
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,750
I don't know if I'm a teacher or not.

331
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:54,720
Those school records were better than my graduation theses.

332
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:02,030
Why should the kids' life be already determined by money ?

333
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,460
It's not right.

334
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,160
What can you do if it's not right?

335
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,820
What can we change?

336
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,520
In the past, I also

337
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,180
thought I could take responsibility of the kids' lives.

338
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,930
But in the end, I couldn't take responsibility of even one.

339
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:42,100
But I'm still a teacher. If something is wrong, I should say that it is wrong.

340
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:47,350
Isn't it right that I say so?

341
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,690
What teacher? When there's no student.

342
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:06,720
Even my scattered dreams,

343
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:14,270
are bearing a tough day today

344
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:20,950
♬ It will pass.♬

345
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:29,880
♬  Like then when I was hurting.  ♬

346
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:38,070
-Never!! Modify!
♬ The white winter also which is piled up with sorrow♬

347
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:47,200
♬ will pass by too when spring comes and flower brooms.♬

348
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,010
Eat it after I make it!

349
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:12,330
It's yummy as it is. Let's just mix and eat.

350
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:16,470
Hey, try this. Ah.

351
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,400
It's so good!

352
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,380
If you eat well, your brain will work well and you'll be able to study as well.

353
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,640
Jackpot, really? I think I can study now.

354
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,480
Oh great! It's totally vacant. Is it a real school record of a high school student?

355
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,330
Ah really. Why do you look at someone else's?

356
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:41,450
Don't you think this is too serious? How are you going to college with this so empty?

357
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:47,680
I will fill it up little by little. I'm preparing for a competition. Mind your own business.

358
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,610
Is it really serious? To the point that you can't get into college?

359
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:55,330
How should you fill it up? The school record?

360
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,030
An Explanatory Meeting for the School Record

361
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,550
2nd year

362
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,660
There's someone sitting here.

363
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,560
Oh how have you been? Oh you have been prettier.

364
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,010
We will be starting the 2017 School record presentation.

365
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:54,650
First, doesn't just hearing about the school record confuse you?

366
00:40:54,650 --> 00:41:00,920
Over 70% of the colleges in the nation choose students based on the school portfolio.

367
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,000
First, I will explain related law.

368
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,280
Education Law 25, the record of school life.

369
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:25,960
I'm trying to make a thesis convention between our school and Seoul University. What do you think about it?

370
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,700
We need to beef up the specs for school portfolios.

371
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,230
I know a professor from Seoul University. Should I ask him?

372
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,320
Great idea. The professor can write a book for us too.

373
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,230
Also, Don't you think we should have our kids play golf or an instrument for extracurricular activity?

374
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:45,150
Yes. Let's make a club and improve our school portfolios.

375
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,850
Wait, do you have to write a paper when going to college?

376
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,820
Why would a high school student write a paper..

377
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,330
Is this your first time to the meeting?

378
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,430
Soju may sit heavy on your stomach. Drink slowly.

379
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:23,030
Nowadays, the parents send their kids to school, but I had no idea what they were saying.

380
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,960
Should we also join the operating meeting or whatever?

381
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,550
Do you think anyone can do that? I heard that you have to pay a lot for that.

382
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,400
Everyone was a doctor, lawyer, company CEO. It was no joke.

383
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,230
What are we going to do about our Eun Ho? Is there any way to get money?

384
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,340
If we need to, we can sell our house, right?

385
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:51,740
We don't own the house! And on top of that, because of that housing warranty issue-!

386
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,610
I have to go sleep...

387
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:58,520
I told you not to do it! I said no, but you still tricked me!

388
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,700
Why did you call me this time...?

389
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,660
Does something have to happen for me to call you?

390
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:09,050
It's alright to have some tea with the homeroom teacher and the parents.

391
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,140
Sit down, sit.

392
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,360
I'll get straight to the point.

393
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,650
We would like to check our children's school profiles.

394
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,800
We don't have access to NEIS so can you please show it to us yourself?

395
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,870
National Education Information System has records on every teacher and student in Korea.

396
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,260
What?

397
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:33,400
What is that surprising?

398
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:40,020
Excuse me Ma'am, but the reason you can't check it yourself is because it's against the regulations.

399
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,040
As a general rule, viewing school profiles during the semester is-

400
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:48,000
We all have our own reasons, which is why we're asking you to show it to us.

401
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,570
I heard you weren't going to submit the professionally written version of my child's school profile.

402
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:56,420
I've been keeping it strongly in mind as I write my own, so please don't feel the need to worry.

403
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,060
No, eacher. You shouldn't keep it in mind, but put it in exactly as how it was written.

404
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,010
Don't even change one word!

405
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,190
Why can't you seem to understand me?

406
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:12,330
If you've been keeping it in mind, then you can at least let us see how much.

407
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:28,440
I... intend to follow the rules regarding viewing rights as well as all other rules established by the Ministry of Education.

408
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,700
It's not possible for me to reveal the teacher's written evaluation portion of the profile during the semester.

409
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,680
If you have something to ask of me that is possible, please feel free to contact me anytime.

410
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,910
Then, I'll be going.

411
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,410
Don't worry too much about him. I'll take care of Teacher Sim.

412
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:50,720
He's still a amateur so I don't think he's aware of his surroundings.

413
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,050
This isn't going my way either.

414
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,820
Are you okay?

415
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,650
And you?

416
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:04,340
I'm 18 yet my life is horrible.

417
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,100
It's better than a 28 year old having a horrible life.

418
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,810
You're living well.

419
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,060
That's the first time that I've heard that.

420
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,630
What?

421
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,750
That I'm living well.

422
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:53,130
I just thought that you were at least living better than me.

423
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,370
Yes.

424
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,580
Principal.

425
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:11,820
Teacher Sim, why are you that inflexible?

426
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,550
They're just asking to see the school profiles. What's so difficult about that?

427
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:20,050
If we help each other with these kinds of issues, both parties reap the rewards.

428
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,340
Still, you know,

429
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,630
revealing the entire school profile is officially not allowed.

430
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:29,950
Home room teacher can reference any time.

431
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:35,000
So you can take a picture or whatever. They just want to check it.

432
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,410
Still, that's a little...

433
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,020
Ah, seriously! Do you want me to fire you?!

434
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,450
What?

435
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:47,720
He won't end up firing you because you'll end up listening to us.

436
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:56,660
I don't understand. It's not officially possible, so why do I need to-

437
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:02,120
There's no such thing as impossible! Providing mutual aid is a good thing!

438
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,050
Thanks to whom is this school running?

439
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,870
Thanks to whom?

440
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,380
Stop.

441
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,710
Do you have time tonight?

442
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:41,280
At night?

443
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:51,480
It's very much like an official job. So don't get fluttered by yourself.

444
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,490
I don't. I definitely don't, and if I did, I wouldn't give you my time.

445
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,200
Really?

446
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,470
Then there's nothing I can do about it.

447
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:15,870
Why are you like that? What is it?

448
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,720
I finally found it. The storage room key.

449
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,560
That... why?

450
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,450
Why are you so surprised?

451
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:54,550
What? When was I...

452
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,860
But why there?

453
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,160
Who knows? It might be a hiding place for X.

454
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,540
We have to check. I got you.

455
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,820
- Let's go.
- The storage room is...

456
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,200
Excuse me! Hold on.

457
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,880
Hold on!

458
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,640
Hold up!

459
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,200
It's dirty there.

460
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,440
There's a lot of dust.

461
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,110
A cramp, cramp.

462
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:55,340
Very ambiguous attitude.

463
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,690
I think he caught on.

464
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,390
This is just a storage room.

465
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:25,200
Exactly how did 'X' find out and escape?

466
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,710
Because of the recent rise of incidents in school, you all need to please be careful.

467
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:32,550
The school is under investigation and they are searching everywhere which might be a hiding place for X,

468
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,460
so don't uselessly do something strange..

469
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,280
Let's just all do what we're supposed to do.

470
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:04,100
If he's not here, that means he moved to somewhere else.

471
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,690
So he's making me feel competitive.

472
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:13,670
Where does it say that he has to be hiding out at the school...?

473
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:38,060
There's no way this is real.

474
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:07,210
The day before

475
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,320
Why do I have to do this?

476
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:27,670
Hey. I've been working this hard for this school, so you need to help me out at least this much.

477
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,060
Am I your servant or what?

478
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:34,410
You. Can you really make that horrible math competition disappear?

479
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,420
Whenever I think about that art competition they didn't tell me about, my blood pressure goes straight up.

480
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,620
Hey. It's me.

481
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:45,810
You want to die?

482
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,910
Quickly pack these things.

483
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:58,320
But if it weren't for our homeroom teacher, we'd be screwed.

484
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,830
This thing, put it in that box, quickly.

485
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:10,540
It's heavy! Quickly, quickly. Put it in.

486
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,310
Quickly put it in.

487
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,920
We will be able to check on the personal profiles today, right?

488
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,780
Yes, we will be able to have you check up on them with the school ID,

489
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:33,970
but editing is only available by the homeroom teacher.

490
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,100
It has been posted. The students' personal profiles from the school.

491
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,780
Who did it?

492
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,620
Quickly!

493
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,580
Teacher

494
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,920
Please move.

495
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,360
School record is everywhere

496
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,650
Oh my!

497
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,140
Look at this.

498
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,000
Wow

499
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,580
Daebak! Hey, I think our homeroom teacher is a stalker!

500
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,640
This is totally close observation comments.

501
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,120
Han Deok Soo. He always listens to everything around him

502
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,830
There's a rumor saying that we're going to have four mock examinations.

503
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,130
while showing extreme talent in collecting information.

504
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:24,990
Won Byeong Goo. He is always entertaining those around him with the most cheerful face

505
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,690
It would be lemon-heart dropping-avengers, right?

506
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:28,920
He's totally a Waikiki face
 (When you say "Waikiki" you smile widely)

507
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,170
Ra Eun Ho's raising a bird? She's a total Mandela for nature preservation!

508
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:36,760
His ability to use language in a creative manner is particularly outstanding.

509
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,680
Hwang Yeong Geon. She has a very unique personality.

510
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,050
She has strong leadership skills and always takes responsibility for what she did.

511
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:44,910
Oh Sa Rang. She has a strong sense of justice and loyalty.

512
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,900
Eun Ho really isn't the culprit. She's innocent.

513
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:53,750
She has a bright and cheerful personality while also being very sure about what she wants to do.

514
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:59,140
Yoo Bit Na. She demonstrates great originality with her ability to convince others using her own completely unique arguments.

515
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:03,420
Ahn Jeong Il. His passion about his path is very strong.

516
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:08,300
Yoon Gyeong Ho. He has a talent for finding true traits in anything.

517
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:12,950
Song Dae Hwi. Not only does he work hard in academics,

518
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:16,860
but his extreme effort and devotion towards being academically advanced is unrivaled.

519
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,640
He ambitiously makes an agreeable studying environment for himself

520
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,770
and frequently makes his own study goals to be successfully fulfilled.

521
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:26,550
Kim Hee Chan. He is a model student,

522
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:30,430
but he is always struggling with the stress of constantly comparing himself with others.

523
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,060
Park Jeong Eun. She frequently helps her friends well.

524
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:36,500
Ma Gun Joo. She is insightful about objects.

525
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,360
Kang Heong Il. His talent for the arts is very prominent.

526
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:46,780
Hyeon Tae Woon. He is mature in a way that he is currently trying to find himself through various ways.

527
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,220
That's the first time I'm hearing that I'm living well.

528
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:54,490
He is a student to look forward to in development of himself.

529
00:57:54,490 --> 00:58:00,560
Ra Eun Ho. She fights injustice with her never-ending bright and clear energy

530
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,150
and has the ability to nurture her dream.

531
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:05,220
We have to fight for equality in every aspect!

532
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,860
An academically lacking student is always a troublemaker.

533
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,660
Just because one is academically lacking doesn't mean that one is a troublemaker.

534
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:16,450
She is always working hard to achieve her dreams, and I wish her hard work will become

535
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:20,980
a big help to achieving her goal.

536
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:36,290
Class 2-1, Student #22, Cho Eun Jung

537
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:37,300
Class 2-1, Student #19, Yoon Jae Hyuk

538
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,560
Class 2-1, Student #24, Choi Hyun Jung

539
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,690
Class 2-1, Student #14, Yeo Seung Eun
Class 2-1, Student #11, Seo Bo Ra

540
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:45,140
Thi.....thi...Does this even make sense? Revealing the students' profiles!

541
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,610
Of course it doesn't make sense.

542
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:50,800
But the even more ridiculous idea is that this was logged in with your ID.

543
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,330
What?

544
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:55,160
We've looked into the login history of the school record site.

545
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,770
and there are no other login record besides your ID yesterday.

546
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:04,730
Wha-.Then quickly catch that guy who used my ID!

547
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,070
We will catch him for sure.

548
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,410
But it was really the principal's ID

549
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:11,790
so we need to catch the principal. I don't know whether or not we should catch the principal though.

550
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:12,680
What!

551
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:17,530
Should we or should we not? Let's just catch you for now.

552
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:19,280
Oh this is a problem.

553
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,650
Let's catch him.

554
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,520
Catch him.

555
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,070
He really did a great job for yours.

556
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:43,180
2017 School Contests Schedule

557
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,440
Second Grade's Mathematics Competition Answer Sheet

558
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,900
It doesn't matter if whatever we try to do helps or not. You at least have to give us the chance.

559
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:01,990
How can the school discriminate among its own students?

560
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,870
The math competition.

561
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:07,000
He prepared for it for an extremely long time with a lot of hard work on his part.

562
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,350
He must have gotten angry after finding out it's predetermined.

563
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,290
He doesn't even know his place.

564
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:31,840
Give it to me.

565
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,110
No, you can't.

566
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,880
Okay, everyone.

567
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It's quiet.

568
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:56,560
Today, I don't have much to say, but let's continue on with improving your student profiles.

569
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,180
This is strange.

570
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,360
Okay, this is the end of announcements.

571
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,730
Teacher! You're the best!

572
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,880
First place in the math competition will surely be you, Tae Woon.

573
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,270
Don't worry and memorize the answers well.

574
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:50,870
Thank you, Principal. I will memorize the answers ambitiously.

575
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:11,220
The math competition was for Hyeon Tae Woon?

576
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,050
Daebak!

577
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:21,720
This is definitely X's work. So X reported on Tae Woon?

578
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,220
Wow. As expected. The son of Chairman Lee is on a totally diff-

579
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,090
different scale.

580
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:12,060
What are you punks looking at?!

581
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:47,650
♫ Believing now in this moment I ♫

582
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:52,870
♫ I sometimes feel insecure and uneasy but ♫

583
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:57,300
♫ When I think about you ♫
