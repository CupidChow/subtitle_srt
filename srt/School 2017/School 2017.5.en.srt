1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,700
I knew it! Song Dae Hwi is X!

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,550
Did you think I wouldn't know cause you weren't wearing your hoodie?

3
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,380
You're really getting on my nerves.

4
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,340
It was you?!

5
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,750
That's right, dummy. You've got quite the consistency streak.

6
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,470
I almost got caught because of you again.

7
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,080
You...

8
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,730
- What?
- You're a copycat, right?

9
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,140
Did you borrow this from Deok Su?

10
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:52,210
School 2017
The things a school record can't record

11
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,640
-  Episode 5 -
Hey, what do you mean "copycat"?

12
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,160
I've never been one to do things if it's not the real deal!

13
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,380
I'm not someone who's desperate enough to copy others.

14
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,650
I hate that kind of thing the most!

15
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,270
I see. Is that so?

16
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,760
Oh my! X is over here!

17
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,450
Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?

18
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,460
When are you going to stop playing around by copying X? Are you an elementary schooler?

19
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,730
Hey!

20
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,450
Whaaat?

21
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,670
What about it?

22
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,760
It really was you?

23
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,850
Does this even make sense?

24
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,180
You've got a horrible bad habit of not believing what people say.

25
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,610
Why are you X? I mean, X is someone who fights for justice-

26
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,420
He's handsome and great at studying.

27
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,950
How is that supposed to be you!

28
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,140
That fits me perfectly. Synchronization 2,000%

29
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,910
What are you even saying?

30
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,910
Here, look then!

31
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,940
On your side,

32
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,190
didn't you not have a wound?

33
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,180
Of course I didn't have one on my side.

34
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,780
Because it's over here.

35
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,310
Oh? Want me to show you?

36
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,680
No! Forget it! Nevermind.

37
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,470
- Shall I drop my pants?
- I said forget it!

38
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,380
You're so sneaky.

39
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,750
Then what does that make this?

40
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,970
I guess that would mean you're X for sure.

41
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,910
I know, right?

42
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,840
You're so- !

43
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Oh-ho! A sudden attack! Whatcha gonna do, huh?

44
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,700
You're saying you're actually X?

45
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,180
Why did you do all those things?

46
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,580
Just because. I was annoyed and bored.

47
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,520
"Just because"? You were "bored"?

48
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,380
Was it fun?

49
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,200
Without knowing anything,

50
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,470
I ran around nonsensically saying I'd catch X. Did you enjoy watching that?

51
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,860
What? Didn't you think I was stupid and pitiful?

52
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,760
Ra Eun Ho...

53
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,870
I was so desperate

54
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,430
You might've done those things just because you were annoyed and bored. But, as for me,

55
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,270
because of that

56
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,800
don't you know how hard it was for me?

57
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,470
I saved you, didn't I? So...

58
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,280
You saved me? Hyun Tae Woon.

59
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,730
Keep your childish games of playing hero limited to yourself.

60
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,610
Ahh! I get it now.

61
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,910
It's cause you're allowed to do it.

62
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,290
Even if you do it and get caught, this is your school.

63
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,450
You've got your father, right?

64
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,300
How can you just say things like that?

65
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,820
It doesn't matter in the end if you get caught, so how about it?

66
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,510
Over here-!

67
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,960
Didn't you hear something just now?

68
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,270
I didn't hear anything.

69
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,830
This really isn't it. It's just full of junk.

70
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,080
I get a certain vibe. I'm sure of it.

71
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,820
Excuse me. Have you always not listened to other people?

72
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,420
Yes.

73
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,190
Hey! If I get caught now, you and I are going to be accomplices!

74
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,310
What about the key? Have you still not found it?

75
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,720
I need to look for it still, but this really isn't it.

76
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,710
- If there's no key, then I'll just have to bust it down.
- Pardon?!

77
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,970
Let go.

78
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,210
Let's just stop this already.

79
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,830
Stop what?

80
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,590
How about you stop those childish pranks?

81
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,700
This is all because of you!

82
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,570
Selfish bastard.

83
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,330
I can't even stand the sight of you.

84
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,290
Report me, then.

85
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,970
If that's what you want to do, then go ahead and do it.

86
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,620
This works out well. I was thinking of quitting these childish pranks anyway.

87
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,770
Yeah. That's what I'm going to do.

88
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,020
That's right. What do you have to fear?

89
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,330
Thanks to your father, this school is your playground,

90
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,370
and the kids are your toys. Isn't that right?

91
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,590
That must be true.

92
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,830
That's the kind of guy I am, isn't it?

93
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,050
You know me so well. So watch what you say to me.

94
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,580
I get that you're angry and I can get that you're dumbfounded.

95
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,870
But don't say things that you don't know.

96
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,230
Of course. I actually dared

97
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,710
to speak such drivel to the chairman's son. How presumptuous of me.

98
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,550
How presumptuous of me.

99
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,510
It's good that you've figured that out now at least.

100
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,210
Where your place is.

101
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,950
Merit-demerit system,

102
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,510
lunch privileges based on grades, public announcement of grades,

103
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,700
it's all been reported to the Office of Education.

104
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,930
They're going crazy that this kind of infringement of human rights against students is possible in today's world.

105
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,800
My apologies.

106
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,170
I was able to appease them this time but...

107
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,890
kids these days aren't like they used to be.

108
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,710
Especially that punk

109
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,140
This time, no matter what methods we have to use, that rascal X will...

110
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,570
It won't be a normal punk.

111
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,680
We should treat it as crime and hold him accountable.

112
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,430
♫Maybe it's not the time yet.♫

113
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:18,240
♫You're too far. I can't reach you.♫

114
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,430
That's right. What do you have to fear?

115
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,660
This school is your playground and the kids your toys.

116
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,690
You don't even know anything.

117
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:38,360
♫ My heart, at some point, started wanting only you ♫

118
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,780
♫ The wind is taking me to you ♫

119
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,550
I get that you're angry and I can get that you're dumbfounded. But don't say things that you don't know.

120
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,630
♫You don't know love has come♫

121
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:03,730
♫It wasn't enough to you who were tired, and was more painful to me.♫

122
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:10,150
♫Just like then, I put you into my eyes.♫

123
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,100
Nam Joo, sit here.

124
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,540
"He's reading a book again," is probably what you're thinking right now.

125
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,520
Bad jerk, I did.

126
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,100
But this book-

127
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,190
I know. You're reading because of the school record. And that you at least have to fill it up with reading record..

128
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,960
You probably don't have any worries.

129
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,570
Why not?

130
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,120
I mean.. your consultant will take care of everything for you.

131
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,050
Spec for your school record.

132
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,210
I guess so.

133
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,520
Are you also volunteering at your dad's company?

134
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,250
My dad's...company?

135
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,980
Have you been volunteering ever since your grandfather owned the company? It has a pretty long history, SinGang Transportation.

136
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,080
Ah.. I found out from looking through some materials.

137
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,210
Why, is there something wrong? You don't seem very good.

138
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,110
No, I'm okay.

139
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,910
You need to check your input details for Sophomore year school record by comparing it to your Freshman year one.

140
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,060
There could be things I've missed.

141
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,290
So, you guys are aware that a full disclosure of your school records is impossible during school year, right?

142
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,640
Can't you just show us?

143
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,070
Write down all your awards, professional licenses, and career visibility..etc.

144
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,520
You must thoroughly plan out your career activities.

145
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,650
-You know that your school record ultimately reflects you, right? Write it in detail.
- Yes.

146
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,920
If you have any questions, always feel free to come talk to me.

147
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,840
Does this make sense? They say this is me.

148
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,940
"Very thoughtful and always prudent."

149
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,700
Do I really have many thoughts?

150
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,890
Well, let's try to have many from now on.

151
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,080
"Honest about self confidence."

152
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,050
That is Hyeon Tae Woon!

153
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,090
"Outspokenly honest."

154
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,150
The school record is such a mess.

155
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,090
What's a school record? When the kids talk about that they go crazy.

156
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,210
It's kind of a 'life' record.

157
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:53,880
People go to colleges with school records these days. It really depends on how well they write one to determine which school to go to.

158
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:00,160
Teacher! I need to consult you first. This is very urgent.

159
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,550
Our Eun Ho! What do we do?

160
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,950
Move, move! We have a patient with a doomed record, we must hurry!

161
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,580
Eun Ho!

162
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,940
Please take a sit here.

163
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,850
Doctor, please save our Eun Ho, she has to go to college.

164
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,870
Just believe in me.

165
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,340
She may not have a lot, but she has a good heart and eats well!

166
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,470
Please take care of her!

167
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,680
What do I do...

168
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,640
Sit down.

169
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,000
Let's do this well.

170
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,380
Chart.

171
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,530
6th rank? What a disaster.

172
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,640
Let's not look at her grades for now, but how is her school record?

173
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,240
It is difficult for her to get into prestigious school with her school record.

174
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,140
Her school record is empty.

175
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,560
She not only needs record of awards and volunteering hours, but she also needs a reading record.

176
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,540
It seems like she has no hope.

177
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,340
She is rank 6, and has too many demerits that..

178
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,410
Others might potentially be affected negatively.

179
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,830
She doesn't have any extracurricular activities either.

180
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,550
Re-filling those in is nearly impossible.

181
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,240
I guess the only way is to obtain detailed evaluations for each subject from her teacher. How much there is left from now onwards?

182
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,660
She has completed the first semester of Sophomore year. Once she becomes a senior..

183
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,960
She won't have time to take care of her school record since she will be busy studying.

184
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,150
So I demanded not performing this surgery!

185
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:48,060
School record is extremely important in college application, but how would she able to go to a college with this inadequate school record?

186
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,640
Scapel.

187
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,560
Isn't it better since it's not wholly based on grades?

188
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,690
So the colleges will be choosing students who are well-rounded rather than students who only focus on their grades.

189
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,850
That's right. "What am I good at, what's my dream?"

190
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,770
What truly matters to students should be prioritized.

191
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,640
Adding every line of records costs money, teacher.

192
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,020
In order to add a variety of activities in the school portfolio, paying to go to academies with respect to each activity is essential.

193
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,010
Then what does that mean? If you're going to grade-based schools then you can just study hard..

194
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,980
But are you saying you can't even go to record-based schools if you can't afford the specialized academy?

195
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,840
That's correct.

196
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,040
Then, I guess going to colleges with your grades is way better.

197
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:52,250
So, your school record is strangely ... a mess.

198
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,970
At this rate, there's probably no college I could attend right?

199
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,630
Yes?

200
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,350
You still have a little bit of time, so let's figure this out together.

201
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:21,550
Yes, but Teacher, are there any art contests at our school?

202
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,690
I don't know, I haven't heard of such.

203
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,560
If there were something like that I would work really hard, like really hard.

204
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,160
I'll try to find out about it.

205
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,770
Anyway, let's not give up on your school record, let's try everything.

206
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,500
Also, accept advice from seniors who have been provisionally admitted to colleges.

207
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,400
Seniors? Seniors?

208
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:50,140
Hey Sunbae Jong Geun. I have questions to ask you regarding the school portfolio.

209
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,870
Should I go to your school tomorrow?

210
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,250
Oh.. backpacking travel. Your girl..friend?

211
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,050
Are you perhaps part of a CC now? (CC = campus couple)

212
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,790
Con...gratulations.

213
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:16,070
Sunbae, I'll call you another time. Yes.

214
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,280
He is an obvious betrayer.

215
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,960
You shouldn't have been involved with him long ago.

216
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:33,540
Look who's talking. If I hadn't been falsely accused and received tons of demerits, then I could've been accepted to Korea University.

217
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,320
That Han Gook University...

218
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,610
What? If you weren't at the teacher's office that day-

219
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,940
That was supposed to be my last, I was going to quit, but you interfered, it's because of you.

220
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,880
Because of me? What kind of excuse...?

221
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,750
I could've put an end to it only if you hadn't been falsely accused, you idiot!

222
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,300
Why didn't you put an end to it? You put an end and I put an end. Why didn't you? Why not?

223
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,730
How could I do that?

224
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,580
Hey, even if I get caught and leave this school,

225
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,570
even though I don't have much a future, you have friends,

226
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,500
and that webtoon or whatever as a cheesy dream.

227
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,360
I just thought that you should keep going to this school, okay?

228
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,000
So cheesy, did I have to say that?

229
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:31,670
Anyway, did you really think I would let it go?

230
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:37,880
Hey son of the director, I will be forever watching you carefully so be careful.

231
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,450
Where are you going?

232
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,540
Why do you need to know?

233
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,400
Didn't you say you were going to watch me carefully? This is not the right way to keep a good eye on me.

234
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,630
Since I feel bad for what I did, I'll at least offer some consideration for you.

235
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,500
So you can comfortably keep an eye on me.

236
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,030
- Tae Woon
- Yeah?

237
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,130
Does the world revolve around you?

238
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,240
Yes.

239
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,140
Why are there so many comics, it's not my style...

240
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,740
Why are you reading comics? Do you think I'll possibly read one?

241
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,350
Leave.

242
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,940
I'm not leaving.

243
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,170
I said I'm not leaving.

244
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,850
You saw this right?

245
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,830
I saw it in the movie.

246
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,630
If you want to wear a mask, you at least need to have justice

247
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,860
or the desire to save others

248
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,880
If not those, then you at least must have the spirit of self-sacrifice.

249
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,380
Right, X?

250
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,020
Ah seriously.

251
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:13,340
Why did you do it X? Why on earth did you do it?

252
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,770
I just did it. It just happened that way.

253
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,890
School was suffocating so to make it interesting...

254
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,060
Is that really all of it?

255
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,020
That really is all of it.

256
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,230
Here.

257
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,050
Hey, I'm not interested in reading comics.

258
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,380
♫ Our summer days are flashing by ♫

259
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,190
♫ In between the spilling sunlight ♫

260
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,350
♫ When I think of you my heart jumps ♫

261
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,530
I wasn't laughing because it's funny.

262
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,110
I was laughing because it's immature.

263
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,580
In any case,

264
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:25,240
Since you laughed you should repay me. Right?

265
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,030
♫ When I catch sight of you I start to smile. ♫

266
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:34,080
It's hot.

267
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,660
Why you...

268
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:45,070
Let's smile a bit.

269
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,230
This is just manual labour. Forget it. I 'm not doing this.

270
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,030
If you say so. I should hurry and go to your father.

271
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,560
Hyeon Tae Woon is X-

272
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,800
Do you really want to stay with me that bad?

273
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,190
No.

274
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,030
♫ My heart is thumping all day. ♫

275

283
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,160
Don't miss what I said last time.

284
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,620
Song Dae Hwi!

285
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,850
Working hard I see.

286
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,890
What are you doing here?

287
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,190
You're still like this.

288
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,090
-Let's go.
-We'll be going. Keep up the hard work.

289
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,710
Good Bye.

290
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,530
My mom is here?

291
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,420
Yes.

292
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,500
Ah that's right, is the performance assessment done yet?

293
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,260
Yeah just a second. This is art,

294
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,230
Musical performance and this is history.

295
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,640
Thanks. You wouldn't have had time to study yourself.

296
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,590
You did mine too.

297
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,220
It's not like I'm doing it for free or anything.

298
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,070
School Records

299
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,370
Natural Sciences and Humanities are in balance.

300
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,190
It's beneficial to talk about these things in front of the interviewer.

301
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,900
The subject related to multi-culture studies is decent, but

302
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:49,340
if it is way too extreme and lacks anything exceptional, then it is a minus.

303
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,840
We didn't know something like this was disadvantageous.

304
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,400
Time's up. That's an hour.

305
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,570
Teacher, I'll increase the consultation fee please give us another 10 minutes.

306
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,610
All right. Let's see then.

307
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,040
I see you're at the top of your class.

308
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,790
Still, it'd be hard to get into Seoul University.

309
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,590
There is nothing notable in your award-winning career.

310
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,720
With the awards you've earned

311
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,230
you need to well plan out how to link your self-reflection essay and the interview.

312
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,430
First of all, you lack school awards. There is no impact.

313
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:38,190
You mean.. school contests?

314
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,750
I think this much will be enough to help you out.

315
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,130
Dae Hwi, hand us that down there and then you can go.

316
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,650
I bought you a bag, in a cooler colour since it's summer.

317
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,270
Thank you.

318
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,010
Our Hui Chan has no problems in the admission process for first rate University, right?

319
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,990
Of course not. His school record is outstanding.

320
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,120
You do realize that the college admission process emphasizes school records, right?

321
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,730
It will be great if he added the school contest records on top of this.

322
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,440
There will be a few school contests soon anyway.

323
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,340
And for volunteering, it's the best if he did some medical services.

324
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,280
it looks very considerate and heartwarming. It's the best to earn some good points.

325
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,680
That's easy, all of his aunties and uncles are doctors after all.

326
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,010
Because of Won Young's parents,

327
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,510
the school is becoming better.

328
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,490
That's a given when you're looking after kids.

329
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,070
How great it is that there are mothers with hearts like yours.

330
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:08,320
There are so many parents who don't look after their children and neglect them.

331
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Not everyone has rights to be a parent.

332
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,460
But, it's already the first semester of sophomore year. Don't you think we should finalize the school record problem?

333
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,880
Right. Before they take the final exam,

334
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,550
I'm thinking about assembling all the school contests.

335
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,790
That's true. It's hard to take care of school record once they become seniors.

336
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,940
Of course.

337
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,180
No, no. It's my job to take care of them.

338
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,920
School Transcript

339
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,620
How is it that you can't beat Dae Hwi even once.

340
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,940
I can't go to first rate nniversity anyway!

341
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,170
Anyway, second place is like losing.

342
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,470
You have to win next time. Got it?

343
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,410
Understood.

344
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:20,800
Here. There will be a math contest soon, so solve this.

345
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,660
I printed out predicted practice problems.

346
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,570
Seriously, what is wrong with you Teacher Sim?

347
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,750
Even so, giving all the kids opportunities fairly is part of equal opportunity...

348
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,620
I'm so frustrated that you don't understand what I mean.

349
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,690
Don't you know that trying to cater to everyone will end up leading to failure for everyone?

350
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,160
Choice and focus is important for writing a school portfolio.

351
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,460
There are students who need particular specs anyway.

352
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,470
Giving more opportunities to the minority who can take more advantage of them,

353
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,640
that's what equal opportunity is.

354
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,570
But even so, once this period of focusing on improving school records has passed, it's going to be difficult for the students to improve their records later.

355
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,010
Anyway, even if we give the students the opportunity...

356
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,840
they can't go to university.

357
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,670
- Why does the school discriminate?
- School is the place to learn to discriminate.

358
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,490
-Excuse me.
-What do you want?

359
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,850
The homeroom teacher wants you to come and consult with him about your school record.

360
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,940
Why? I dare you to go tell on us to the teacher again.

361
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,930
I can't believe anything you say.

362
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:53,440
You listen very well to teachers.

363
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,900
If you don't come, he said he's going to make you..

364
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,370
talk to Suzy teacher about the school violence.

365
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,340
Whatever the admission officer said..

366
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,670
doesn't really affect you negatively that much.

367
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,550
As long as you show them positive attitude after the school violence-

368
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,720
Do you understand what I mean?

369
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,400
I'm not going to college.

370
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,650
Do you not get what I'm saying?

371
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,890
How am I supposed to go to college with my grades?

372
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,100
Should I go to college with my flawed school record, containing a bunch of demerits?

373
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,130
Teacher Shim.

374
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:58,720
Don't waste your efforts on kids like that. It's enough if you just write a line or two.

375
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,050
What she's saying is right. It's not like they'll be able to go to college anyway.

376
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:09,500
You said before to group choice and focus together.

377
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,080
I'm going crazy.

378
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,310
What's wrong?

379
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:34,090
I need to fill up my school record, but there is no way.

380
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:41,040
What do you think about publishing your own Webtoon?

381
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,970
No.. like if the people's responses are good, it could help with the application.

382
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,470
Publish..

383
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:52,210
I thought that I would have to do it sooner or later... Do you think it'll work out?

384
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,280
I think it would. You draw well.

385
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,020
Really? You really think so?

386
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,770
You... Have you seen my drawings before?

387
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,840
Yes, of course.

388
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:17,070
It must be nice for you... You don't have to worry about things like this because you're ranked 1st.

389
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,840
That's right... We have to go clean.

390
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,680
River Jordan teacher...

391
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,440
If you're going to clean poorly like this, there will be more cleaning days!

392
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,260
- Okay.
- Okay.

393
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,010
Go on!

394
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,640
Congratulations, you're first.

395
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,050
There aren't any more drawing competitions now, right?

396
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,730
I'm sure.

397
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:51,180
Teacher. There were drawing competitions?

398
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,210
I'll be going now.

399
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,150
When did the contest open? I had no idea.

400
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:04,980
That... I sent a notice. You probably didn't see it.

401
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,880
I didn't see any notice.

402
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,150
You didn't by any chance not let me know on purpose, right?

403
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:17,080
You need to be in a higher class rank for a better college admission anyway.

404
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,250
- It wouldn't help you much.
- No... If it

405
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,890
helps me or not, you still have to give me the same chance.

406
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:28,800
How could a school discriminate among students?

407
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,530
Look at how you're talking!

408
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,440
I'm going to say one more thing.

409
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,330
Every student in Geumdo High School

410
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,960
have their own important lives and they are all desperate.

411
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,910
Is the future only vital for the top student?

412
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,700
Is there already a notice in the staff room?

413
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,720
A notice of the contest?

414
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,100
Aren't you guys here to ask about the math contest?

415
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,740
Tae Woon, the Chairman...

416
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,000
Anyway, you'll be contacted.

417
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,780
You're still living like that?

418
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,900
You're still listening to your father well.

419
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,580
You live your life properly.

420
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,740
Aigoo, isn't it time for you to do your homework?

421
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,690
What would a bastard like you know?

422
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,220
I know much. Why?

423
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,910
Are you expecting to gain something while you're with him?

424
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,190
Shut your mouth.

425
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,310
Anyway,

426
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,060
a bastard like you in a math contest?

427
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,480
There will be a math contest soon.

428
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,030
Make sure to memorize this answer document.

429
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,110
I'm not going out to that.

430
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,720
Give this opportunity to kids who are desperate.

431
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,520
Exactly what are you not satisfied with?

432
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,500
This is an opportunity that even those who want it can't have.

433
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,300
So that's why I'm saying that I don't want it, because it's embarrassing.

434
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,290
You were not being a troublesome for a while, but are you now ready for some smack or something?

435
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,040
Don't worry. I won't cause trouble.

436
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:39,470
You're going to block it anyway. Like how you did when I beat my friend up, or when my friend died.

437
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,620
If you know, don't do anything rash. Get ahold of yourself.

438
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,140
I'm not going to let you live according to how you want to.

439
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,720
Kim Joon Gi.

440
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,220
Kim Joon Gi! Tae Woon.

441
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,370
The black box recorded it like that?

442
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:44,180
So the fact is that Im Joon Gi suddenly got in the path of the bus.

443
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,560
He's going to drop out anyway.

444
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,080
Song Dae Hwi

445
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,540
Right. There's nothing else for the school to do except to care about basic responsibilities.

446
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:17,040
It would be nice if you picked a title like that. Anyways, I'll leave you to take care of it. Yes.

447
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,480
Yes, hello?

448
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,370
Yes, Director.

449
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,720
I don't know how to tell you this...

450
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,410
The Chairman sent you this.

451
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,300
Geum Do High's Chairman Hyeon Kang Woo

452
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,380
I know.

453
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,580
Geum Do High's Chairman Hyeon Kang Woo

454
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,560
We decided to bury him tomorrow.

455
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:08,800
There is no one to come anyway. And there will be a lingering grudge if we delay this process.

456
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,340
I want him to quickly leave this world and live happily in the heaven.

457
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,920
What about Tae Woon?

458
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,710
Thank you, Dae Hwi.

459
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,170
Joon Gi used to brag about you a lot.

460
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,910
That you were good at studying, looked handsome, and that you were kind on top of that.

461
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:05,060
Whenever he opened his mouth, he always talked about you and Tae Woon.

462
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:11,280
He said that he wanted to quit school,

463
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,480
but after he met you two,

464
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,020
Only if he was a little younger..

465
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:43,270
My Joon Gi..

466
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,510
He's so pitiful, what do I do... Our Joon Gi.

467
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,350
You guys are so pitiful, what do I do?

468
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,440
You guys are so pitiful.

469
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,540
Geum Do High's Chairman Hyeon Kang Woo

470
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,940
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

471
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,400
Please let him just go once.

472
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,240
Our Joon Gi. Please let him just go around the school once.

473
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,940
I would like to too, but I can't. I'm sorry.

474
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,310
Our poor Joon Gi. Please just once, please let me take him around once.

475
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,410
Do something about it.

476
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:16,090
If the ambulance comes into school, the students will be distracted.

477
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:20,220
-It's exam period too.
-You're right.

478
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:27,060
If we kindle any rumors, everyone will start talking about them.

479
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,310
Father.

480
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,980
Just once, please..

481
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,650
Please let Joon Gi around the school.

482
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,550
I beg you.

483
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:17,210
Please. Please let him go once around.

484
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,910
I'll be good to you from now on.

485
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:27,140
Father, please. Please. Please let him take a lap around school.

486
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,520
To Joon Gi, I..

487
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:46,420
Just once! Just once please!

488
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,010
Whether it was the past or it is the present,

489
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,270
Why do things turn out like this?

490
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:36,810
♫ Let's go home. The day is getting dark ♫

491
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:43,080
♫ So that my tired feet can rest ♫

492
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,370
Hey!

493
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:52,250
♫ Like fluttering in the wind  ♫

494
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:58,620
♫ So my wavering heart can rest as well ♫

495
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:03,920
Why do you make me deliver all the way here with just a coupon?

496
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:11,290
I heard a pretty lady will be delivering. Is she coming?

497
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,240
You..are making excuses, right?

498
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,810
Did you possibly-

499
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:28,170
- What's wrong with you?
- Call me to annoy me?

500
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,850
How did you know?

501
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,930
I'll come up with other excuses next time.

502
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,530
What is up with you?

503
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,320
Did you get caught by your father?

504
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,350
Am I you? Getting myself caught all the time.

505
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,530
Are you not working your part-time job today?

506
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:15,780
I already went and rushed over here.

507
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,220
You live such a engergetic life.

508
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:27,270
Of course. I have to live doing everything I can.

509
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,760
So that I don't feel sorry.

510
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,190
I'm living my life in place of someone else.

511
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:48,760
So I'm going to live my life to the fullest, for both that person and myself.

512
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,250
If you feel bad, then you should at least live smiling.

513
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,890
So,

514
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,030
stop dawdling your life away and put some effort into living.

515
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:11,700
You.. you probably think of him more than I do.

516
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,730
♫ The white winter, which is piled up with sorrow ♫

517
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:23,010
♫ When spring comes and the flowers bloom ♫

518
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:28,170
♫ will pass ♫

519
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:34,640
2017 Mathematics Competition Announcement

520
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:09,080
Are you really going to participate?

521
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,470
Yes, I'm going to try.

522
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:19,350
I heard the professor of Seoul University is the judge. It seems like the difficulty of problems is no joke.

523
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:25,210
If you haven't prepared hard enough, I heard it is hard to solve them.

524
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:31,580
But I am pretty confident in math. You never know until you try.

525
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,520
Ok, I understand.

526
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,130
Work hard.

527
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:50,830
High School Self-Study Books

528
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,460
Have you solved any problems on the math contest?

529
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:49,510
They are so hard. I still don't understand how to do them even though I know the answers.

530
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:55,870
Math contest problems? What do you mean you know the answers?

531
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:06,790
- Hey, well..
- Just tell him so he doesn't waste time.

532
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,940
This test is extremely important. so..

533
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:23,780
Do you guys have the answer document?

534
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:29,720
Isn't Hyeon Tae Woon going to win this contest anyway?

535
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,980
We're not the only ones doing this.

536
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,940
Hyeon Tae Woon is participating in the math contest?

537
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:55,940
You already know. Everyone is involved in building their specs.  (Adding to their resume)

538
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:01,100
This time, you shouldn't meddle.

539
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,920
I can't meddle?

540
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,630
Good for all of you.

541
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,040
Did I hear something wrong?

542
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,590
You heard me correctly.

543
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,450
Money is great, indeed.

544
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,920
Since having a rich father evidently makes you smarter, too.

545
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,010
What was that, you punk?

546
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:43,640
Let go. If you keep getting in my way, it's going to be the end for both of you.

547
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,740
What an ego.

548
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,340
What's wrong with him?

549
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,140
The mathematics competition. He studied like crazy for it not knowing anything.

550
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:12,020
I guess he got upset since it's predetermined.

551
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,680
He doesn't even know his place.

552
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,010
I see you haven't changed.

553
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:22,300
What hasn't?

554
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,230
You're still a low-life scum.

555
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,580
You came at a good time! Come here!

556
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,200
This is my son.

557
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,040
What are you doing?

558
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:26,890
I'm applying for a credit card but I need a guarantor.

559
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:31,290
He's a high school student though. Will that be okay?

560
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,720
Technically, no.

561
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,310
But as long as he writes a vow that he'll take joint responsibility when he comes of age it should be fine.

562
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:40,860
Dae Hwi, you need to fill out this, here.

563
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:45,560
Your name and your contact information. Fill this in for me.

564
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,080
What's wrong with you?!

565
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,410
What are you doing!

566
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:56,880
Please, stop.

567
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,070
Please, just stop.

568
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:04,530
I'm asking you to please stop all this!

569
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:16,500
Stop this, please!

570
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,940
I'm begging you. Please, just stop.

571
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:28,840
Our Dae Hwi, you got first place in Korea University's essay contest!

572
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,580
You'll be a shoo-in for acceptance into Korea University.

573
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,370
Congratulations

574
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:36,000
- Teacher
- Yes?

575
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,100
I can't go to Korea University.

576
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:43,040
- What?
- My family can't afford to send me to private universities.

577
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,650
I have to get into Seoul University. No matter what.

578
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:51,740
You're worried about your school record's credentials.

579
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,860
You must acquire a lot of school contest awards in order for that to be possible.

580
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:59,960
That's right. But... There aren't many...

581
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:05,240
There are three contests left this semester.

582
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:09,300
Even if I win all of them, it's only going to be 3 lines.

583
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:14,420
Teacher, this upcoming mathematics competition-

584
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:19,400
That's right! You're participating in the upcoming mathematics competition! You have to make sure you get first place.

585
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,650
Seoul University heavily considers math and science competitions.

586
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:27,140
Plus, you're ahead of the rest when it comes to math, aren't you?

587
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,810
Yes, thank you.

588
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,230
Do well on the test. You can go to Seoul University.

589
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,810
Yes.

School Mathematics Competition

591
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:18,550
I see you're first in the school. Even so, it will be hard to get in Seoul University.

592
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,070
Why...

593
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:25,050
First off, you have too few school awards so you're lacking impact.

594
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:29,700
You know how it is. Everyone is trying to build up their specs.

595
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,620
This isn't something you can meddle in this time.

How can a storyline be so...

598
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:14,020
Why did the hero have to give out lemonade of all things?

599
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,380
You have to make that inner struggle clear!

600
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,300
What is it? That inner struggle feeling?

601
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,540
When did you get so close?

602
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,640
What is that feeling?

603
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,550
You numbskull of a girl

604
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,500
You don't need to know!

605
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,060
What could it be?

606
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:44,630
He just gives out the lemonade. What else could there be?

607
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,730
What could it be?

608
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:57,000
Here's the deal, if you empathize a little more with the hero

609
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,170
wouldn't you be able to understand what he was feeling?

610
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,940
This is difficult.

611
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:10,660
Very difficult. How am I supposed to empathize with the hero?

612
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,290
Where are you going?

613
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:15,280
Getting some fresh air.

614
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,390
At this time of night?

Don't meet up with Song Dae Hwi anymore. Don't even get involved with him.

01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,940
I finally found it. The key to the storage room. I've got you now.
