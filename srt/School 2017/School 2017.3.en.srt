1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,920
2nd Floor

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,000
Corn Syrup

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,180
Sticky Syrup

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,890
Why am I there?!

5
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,090
Wow... you!
Student

6
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,820
Stupid Principal Resign!

7
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,260
If the culprit was seen, then you should be clear of your verdict.

8
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,570
What is this situation?

9
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,930
They said I trespassed in the Teacher's Office and attempted a theft.

10
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,730
This is all because of that little punk.

11
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,330
What kind of guy is he even?

12
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,340
A jerk.

13
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,970
See you.

14
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,300
Eun bbal (nickname). Don't worry too much.

15
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,530
Okie.

16
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,450
See you.

17
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,390
See you tomorrow.

18
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,870
Stop right there!

19
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,400
Hey!

20
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,680
We've got you at last.

21
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,530
So...

22
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,730
School 2017
Doubt your friends

23
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,930
Do you think that makes sense?
-  Episode 3

24
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,230
I'm telling the truth! I just imitated what looked cool to me...

25
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,850
He seems to be telling the truth.

26
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,050
This friend here was at the crime case last time as well.

27
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,710
You rascals, really.

28
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,550
-What is he?
-I caught him throwing eggs.

29
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,940
He said that he imitated the culprit. I think he's telling the truth.

30
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,010
Give them a huge punishment.

31
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,250
Is school a joke? How dare you guys do this?

32
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,990
That's because the school is ruled by a bad leader.

33
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,770
That is true, but...

34
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,010
Hello?

35
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,050
Yes, Chairman.

36
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,690
Drone

37
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,490
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,750
Yes. I will come see you.

39
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,060
What's wrong? Is he not letting them off the hook?

40
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,820
Did they say to give up if we don't catch that guy?

41
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,300
Why can't you stay quiet?

42
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,290
I don't want to see anyone, so get out. Get out.

43
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,940
Follow me.

44
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,860
We will catch you.

45
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,520
Hey, Ra Eun Ho. The principal wants to see you.

46
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,060
Why?

47
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,200
At this rate, I'll become the principal's best friend.

48
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,560
Accomplice?

49
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,530
I'm just saying that it's possible.

50
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,050
Why did you come in at that time to create a fuss?

51
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,510
If he hadn't done anything, you could've just taken all the blame.

52
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,490
No! I'm being truthful.

53
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:29,890
In any case, I was going to give you a huge chance.

54
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,310
Anonymity. I will guarantee that for you so,

55
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:42,410
I'm saying for you students to not worry and just focus on your studies.

56
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,860
You get merits for reporting demerits.

57
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,260
I don't believe this.

58
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,290
You will be given 5 merit points for each report.

59
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,530
Hiding your friend's wrongdoings...how is that a friend?

60
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,870
You must report them... that is the right thing to do.

61
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,990
I'm saying that.

62
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,610
Who is it?

63
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,550
Daebak!

64
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,470
Demerit points will regularly be posted on the bulletin board.

65
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,150
After two weeks,

66
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,480
I will announce the ten most likely accomplices.

67
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,950
To those who are caught,

68
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,570
I will suspend them and give them the punishment they deserve.

69
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,420
Aish. Why is he trying to make us scared?

70
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,170
It's like 'Accuse each other' using our student record a hostage.

71
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,800
He's basically saying to report anyone if you don't want demerits.

72
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,420
What do you think, School President?

73
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,350
We just need to not report each other then, right?

74
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,100
- Right. That's right.

75
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,200
How can we believe that?

76
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,930
Crazy school. They even do this.

77
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,420
I think this happened because of me.

78
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,090
What?!

79
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,990
You want me to catch the culprit?

80
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,440
You said you wanted to get rid of your demerit points. Then catch the culprit!

81
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,420
Then you're saying this reward snd punishment system is so they can find out who X is?

82
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,920
If I kept watching the other students, I'll look suspicious.

83
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,310
Aish, the principal is really something.

84
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,100
That means that X is trying to catch us.

85
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,340
If I don't catch him,

86
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,100
I won't be able to go to any university, including Korea University.

87
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,120
You can go to Korea University.

88
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,610
Really? I can really attend Korea University?

89
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,760
Excuse me, she's in the lowest ranking group. Is that okay?

90
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,720
She's in the 280th place.

91
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,020
You need to get at least 3rd place in the contest.

92
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,670
If you send in your artwork portfolio, you have a high chance of acceptance.

93
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,630
School records...

94
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,730
Excuse me, is it okay if she has a lot of demerits?

95
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,740
She has so many.

96
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,630
That's a little bit...

97
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,420
I'm going to get rid of those demerits.

98
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,840
I'm going to catch X, get rid of my demerits, and get accepted into Korea University.

99
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,420
Okay then.

100
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,570
Yoon Gyeong Woo! Hey, Yoon Gyeong Woo!

101
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,770
Did you really not see him?

102
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,970
He really went up to the rooftop.

103
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,500
Do you really want to meet him? What are you going to do after meeting him?

104
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,680
I'm going to report him.

105
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,100
But he saved you.

106
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,360
That's true.

107
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,940
But I'm in an urgent situation right now. I have to catch him.

108
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,670
Otherwise, I won't be able to go to a university and my life will be over.

109
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,830
Aiyoo. Why does this world make it so that your life is over if you don't go to a university?

110
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,160
Exactly.

111
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,730
But do you think that jerk is messing with me?

112
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,520
Because I look easy?

113
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,390
He must be scared.

114
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:37,760
He must be living a complicated life so he can't register other people's perspectives.

115
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,360
You sound like the culprit.

116
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,230
I don't want to be a snitch.

117
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,050
But that doesn't mean I can't acknowledge what I know.

118
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,110
Don't they teach you this at school?

119
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,260
Snitch? Snitch...

120
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,530
-Ra Eun Ho.
-Ra Eun Ho.

121
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,150
Song Dae Hwi and Hyeon Tae Woon were not at the gym earlier.

122
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,550
Why are you so surprised?

123
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,030
It's nothing. But,

124
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,670
why?

125
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,870
What did they say? Are you free of your verdict?

126
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,630
Yeah. Something similar.

127
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:16,280
Anyway, they will catch the culprit in the end.

128
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,130
The real culprit must be nervous.

129
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,510
Of course.

130
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,420
Do you think the culprit would be safe after doing such a thing?

131
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,740
Tell me if you need any help from the student council.

132
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,520
-Okay.
-Look at you joking.

133
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:06,090
That day? Dae Hwi went out for the banner of the anniversary of the founding of a school.

134
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:12,100
Tae Woon. Tae Woon! He was with the nurse because he wasn't feeling well.

135
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,030
He met me there as well. I wonder if he's feeling better.

136
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,270
Is your song composing going well?

137
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,330
You know that drone?

138
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,450
What?

139
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,700
It probably was to help Eun Ho get rid of her verdict, right?

140
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,490
Yeah, I guess so.

141
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,000
Did the banner come out well?

142
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,280
The banner for the school's anniversary.

143
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,530
Yeah. Just ...

144
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,190
Is it your first time seeing a handsome guy? Why are you so nervous?

145
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,560
It hasn't been long since I had food.

146
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,920
Yeah, you sure ate a lot.

147
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,740
But...

148
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,780
-who do you think X is?
-X?

149
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,690
The kids are all calling him that. There was an X on that figure the other day.

150
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,960
That's really something.

151
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:54,300
He probably did that to save me, right?

152
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,920
The drone.

153
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,710
Are you asking a question or trying to figure it out? Pick one.

154
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,390
Do you think X has so much free time? Enough to fly a drone and save you?

155
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,320
I bet it was to get rid of you because you're acting stupid.

156
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,460
Don't call me stupid.

157
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,560
That guy having a sense of justice? No way.

158
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,920
I don't think so.

159
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,440
Why why why?

160
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,890
Is this real? Do you think this is true?

161
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,950
Don't you think I'd be the most curious?

162
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,530
What the heck? Then that means the culprit is either Hyeon Tae Woon or Song Dae Hwi-

163
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,230
Sorry

164
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,320
There's no way. They aren't the type to do that.

165
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,360
That's what I'm saying.

166
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,350
Song Dae Hwi: Number 1 student in the school, student body president, and expected future student of Seoul University.

167
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:32,180
The student who the principal is most proud of.

168
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,820
Hyeon Tae Woon. The chairman's son.

169
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:40,290
Teachers can't help cringing before the next chairman of Gumdo High School.

170
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,670
Those privileged class have no reason to do harm to the school.

171
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,310
Don't you think this was sent by the real culprit?

172
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,940
He might want us to think that these two are the culprit and divert the attention away from him.

173
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,570
But you said that both of them weren't at the gym.

174
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,720
Well, if you want to approach it like that, I bet there were more absent students.

175
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,790
Song Dae Hwi and Hyeon Tae Woon were not at the gym!

176
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:11,990
So one is the chairman's son and the other is first place?

177
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,170
So the question is which one of them did it?

178
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,320
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

179
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,360
-The rich one is the culprit.
-How's the stew? It's good, right?

180
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,820
Being able to afford to fly a drone just screams that he has a lot of money.

181
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,830
So with that in mind, give me just $5.

182
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,720
-Aigoo.
-Hey.

183
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,600
You didn't mature properly.

184
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,100
Don't the smart kids have a lot of stress? What if the smart guy was releasing his stress in that way?

185
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,060
I made the fish with-

186
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,820
That's right! He studies so much!

187
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,790
Hey hey hey. Don't touch this.

188
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,360
Why?

189
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,950
What am I in this household? Am I just the chef?

190
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,830
Is it hard to just say if my food is good or not?

191
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,000
- It's good! It's so delicious!
- Forget it.

192
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,830
It's so good! Yummy! - Delicious! Tasty!

193
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:15,380
It's very delicious! Woo!

194
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,920
-Is it really good?
-Yes.

195
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:41,060
The rich guy is the culprit. Being able to afford to fly a drone just screams that he has a lot of money.

196
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,200
What the?

197
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,720
Why isn't anyone here?

198
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,200
He came in

199
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,820
Where is my cell phone?

200
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,200
Hey, why are you here?!

201
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,400
I came here on an errand for my father.

202
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,330
What about you?

203
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
Me? I...

204
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,600
I... But why were hiding then?

205
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,790
Because you came in all of a sudden.

206
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:53,320
You seemed to come in to do something strange. You will be scolded if you came to do any harm to school.

207
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,660
That's not...

208
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,310
You keep on...

209
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,360
Wait.

210
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,200
Why did you come out of there?

211
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,620
There was something my father wanted me to deliver.

212
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,590
And what about you?

213
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,630
- Uh, I was...
- She just likes to follow me a lot.

214
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,000
Basta- That's not it. The thing is-

215
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,840
I told you. I am watching you with the possibility of an accomplice.

216
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,230
There's no possibility of that though.

217
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,450
- What?
- She's not that smart and doesn't and lacks attention to detail. She's a bit of a dunce.

218
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:46,300
- Hey! A dunce?!
- Who would want to be an accomplice with her? Unless they want to get caught.

219
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,530
I'll put a good word in with my father.

220
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,560
"Good"?

221
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,950
-Father?
-Hey!

222
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,900
-What? A bit of an idiot? You wanna die?

223
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,850
Hey!

224
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,620
Hey, can't you comprehend the situation?

225
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,680
What?

226
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,880
- Forget about being a bit of an idiot, you're a big idiot.
-Hey!

227
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,840
I think I've just saved you from an almost certain death.

228
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,230
Hey, it's not like that!

229
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,920
Listen. You went into the principal's office, and Goo Yeong Goo finds out.

230
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,740
My gosh.

231
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,730
Should I get any merit points at this chance?

232
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,310
Is this a threat?

233
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,800
Rather than a favor, a threat is more right.

234
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,370
That sounded like a threat, didn't it? A warning to be careful how I work?

235
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,430
I'll put in a good word to my father.

236
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,620
Why would he say good?

237
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,970
Good..good..good.

238
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,910
It was very difficult words.

239
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,390
If we couldn't stop this situation quickly, he would snitch to his dad.

240
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,770
Hey. What is 'snitch'? Too undignified a word for the vice principal.

241
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,010
There's another undignified man in this room.

242
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,900
Anyway, unless we take extraordinary measures,

243
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,160
we will be broken up by the chairman in the near future.

244
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,100
Broken up?

245
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,980
Since we threw bait, he has to bite it.

246
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,370
Now. Slowly begin it.

247
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,160
Because the bait is unbelievable.

248
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,860
List of black points in class 2-1

249
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,130
This reward and punishment system that's making friends doubt and accuse one another,

250
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,410
get rid of it immediately. Don't you find it too inappropriate for a school?

251
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,050
Principal Speaking
How is it "inappropriate for school"? In this day and age, this is exactly the kind of survival method they need to learn!

252
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,250
That's what it is!

253
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,870
If I don't shoot them, they'll shoot me!

254
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:45,390
That's right. Shoot wildly. Shoot friends, students and teachers too. Shoot them all.

255
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:51,190
Ah, kids are really annoying these days. I'm not even their mother.

256
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:02,380
The instant that you leave, the world is a battlefield.

257
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,290
At school brutally...

258
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,170
Viciously...

259
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,750
If you don't discipline severely enough...

260
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:30,130
The students will break down immediately.

261
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,010
No discrimination, Trustworthy Gumdo Highschool

262
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,960
Current Demerit Point Rankings for Second Grade

263
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,790
- There it is
- Hey, what would you do?

264
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,110
Why am I?

265
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,430
That's really nonsense.

266
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,980
Hey, didn't our class agree not to do it?

267
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,010
That's right...

268
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,280
Huh. 39 penalty points?

269
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,920
Alright, that's how they want to do it.

270
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,060
You got a mass load for going in the principal's office.

271
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,800
Ugh, my school records...

272
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,990
Oh! What is this? Song Dae Hwi has 5 penalty points?

273
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,660
Really? Who?

274
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,050
Oh!

275
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,470
Think of it in a good way. Let's use this as our opportunity.

276
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,660
Doesn't Dae Hwi have a weakness? Report something about him!

277
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,560
You and he have just one rank difference. So if he gets huge penalty points and lowers his student record,

278
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,040
you will have an advantage over him in college entrance examination.

279
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,200
Can we just tear that thing down?

280
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,820
Yoo BinNa 13

281
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,430
Who is it?

282
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,160
Hey!

283
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,220
Who snitched? Who?

284
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,980
Was it you?

285
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,970
It was you, Hong Nam Joo, right?

286
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,910
Hey what are you doing?

287
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,060
Was it you guys?!

288
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,290
Do you have to confirm it?

289
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,600
Yes. I don't understand why I'm being penalized.

290
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,920
Satisfied?

291
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,130
Yes.

292
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,950
Kids are antagonistic and keeping an eye out on each other.

293
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,350
Isn't it wrong that even school makes them unable to believe each other?

294
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,940
- What about when they leave school?
- Huh?

295
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,370
If you leave this school the world is more brutal.

296
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:45,210
We're just teaching them the inevitable early on.

297
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,530
Even so..

298
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,770
Why? I like not having blood on my hands.

299
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,450
This is a method I can control them without my own hands.

300
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,890
Teacher should be like a teacher to understand the words.

301
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,890
Did you... just say that for me to hear?!

302
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,460
What? Of course I said it for me to hear.

303
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,820
Me. It's... me.

304
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,960
Oh, seriously.

305
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:34,240
Hey you rascal kid. Do you like it? Reporting me to take care of your score?

306
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,150
What are you talking about? That's not true.

307
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,920
You're the only one who knows about that fact you bastard.

308
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,400
That's really not true. Crazy bastard.

309
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,100
So show us your phone then.

310
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,670
Forget it. Why would you look at someone else's phone?

311
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,130
Let's see, you bastard!

312
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,560
Hey what's the matter. Stop it.

313
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,460
Are you crazy? You ignorant and cowardly punk.

314
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,530
What? Coward?

315
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,510
Hey, Yoo Bit Na!

316
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,200
Why? I'm taking a selfie.

317
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,250
This girl seriously...

318
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,450
I said I'm taking a selfie!

319
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,230
-Give your phone.
-I don't want to.

320
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,980
-Give it
I said I don't want to. I didn't take it.

321
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,820
-You took it I saw!
-I didn't!

322
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,820
-I didn't take it!
-Hurry up and give it.

323
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,990
I said no!

324
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,960
If the Principal saw this he'd be absolutely delighted.

325
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,790
This school is going crazy.
- Give it.

326
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,110
I don't want to.

327
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,030
What's this one about?

328
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,520
He died because he ate too many penalty points. (parody of movie The Wailing)

329
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,330
The school is going crazy.

330
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:58,940
It's done by the devil X. We should run away quickly.

331
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,650
What is this?

332
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,050
Never be fooled. The devil principal

333
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:26,040
It's his sly trick.

334
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,700
This punk!

335
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,800
That's right, I'm 'X'. Hahaha.

336
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,100
What is important?

337
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,210
Is everything alright if you get merit points?

338
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,390
What? You guys all were on the same side?

339
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,370
You are accomplices.

340
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,000
Why are you doing this?

341
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:14,490
Inappropriate attire, minus 10 points. You bit at the bait

342
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:19,820
You don't even know what's important!

343
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,000
If you doing it like this, why don't you use Issue oppa as a leading role? It will be a great hit.

344
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,220
- Why?
- The idol group's name is Geum Sang Cheom Hwa? (Frosting on the cake)

345
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,880
It's so killer, right?

346
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,480
Ra Eun Ho!

347
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,090
Did you apply for a reduction of demerit points too?

348
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,450
I have to start getting rid of them now.

349
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,630
How are we going to pull all of this? This is crazy.

350
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,030
I can't do this anymore.

351
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,670
Why did you do something if you were going to get caught?

352
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:35,540
Ugh. Why're we doing this in early morning?

353
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,270
Don't hit me!

354
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,560
You guys are hot right? Drink this and then work.

355
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,350
Here, eat.

356
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,580
- President!
- Drink up.

357
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,930
I thought I would die in this heat.

358
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,340
What's with the drinks? Out of the blue.

359
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,440
That too... all of a sudden.

360
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,620
Just because I thought you two would be hot.

361
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,910
You aren't plotting something, right?

362
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,550
What do you mean?

363
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,720
We are close you see.

364
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,160
That's right.

365
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,440
I'll try to make it so that they'll cut your punishment a bit.

366
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,830
-Oh really?
-Yeah.
-Then I would be super thankful.

367
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,620
Is it refreshing?

368
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,430
Like sticky rice cakes from Apgujeong,

369
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,310
Our sticky love.

370
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:44,120
Let's not get stressed, but stay together.

371
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:49,020
For eternity. Forever.

372
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,840
Okay. The last person, Ra Eun Ho.

373
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:09,770
Title;" This is all because of X."

374
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,540
By Ra Eun Ho.

375
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,070
This is all because of X.

376
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,540
Unjust demerit points, risk of voluntary school withdrawal
(Rather than expelling students, many schools in S.Korea force students to withdraw "voluntarily" in order to protect the school's image.)

377
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,500
A terrible student record, gave up on college.

378
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,280
My mother came to the teachers' office

379
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,330
and was forced to kneel because of someone.

380
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,190
The one who ruined the beautiful life of an eighteen year old

381
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:39,070
is X.

382
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:45,970
X, when I call your name,

383
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,560
you will...

384
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,250
die, got it?

385
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,160
Will die...

386
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,230
Die...

387
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:17,580
We'll end here.

388
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,220
Student president, you forgot the master key.

389
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,370
Oh, yes. I was needing to return the self-study forms to the teacher's office.

390
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,300
- Right, work hard.
- Goodbye.

391
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:38,710
Why would he give you a master key?

392
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,750
A that is because i have a lot of things to do here and there.

393
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,960
The school president and vice president each have one.

394
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,350
Why did you call me?

395
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,180
What are you doing?

396
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,820
Well, just...

397
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,200
Why suddenly?

398
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,930
Why are you seeing me?

399
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,040
Well...

400
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,390
Because you are pretty?

401
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:39,710
Normally someone would say "Because I like you", when asked.

402
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,090
Are you mad?

403
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,850
I like everything about you.

404
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,500
Your beauty, and everything else.

405
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,990
Everything about me?

406
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,960
Hey, you...

407
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,160
Have you ever tried kissing?

408
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,010
Are you crazy?

409
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:34,840
Right! You haven't tried either? I knew it wasn't only me.

410
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,470
Are you crazy?

411
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,120
Would I not have? Elementary kids even do it.

412
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,840
Elementary kids?

413
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,480
I should hurry...

414
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,320
Why? What? Were you planning to do it with that skylark person  (Sunbae Jong Geun)?

415
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,630
Well, it's none of your business. If I wrestle or kiss

416
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,270
with that skylark person,

417
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,860
stay out of it.

418
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,940
- A minor, you know.
- What are you doing with a skylark?

419
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,010
Ra Eun Ho raises birds?

420
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:19,560
Wow, she's like a total Nelson Mandela for the preservation of nature.

421
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,970
Should I raise some too?

422
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,450
No.

423
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,890
Go, leave.

424
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,780
Won't Eun Ho be hungry?

425
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,060
Don't bother her and stay still.

426
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,540
Well, of course we should.

427
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,520
Make her comfortable. Let her do her work comfortably.

428
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,050
Right, it's a test for Korea University. Let's not bother her.

429
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,440
At all, huh?

430
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,510
Don't mind me, just do your work.

431
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,500
Thank you.

432
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,950
Don't mind me, don't mind me.

433
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,710
It's a herb to make you smart. Drink it.

434
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,240
Hurry and do it.

435
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,630
Stop coming, stop coming!

436
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,530
Hey, it's not that.

437
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,920
Here.

438
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,830
This money is like my blood. Do well.

439
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,770
Thank you.

440
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,140
Popular idol group 'Geum Sang Chum Hwa' dominated the TV screens.

441
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,240
'But what is Issue doing?'
- What? A surplus member?

442
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,990
These people are asking for their deaths, writing hate comments.

443
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:27,430
What is the management company doing? They don't manage?

444
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,150
Who is that?

445
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,840
Issue Oppa.

446
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,170
Hey, here.

447
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,900
The one at the very end.

448
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,310
Isn't he just radiating?

449
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,240
Isn't it amazing?

450
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,080
No. His dance is out of sync and his vocalization doesn't suit the song.

451
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,250
Hey! It's much better than your vocalization!

452
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,860
♬You know, just like this, don't let me go, na na na na♬

453
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,450
♬Na Na Na Na Don't play that♬

454
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:13,480
You will feel at ease. I am the master of exams.

455
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,560
Thank you.

456
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,770
Where's the exam this time?

457
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,580
This time, they're exams for public officers in Chungnam and Gyung Book regions.

458
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,530
3 days and 2 nights

459
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,160
For 3 days?

460
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,090
I'm feeling bored already.

461
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:35,180
Hey. Just 3 days.

462
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,980
Good morning.

463
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:47,610
Hey...I don't think I'm going to take that exam

464
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,030
I don't want to leave this school for even 3 seconds.

465
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,900
I want to introduce a transfer student, he's a very famous idol.

466
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,780
What's your name?

467
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,670
Issue

468
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,530
Issue, introduce yourself on your own.

469
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,250
Issue? Issue?

470
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:18,500
Hey guys, I'm Kang Hyeon Il who has now transferred to your class.

471
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,370
Please take of me.

472
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,850
I have my sketchbook...

473
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,750
I have my examination slip. Ok!

474
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,810
Are you going to the competition?

475
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,630
Make sure you're not forgetting anything like an idiot, okay?

476
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,730
Like an idiot... Hey!

477
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,240
Is making fun of people your hobby?

478
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,860
No. It's making fun of idiots.

479
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:08,030
Let's endure it, a mature person like me should endure it.

480
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,730
What? It broke again!

481
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,120
What do I do?

482
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,530
That's why you should take the bus and not drag a bike around.

483
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,520
I can't ride the bus.

484
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,740
What?

485
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:35,040
Excuse me... Can I ride...

486
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,300
From now on I'm really busy. I have to maturely study-

487
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,300
Hey, why are you taking it so seriously?

488
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,540
Your feelings are really hurt, aren't they? I get it. If I were you, my feelings would be hurt, too.

489
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,830
Why do I just spit out words without thinking?

490
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,520
I know right.

491
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,450
So, a mature person like you should give me-

492
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,440
Can't you give me a ride?

493
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,850
I can't be late for the competition...

494
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,120
Say, "Please give me a ride~"

495
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,180
What?

496
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,560
Say, "Please give me a ride Oppa~"

497
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,530
Op-

498
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:29,470
♫ Our summer days are flashing by ♫

499
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:33,310
♫ In between the spilling sunlight ♫

500
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:40,820
♫ When I think of you my heart jumps ♫

501
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:44,010
♫ That's me ♫

502
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,010
♫ The dazzling blue sky ♫

503
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:52,610
Hey Hey! Your head, hey!
♫  The trees dancing outside the window ♫

504
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,460
Thanks! (In Japanese) Thanks! (In Korean)

505
00:45:54,460 --> 00:46:02,100
♫  Next to you I'm looking at you. A smile, that's me.♫

506
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,100
♫ I wish everything will happen. Everything I want ♫

507
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:12,030
Let's take off the helmet, maturely.
♫ My heart is thumping all day. ♫

508
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,750
♫ It's dreaming of tomorrow ♫

509
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:30,130
Teacher, you know who did it, tell us.

510
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,050
I really won't say anything to that person.

511
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,680
Bit Na, you can't do that.

512
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,530
It's not fair. You're always going to take the side of the person who reports something.

513
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:45,430
Have you even checked whether or not the picture is real or fake? It could be Photoshopped, Teacher!

514
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:50,280
You don't really think someone would go so far as to Photoshop, do you? So let's just trust in each other.

515
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,460
The school is in chaos because of Ra Eun Ho.

516
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,600
I heard that Ra Eun Ho could be an accomplice with that X student or something?

517
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,970
Teacher, that's not it.

518
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,260
What's not it?

519
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,890
I heard it's for Ra Eun Ho to catch X. The reward and punishment system.

520
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,550
Fly fly

521
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:21,030
Why did that Ra Eun Ho do such a thing,

522
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:22,720
to cause this mess?

523
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,490
Exactly.

524
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:27,850
It's because of Ra Eun Ho?

525
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:32,760
No, it's not, it's not because of Eun Ho.

526
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:46,260
Hey, Ra Eun Ho! I heard that it was all because of you.

527
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,240
What? The reward and punishment system.

528
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,520
I heard that it was because of you, when you were trying to catch X.

529
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,790
That's not it...

530
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,920
We're carrying out the reward and punishment system all because of her.

531
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,200
She and the principal both planned the reward and punishment system together so that we can find X. You heard it too.

532
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,120
She's right.

533
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,740
What the heck? Because of you we fought with each other...

534
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,100
Hey! Are you going to take responsibility for my school record!

535
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,870
Hey Ra Eun Ho, you better take responsibility.

536
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:15,720
Ah, so annoying.

537
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,300
God, so annoying.

538
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,300
Ugh, how annoying.

539
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,860
What are you gonna do?

540
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,240
Are you going to take responsibility?

541
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,830
What are you going to do?

542
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:31,150
Stop it, it's not even confirmed. We didn't even catch X.

543
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,560
It is confirmed, Teacher said it.

544
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,080
What are you gonna do? I said what are you gonna do?!

545
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,080
Having fun?

546
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,920
Who are you?

547
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,150
Your senior.

548
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:10,640
The college entrance exam is right around the corner so I've kept quiet.

549
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,190
But I'm a senior who's very tortured and angry because of some reward and punishment system.

550
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,960
But you seem so calm.

551
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,320
It wasn't me.

552
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,420
What do you mean it's not you, I heard it was because of you.

553
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,420
Do you want to die?

554
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,270
And what is this?

555
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,490
Give it back.

556
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:31,760
Give it back!

557
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,730
Is this girl crazy?

558
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,850
It's so annoying, really.

559
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,800
What did you just say?

560
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:56,620
Let go. What did you just say?

561
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,340
You heard right. It's annoying.

562
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,130
You crazy bastard, cutting me off like that?

563
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:05,740
My tongue is naturally short. I cut off words and cut off awful personalities.

564
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,590
So if you don't want to get beat, get lost.

565
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,610
This bastard...

566
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,920
Hey-hey-hey.

567
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:18,860
Y-You're dead, this is school violence.

568
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,940
That's great, I'll report it as school violence, then you'll get expelled.

569
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,290
This school is mine, you know.

570
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,660
This crazy bastard...

571
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,430
If you don't want to be reported then just get hit.

572
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,630
-I'll give you ten times the money to compensate for your hospital fees.
-Just say sorry.

573
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,700
My family has a lot of money too.

574
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:37,950
You, be careful.

575
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,560
Look at her.

576
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,360
You promised me right? If I bring X then I won't be punished.

577
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,920
Now you've come to your senses, Ra Eun Ho.

578
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:52,670
And repeal the reward and punishment system, and write a remark on the transcript.

579
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,870
that I contributed extraordinarily to establish the discipline of school.

580
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,830
Of course, just catch the guy.

581
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,320
I'll go and get him, whatever it takes.

582
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,250
'I'll go and get him, whatever it takes.'

583
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,300
It is common courtesy to say thanks.

584
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,380
I'm not thankful.

585
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,360
I'm not thankful at all. You wicked people.

586
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,760
Whether you are X or Y, don't you dare get caught.

587
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,500
I'm going to destroy him.

588
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:03,600
Wow.

589
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,400
Ok!

590
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,100
Im Joon Gi! Im Joon Gi!

591
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,230
Isn't it a so-called 'friendship watch', right?

592
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:16,040
What is a friendship watch ? So cheesy. It's nothing like that.

593
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,650
Dad, because of an accident Joon Gi...

594
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,520
Joon Gi... Joon Gi...

595
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,920
Please!

596
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:03,590
A school dropout's immature ride caused citizen's death on their way home

597
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,080
Tae Woon! What happened?

598
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,860
Hyeon Tae Woon!

599
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:27,180
1st memorial day

600
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:09,670
I told you not to ride. Doing such a thing...

601
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:14,420
What about you? That incident won't disappear if I don't ride this.

602
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,200
This has nothing to do with that so don't needlessly bring it up.

603
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,410
It doesn't change.

604
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:26,830
So I'm looking for something grand. Because I know you won't change too easily.

605
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:48,060
What will you do?

606
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,860
I'm sorry.

607
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:07,130
Clearly ...

608
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,440
Who did it?

609
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:17,440
Who did this? Huh?

610
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,850
Come out while I'm being nice.

611
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:24,850
I said who did this?!

612
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,290
Was it you?

613
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,420
Was it you? You?

614
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:43,200
I look pretty happy right now, right? Tell me who it was now.

615
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,870
Who was it that did this, you bastards!

616
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:48,690
Stop it!

617
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,120
Get out everyone.

618
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,070
If you do this you'll die.

619
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:13,870
I said hurry and get out!

620
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,120
What are you doing?

621
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,430
Hey. Do you want to die?

622
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:40,920
Hey. Don't create a fuss.

623
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:49,950
Shut up, you bastard. I'm in a pretty bad mood right now.

624
00:59:54,990 --> 01:00:02,250
Do you think making a fuss over something like that will serve as an atonement or something?

625
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,320
Something like that?

626
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,980
Hey. Bastard.

627
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:14,470
Did you say something like that?

628
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:24,850
Go ahead.

629
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,430
What?

630
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,910
Cowardly bastard.

631
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,110
Shut up before I expose everything.

632
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:25,390
I'm thinking of that too. How could I waste this horrible school.

633
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:30,470
It would be really fun if the others found out what you did.

634
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:34,380
Shut up you murdering bastard.

635
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:37,260
Do you want to die, you punk?

636
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,550
Are you crazy?

637
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:17,210
♫ Believing now in this moment I ♫

638
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:22,620
♫ Sometimes I feel insecure and uneasy but ♫

639
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:28,350
♫ As I think of you ♫

640
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:35,250
♫ Something wonderful will happen, expect it ♫

641
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:39,700
♫ The moment you smiled in the bright sunshine ♫

642
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:43,430
- If you live trying your best...
- This rascal!

643
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:45,230
Will I be able to get out?

644
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,790
I'm sure one of the two is X.

645
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,720
Let's make it an opportunity.

646
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,530
Sticking together is surviving.

647
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,140
Who really is X.

648
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,590
It seems like you'll really be able to go to Korea University.

649
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,990
Yes!

650
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:02,210
Can you open this?

651
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:05,580
You perfectly set a trap, right?

652
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,180
Please look over it.

653
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:10,210
Teacher.

654
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,230
Please help me.
