00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,740
First, we were haunted by Dowager Noble Consort Li.

4
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,930
Now again?

5
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,460
The late Emperor?

6
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,380
I didn't

7
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,540
see it coming.

8
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,210
Really?

9
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,330
Chu Huaiming.

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,620
Are you really competent

11
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,930
as an Imperial Astronomer?

12
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,900
My apologies, My Lord.

13
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,570
The coffin of the late Emperor

14
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,020
moved for no reason.

15
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,260
I have a theory for this.

16
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,740
Perhaps we should not have

17
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,130
relocated the coffin

18
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,900
of the Dowager.

19
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,260
Do you suggest

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,020
that I have to request the Emperor

21
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,850
to move back the Dowager?

22
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,690
My Lord.

23
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,290
Maybe

24
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,890
the feng shui was destroyed

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,380
when they were building the royal tomb.

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,380
The harm has been done.

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,220
But the top priority right now

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,100
is to find an excuse

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,500
to fix the problem.

30
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,540
It won't take long

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,980
before the Empress Dowager is buried in the royal tomb.

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,410
How about this?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,820
We can secretly restore the coffin

34
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,010
of the late Emperor

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,170
under the pretext that the royal tomb is in disrepair.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,980
However, it's a big deal

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,060
to repair the royal tomb.

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,890
I need approval from you, My Lord.

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,690
As we discussed earlier,

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,690
I still need

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,850
to bother the Emperor, don't I?

42
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,610
My Lord.

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,410
You just perfectly solved the problem

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,170
of burying the Empress Dowager.

45
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,170
If you propose

46
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,260
to repair the royal tomb at this very moment,

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,260
the Emperor would appreciate

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,260
your loyalty and grant the request.

49
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,820
If we don't do this,

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,010
once the rumor goes around

51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,340
that we are haunted by the late Emperor, I'm afraid...

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,540
Finish the job.

53
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,780
No mistake is allowed.

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,940
Yes, My Lord.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,100
It may raise suspicions

56
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,010
if I handle this task

57
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,690
in person.

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,130
We have to

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,780
find someone else.

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,820
This man should be equipped

61
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,220
with feng shui and geomancy.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,890
Moreover,

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,100
to avoid the leak of the secret,

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,540
he must not have any connections

65
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,540
in the court.

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,940
My Lord.

67
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,540
I have a perfect candidate for this job.

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,610
Speak.

69
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,010
Zang Hai, the newly recruited aide.

70
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,290
He helped us

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,340
solve the problem

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,060
of relocating Dowager Noble Consort Li.

73
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,570
He is familiar with the layout of the royal tomb

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,610
and he knows feng shui and geomancy.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,220
Most importantly, he is working for us

76
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,130
and totally clean.

77
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,500
He is the man we're looking for.

78
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,890
Zang Hai?

79
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,100
Is he suitable for this job?

80
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,050
My Lord.

81
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,170
You're blessed

82
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,700
to have such a rare talent working for you.

83
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,290
It's a great opportunity for him.

84
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,580
He deserves a reward

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,900
once he completes the task.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,660
Chu Huaiming.

87
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,250
Offer him

88
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,410
some role in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

89
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,900
and authorize him to supervise the repair work.

90
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,370
Remember,

91
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,410
don't mention it to anyone that he is working for us.

92
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,460
Yes, My Lord.

93
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,850
The Emperor hereby

94
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,140
appoints Zang Hai

95
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,140
as Assistant Supervisor of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

96
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,460
to supervise the repair work of the royal tomb.

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,340
Please note.

98
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,540
I accept this appointment with pride.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,930
Congratulations!

100
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,370
Zang Hai.

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,410
Your birth date is compatible with the late Emperor.

102
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,250
You know feng shui and geomancy well.

103
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,140
As a newly recruited aide,

104
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,810
you're trusted with such an important job.

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,220
There is a bright future ahead of you.

106
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,490
Thanks, sir.

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,370
Chu Huaiming said your birth date is compatible with the late Emperor?

108
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,020
They cannot wait

109
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,100
to see me buried together with the late Emperor.

110
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,580
Sinister plan!

111
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,250
I don't think

112
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,050
this idea was proposed

113
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,700
by a loser like Chu Huaiming.

114
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,410
Zang Hai.

115
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,930
You offended Yang Zhen. Now they are coming for you.

116
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,540
You have to accept the challenge.

117
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,100
But they are craving for your blood!

118
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,730
No way.

119
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,020
I should dress up myself

120
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,370
and come with you.

121
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,660
Master.

122
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,700
They won't kill me

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,050
if you come along with me?

124
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,660
I'm waiting

125
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,700
for their move.

126
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,220
Once they make the move,

127
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,490
there would be opportunities for me.

128
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,020
Only then I can turn the tide and win.

129
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,930
That's the only way to survive.

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,580
This is too dangerous.

131
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,780
You need a backup plan.

132
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,810
Master. Come on.

133
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,220
Sit.

134
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,700
The royal tomb repair takes three months.

135
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,220
I'm safe

136
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,020
during this period.

137
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,370
They may try to bury me

138
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,340
once the project is completed.

139
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,250
Master.

140
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,460
I need two favors from you.

141
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,420
[royal tomb, Xiaocang River]

142
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,620
[royal tomb, Xiaocang River]

143
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,700
The plan is actionable

144
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,100
but there is no guarantee that it would be successful.

145
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,660
I've been thinking about this.

146
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,170
This is

147
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,370
the only way to survive.

148
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,220
It's risky.

149
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,290
But I'd like

150
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,780
to take the chance.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,850
What about the second favor?

152
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:18,730
Master.

153
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,460
It's been a while

154
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,730
since you demonstrated your talent.

155
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,490
Aren't you itching for a try?

156
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,460
Sir.

157
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,490
Sir.

158
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,370
Since you are here,

159
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,020
fix the problem

160
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,370
for the imperial court.

161
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,420
Zang Hai. What are you doing?

162
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,770
Sir.

163
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,490
I'm trying

164
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,650
to fix the haunting problem.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,820
Sir. Please see this.

166
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,700
Watch closely.

167
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,580
Why so much water here?

168
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,770
The displacement of the late Emperor's coffin

169
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,820
is caused by underground water.

170
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,370
The underground water,

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,700
just like tide,

172
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,250
rises at night and declines in daytime.

173
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,300
The coffin

174
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,650
is made of Chinese giant redwood,

175
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,130
which is rare and soft.

176
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,530
It would float in water.

177
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,940
If the water rises high enough,

178
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,460
the coffin would escape from Dragon Stone

179
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,770
and float

180
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,300
around the palace.

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,530
Pushed

182
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,010
by water,

183
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,250
the coffin may knock against the rock door.

184
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,010
The guard made a mistake

185
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,980
after hearing the knock sound.

186
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,610
Rain stops in daytime.

187
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,650
Water would decline

188
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,460
and escape from the gap

189
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,700
of wooden doors.

190
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,100
As a result,

191
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,530
the coffin

192
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,340
is relocated here.

193
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,300
Sir. If you need evidence,

194
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,010
please check

195
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,700
the water stains

196
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,890
on the wall.

197
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,530
Of course I know

198
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,890
the rule of underground water movement.

199
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,420
It happens every day.

200
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,850
Why isn't the palace breached before?

201
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,580
As you know,

202
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,130
You River was diverted five years ago

203
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,370
and passing around the royal tomb.

204
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,460
It's normal in daytime.

205
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,730
But the river would rise

206
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,850
in the night.

207
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,980
As the chamber

208
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,490
is located in the very deep of the royal tomb,

209
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,700
it would no longer be safe from water

210
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,220
when the heavy rain lasts for days.

211
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,250
However,

212
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,420
the royal tomb project

213
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,820
is supposed to watertight.

214
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,180
There is no reason

215
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,940
that the chamber is flooded

216
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,100
with so much water.

217
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,250
Not to mention

218
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,300
floating the coffin.

219
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,100
Is it possible

220
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,180
that we missed the waterproofing process

221
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,770
in the royal tomb

222
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,220
after the diversion of You River?

223
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,300
What do you mean?

224
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,340
Sir.

225
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,610
Since I was appointed

226
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,300
as the Assistant Supervisor of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

227
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,820
it's my duty to figure out

228
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,180
how to repair the royal tomb.

229
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,100
Do you have any plans?

230
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,530
The diversion of You River

231
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,730
has caused the flooding issue.

232
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,650
We can do nothing about it.

233
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,420
There is only one solution to this.

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,610
Redo the waterproofing

235
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,700
process

236
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,980
in the chamber.

237
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,700
Fine.

238
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,420
Advice approved.

239
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,850
Do what you have to do.

240
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,060
Listen, everyone!

241
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,530
Follow the instructions of Mr. Zang.

242
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,650
Yes, sir.

243
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,610
Zang Hai.

244
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,100
Keep working.

245
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,850
Once the repair is done,

246
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,700
you would be rewarded generously.

247
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,580
Thanks, sir.

248
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,220
It turns out

249
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,250
the royal tomb is not haunted.

250
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,300
Dust to dust.

251
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,420
Ghost stories

252
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,420
are invented only to comfort us.

253
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,010
But I don't

254
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,490
understand one thing.

255
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,420
What, sir?

256
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,850
There should be water stains on the floor

257
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,010
when water declines.

258
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,060
It's supposed

259
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,490
to occur frequently.

260
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,180
Hasn't anyone

261
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,890
noticed this?

262
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,060
Yes. Someone mentioned about this.

263
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,850
But Mr. Chu didn't believe that guy

264
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,060
and punished him

265
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,250
hard instead.

266
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,250
That guy.

267
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:01,890
Ji Qun.

268
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,890
Ji Qun.

269
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,300
This is Mr. Zang.

270
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,770
Uncle Ji.

271
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,850
Zhinu.

272
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,180
Uncle Ji.

273
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,820
Zhinu.

274
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,890
How about your learning of the Mountain Viewing Skill?

275
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,770
Very well.

276
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,420
Come.

277
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,850
I have a gift for you.

278
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,730
This is called telescope.

279
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,460
You can use it to watch

280
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,180
mountains clearly

281
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,010
dozens of li from us.

282
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,610
Ji Qun.

283
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,580
You're back.

284
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,530
Sir.

285
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,340
Father.

286
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,980
It's a gift from Uncle Ji.

287
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,610
Good.

288
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,650
He is bothering me all day long,

289
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,610
saying he wants

290
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,650
to learn from you the technique

291
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,060
of Mountain Viewing.

292
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,610
It seems

293
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,770
that you would become

294
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,890
a Calendrical Official in the Five Offices

295
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,580
just like me.

296
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,180
I saw your name

297
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,610
in the roster of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

298
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,250
You were

299
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,060
the Calendrical Official in the Five Offices

300
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,980
of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

301
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,010
The workers told me

302
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,490
that you advised to Mr. Chu

303
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,300
the royal tomb may be breached by underground water.

304
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,700
Do you know that the displacement

305
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,770
of the late Emperor's coffin is caused by the water

306
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,610
and there is no such thing

307
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,730
like haunting?

308
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,220
If you say so,

309
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,460
sir.

310
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,100
My opinion

311
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,580
doesn't matter at all.

312
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,730
Sir.

313
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,370
Ji has an odd temper.

314
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,340
No need to get mad at him.

315
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,650
Burned in fire,

316
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,100
lime would never

317
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,460
deteriorate

318
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,850
even soaked in water.

319
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,730
To build the royal tomb,

320
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,700
we need one portion of lime

321
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,300
and three portions of sand and earth.

322
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,490
Then add glutinous rice to mix everything well.

323
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,650
The wall would remain strong

324
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,340
without repeated ramming.

325
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,940
This is Sanhe Earth.

326
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,180
For make sure boat

327
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,650
or wall waterproof,

328
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,980
we need to mix lime,

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,820
repeatedly pounded thick silk,

330
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,530
fine fabric,

331
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,700
tung oil and fish oil,

332
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,730
then add clarified lime water

333
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,340
and paper towel and finally apply the mixture to the connections.

334
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,060
It would be watertight for ages.

335
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,180
Do you mean

336
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,180
Zang Hai knows

337
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,330
that we cut corners when building the royal tomb?

338
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,980
We would never need extra waterproofing work

339
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,090
were it not for the diversion

340
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,620
of You River.

341
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,980
The court

342
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,460
has allocated a large amount of money

343
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,570
to build the royal tomb.

344
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,980
If they keep digging,

345
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,530
they would know

346
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,700
that you embezzled public funds for other purposes.

347
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,330
How about getting rid of him

348
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,660
before it is too late?

349
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,420
But my father appreciates his talent.

350
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,140
Your father is a decisive man.

351
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,980
He would not hesitate

352
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,460
to remove anyone that threatens you

353
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,660
no matter how he

354
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,770
appreciates the man's capability.

355
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,290
Sir. Please rest assured.

356
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,180
Let me take care of it.

357
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,010
We can get what we want

358
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,900
if you and Mr. Yang

359
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,730
could influence your father.

360
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,570
Not just ants.

361
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,220
Many bugs

362
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,810
hate the juice of Goat Peach Vine.

363
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,700
So if we add tung oil and fish oil

364
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,530
into the mixture

365
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,980
and apply to the connections between

366
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,530
the tile and coffin,

367
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,290
we can make sure the coffin waterproof

368
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,810
and bugproof.

369
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,290
You know this method, too?

370
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,900
A senior taught me this.

371
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,330
This is a method

372
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,530
once used by a friend

373
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,570
in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

374
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,090
The approach was

375
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,900
abandoned and used no more.

376
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,770
Why?

377
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,940
Maybe they consider

378
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,730
it old and useless.

379
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,700
Effective method

380
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,620
never gets old.

381
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,140
It is only updated

382
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,980
by different ingredients.

383
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,770
You sound like him.

384
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,090
Could you tell me more about your friend?

385
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,770
He is the former Imperial Astronomer

386
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,700
Kuai Duo.

387
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,940
Forgive my ignorance.

388

00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,690
Fill me a cup.

777
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,420
You guys have been

778
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,650
working so hard for months.

779
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,980
The lords

780
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,980
are satisfied

781
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,170
with your efforts.

782
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,490
I would report to the lords

783
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,420
and apply rewards

784
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,780
for you.

785
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,380
Everyone would be rewarded.

786
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,530
- Yeah! - Yeah!

787
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,940
- Thanks, sir! - Thanks, sir!

788
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,740
Drink!

789
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,610
Thanks, sir.

790
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,980
Ji Qun.

00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,650
Kong San.

00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,780

00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,820
Yuan Ju.

797
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:58,820
Li Jialiang.

798
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,420
Eight craftsmen totally.

799
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,690
I've reported to the Emperor

800
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,860
that your birth dates are compatible

801
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,650
with the late Emperor and Empress Dowager.

802
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,010
You're willing to get buried with the dead,

803
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,820
right?

804
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,460
Yes.

805
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,690
We're willing to sacrifice ourselves.

806
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,780
According to the rules, I have to ask again.

807
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,650
Any one to change their minds?

808
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,380
Speak now

809
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,090
and you would be pardoned for deceiving the Emperor.

810
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,740
Once I submit the report,

811
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,900
there is no room for regret.

812
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,210
Sir.

813
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,900
Could you

814
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,490
keep your promise?

815
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,690
Of course.

816
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:33,820
You have my word.

817
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,610
Mr. Chu.

818
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,420
Please keep your promise.

819
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,650
Help me

820
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,530
cure my daughter.

821
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,420
Don't forget to take care of my family.

822
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,940
Since you're willing

823
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,690
to sacrifice yourselves for the late Emperor and Empress Dowager,

824
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,260
the court would

825
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,980
grant a large amount of money

826
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,980
to your families.

827
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,740

828
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,340
The court would remember you.

00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,420
I, Chu Huaiming, would remember you.

830
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,860
Sir.

831
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,460
We're going to die soon.

832
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,690
We may get drunk and make fools of ourselves later.

833
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,820
Please leave.

834
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,530
You can

835
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,090
count on us.

836
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,650
No hurry.

837
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,940
One more thing.

838
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,420
Zang Hai. The Emperor has spoken.

839
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,820

the royal tomb.

843
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,820

and compatible birth date,

845
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,130
you're ordered to sacrifice yourself

846
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,820
and reside in the royal tomb permanently.

847
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,740
Sir.

848
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,260
