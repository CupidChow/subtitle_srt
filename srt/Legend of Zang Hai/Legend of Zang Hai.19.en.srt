00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,570
Greetings, Mr. Zhuang.

5
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,740
I'm here to see Mr. Zang.

6
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,260
He went out last night and hasn't returned yet.

7
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,900
Do you know where he went?

8
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,930
I'm afraid I don't.

9
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,210
He was probably out on official business.

10
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,340
[Zang Residence]

11
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,410
All right. Got it.

12
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,940
When your master returns,

13
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,340
tell him

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,380
I've set out as he instructed.

15
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,570
Are you going to stare out that window all day?

16
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,730
I'm not waiting for him.

17
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,010
I'm just feeling a little bored,

[Cold medicine]
felt like getting some air.

19
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,060
But you've been "bored" since last night.

20
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,610
You're wearing yourself out.

21
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,100
Come drink your medicine.

22
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,100
I'm afraid he's not coming.

23
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,850
Miss,

24
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,890
Mr. Zang is here.

25
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,570
Where is he?

26
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,690
He's downstairs.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,570
What's wrong?

28
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,100
Getting cold feet now that he's close?

29
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,500
After making me wait this long,

30
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,170
now I have to run to him the moment he arrives?

31
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,100
What kind of logic is that?

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,170
Today, let him do the waiting.

33
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,890
If he has such patience,

34
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,850
Fengliu, take him to the Liutao Pavilion.

35
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,780
Yes, ma'am.

36
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,380
What are you up to now?

37
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,380
Please wait here, Mr. Zang.

38
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,820
Our Miss will be down shortly.

39
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,130
Shen Xiaoxing, this is your tent.

40
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,170
Get in.

41
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,290
It's packed in here. Where am I supposed to sleep?

42
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,340
What, you want me to find you a spot?

43
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,810
This is a military camp, not an inn.

44
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,050
Find one yourself!

45
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,900
Don't tell me he wants a private room!

46
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,580
The outhouse is private. You want that?

47
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,810
What's so funny?

48
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,490
All of you, cut it out!

49
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,580
From today on, he's one of your own.

50
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,700
Shen Xiaoxing,

51
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,490
start getting settled in.

52
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,410
What are you waiting for? Go on!

53
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,140
He thinks we're just a bunch

54
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,020
of scruffy men hogging space.

55
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,220
Look at that soft skin of his.

56
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,930
Let's call him Gentleman Shen from now on.

57
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,290
Sounds good to me.

58
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,020
Gentleman Shen, you okay?

59
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,980
Come on, get up.

60
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,050
You all right?

61
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,780
Don't tell me you're about to cry.

62
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,370
Gentleman Shen's going to cry.

63
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,460
Gentleman Shen's going to cry!

64
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,610
Enough!

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,220
Do you have any idea who I am?

66
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,140
You?

67
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,490
Who are you?

68
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,100
Some General Shen?

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,020
General Shen's joined our camp.

70
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,340
How humbling!

71
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,580
So it's General Shen.

72
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,050
You scared the life out of me!

73
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,900
This spot's already taken.

74
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,340
What now, Gentleman Shen?

75
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,540
That spot by the gate's not bad.

76
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,930
You'll block the wind for us.

77
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,610
That keeps you fit, too.

78
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,220
See how good we are to you?

79
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,170
Did Zang Hai complain at all?

80
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,780
He didn't show a trace of impatience.

81
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,050
He just sat there

82
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,900
without even frowning.

83
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,850
Come on.

84
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,250
Zang Hai just sat there, quietly sipping tea.

85
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,580
He didn't even take a bathroom break.

86
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,660
Impressive.

87
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,780
Didn't you say

88
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,410
a man's patience

89
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,460
shows how much he cares?

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,370
So, I made him wait a couple hours.

91
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,050
That's not too much, is it?

92
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,220
I'm just not sure

93
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,050
if you're testing him or torturing yourself.

94
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,580
Do I look nice?

95
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,660
I've never seen

96
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,930
such a beautiful woman.

97
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,610
Zang Hai probably can't take his eyes off you.

98
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,700
Then invite him up.

99
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,610
Yes, ma'am.

100
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,730
No.

101
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,660
I'll go to him myself.

102
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,980
Fengliu,

103
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,140
is Miss Xiang still not ready?

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,930
Sir, please wait a moment

105
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,220
and take some more tea.

106
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,730
Our Miss will be down soon.

107
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,460
This is already my sixth pot.

108
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,700
One more and my lips will blister.

109
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,290
Please tell Miss Xiang

110
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,220
I have other duties today and I'll come another time.

111
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,020
Sir, you're not going to wait a bit longer?

112
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,900
I believe I've understood

113
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,140
Miss Xiang's message.

114
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,540
Sir, what do you mean?

115
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,020
Please wait, I'll go check.

116
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,780
No need.

117
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,730
Thank her for me.

118
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,340
Farewell.

119
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,490
Please visit us again soon, sir.

120
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,020
I will.

121
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,370

122
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,460
Did he get tired of waiting?

123
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,580
Was he rushing you?

124
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,530
Mr. Zang said he had official business. He left.

125
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,010
Miss!

126
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,610
He just left like that?

127
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:14,980
Miss,

128
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,890
he might've misunderstood and thought you changed your mind.

129
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,060
What did he say before he left?

130
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,340
He said he understood your message,

131
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,940
and thanked you.

132
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,300
What message?

133
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,060
If I can wait for him, why can't he wait for me?

134
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,420
I was never someone he could see whenever he pleased!

135
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,180
Miss, if you go now, you might still catch him.

136
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,850
Why should I?

137
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,490
Fine.

138
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,100
If he has that much pride,

139
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,220
then I won't bother anymore.

140
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,250
If he shows up again, just say I'm not here!

141
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,700
And tell him to leave!

142
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
[Welcome with Great Enthusiasm]

143
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,530
Master.

144
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,220
Why are you here?

145
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,130
How did it go?

146
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,010
She wouldn't see me.

147
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,370
I know she's being moody.

148
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,940
While I waited for her,

149
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,370
I kept thinking,

150
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,300
if I really did see her,

151
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,300
how would I even begin to speak?

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,180
But then I realized

153
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,130
it is better to be disappointed

154
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,490
than heartbroken.

155
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,650
So be it.

156
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,220
Maybe not seeing her is the best outcome.

157
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,460
I don't want to drag her

158
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,610
into this mess of revenge.

159
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,820
Being close to me will put her in danger.

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
I've delayed long enough.

161
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,610
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau is cleared.

162
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,610
It's time to find the third enemy.

163
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,580
I came to tell you

164
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,250
Zhuang Zhixing has gone to the military camp.

165
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,300
He came to say goodbye early this morning.

166
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,130
You weren't there.

167
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,010
This kid moves fast enough.

168
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:15,940
Hai,

169
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,100
do you really think he can make it?

170
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,700
Who's there?

171
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,580
Aren't you the new recruit,

172
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,700
Shen Xiaoxing?

173
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,060
What are you doing here?

174
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,650
Those brats bullied you?

175
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,100
Come on.

176
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,460
You'll stay with me tonight.

177
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,340
If you curl up here all night, you'll freeze.

178
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,530
My name's Xiang Hong.

179
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,580
I'm the captain of the third squad.

180
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,180
Those who retreat before battle face death!

181
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,730
Those who flee their unit, death!

182
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,580
Those who stray from the ranks, death!

183
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,100
Those who disobey orders, death!

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,940
Those who run wild in camp, death!

185

Those who disobey their commander's command, death!

186
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,610
Those who break formation in drills...

00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,340

You. Yes, you!

189
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,130
What do you think you're doing?

190
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,130
Stand still! Quit moving!

191
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,250
Reporting to Squad Leader, there's something on me.

192
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,490
Still talking back?

193
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,340
Step out of line!

194
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,060
What's your name?

195
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,530
Shen Xiaoxing!

196
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,010
Improper appearance, ten lashes!

197
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,580
He nearly burst into tears.

198
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,220
Taking ten hard lashes

199
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,100
left him limping.

200
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,980
Such a softie.

201
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,890
That serves him right.

202
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,530
Well, look who it is.

203
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,300
Isn't it Gentleman Shen?

204
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,700
You put that bug on me, right?

205
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,100
It was just a prank.

206
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,530
Hey!

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,700
Zhan Hao,

208
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,130
that's enough!

209
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,700
Fighting's strictly forbidden in camp.

210
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,250
Aren't you afraid the squad leader will find out?

211
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,420
What're you staring at?

212
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,340
Eat your food!

213
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,220
Let's go.

214
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,770
Hang in there.

215
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,650
The medicine stings,

216
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,490
but it works like a charm.

217
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,820
You'll be healed in a week.

218
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,490
I never did anything to them.

219
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,060
Why are they targeting me like this?

220
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,580
Come on, sit up.

221
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,460
Take care.

222
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,700
In camp, might makes right.

223
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,340
The weaker you look, the less respect you get.

224
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,060
Out on the battlefield,

225
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,850
your life's on the line at any moment.

226
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,060
No one wants dead weight.

227
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,940
But once you get stronger,

228
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,300
they won't mess with you anymore.

229
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,820
Then why didn't you pick on me?

230
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,130
Why help me instead?

231
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,850
Aren't you afraid I'll drag you down?

232
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,820
You may look weak,

233
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,650
but you've got backbone.

234
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,730
Zhan Hao's tough,

235
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,300
but you still dared to fight him.

236
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,580
Just for that, you're worth being friends with.

237
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,370
Besides, you won't drag me down.

238
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,770
You're going to be strong someday.

239
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,130
You really believe that?

240
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,850
You took a punch from Zhan Hao for me.

241
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,460
No big deal. That's what brothers are for.

242
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,890
I got something for you.

243
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,010
Top-quality Bamboo Leaf Green wine.

244
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,730
I usually can't bear to drink it.

245
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,340
Don't we have cups?

246
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,370
Just drink straight from the bottle!

247
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,010
Go on, try it!

248
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,250
Drinking like this really hits the spot.

249
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,140
From now on, we feast and drink like kings!

250
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,010
That's living!

251
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,810
Rest up.

252
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,570
I'll go check out the other tents.

253
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,900
Xiang Hong, thanks.

254
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,050
Before I came,

255
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,570
I figured camp life would be rough.

256
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,490
Never thought I'd make a friend like you.

257
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,860
Get some rest.

258
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,250
You guys have a lot of nerve.

259
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,810
How dare you pick on him?

260
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,330
Do you even know who he is?

261
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,940
I don't care who he is.

262
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,900
I beat pretty boys like that on sight.

263
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,490
Great.

264
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,900
Let me spell it out for you.

265
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,940
He's the Marquis of Pingjin's second son, Zhuang Zhixing.

266
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,420
No way.

267
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,250
How do you know?

268
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,220
I was on duty during this year's ground polo contest.

269
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,940
I saw him there.

270
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,090
Same face. No mistake.

271
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,730
I don't know

272
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,090
why he came here under a fake name,

273
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,530
but I do know none of us can afford to mess with him!

274
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,460
You guys are still laughing like it's nothing!

275
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,490
We're doomed...

276
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,900
We're so screwed...

277
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,050
No wonder you kept

278
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,140
sucking up to him.

279
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,250
You knew who he was all along!

280
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,290
Then why didn't you say something sooner?

281
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,900
I beat him to a pulp today.

282
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,490
If he tells his father,

283
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,180
I'm dead meat!

284
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,330
Enough.

285
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,380
You're lucky.

286
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,620
I already smoothed things over.

287
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,530
He's a noble's son, naive and easy to please.

288
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,860
Just speak nicely to him from now on.

289
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,900
Go along with whatever he wants.

290
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,660
Keep him happy, and he won't report you.

291
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,050
Xiaoxing,

292
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,900
why are you out here?

293
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,180
You knew who I was all along,

294
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,050
and that's why you kept helping me?

295
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,660
I thought

296
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,420
you were kind to me

297
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,660
because you genuinely cared.

298
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,810
Xiaoxing,

299
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,980
you grew up in the Marquis's Mansion.

300
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,180
You don't understand how the world really works...

301
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,900
If I weren't the Marquis of Pingjin's son,

302
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,660
would you still have stepped in

303
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,530
when Zhan Hao hit me today?

304
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,860
Is that why you said

305
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,140
you believed I'd become strong?

306
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,180
You're from a military family.

307
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,570
You wouldn't be weak.

308
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,090
So, in the end, it's all because of my father!

309
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,140
I really thought you wanted

310
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,090
to be my friend,

311
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,490
that you came close

312
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,530
because of who I am!

313
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,570
You're the Marquis's son.

314
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,330
That's an identity you can't shake.

315
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,330
Besides,

316
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,090
with no personal gain,

317
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,940
why would anyone go out of their way

318
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,700
for you?

319
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,620
Xiaoxing...

320
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,420
Stop!

321
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,090
Where are you going?

322
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,660
What are you doing here?

323
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,900
You know desertion means death.

324
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,860
Come with me.

325
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,620
Good thing I ran into you today,

326
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,420
or you'd be in serious trouble.

327
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,010
What happened? You look awful.

328
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,250
Eat up. I'll take you back after.

329
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,570
What if I say

330
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,730
I'm not going back?

331
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,820
Do people

332
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,490
ever really treat each other selflessly?

333
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,940
Everyone's chasing something.

334
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,780
Almost no one gives without expecting return.

335
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,100
Then what about you?

336
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,940
If I weren't the Marquis's son,

337
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,570
would you still want to befriend me?

338
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,330
If I had no grudge against my father

339
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,250
and would never betray him,

340
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,330
would you still want to ally with me?

341
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,090
If I never uncover the truth about the past,

342
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,860
would you still stand by me?

343
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,380
Now I understand,

344
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,570
in this whole world,

345
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,220
only one person ever loved me unconditionally.

346
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,900
And that was my mother.

347
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,530
But she's gone now.

348
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,220
I hope you'll never forget how she died.

349
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,620
No need to walk me back, sir.

350
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,180
I'll go alone.

351
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,060
[Imperial Astronomical Bureau]

352
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,530
Sir, reporting in.

353
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,330
No need for formality, Shiquan.

354
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,420
Sir,

355
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,380
why'd you move here?

356
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,810
It's more open than inside,

357
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,330
easier to come and go.

358
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,050
It makes a great place for writing.

359
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,940
You sure know how to settle in.

360
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,330
Shiquan,

361
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,570
last time,

362
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,770
I only caught the Bureau's problems thanks to your warning.

363
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,770
You were willing to hear me out that night.

364
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,570
I should be the one thanking you.

365
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,090
Even though now

366
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,980
only three of you officials remain,

367
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,770
it was you three doing the real work anyway.

368
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,530
The bureau will be stable for now.

369
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,900
I'll take extra care choosing new appointments.

370
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,620
Compared to your decisive style,

371
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,420
my letter must've seemed clumsy.

372
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,530
No one listened to your suggestions before

373
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,220
because of Chu Huaiming.

374
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,330
But officials should serve the people.

375
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,900
That kind of thing won't happen again.

376
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,700
Sir,

377
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,090
Chu Huaiming's belongings

378
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,330
have been in storage for a while.

379
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,530
Should we dispose of them, or do you want to see them first?

380
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,570
Bring them to me.

381
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,420
[Zhenyou Tongbao]

382
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,620
So Chu Huaiming was into these?

383
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,940
Not him, but someone higher up in the Capital.

384
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,250
The Emperor's younger brother, Prince Yongrong.

385
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,420
Prince Yongrong?

386
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,050
Not many people know this.

387
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,700
Chu once had Shiquan help him search for rare coins.

388
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,700
Shiquan told me about it.

389
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,290
After Chu became the Imperial Astronomer,

390
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,180
his career hit a ceiling.

391
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,700
But he still tried to befriend the elite in the Capital.

392
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,460
Prince Yongrong...

393
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,980
Be careful.

394
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,570
...is the smartest target, naturally.

395
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,770
But ordinary coins won't catch his eye.

396
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,010
Only a full Zhenyou Tongbao set will interest him.

397
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,730
But Chu never completed it.

398
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,250
He was missing one, the Zhesan coin.

399
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,420
I have a theory.

400
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,530
Chu tried to befriend Yongrong

401
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,490
because he knew

402
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,250
Yongrong was the one

403
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,570
backing the Marquis and Cao Jingxian.

404
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,530
It's not impossible.

405
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,770
Still, just a box of coins

406
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,010
isn't enough to prove

407
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,250
Yongrong's the third man.

408
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,050
But...

409
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,290
it's the only lead we've got.

410
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,980
That third man has stayed hidden for years.

411
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,330
The Marquis and Cao Jingxian cover for him willingly.

412
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,380
Which means his rank or power

413
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,660
might not be lower than theirs.

414
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,980
He could even be above them.

415
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,460
There aren't many people like that.

416
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,860
Yongrong certainly qualifies.

417
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,770
Yongrong...

418
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,770
I've got it.

419
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,860
How so?

420
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,460
It's almost time for regional officials

421
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,900
to report to the Capital.

422
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,460
The court allows them

423
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,380
one day of leisure after their reports.

424
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,570
And?

425
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,010
Prince Yongrong loves hosting parties.

426
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,940
He always throws banquets for the visiting officials.

427
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,140
Plenty of big names in the Capital

428
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,490
also show up for those.

429
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,490
So if I can somehow

430
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,010
get into Yongrong's banquet,

431
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,900
I can investigate him,

432
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,420
and check out the other big names

433
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,770
while I'm at it.

434
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,700
Now that's the right idea!

435
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:36,810
But Master,

436
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,380
I'm just a low-ranking Astronomer.

437
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,730
I've never even met Prince Yongrong.

438
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,530
How could I

439
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,530
possibly get invited?

440
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,620
You brat,

441
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,810
you know all you need is one Zhesan coin.

442
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,490
In a city this size,

443
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,940
you think I can't track one down?

444
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,770
Leave it to me!

445
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,580
Your Highness.

446
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,580
Gentlemen,

447
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,740
this is a report from the Astronomical Bureau.

448
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,380
It's a thorough investigation

449
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,770
into reburials, ghost marriages,

450
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,180
and land seizures carried out under false pretenses.

451
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,900
This new Astronomer

452
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,700
laid down strict reforms the moment he took office,

453
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,250
exposing so many

454
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,700
corrupt high-ranking officials.

455
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,620
Zang Hai is just a fifth-rank officer.

456
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,140
If he keeps going down this list,

457
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,860
he'll offend half the court.

458
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,530
How will the Bureau

459
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,180
even survive like this?

460
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,530
That's just a new official trying to make a splash.

461
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,010
What splash?

462
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,420
Greetings, Your Highness.

463
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,220
I'm simply bored today,

464
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,250
so I drop by the Cabinet and join the fun.

465
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,250
Hope I didn't interrupt your discussions.

466
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,700
Not at all.

467
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,290
Your Highness.

468
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,380
Grand Secretary Shi,

469
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,570
who were you just talking about?

470
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,730
The new Imperial Astronomer, Zang Hai.

471
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,090
Zang Hai?

472
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,140
The one who challenged Chu Huaiming

473
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,660
in astronomy?

474
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,420
Interesting.

475
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,220
I didn't expect Mr. Zang

476
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,700
to stir up such a firestorm.

477
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,940
So then

478
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,770
what do you make of this?

479
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,700
If you ask me, let's start with the list.

480
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,700
See if these people

481
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,490
really did the awful things

482
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,570
the Astronomical Bureau claims.

483
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,810
Since the late Emperor set the rules for Capital Review,

484
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:21,250
every official from top to bottom is assessed

485
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,860
once every six years.

486
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,250
Since we have this list now,

487
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,380
let's begin this year's review with them.

488
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,180
Let's see

489
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,940
[The List]
how far this list can go.

490
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,980
Sounds good.

491
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,460
I'm curious to see

492
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,770
what surprises Mr. Zang might bring.

493
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,580
[Zang Residence]

494
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,090
Hold on.

495
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,490
Take your time.

496
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,530
How did it go, Master?

497
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,250
I searched every market in the Capital.

498
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,380
I even hit the black market.

499
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,490
I talked till my lips went dry.

500
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,810
The weird thing is,

501
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,330
every Zhesan coin has already been bought up.

502
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,570
I finally caught wind

503
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,980
of a super rare Zhenyou Tongbao at an auction.

504
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,490
It was exactly the Zhesan coin,

505
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,940
well-kept, perfect condition.

506
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,940
I rushed right over,

507
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,490
but still got there too late.

508
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,090
Someone bought it at a high price.

509
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,420
Absolutely maddening!

510
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,050
Guess

511
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,140
who bought it.

512
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,620
Xiang Antu?

513
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,730
We underestimated her.

514
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,050
How did the coin end up in her hands?

515
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,250
She's clearly targeting you.

516
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,290
It's too much of a coincidence otherwise!

517
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,420
When's the next Capital Review?

518
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,810
Three more years.

519
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,780
Then I'll try to figure something out.

520
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,860
Maybe there's another way

521
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,170
to find that Zhesan coin.

522
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,260
I'll go look.

523
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,740
Go, then.

524
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,260
Hurry up.

525
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,780
You're right.

526
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,820
If even you can't find it,

527
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,300
I've got no chance.

528
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,340
Hai,

529
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,380
instead of running in circles,

530
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,130
why not try getting it from Miss Xiang?

531
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,650
Ordinary or rare Zhesan coins

532
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,090
are both with her

533
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,380
at Zhen Tower now.

534
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,650
This is an open scheme you can't avoid.

535
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,740
How much did she pay for the coin?

536
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,570
Five hundred taels.

537
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,010
She really shelled out.

538
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,570
All right,

539
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,380
we'll offer a thousand.

540
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,690
Where are we supposed to get a thousand taels?

541
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,420
You can't be serious.

542
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,570
Where's the deed to our house?

543
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,610
Hey, kid!

544
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,860
You're going to trade your house?

545
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,570
Where would I live?

546
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,780
No time to worry about that.

547
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,460
We need to show we're serious.

548
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,490
Here's the plan.

549
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,820
We'll stay at an inn for now.

550
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,860
As for living expenses later,

551
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,900
we'll just cut back.

552
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,820
Cut back?

553
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,980
Humph.

554
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,090
Hai,

555
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,940
let me think of a better way.

556
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,340
Master,

557
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,610
there's no other way!

558
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:26,610
So tomorrow,

559
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,300
go to Zhen Tower,

560
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,380
give her the house and land deeds.

561
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,090
You want me to go?

562
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,210
What good would that do?

563
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,980
She's pushing you!

564
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,170
If I go, she might double the price.

565
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,940
Then what will you do?

566
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,980
There's no other choice.

567
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,690
You're better off just pleading with Miss Xiang.

568
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,490
Swallow your pride, say you're sorry.

569
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,300
If you can cheer her up,

570
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,820
she won't make it hard for you.

571
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,570
It's not about pride anymore.

572
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,530
I've already made up my mind to focus on revenge.

573
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,260
Whatever her motives are,

574
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,130
I've made my choice.

575
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,300
I'll deal with whatever comes next.

576
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,530
The home's fallen apart.

577
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,210

603

You're usually teasing me,

604
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,940
but now you're just silent.

605
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,090
It's kind of weird.

606
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,420
With that face, who dares joke with you?

607
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,740
Didn't you say you'd never see him again?

608
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,130
He's patient enough.

609
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,740
He hasn't shown up since he left,

610
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,460
but keeps sending people to look for coins.

611
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,570
Didn't you say you wouldn't see him

612
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,610
even if he came?

613
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,380
Well, he has to show up first!

614
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,460
Miss, Mr. Zang is here.

615
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,940
Speak of the devil.

616
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,050
Invite him to Liutao Pavilion.

617
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,900
Yes, ma'am.

618
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,090
Looks like Mr. Zang's in for a treat.

619
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,380
Now that you're here,

620
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,260
my humble place suddenly feels grand.

621
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,300
I left in such a rush last time, didn't get to meet you.

622
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,050
I apologize.

623
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:26,820
Last time?

624
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,260
When did you ever come look for me? I don't recall.

625
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,490
That's my fault.

626
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,650
But since you forced me to come,

627
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,610
you must know why I'm here.

628
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,490
Don't flatter yourself.

629
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,530
I didn't force you. This was your idea.

630
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,740
Well, now that I'm here,

631
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,380
Miss Xiang, let's not dance around it.

632
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,650
Mr. Zang,

633
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,170
you're here for this, aren't you?

634
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,130
I've searched high and low for this Zhesan coin.

635
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,860
Glad it's in your hands.

636
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,820
I'm willing to offer double. Please consider it.

637
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,980
Double? Can you afford that?

638
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,900
I brought the house and land deeds.

639
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,980
Please accept them.

640
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,130
This Zhesan coin is incredibly rare.

641
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,090
To a true collector, it's priceless.

642
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,650
Mr. Zang,

643
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,570
I want to know

644
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,380
what do you want it for?

645
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,210
To be honest,

646
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,650
I'm new in office and need to build connections.

647
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,130
I especially want to meet Prince Yongrong.

648
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,460
I heard he loves collecting ancient coins.

649
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,740
So I'm playing to his taste.

650
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,610
Looks like your career matters a lot to you.

651
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,490
This coin is one of my favorites.

652
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,530
After hearing you out, it feels even more valuable.

653
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,340
I've decided to keep it.

654
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,420
Everything I have is right here.

655
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,740
If you won't part with it,

656
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,260
I won't push.

657
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,210
Thank you for granting me this meeting today.

658
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,170
Goodbye.

659
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,420
Wait.

660
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,820
I just remembered

661
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,300
I never finished reading your palm last time.

662
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,980
Let me finish it now.

663
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,260
That wound healed fast.

664
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,740
I can't even see the scar anymore.

665
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,690
Your career line looks a bit deeper now.

666
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,090
But the others

667
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,570
have gotten lighter.

668
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,860
I can't accept the house the Marquis gave you.

669
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,010
And I'm not short on money.

670
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,740
Take the coin.

671
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,050
But now you owe Zhen Tower a favor.

672
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,740
Miss,

673
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,300
you're just letting him go?

674
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,050
I can tell he's hiding a lot in his heart.

675
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,050
But pressing now

676
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,420
won't get us anywhere.

677
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,010
