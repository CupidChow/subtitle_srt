You should realize

20
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,280
that from the moment Muji Camp broke into the jail,

21
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,010

so he just wants to do this indirectly.

189
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,060
Since he doesn't want to kill you himself,

190
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,900
you still have a chance.

191
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,570
I heard that you have been promoted

192
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,050
and are now Vice Minister of Works.

193
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,180
Congratulations.

194
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,980
What are you going to do after this?

195
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,860
Now, you have two more enemies,

196
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,980
so have you figured out how to deal with them?

197
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,730
Just try my best.

198
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,900
We propose, and heaven disposes.

199
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,530
It's impossible for everything to go my way.

200
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,140
Are you happy now?

201
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,900
Your first enemy is dead,

202
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,940
so are you happy?

203
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
At first, I only wanted

204
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,620
to avenge my mother's death,

205
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,860
but then I found that I didn't have enough

206
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,490
and wanted more.

207
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,380
Now, it's too late.

208
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,250
I have come

209
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,660
to the end of this road unknowingly.

210
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,940
Then think of today as your new life.

211
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,380
Everything will start from scratch.

212
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,290
I hope you can find a new path.

213
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,140
From now on,

214
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,700
I will live well,

215
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,530
and I promised my father

216
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,860
to revive the Zhuang family.

217
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,660
Zhixing.

218
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,010
Why are you here?

219
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,860
Mr. Zang said

220
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,860
you were going to be stationed at the border,

221
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,730
so we wanted to go with you to distinguish ourselves gloriously.

222
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,490
I've asked the Ministry of War for them.

223
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,050
It's a long way to the north.

224
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,420
They've gone with you through the fire and water.

225
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,380
If they go with you, you can take care of each other.

226
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,180
Are you looking down on us

227
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,620
because you are now Field Officer of Verified Loyalty?

228
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,940
You go ahead. I'll be right there.

229
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,050
Farewell, sir.

230
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,220
Don't look back.

231
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,770
Go forward.

232
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,810
Don't look back.

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,340
[Clarity Through Composure]

234
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,730
Father.

235
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,940
Is Zhuang Zhixing out of the city?

236
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,660
Yes.

237
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,700
He left the city gates before the hour of You.

238
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,860
He's probably in the Yuzi Valley by now.

239
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,620
This time, the road is clear.

240
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,660
It's easy for us to do it.

241
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,220
He is now the Field Officer of Verified Loyalty verified by the Emperor.

242
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,140
If he dies on his way to his post,

243
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,330
everyone will think that I am the one

244
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,180
who is eliminating the remaining trouble.

245
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,570
A nobody like him

246
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,900
won't jeopardize my plans.

247
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,660
I just don't like the feeling

248
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,490
that my enemy is still alive.

249
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,700
Father, don't worry.

250
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,330
Conditions at the border are hard,

251
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,980
and there are always offensive bandits.

252
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,620
Zhuang Zhixing is just a commandant.

253
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,220
Without his dad's protection,

254
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,570
he could die at any time

255
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,810
after being sent to war a few times.

256
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,220
Any news about the hostage?

257
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,660
We haven't been able to find him since he disappeared

258
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,940
that night at Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion,

259
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,420
but

260
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,010
there's no word of the Gui Seal

261
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,180
on the streets of the city.

262
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,140
We've gathered

263
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,860
no intelligence about any response from Dongxia either.

265
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,530
How is the investigation at Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion going?

266
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,570
All of Zhuang Luyin's property has been confiscated.

267
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,090
I've checked them all.

268
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,250
There's nothing you want.

269
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,940
Get the carriage.

270
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,180
Now the sediment has been filtered,

271
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,570
so I'm going to check out the pearls

272
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,770

[Zang Residence]

275
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,570
Hai.

276
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,420
Guanfeng made a full table

277
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,090
to celebrate your first big revenge,

278
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,010
but you don't look like you're in the mood,

279
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,420
and you didn't eat much.

280
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,530
I was just thinking.

281
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,730
If your revenge is over,

282
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,860
what will you do with your life?

283
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,330
Have you thought about it?

284
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,250
What's the use of thinking about it now?

285
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,330
Hai.

286
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,940
You must.

287
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,220
I'm sure

288
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,570
the day will come soon.

289
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,730

290
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,460
In fact, revenge

291
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,860
is a relief for me,

292
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,050
but I am afraid

293
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,660
that I will die before my revenge is completed

294
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,460
to the extent that I will be ashamed to meet my parents,

295
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,010

Why are you here?

There's a big deal going on in the Capital.

301

Everyone knows about it.

302
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,460

your first enemy.

306
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,250
The Marquis of Pingjin is dead,

307
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,490
but you don't look very happy.

308
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,700
My masters have told me

309
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,620
that many things in my mind don't need to be shown.

310
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,490
I heard that you gave Zhuang Zhixing

311
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,460
a personal send-off today.

312
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,180
Before he left, he asked me

313
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,660
if I was happy after my revenge.

314
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,810
The Marquis of Pingjin died,

315
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,140
so by rights, I should feel relaxed and happy,

316
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,980
but that day, looking at Zhuang Zhixing,

317
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,090
I realized

318
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,140
that I had destroyed

319
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,620
an innocent and kind-hearted teenager

320
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,050
with my own hands in order to take revenge.

321
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,490
I probably could have found another way

322
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,530
to achieve my goal,

323
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,050
but instead, I chose to use hatred to manipulate people's hearts

324
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,050
and ruin their lives.

325
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,180
How am I any different from the Marquis of Pingjin?

326
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,180
You're not him.

327
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,770
Let's go.

328
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,530
Looks like this place

329
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,140
used to be an underground vault for storing charcoal.

330
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,010
This is it.

331
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,700
What place can be better

332
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,460
to hide a secret than here?

333
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,250
If the charcoal in the underground vault

334
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,940
hadn't been burned,

335
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,250
how could I have seen this house

336
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,220
as it was?

337
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,290
Are you suggesting

338
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,980
that Zhuang Luyin may have hidden the Gui Seal

339
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,330
inside the walls of the underground vault?

340
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,940
Sir.

341
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,420
Why does Cao Jingxian want the Gui Seal?

342
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,660
The Marquis of Pingjin wanted the Gui Seal

343
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,660
because it was rumored that the Gui Seal

344
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,050
could summon ghost soldiers and make him invincible in battle.

345
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,140
That may be the lifelong dream of every general,

346
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,050
but why does Cao Jingxian want the Gui Seal?

347
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,900
This rumor has a kind of power.

348
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,620
The power of the authority.

349
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,290
Cao Jingxian wants the Gui Seal

350
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,330
because the Emperor has no son.

351
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,730
So Cao Jingxian is afraid

352
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,250
that one day, he'll lose his power

353
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,900
and the possibility of living.

354
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,420
You are very enlightened.

355
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,250
Cao Jingxian

356
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,220
is the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director and powerful,

357
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,730
but he has no descendants,

358
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,530
and the only leader he can look up to is the Emperor.

359
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,810
Once the Emperor dies,

360
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,620
his power will crumble,

361
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,490
but he wants a happy ending,

362
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,460
so he needs to either befriend the successor

363
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,420
or have a tool

364
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,530
to continue his power.

365
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,980
So it's all

366
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,530
still about power.

367
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,810
Power doesn't die

368
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,980
in a thousand generations.

369
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,530
Father.

370
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,770
Take a closer look.

371
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,980
It's empty.

372
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,490
Now.

373
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,090
Open it.

374
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,570
Sir.

375
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,220
Where do you think the Gui Seal is?

376
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,010
Those three have searched for so long

377
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,460
but found nothing.

378
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,620
From what I know of them,

379
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,260
if Gui Seal had appeared,

380
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,820
they would have picked up the trail,

381
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,130
but they've been quiet for ten years,

382
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,170
so Gui Seal could still be in hiding.

383
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,610
Is it possible

384
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,980
that the Gui Seal has been found by the third person

385
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,530
who has kept it under wraps

386
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,010
and is unwilling to share it with the Marquis of Pingjin and Cao Jingxian

387
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,130
in order to keep them searching for it without any clues?

388
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,900
If the Gui Seal is really in the third person's hands,

389
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,300
she'll have the bronze fish set,

390
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,460
but that's okay.

391
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,090
Whether or not the Gui Seal has been found,

392
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,860
Cao Jingxian will fall into the trap.

393
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,690
As long as he thinks

394
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,690
that the Gui Seal is still with the Marquis of Pingjin,

395
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,380
then he will surely die.

396
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,420
What did you do?

397
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,210
I went to the Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion

398
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,460
and buried something in the underground vault.

399
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,420
[The bronze fish is about 2 cun long and half a cun wide]

400
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,420
Zhuang Luyin.

401
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,130
You really found it.

402
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,460
Father, be careful.

403
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,980
We could be in danger

404
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,460
if we take it out with imprudence.

405
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,900
No.

406
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,130
I want to watch you

407
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,740
open it.

408
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,650
Cao Jingxian is suspicious.

409
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,050
Once he finds the Gui Seal,

410
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,980
he will never allow his men to act independently

411
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,690
and will definitely verify the Gui Seal himself.

412
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,900
Based on his caution,

413
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,170
his guards will stand

414
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,460
in front of him when he triggers the mechanism,

415
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,900
but they don't know

416
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,530
that I have been aiming at his back from the beginning.

417
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,820
Attacking him while he's not prepared?

418
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,460
Gao Ming.

419
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,340
You and Xing Dou have produced a good apprentice,

420
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,050
but Zang Hai,

421
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,460
I'm afraid

422
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,780
that all your behavior

423
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,050
has caused a third person to catch wind of it.

424
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,860
She's far away in Dongxia.

425
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,300
If she doesn't come to the Capital, there's nothing I can do about it,

426
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,210
so all I want is for her to get wind of it.

427
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,570
Cao Jingxian is in secret collusion with the Queen of Dongxia,

428
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,900
so she may already know something.

429
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,340
If she really dares to come to the Capital,

430
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,460
you won't surely have a chance of winning.

431
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,780
Xiang Antu disappeared after the battle at the Marquis's Mansion,

432
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,980
and I was one of the Marquis of Pingjin's men,

433
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,610
so I was there that night.

434
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,860
And because of my previous relationship with her,

435
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,820
her men

436
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,780
will report it to the Queen of Dongxia.

437
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,780
She doesn't know that I'm a descendant of the Kuai family,

438
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,130
but her daughter's disappearance

439
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,090
has something to do with me anyway.

440
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,690
Maybe she's already been watching me in secret.

441
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,260
Princess Dongxia is still at your residence?

442
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,820
Yes.

443
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,460
Master Liuchu is taking care of her.

444
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,460
What will you do next?

445
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,460
I don't know yet.

446
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,940
Using her to blackmail the Queen of Dongxia might work.

447
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,210
There must be a better way.

448
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,130
We're all here.

449
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,260
You don't need to worry that you can't fight Queen of Dongxia.

450
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,980
Princess Dongxia has disappeared for so many days,

451
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,460
so they won't just sit back and do nothing.

452
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,780
Gao Ming.

453
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,980
Do some snooping around

454
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,090
and put out some more information.

455
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,340
And you, stay put

456
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,340
so as not to expose your whereabouts.

457
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,740
That's the way it is,

458
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,170
but you don't have to worry too much.

459
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,900
Liuchu, don't go.

460
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,420
I don't want to see him.

461
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,690
I'm his master,

462
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,460
so I must help him.

463
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,010
I can't always help you.

464
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,210
Don't worry.

465
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,170
Antu and I get along,

466
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,520
and I'm fond of her.

467
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,470
If you bully her again,

468
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,780
I'll beat you up.

469
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,460
I just heard from her

470
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,730
that Zhuang Luyin is dead

471
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,490
and that you made a move on Cao Jingxian.

472
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,130
My mother's next, isn't she?

473
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,640
If you kill her,

474
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,300
I'll hate you forever.

475
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,380
If you want to kill her, kill me first,

476
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,380
or I'll take revenge on you.

477
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,780
Fine.

478
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,940
At that time, I will be at your disposal.

479
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,940
It's cold. Wear more clothes.

480
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,320
[Cold medicine]

481
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,780
A prescription from Renjitang's physician.

482
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,740
Take it three times a day on schedule.

483
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,210
Thank you for your concern.

484
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,650
How are they talking?

485
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,650
The way he's going,

486
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,420
I'm not sure

487
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,260
if he can make it to the end.

488
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,380
I'm afraid Hai may fail because of a woman.

489
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,740
Hai has a clear mind.

490
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,010
I'm leaving.

491
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,490
To where?

492
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,010
It's none of your business.

493
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,420
I can't stay here forever.

494
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,650
Okay.

495
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,520
I'll get your carriage ready.

496
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:02,900
No need.

497
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,470
The carriage is already outside.

498
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,610
I'll probably be away from home for a while

499
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,050
because I have to contact Dongxia's spies

500
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,170
to help Hai get word of the Gui Seal's presence in the Capital

501
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,170
as soon as possible.

502
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,260
Did I ask you?

503
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,570
I was just talking to myself.

504
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,460
Did I give you permission to go?

505
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,650
What else?

506
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,570
Fill the stove in my carriage with charcoal.

507
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,620
I need it to be warm.

508
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,810
Good. I'll do it.

509
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,460
I'll add more.

510
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,380
I'll add more.

511
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,010
You underestimate the Queen of Dongxia.

512
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,900
How can you kill her?

513
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,690
You've locked me in here

514
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,650
just to lure her here.

515
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,010
How can Queen of Dongxia be compared

516
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,010
to Zhuang Luyin and Cao Jingxian?

517
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,130
That's right.

518
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,460
I can't even solve your plots,

519
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,610
let alone your mother's.

520
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,780
Zang Hai.

521
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,690
Don't go to my mother.

522
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,610
You can't defeat her, and you will die.

523
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,740
It'll be great

524
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,650
