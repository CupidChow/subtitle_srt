1
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:21,000



2
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:30,020
   

3
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,760
   

4
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,310
His Majesty flew into a rage in the imperial court today.

5
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,180
I fear he knows about the stolen Gui Seal

6
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,230
and that the Empress of Dongxia suddenly died last night.

7
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,510
Such coincidences do not exist in this world.

8
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,770
The Hostage's Residence is heavily guarded by the Imperial Guards.

9
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,940
It seems His Majesty not only knows about the theft,

10
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,050
he also suspects the people of Dongxia.

11
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,890
And Cao Jingxian has the seal.

12
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,400
This is bad.

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,210
Cao Jingxian did not show up today.

14
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,690
His injury is severe.

15
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,560
He won't act rashly for the time being.

16
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,600
What matters most now is to find a way to clear Antu of suspicion.

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,430
Based on what you said about His Majesty's attitude,

18
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,380
I fear we are powerless.

19
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,480
Your Highness, stop looking. Let's go inside.

20
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,410
You're still not feeling well.

21
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,830
I've lived here for ten years.

22
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,870
I used to despise this place.

23
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,090
But now, I won't be able to see it much longer.

24
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,307
   

25
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,410
You're here.

26
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,340
I... have obtained it.

27
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,080
But I...

28
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,780
can't hang on any longer.

29
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,100
We've planned this for so long.

30
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,120
I didn't expect...

31
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,460
the one to have the last laugh...

32
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,090
would be you.

33
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,540
In that case, from here on,

34
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,510
I'll leave everything to you.

35
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,380
You may go now.

36
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,920
Zang Hai, what do we do now?

37
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,700
The Imperial Guards have surrounded the Hostage's Residence for days.

38
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,870
Have you seen Antu?

39
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,950
How is she doing?

40
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,000
News from the Hostage's Residence has been sealed off.

41
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,530
Don't even mention seeing her,

42
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,680
we can't even find out how she is.

43
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,950
Don't panic first.

44
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,390
Nothing has been concluded now,

45
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,130
but I fear this situation won't last for long.

46
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,150
I'll beg my father to find a way for me to see Antu.

47
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,270
Don't.

48
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,870
The Hostage's Residence is now heavily guarded.

49
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,750
It's impossible to sneak in.

50
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,410
Even if your father is willing to help us,

51
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,270
the situation will only be more complicated and backfire.

52
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,000
By that time, not only will we fail to help her,

53
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,890
your entire family might be implicated.

54
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,200
How can she endure it alone?

55
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,900
Don't worry.

56
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,650
I'll do everything I can to get her out of danger.

57
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,770
- Chief Secretary. 
 - What is it?

58
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,450
The Surveillance Office sent this letter to us.

59
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,380
The Surveillance Office?

60
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,720
- Did Eunuch Cao send someone to deliver this? 
 - Yes.

61
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,370
These appear to be secret letters from Dongxia's hostage.

62
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,720
Prepare my horse.  I must go to the palace to see His Majesty.

63
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,930
Yes, sir.

64
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,750
Sir.

65
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,270
Sir.

66
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,030
Something happened.

67
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,080
What is it?

68
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,810
We were in the street and found that Zhen Tower was besieged by Imperial Guards.

69
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,630
They said the owner of Zhen Tower was a hostage

70
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,870
and sowed discord for ten years between Dongxia and Great Yong.

71
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,040
Another squad of Imperial Guards is heading for the Hostage's Residence.

72
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,650
This is bad.

73
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,120
It's the Princess of Dongxia.

74
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,750
What happened to her?

75
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,980
Haven't you heard?

76
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,200
The Empress of Dongxia just died.

77
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,910
It's rumored that the princess killed her.

78
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,390
She killed her mother?

79
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,960
How ruthless.

80
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,850
- Look! 
 - They're out!

81
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,150
Halt! What are you doing?

82
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,700
Step back!

83
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,980
 Leave now. 

84
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,280
I've received word.

85
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,760
After the empress' death, a new empress ascended the throne.

86
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,000
It's Miss Xiang's older sister, Mingxiang Yinshu.

87
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,350
Somehow, the Surveillance Officers found evidence at Shen Tower

88
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,510
of Miss Xiang's evidence for the past decade

89
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,000
to sow discord between Dongxia and Great Yong.

90
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,940
They submitted it to His Majesty.

91
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,900
They claimed that she resented being taken a hostage

92
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,080
and bore hatred in her heart.

93
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,410
These are all false accusations.

94
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,430
Cao Jingxian knew His Majesty was going to investigate the Gui Seal

95
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,110
and set up this trap.

96
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,050
And the newly crowned empress has revoked Miss Xiang's royal status.

97
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,260
She formally requested His Majesty to handle this in Great Yong,

98
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,300
and said that Dongxia wouldn't intervene.

99
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,240
In other words, Dongxia has abandoned her.

100
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,310
You can say that.

101
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,500
Although he's gravely wounded,

102
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,540
Cao Jingxian still has such great ability.

103
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,070
The empress is dead. He has the Gui Seal.

104
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,600
Antu and I will be the first he'll eliminate.

105
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,150
What do we do? Should we rescue Miss Xiang?

106
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,540
Do not act recklessly.

107
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,480
Once we make any moves, we may cause her death.

108
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,970
Is there no other solution?

109
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,380
Master, I need you to forge a punishment department writ.

110
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,200
You're entering the Imperial Prison?

111
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,020
No... Absolutely not.

112
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,940
Brat, you've an unusual identity now. This is too dangerous.

113
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,150
I won't act recklessly. I've yet to take revenge.

114
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,410
Please help me this time.

115
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,290
But it's hard to forge the seal for this writ.

116
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,480
But you can certainly do it.

117
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,280
I don't need it to be perfect.

118
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,040
I only need it to fool the prison guards.

119
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,180
But if there's a careless mistake, neither of you will make it out.

120
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,980
Xiao Hai, what exactly are you planning to do?

121
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,510
What I'll say next is very important. Don't ask why.

122
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,290
Just do as I say and make sure that nothing goes wrong.

123
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,870
I'll take this forged writ to see Xiang Antu today.

124
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,520
I don't know anything about her situation.

125
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,880
So, I must see her as soon as possible.

126
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,390
What you must do is to wait for me at home.

127
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,140
No matter how late it is.

128
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:19,590
Once I return, we must immediately devise a plan to rescue her.

129
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,450
Time is of the essence. She may face danger as early as tomorrow.

130
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,930
We might only have a few hours left to save her.

131
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,440
Master, please trust me.

132
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,240
We will rescue Antu.

133
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,720
You may leave.

134
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,450
Yes, sir.

135
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,080
Zang Hai.

136
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,780
You have suffered.

137
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,600
Why are you here? Don't do anything foolish for me.

138
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,420
Don't worry. I came here with a writ.

139
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,320
Did His Majesty allow you to participate in the case?

140
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,760
No. This is fake.

141
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,980
You are insane.

142
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,710
Forging official documents is tantamount to deceiving the Emperor.

143
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,030
They'll find out when it's verified in the morning.

144
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,770
You must leave the capital now. Don't worry about me.

145
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,030
I've taken this step.

146
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,700
There's no turning back.

147
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:32,910
To Dongxia, I'm already a discarded person.

148
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,830
Death is certain for me now.

149
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,780
I won't let you die. You will leave here safely.

150
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,750
His Majesty detained me...

151
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,870
because he suspected Dongxia took the Gui Seal.

152
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,730
If the seal is not found, he won't give up.

153
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,770
If I leave, he'll simply take it out on Dongxia.

154
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,140
My sister just ascended the throne. Her foundation is still weak.

155
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,650
If war breaks out between the countries, Dongxia will face utter destruction.

156
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,360
Don't worry. I have a plan.

157
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,440
Don't do anything more for me.

158
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,400
While you can still escape, leave quickly.

159
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,920
I've lost too many loved ones.

160
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,660
Now, I cannot lose you, too.

161
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,010
Wait for me.

162
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,070
Eunuch Sun.

163
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,060
Lord Zang, it's late. His Majesty has retired for the night.

164
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,540
If there's anything, please bring it up at the imperial court tomorrow.

165
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,100
Eunuch Sun, I have an extremely urgent matter

166
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,960
and need to see His Majesty immediately.

167
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,340
Please announce me.

168
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,690
Steward, Lord Zang left a letter for you.

169
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,050
- When was this? 
 - He gave it to me before he left.

170
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,480
He specifically instructed me to deliver it to you at this time.

171
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,030
What is Xiao Hai trying to do?

172
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,790
 Master, what I told you was the truth and also a lie. 

173
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,470
 I'll do everything to save her, but I must go alone. 

174
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,200
 I will confess everything to His Majesty. 

175
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,440
 You know what that means. 

176
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,780
 Tonight, you must flee the mansion and hide. 

177
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,360
 If I fail, please take Guan Feng and Shi Lei and flee far away. 

178
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,770
 If she and I return together tomorrow, we shall meet again. 

179
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,490
What did Xiao Hai say?

180
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,780
He fooled us.

181
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,230
He went alone to save Miss Xiang.

182
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,980
This is too dangerous. We must help him.

183
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,200
We may no longer be able to.

184
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,810
Xiao Hai is making a perilous move in risking death to save a life.

185
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,030
He wanted us to stay out of it

186
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,220
so that he could proceed without worry.

187
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,958
   

188
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,760
Lord Zang, we've arrived.

189
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,420
Lord Zang, please.

190
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,450
Your Majesty, Lord Zang has arrived.

191
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm here to confess my crime, Your Majesty.

192
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,250
Zang Hai, Vice Minister of Works,

193
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,630
what crime have you committed?

194
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,830
Speak.

195
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,910
- The item Your Majesty lost... 
 - Shut up!

196
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,290
Guards!

197
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,240
Tie him up.

198
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

199
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,780
Leave now.

200
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

201
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,510
You can speak now.

202
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,980
A few days ago, I...

203
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,370
privately entered Your Majesty's Hanzhang Palace

204
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,070
and unlocked the mechanism in the heated pavilion...

205
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,030
to take the Gui Seal.

206
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,870
Zang Hai, how dare you!

207
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,250
Where is the seal?

208
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,750
Your Majesty, the seal is now with Cao Jingxian.

209
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,920
That night,

210
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,510
I brought the seal back to the Astronomical Bureau

211
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,030
but Cao Jingxian took it away.

212
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,200
Deceiving the monarch is punishable by death.

213
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,680
Your Majesty, it is a capital crime.

214
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,880
It's also a capital crime to take away the Gui Seal.

215
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,070
I have confessed everything.

216
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,790
I could not possibly be deceiving Your Majesty further.

217
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,340
Why should I believe you?

218
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,010
There is one more reason.

219
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,820
When I was in Hanzhang Palace that day,

220
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:34,030
I saw a wood carving with a deer and a goose.

221
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,140
Only then did I realize

222
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,480
my father and Your Majesty once shared a deep bond.

223
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,720
So, I'm here today

224
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,480
daring to ask Your Majesty to honor that past bond.

225
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,710
Your father?

226
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,940
Who are you?

227
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,180
I was once called...

228
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,810
Zhinu.

229
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,940
I am the son of Kuai Duo, the former Imperial Astronomer.

230
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:14,170
Ten years ago, all 14 members of my family were slaughtered.

231
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,510
I'm the only survivor.

232
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,040
I returned to the capital for revenge.

233
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,280
Raise your head.

234
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,600
How can you prove you are Zhinu?

235
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,400
When I was a child,

236
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,200
my father often fiddled with a wooden deer sculpture.

237
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,960
I asked him about it.

238
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,340
He only said, "In the jungle,

239
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,420
you never know what beast is spying on you from behind the leaves."

240
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,290
But he told me,

241
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,340
"I hope you'll meet a deer in your most dangerous moment in the future."

242
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,250
Where is that deer sculpture now?

243
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,810
It was burned with the mansion the night my family was slaughtered.

244
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,450
Your father bought you this life.

245
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,110
Rise.

246
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,360
- Thank you, Your Majesty. 
 - Sun Defang!

247
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,070
- Your Majesty. 
 - Send people to Cao Mansion at once.

248
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,480
Do not let anyone leave the premises.

249
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,880
Search every corner carefully.

250
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

251
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,960
Who are your enemies?

252
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:05,550
Zhuang Luyin, Cao Jingxian.

253
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,360
There is one more person I have yet to identify.

254
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:20,490
So to say, Zhuang Luyin and Cao Jingxian's recent downfalls...

255
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,240
were because of you?

256
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,540
So, to find this unknown person,

257
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,500
you stole my Gui Seal.

258
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,350
Your Majesty,

259
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,030
the three of them killed my entire family

260
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,960
all because of the Gui Seal.

261
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,270
Thus, I could only use the Gui Seal to find the third person.

262
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,480
- But… 
 - But you neither found the third person

263
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,720
nor kept the Gui Seal.

264
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,740
So, all these years,

265
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,640
they've been searching for the Gui Seal.

266
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,830
Zhuang Luyin, after massacring my family,

267
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,920
was not content to leave empty-handed.

268
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,160
He even flayed my parents

269
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,750
and hung their skins in the mansion's cellar.

270
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,640
He then had Chu Huaiming use his position

271
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,420
to search for the seal everywhere.

272
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,340
As for Cao Jingxian, he used the Surveillance Office

273
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,640
to track for traces of it.

274
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,090
Years ago, he even placed his adopted son in the Astronomical Bureau as a spy

275
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,560
until I eventually brought the seal out.

276
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,910
Had they known from the start

277
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,240
that the seal was in Your Majesty's hands,

278
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,970
perhaps all this could have been avoided.

279
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,300
Are you blaming me

280
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,900
for not announcing to the world that I possessed the Gui Seal,

281
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,450
which led to your family's slaughter and many more deaths?

282
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,700
I dare not.

283
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,320
Zang Hai.

284
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,750
You are too naive.

285
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,310
Even if I had made it public,

286
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,310
they would not have stopped.

287
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:29,040
Would Your Majesty be willing to enlighten me?

288
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:37,260
You wish to know what really happened back then?

289
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,200
I've been relentlessly pursuing the third enemy.

290
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,240
If Your Majesty could reveal the truth to me,

291
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,820
perhaps I may finally find the third person.

292
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,800
Can you craft birdcages?

293
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:43,160
I met your father when I was a prince.

294
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,020
I was fond of woodwork and carpentry.

295
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,440
The late emperor doted on me and allowed Kuai Duo...

296
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,840
 - Your Highness. 
- to be my study companion.

297
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,100
Your Highness.

298
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,030
Kuai Duo inherited his family's craftsmanship

299
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,020
and became my dearest friend in childhood.

300
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,960
Those were my most unforgettable days.

301
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,880
With Kuai Duo by my side, 
    

302
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,570
I tasted the joys of a commoner's life.

303
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,070
In the 20th year of Wuhe,

304
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:28,560
the long battle for the Crown Prince's seat finally came to an end.

305
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,220
The one chosen by the late emperor...

306
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,480
was not Prince of Yan, the legitimate eldest son,

307
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,590
nor Prince of Qi, who was virtuous and capable.

308
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,720
It was me instead, a concubine's prince without a mother.

309
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,480
 In reverent accordance with the initial decree, 

310
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,300
 following the rites and respecting the will of the people, 

311
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,070
 I solemnly informed Heaven and Earth and bestowed the golden book 

312
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,450
 to establish the crown prince and continue the legacy of generations. 

313
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,440
From then on, I could no longer pursue carpentry.

314
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,830
Instead, I was taught the art of being a ruler by the Crown Prince's tutor.

315
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,810
Kuai Duo joined the Astronomical Bureau 
    

316
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,720
to learn from his father.

317
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,400
There's no peace for being born into the imperial family.

318
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:25,450
Back then, I had yet to understand what fate lay ahead.

319
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,680
In the 35th year of Wuhe,

320
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,550
Dongxia stirred trouble at the borders. There was a threat of invasion.

321
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:37,000
The late emperor decided to personally lead a campaign against Dongxia.

322
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,960
As the Crown Prince,

323
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,680
I remained in the capital to oversee state affairs.

324
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,240
The army sent back frequent reports of victory.

325
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,550
The entire capital rejoiced in triumph.

326
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,590
Yet within the palace,

327
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,360
a silent conspiracy targeting me was brewing.

328
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,720
 Your Highness. 

329
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,170
 Your Highness! What's wrong, Your Highness? 

330
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,370
 Your Highness, Your... 

331
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,310
 Someone! Summon the imperial physician! 

332
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,430
 Summon the imperial physician! 

333
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,350
 Eunuch, bad news! 

334
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,350
 The Imperial Academy of Medicine reported 

335
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,050
 that the Empress is suffering from another migraine. 

336
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,200
 All the imperial physicians were summoned by her. 

337
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,440
 Your Highness. 

338
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,880
 Your Highness. 

339
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,260
 Please hang in there. 

340
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,830
 I'll seek a physician from outside the palace now. 

341
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,350
 Your Highness? 

342
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:45,420
 Help me to find this person... 

343
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,850
 Kuai Duo... 

344
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,560
 Kuai Duo... 

345
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,550
 Go now. 

346
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,430
 Yes, Your Highness. 

347
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,530
 Your Highness, please hang in there. 

348
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,280
 The poisoning was recent. 

349
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,240
 I could save you in time. 

350
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,170
 But I fear... 

351
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,190
 the enemy may have more schemes. 

352
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,430
 Eunuch Sun, please tell the Imperial Guards to send more men here. 

353
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:43,280
 But the guards have all been dispatched 

354
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,210
 to Shenwu Gate for night duty tonight. 

355
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,030
 Sun Defang. 

356
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,070
 Yes, Your Highness. 

357
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,280
 Go to the Five Armies Camp now and find Xue Zhao. 

358
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,550
 Tell him to lead men to protect the throne. 

359
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,610
 Yes, Your Highness. 

360
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:09,210
 "There's no peace for being born into the imperial family." 

361
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,780
 You were right. 

362
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,200
 They failed to poison me. 

363
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,740
 They will come again to kill me. 

364
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,200
 I fear it will be tonight. 

365
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,180
 Go home. 

366
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,760
 Leave. 

367
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,350
 Don't stay here and die. 

368
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,620
 Go. 

369
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,450
 Rest assured, Your Highness. 

370
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,950
 I will not let them harm you again. 

371
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,110
 Soldiers, heed my command! 

372
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,860
   

373
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,380
 The Crown Prince is in danger. 

374
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,110
 Hurry to the front gate and defend it! 

375
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,010
 Understood! 

376
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,760
   

377
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,380
 Where is the Crown Prince? I want to see him. 

378
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,280
 Who are you? What is your purpose? 

379
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,420
 I'm under orders to deliver His Majesty's final decree to His Highness. 

380
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,160
 Crown Prince, His Majesty has passed away. 

381
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,850
 By the late emperor's decree, the Crown Prince shall ascend the throne! 

382
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,952
   

383
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,510
Your father saved my life.

384
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,150
Your father was the one I trusted most.

385
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,220
The Great Yong army collapsed overnight.

386
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,670
The late emperor was grief-stricken, fell ill, and died at the border.

387
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,880
Everything was due to the Gui Seal.

388
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,380
The last order the late emperor gave me before his death

389
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,400
was to seize the Gui Seal.

390
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,230
When I first ascended the throne,

391
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,230
my throne was unstable. 
    

392
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,110
Thus, I had to plant my own man in the Directorate of Ceremonial.

393
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,720
And that man was Cao Jingxian.

394
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,630
The second thing I had to do was to win a great battle

395
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,880
to wash away the shame of Great Yong.

396
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,710
Dongxia defeated us with the Gui Seal,

397
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:19,970
but their empress died soon after and the Gui Seal vanished.

398
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,920
Following Cao Jingxian's advice,

399
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,360
I appointed Zhuang Luyin, who was guarding the border.

400
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,540
Our army sharpened its blades and marched again to Dongxia.

401
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,030
This time, Dongxia, without the Gui Seal,

402
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,700
finally submitted to Great Yong.

403
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,220
The third thing I did

404
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,280
was to secretly send your father to Mount Dansui in Dongxia to search for the Gui Seal,

405
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,820
under the guise of overseeing the Fengshan Altar's construction.

406
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,780
I knew your father would never disappoint me.

407
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,410
And I waited for three long years.

408
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,590
One night in the ninth year of Zhenshun, your father returned.

409
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,030
 Your Majesty, Sir Kuai has returned. 

410
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,030
 I, Kuai Duo, greet Your Majesty. 

411
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,220
 Rise, quick. 

412
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,570
 Your Majesty, 

413
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,900
 I retrieved it. 

414
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,460
 Is this the Gui Seal? 

415
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,420
 Indeed. 

416
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:06,430
 How can such a small item control the ghost soldiers? 

417
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,360
 I've never personally witnessed it. 

418
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,900
 I only heard of its immense power. 

419
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,780
 Dongxia once possessed it, 

420
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,150
 but they've submitted to us. 

421
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,950
 The ancient sages said that fortune and misfortune go hand in hand. 

422
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,880
 I do not know which one it will bring. 

423
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,840
 How to use this? 

424
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:37,360
 Your Majesty, I... do not know either. 

425
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,550
 Do you know what it feels like 

426
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,590
 to hold this in your hand? 

427
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,950
 I no longer fear anyone. 

428
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:03,010
 The kingdom is now within my grasp! 

429
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,180
 Your Majesty, 

430
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,990
 you're the Son of Heaven. 

431
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,800
 Even without it, 

432
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,990
 the kingdom is still yours. 

433
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,170
 You don't understand. 

434
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:28,760
 Without this, in a few years, 

435
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:36,330
 you might be calling someone else the Son of Heaven. 

436
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,110
 Your Majesty... 

437
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,630
 I was merely making a joke. 

438
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,100
 Rise. 

439
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,050
 In the end, 

440
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,640
 you still don't wish me to possess this item. 

441
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,370
 I dare not. 

442
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,360
 You're aware of the tragedies from past years. 

443
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,730
 If Dongxia uses this again to wage war against Great Yong, 

444
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,210
 you will regret. 

445
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,060
 I will regret. 

446
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,950
 A state's deadly weapon must not be revealed. 

447
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,050
 A ruler's weakness must not be exposed. 

448
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,450
 But Beloved Subject Kuai, 

449
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,640
 you really know a lot of my weaknesses. 

450
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:10,010



451
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,200
