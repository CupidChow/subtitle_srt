00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,220
[Zhen Tower]

4
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,020
Excuse me.

5
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,260
Was that...?

6
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,170
That was Mr. Eight.

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,850
Mr. Zang, please don't keep Miss Xiang waiting.

8
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,060
Miss, Mr. Zang is here.

9
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,980
Miss Xiang.

10
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,940
Well, that's timely.

11
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,980
I just got back,

12
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,010
and here you are with gifts.

13
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,730
What, are you in need

14
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,410
of Zhen Tower's help already?

15
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,340
Please forgive me.

16
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,060
I'm here to make amends.

17
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,980
I was too arrogant and failed to appreciate

18
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,730
your kindness.

19
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,060
I let you down.

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,260
Is it too late to change

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,610
my mind now?

22
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,980
Didn't you say you weren't

23
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,730
worthy of my friendship?

24
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,730
Why have you changed your mind?

25
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,570
Did earning the Marquis's favor

26
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,730
make you think

27
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,730
you're above me now?

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,170
Favor?

29
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,010
I'd be lucky if the Marquis isn't suspicious of me.

30
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,290
The rumors

31
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,940
these past few days have nearly

32
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,340
ruined me.

33
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,170
So that's why you're here?

34
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,820
What rumors?

35
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,290
I haven't heard a thing.

36
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,410
Miss Xiang,

37
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,450
please have mercy on me.

38
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,850
The rumors from Mr. Eight...

39
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,100
Who said they came from him?

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,100
This has nothing to do with Zhen Tower.

41
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,410
Fine...

42
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,170
Let's just say the rumors

43
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,130
didn't start here.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,660
I came today

45
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,850
to ask for your help

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,500
in putting an end

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,610
to those rumors.

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,850
Rumors blow over like the wind.

49
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,340
The wind fades,

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,890
but the damage remains.

51
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,540
Rumors stick in people's minds.

52
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,410
Over time,

53
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,730
they forget

54
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,340
where they heard them

55
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,980
and just assume they're true.

56
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,540
You really care that much?

57
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,540
The Marquis said

58
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,810
he'd get to the bottom of this.

59
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,700
Are you threatening me with his name?

60
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,660
I wouldn't dare.

61
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,220
But if you're truly blameless

62
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,700
and unwilling to help,

63
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,370
I'll have to leave it to fate.

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,100
You overestimate me.

65
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,340
I doubt I could

66
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,100
convince Mr. Eight.

67
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,540
I believe you can.

68
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,220
Zang Hai,

69
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,410
if you want to chase power and success,

70
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,810
there are plenty

71
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,540
of powerful men in the Capital to rely on.

72
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,850
Why are you

73
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,340
so fixated on serving

74
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,850
the Marquis of Pingjin?

75
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,700
He needed a feng shui master for the burial

76
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,140
of the Empress Dowager,

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,660
so he seized me.

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,290
I was just a commoner.

79
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,340
To survive, I had no choice.

80
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,490
I was just like a drowning man

81
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,850
clutching a floating branch in the currents

82
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,050
and trying to make it out alive.

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,980
It just so happened that the branch turned out to be

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,660
a towering tree.

85
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,780
If you ask me,

86
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,980
he didn't choose you.

87
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,460
You chose him.

88
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,660
Sounds like you care quite a bit as well.

89
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,140
In the Capital,

90
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,220
relationships form a tight web.

91
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,900
Grudges

92
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,930
and favors

93
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,810
are like hidden rocks in the river.

94
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,580
You can't see or feel them

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,980
until your boat hits one.

96
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,660
Well said.

97
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,250
I'll keep that in mind.

98
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,540
But rest assured.

99
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,610
I'm not your enemy.

100
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,100
Our goals don't clash.

101
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,540
That's not

102
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,700
for you to decide.

103
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,850
Miss Xiang,

104
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,370
just wait and see.

105
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,100
I'll be here in the Capital

106
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,340
for you and everyone else to watch.

107
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,660
I won't be watching.

108
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,610
Whether you turn out good or bad

109
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,930
has nothing to do with me.

110
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,810
[Dried Fruit]
Chili peppers!

111
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,140
- Dried chili peppers! - That stall belongs to a Dongxia merchant.

112
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,610
Dongxia and the Great Yong

113
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,730
trade regularly.

114
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,250
But it's tough doing business here now,

115
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,730
with the Surveillance Office always watching.

116
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,930
He's just

117
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,850
like you said,

118
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,050
under countless watchful eyes.

119
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,140
Oh, well.

120
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,580
You made yourself sound so pitiful.

121
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,900
If I don't give you a break,

122
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,930
I'll be as awful as the Surveillance Office.

123
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,290
Thanks for the gifts.

124
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,810
I'll talk to Mr. Eight for you.

125
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,930
Thank you, Miss Xiang.

126
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:55,850
I'll take my leave.

127
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,610
Sir,

128
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,610
what would you like?

129
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,660
Have a look around.

130
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,930
Candied hawthorn!

131
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,610
These are handmade,

132
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,900
embroidered

133
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,540
with Dongxia patterns.

134
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,370
Would you like one?

135
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,490
I'll take this one.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,780
Thank you, sir.

137
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,980
Thank you!

138
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,650
So you're letting him off already?

139
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,650
Didn't you want

140
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,490
to sabotage his career and get him

141
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,300
kicked out of the Capital?

142
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,460
I can't figure him out.

143
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,300
He seemed

144
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,300
to have used the rumors to gain

145
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,730
more trust from the Marquis.

146
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,610
He really is something.

147
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,490
Now you're admiring his talent?

148
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,610
He ignored my warning,

149
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,980
so why should I bother?

150
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,890
We'll see how things go.

151
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,580
The real show's still to come.

152
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,180
Fresh cakes!

153
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,180
Hot and sweet!

154
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,820
Master.

155
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,220
You planned to assassinate the Marquis

156
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,250
and didn't even tell me?

157
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,820
Look at you, flying solo already.

158
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,420
Master,

159
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,100
I was wrong.

160
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,820
I was going to ask for your advice,

161
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,250
but someone knocked me out and took me away.

162
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,980
When I came to,

163
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,490
I saw my senior brother, Guanfeng.

164
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,420
He was also working at the Marquis's Mansion.

165
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,340
[Books]

166
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,100
Oh my, so much has happened.

167
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,300
Good thing

168
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,980
the rumors are cleared,

169
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,610
and the Marquis has lowered his guard.

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,980
Zhen Tower really is powerful.

171
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,980
They nearly ruined you with just a few rumors.

172
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,490
We can't kill the Marquis now.

173
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,700
I need to keep serving him to find out who the third person is.

174
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,370
Since it was three people plotting together,

175
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,250
chances are

176
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,100
that they're

177
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,490
of similar standing.

178
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,090
Not necessarily.

179
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,300
It's been years.

180
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,770
Officials rise and fall.

181
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,940
We can't rule anyone out by status.

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,700
Our target can be

183
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,300
a noble,

184
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,340
a rich merchant,

185
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,610
or even a commoner.

186
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,250
I didn't think of that.

187
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,850
If so, the investigation could take forever.

188
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,890
If only the Marquis would just

189
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,820
tell us himself.

190
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,530
That'd make it easy.

191
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,490
Master,

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,650
you're right.

193
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,250
I was joking.

194
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,460
You took that seriously?

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,370
Listen,

196
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,300
there is a way to make him talk.

197
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,850
But I can't ask him.

198
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,220
No matter how close we are,

199
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,460
if I bring it up,

200
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,530
he'll get suspicious.

201
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,340
So, I need someone else,

202
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,730
someone who can talk to him

203
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,490
and get him to open up.

204
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,770
Then it has to be someone really close to him.

205
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,490
Jiang Xiang, his principal wife,

206
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,820
is a proud noblewoman.

207
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,180
Even if you're useful to her,

208
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,980
she'll treat you like a dog.

209
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,530
The same goes for Zhuang Zhifu.

210
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,940
Besides, I've drawn too much attention.

211
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,100
Both Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao died because of me.

212
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,730
They won't trust me easily.

213
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,220
So that leaves one person.

214
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,770
Too bad Zhuang Zhixing is such a pushover.

215
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,490
Otherwise, he'd be a good choice.

216
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,490
No. He is the best choice.

217
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,580
But everyone in the Capital knows

218
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,100
the Marquis doesn't like him.

219
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,530
Are you sure?

220
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,530
Yes.

221
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,700
I'll help him earn

222
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,180
the Marquis's favor and trust.

223
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,220
Then he can ask for me.

224
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,220
Why would he help you?

225
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,890
Because people move for one thing: self-interest.

226
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,370
And what do you have to offer?

227
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,490
I'll help him become the Zhuang family's heir.

228
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,300
The heir?

229
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,460
Zhuang Zhifu is the legitimate son.

230
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,980
Zhuang Zhixing is just

231
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,220
a lost cause.

232
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,490
How could he possibly compete?

233
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,770
That's exactly why

234
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,460
he'll be tempted.

235
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,490
I help him rise,

236
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,700
and he helps me learn the Marquis's secret.

237
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,100
Fair deal.

238
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,250
Besides, I heard his birth mother

239
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,700
was once deeply favored by the Marquis.

240
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,300
But over time,

241
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,730
both mother and son got cast aside.

242
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,220
That kind

243
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,340
of fall from grace is hard to live with.

244
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,530
So I believe

245
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,650
he won't turn me down.

246
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,740

Please forgive her.

she is no longer Dongxia's princess.

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,940
a girl ran into the palace.

292

I think...

294
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,300
I think she went that way.

Your Highness,

296
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,060
wait here.

Let's check over there.

298
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,250
Yes.

299
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,700
They're gone.

300
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,180
Why didn't you tell them?

301
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,490
You didn't do anything wrong.

302
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,770
Why should I?

303
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,530
Isn't sneaking in a bad thing?

304
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,420
To me,

305
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,130
sneaking out is worse.

306
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,060
I'm exhausted.

307
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,340
I finally got out on my own.

308
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,250
Do they watch you that closely?

309
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,770
Yeah.

310
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,860
Someone always follows me.

311
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,050
I'm not allowed to talk to others freely.

312
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,380
But you're free today.

313
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,140
If you want, I know lots of ways to sneak out.

314
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,660

320
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,570
Still not quite right.

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,140
Then let's try another shop.

322
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,810
So?

323
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,290

324
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,490

going on about the same stuff,

like Great Yong's etiquette and its glorious history.

327
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,140
I'm so sick of it.

or a stirring tale of revenge?

336
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,330
I want to hear

337
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,860

a tale of...

00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,140
a Dongxia songstress

342

00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,420
If you want a real story,

348
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,570

No.

00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,530
Have you thought about the future?

353
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,380
I have.

354
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,050
Well,

355
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,140
not too clearly.

356
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,620
But I do know

357
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,570
I hate doing needlework.

358
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,140
And I hate the books

359
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,010
my father makes me read. They're so dull.

360
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,380
What I love

361
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,050
is sitting around

362
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,250
in alleys and teahouses,

363
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,250
listening to gossip,

364
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,010
and turning it into stories.

365
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,900
If I can tell them with shadow puppets,

366
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,290
that would be perfect!

367
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,380
If you perform stories with shadow puppets,

368
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,010
you'll definitely draw big crowds.

369
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,420
By the end of the day,

370
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,290
you'll have more tips than you can count.

371
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,660
I'll follow you with a sack

372
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,810
to collect them!

373
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,490
You little money grubber!

Where's your royal grace?

375
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,490
I hope...

376
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,290
I hope one day,

377
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,570
Dongxia's children

378
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,140
can eat candied hawthorn too,

379
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,620
and that our people

380
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,770
can live as well as those in the Great Yong.

381
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,770
I believe it.

384
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,050
But I'm stuck here in the Capital.

385
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,810
There's nothing I can do.

386
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,700
What use is a princess

387
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,420
who can't help her people?

388
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,140
In Great Yong, we have a saying:

"Take things as they come."

390
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,290
Since we can't

391
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,730
change the past,

392
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,180
we should do our best with what we have now.

393

That's odd.

This place is usually packed.

400
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,220
Why is it so quiet today?

401
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,700
Because it's not open yet.

402
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,220

When did Chen Tower

404
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,620
become Zhen Tower?

405
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,700
Chen Tower was losing money,

406
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,900
so I bought it for cheap.

407
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,010
Even the Emperor approved it.

408
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,530
From now on,

409
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,980
Zhen Tower will be mine to run.

411

00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,940
to raise you into a failure

569
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,570
so her son would have

570
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,460
no rival?

571
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,050
See that note?

572
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,810
"Jia-xia qu."

573
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,380
[Jia-xia qu] [*Drawn by the master]
"Jia-xia" usually means family members,

574
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,420
so on the surface, the note says

575
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,730
you took the money.

576
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,090
But "jia" includes the character for pig,

577
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,700
so what it really says

578
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,180
is that a pig

579
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,090
took all the money.

580
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,220
When your family gathered to honor the ancestors,

581
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,010
you were out drinking.

582
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,660
The Marquis was disappointed and angry.

583
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,530
Over time,

584
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,860
he'll lose

585
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,090
all faith in you.

586
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,380
Was it your own choice to stay away,

587
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,460
or did someone make sure you would?

588
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,140
Mr. Zhixing,

589
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,700
how much longer are you going to put up

590
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,940
with all this humiliation?

591
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,900
Lady Jiang's kindness

592
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,940
is easy to accept

593
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,940
but hard to reject.

594
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,050
Don't you want to fight?

595
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,090
Fight for what?

596
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,810
To prove you can surpass your brother.

597
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,220
Do you really think

598
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,700
I can do it?

599
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,180
Of course.

600
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,330
Your brother's mediocre in every way.

601
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,140
He can't ease the Emperor's burdens.

602
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,050
Nor can he win hearts.

603
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,180
Frankly, I think

604
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,220
he's already peaked.

605
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,900
If someone like him inherits

606
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,490
the title of the Marquis of Pingjin,

607
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,380
the Zhuang family

608
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,490
will only decline.

609
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,730
But you're different.

610
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,180
You're bold and free-spirited,

611
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,980
just like the Marquis in his youth.

612
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,490
One day, you'll lead armies and rise to the top.

613
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,860
Mr. Zhixing?

614
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,090
Zang Hai,

615
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,980
no one's ever said

616
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,290
anything like that to me.

617
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,860
That makes me feel

618
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,250
even better than winning at the tables.

619
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,330
We must have a drink together.

620
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,050
All right.

621
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,770
As you wish.

622
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,770
Whatever you say, sir.

623
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:36,770
Good.

624
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,460
Here.

625
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,420
This is the Tusu wine I've been saving at Zhen Tower.

626
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,860
Have a taste.

627
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:54,940
Here.

628
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,980
Thank you, sir.

629
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,660
Cheers.

630
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,050
Zang Hai,

631
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,900
you've been looking out for me,

632
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,530
but I doubt

633
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,220
this is all for my sake.

634
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,090
There's something in it for you, right?

635
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,180
Your brother's current success

636
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,330
owes everything

637
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,770
to Jiang Xiang's support.

638
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,420
Even if I joined his camp,

639
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,140
at most I'd be

640
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,380
just another forgettable aide.

641
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,460
He'd never see me as anything more.

642
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,900
But with you, it's different.

643
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,220
You've got nothing to lose.

644
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,660
So why not take a chance?

645
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,860
You see things clearly.

646
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,010
My brother's already in office,

647
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,660
and he's my father's chosen heir.

648
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,940
You wouldn't get far helping him.

649
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,460
So you're betting on me instead.

650
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,860
If it pays off,

651
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,810
you'll win big.

652
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,730
You know how to gamble.

653
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,980
I could never match you, Mr. Zhixing.

654
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,220
Zang Hai,

655
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,810
after talking to you today,

656
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,940
I realize there's actually

657
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,460
someone in the family who cares about me.

658
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,090
Come on.

659
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,290
Here's to you.

660
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,570
You...

661
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,860
I don't hold my liquor well.

662
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,660
Do you think you're too good for my wine?

663
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,530
Of course not.

664
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:29,730
Here.

665
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,420
This is indeed excellent wine.

666
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,940
I'm good at drinking.

667
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,620
But I'm useless

668
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,050
when it comes to real work.

669
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,290
All I know is how to enjoy myself.

670
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,940
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

671
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,330
You underestimate yourself, sir.

672
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,660
You don't believe me?

673
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,090
Let me tell you something.

674
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,420
When I was a kid,

675
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,810
I was once locked in an underground tunnel

676
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,900
by a bully.

677
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,420
It was just one night, but I nearly died in there.

678
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,980
So no,

679
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,900
I really can't handle hardship.

680
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,050
That just means you're blessed, Mr. Zhixing.

681
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,180
Surviving disaster means there's fortune ahead.

682
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,090
To this day, I still remember that bully.

683
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,530
Back then,

684
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,530
when trying to find his father,

685
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,420
he got whipped by the Princess of Dongxia.

686
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,380
He also seized me

687
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,290
to ask about his father's whereabouts.

688
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,140
Do you know who his father was?

689
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,700
How would I know that?

690
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,010
His name was Kuai Duo.

691
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,900
He was the Imperial Astronomer back then.

692
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,730
But the very next day, his whole family was wiped out.

693
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,380
The kid died too, of course.

694
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,770
He had a deep wound on his back.

695
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,900
They said it looked like a cross

696
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,730
or even a sword,

697
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,130
just like yours.

698
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,130
You're not that bully, are you?

699
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,690
You're too funny, Mr. Zhixing.

700
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,380
The scars on my back?

701
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,860
I got them when I was a kid.

702
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,980
My master whipped me for slacking off.

703
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,210
Is that so?

704
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,050
I guess it's true.

705
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,210
After all, he's long dead.

706
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,460
If he'd lived,

707
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,170
he'd be about your age now.

708
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,900
He'd definitely find a way to get close to my father,

709
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,460
and when the time is right,

710
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,900
he'd kill him.

711
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,650
Mr. Zhixing,

712
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,300
you're

713
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,900
scaring me.

714
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,980
A bully and a massacre?

715
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,130
I don't understand a word of it.

716
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,210
Like I said,

717
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,650
I came to the Marquis's Mansion

718
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,980
just to find a place to settle in.

719
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,300
If anything were to happen to the Marquis,

720
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,210
it wouldn't do me any good.

721
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,940
Wouldn't you agree?

722
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,690
Maybe you're just trying to secure a future.

723
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,340
Or maybe

724
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,980
you realized you couldn't kill my father,

725
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,860
so you changed tactics and came after me.

726
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,690
Am I right...

727
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,570
Zhinu?

728
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,980
Admit it. You're Zhinu.

729
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,170
You didn't die back then,

730
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,380
and now you're back for revenge.

731
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,610
Mr. Zhixing,

732
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,260
you've had too much to drink.

733
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,490
I'll say it again:

734
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,780
You've got the wrong man.

735
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,820
I'm not Zhinu.

736
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,380
My name is Zang Hai.

737
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,010
If you don't believe me,

738
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,010
you're welcome to investigate.

739
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,010
I'm perfectly sober right now.

740
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,130
I'll tell you something.

741
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,820
I've remembered you ever since we first met

742
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,780
in the treasury.

743
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,340
Later, when Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao died because of you,

744
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,170
I started to become suspicious of you.

745
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,300
This Tusu wine contains lovage rhizome and cinnamon.

746
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,340
Drinking it brings back all the scars,

747
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,460
no matter how long they've faded.

748
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,380
Mr. Zhixing,

749
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,050
no one's going to believe your wild guesses.

750
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,820
The scars on your back

751
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,860
are all the proof I need.

752
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,010
We can go right now

753
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,980
and show them to my father.

754
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,650
No matter who you are,

755
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,860
no matter how good you are with words,

756
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,780
I doubt he'll spare you.

757
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,940
If you already figured it out,

758
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,490
why are you just telling me?

759
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,690
Because my father's hands

760
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,210
are already stained with your family's blood.

761
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,170
I don't want him to kill you too.

762
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,260
That night ten years ago,

763
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,380
I couldn't sleep after what you did

764
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,490
to me.

765
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,130
- Father? - So I wanted

766
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,170
to have my father stand up for me.

767
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,490
Father?

768
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,300
But then I got tired,

769
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,300
so I waited outside his room.

770
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,340
He came back very late.

771
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,050
I wanted to call out to him,

772
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,490
but his face was grim.

773
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,010
Father...

774
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,820
I knew

775
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,570
something must have happened that night.

776
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,820
Young Master, where are you going

777
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,570
this early?

778
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,300
To visit the Kuai family.

779
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,460
The Kuai family?

780
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,900
Young Master,

781
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,340
which Kuai family?

782
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,820
Which one do you think?

783
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,340
The Imperial Astronomer's. They live in the suburbs.

784
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,900
Their residence caught fire last night.

785
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,780
Everyone inside died.

786
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,380
But then I remembered the look

787
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,420
on my father's face

788
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,820
and the burn marks

789
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,340
on Yang Zhen's robes that night.

790
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,300
That's when I started to suspect

791
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,860
my father was

792
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,210
behind those deaths.

793
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,490
But I didn't dare think that.

794
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,530
What if it was true?

795
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,940
Zhinu,

796
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,570
I know you've had it rough these years.

797
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,090
I know you hate my father.

798
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,900
But I can't let you take revenge.

799
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,530
He's the only family I have left.

800
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,210
If you try to kill him,

801
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,340
I will kill you first.

802
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,420
Leave the Marquis's Mansion. Leave the Capital.

803
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,170
And never come back.

804
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,820
And if I can't?

805
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,460
You've got one day.

806
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,420
How did he find out?

807
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,090
He's smarter than I thought.

808
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,570
He took notice of me when we first met

809
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,740
in the treasury.

810
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,260
After I took out Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao,

811
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,900
he began to suspect me.

812
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,340
He never saw the scars on my back,

813
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,490
but he remembered how my senior brothers

814
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,300
described them.

815
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,820
The scars had faded,

816
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,780
but today at Zhen Tower,

817
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,820
he made me drink some medicinal wine,

818
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,130
and then the two scars reappeared.

819
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,490
I planned to deny everything,

820
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,210
but he threatened to take me to the Marquis.

821
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,820
With how suspicious the Marquis is,

822
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,210
I'd be dead for sure.

823
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,130
These problems never end. What do we do now?

824
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,260
Zhuang Zhixing didn't turn me in.

825
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,980
He pitied me and gave me one day

826
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,820
to leave the Marquis's Mansion and the Capital.

827
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,780
One day?

828
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,690
You're visiting the ancestral tombs with the Marquis tomorrow.

829
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,340
Zhuang Zhixing will be there too.

830
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,300
While you're there,

831
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,090
he'll definitely be alone at some point.

832
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,260
Let Guanfeng and Shilei

833
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,860
find a chance to kill him.

834
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,900
He's not a bad man. He doesn't deserve to die.

835
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,980
Getting soft, are you?

836
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,090
I'm not.

837
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,210
You hesitate to kill the innocent,

838
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,050
but did the Marquis spare anyone in your family?

839
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,530
Zhuang Zhixing is

840
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,820
just like a powder keg.

841
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,650
Let him live, and you risk your revenge

842
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,780
and your life!

843
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,460
I know!

844
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,090
I'll take care of it.

845
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,170
If he has to die,

846
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,380
I'll kill him myself.

847
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,020
[Late mother Shen's grave]

848
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,900
Mother,

849
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,210
I've come to see you.

850
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,690
The servants did

851
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,690
such a poor job.

852
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,860
They didn't pull the weeds

853
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,460
or refill the soil.

854
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,380
I'll scold them when I get back.

855
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,460
Are you doing well down there?

856
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,090
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

857
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,900
Father's visiting the tombs tomorrow.

858
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,460
I'll ask him to stop by your grave too.

859
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,460
Lady Jiang treats me well.

860
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,260
She's never harmed me,

861
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,420
but she's always on guard,

862
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,940
trying to raise me into a useless man

863
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,210
so I won't compete with my brother.

864
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,420
But she worries too much.

865
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,860
I've never even thought of it.

866
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,610
And I ran into an old face.

867
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,650
I know he came back

868
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,820
to kill Father and avenge his family.

869
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,260
I told him to leave the Capital

870
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,260
and never come back.
