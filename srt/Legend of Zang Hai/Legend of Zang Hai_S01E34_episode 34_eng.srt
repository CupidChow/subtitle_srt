3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,802
   

4
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,150
 A state's deadly weapon must not be revealed. 

5
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,880
 A ruler's weakness must not be exposed. 

6
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,300
 But, Kuai Duo, you truly know a lot of my weaknesses. 

7
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,720
 Kuai Duo, you've been tremendously helpful. 

8
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,110
 Your kindness won't go unrewarded. 

9
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,240
 Judging from your intelligence and talent, 

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,250
 the Imperial Astronomical Bureau doesn't deserve you. 

11
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,250
 Let me find a way to get you into the Cabinet. 

12
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,440
 Then, you can work for me with all your heart. 

13
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,750
 Your Majesty, may I ask for a favor? 

14
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,290
 I'm listening. 

15
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,000
 Those years in the mausoleum left me with a blood deficiency. 

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,920
 Then, I spent another three years in Dongxia, drained by the extreme cold. 

17
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,670
 I'm afraid I won't be able to serve Your Majesty anymore. 

18
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,450
 I'd like to resign from work and return to my hometown. 

19
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,540
 You want to leave? 

20
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,880
 I'd like to relocate my family to Zhenning 

21
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,600
 and settle into our ancestral property. 

22
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,950
 Zhenning is not far from the capital. 

23
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:08,430
 If Your Majesty misses me, you can summon me at any time. 

24
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,590
 On your way back from the North, was there anything strange? 

25
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,040
 No. 

26
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,580
 Does anyone know you came to the palace? 

27
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,160
 I... took the secret passage. 

28
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,400
 What about your family? 

29
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,800
 I haven't gone home yet. 

30
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,100
 Kuai Duo. 

31
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,320
 You didn't lie to me, right? 

32
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,970
 I dare not. 

33
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,310
 Good. I will grant your wish. 

34
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,570
 Take your family and leave tonight. 

35
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,640
 Thank you, Your Majesty. 

36
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,620
 I humbly take my leave. 

37
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,040
 Your Majesty, the Kuai family's house caught fire last night. 

38
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,230
 This morning, the Ministry of Justice reported 

39
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,950
 that the whole family was killed by bandits. 

40
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,790
 What about Kuai Duo? 

41
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,200
 No one survived. 

42
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,240
 Everyone was burned beyond recognition. 

43
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,020
 Your Majesty, should I send someone to double-check it? 

44
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,720
 No need. 

45
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,790
I didn't expect that your father would die.

46
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,740
I failed to protect my most loyal minister.

47
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,920
Tell me. What did you see that night?

48
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,580
Your Majesty really wants to know?

49
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,090
Tell me.

50
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,540
They threatened to kill my fellow disciples to find out where the Gui Seal was.

51
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,500
My father remained silent.

52
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,640
They killed my fellow disciples

53
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,300
and threatened my father with the life of my sister, Yue Nu.

54
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,320
Still, my father remained silent.

55
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,510
They killed my sister and my mother.

56
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,940
My father killed himself out of devastation.

57
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,820
Now I see why my father chose that as his ending.

58
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,280
Kuai Duo... took my secret to the grave.

59
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,360
I've failed him.

60
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,180
Your Majesty.

61
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,741
   

62
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,920
Your Majesty, Cao Jingxian is dead.

63
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,790
Your Majesty, preliminary examination shows

64
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,000
that Eunuch Cao's body was badly decomposed.

65
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,160
I did a rough calculation.

66
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,910
He's been dead for at least five days.

67
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,040
But the officers in the mansion died just now.

68
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,760
Some corpses are still warm.

69
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,360
How did they die?

70
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,640
From poisoning.

71
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,180
There are no traces of fighting.

72
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,350
Have you found the item?

73
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,690
Not yet. I'll keep looking for it.

74
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,650
You may leave.

75
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,580
The Surveillance Office has been reporting to me

76
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,750
just as usual in the past few days.

77
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,800
Your Majesty, someone discovered Cao Jingxian's secret

78
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,120
and hid the fact that he died.

79
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,710
This person took over the Surveillance Office

80
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,160
and killed everyone in the Cao Mansion.

81
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,160
It was such an elaborate plan.

82
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,740
I am afraid that my third enemy has shown up.

83
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,180
If Cao Jingxian had died from serious injury,

84
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,540
then the officers would have known.

85
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,000
It would have been hard to mobilize them.

86
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,070
There was only one way to avoid that.

87
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,120
Cao Jingxian concealed the fact that he was dying

88
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,190
and asked his confidants to work for someone else

89
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,800
and keep mobilizing the officers with his secret token.

90
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,300
In that case,

91
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,110
your third enemy has the Gui Seal now.

92
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,320
You came here today to look for your third enemy.

93
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,120
Without my help, you can't fight him or even find him.

94
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,070
I've told you the truth you wanted.

95
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:33,740
Now, you should bring the Gui Seal back.

96
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,640
I will not let you down, Your Majesty.

97
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,910
But I need another favor from you.

98
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,230
- I'm listening. 
 - At the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

99
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,400
if it weren't for the Queen of Dongxia and the royal hostage,

100
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,480
Cao Jingxian would have killed me.

101
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,910
The Queen of Dongxia died to save the royal hostage.

102
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,240
The royal hostage wasn't the culprit.

103
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,560
I implore Your Majesty to release the hostage.

104
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:12,130
All right. I will release the hostage of Dongxia as you wish.

105
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,660
Thank you, Your Majesty.

106
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,580
This is the Sword of Justice.

107
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,650
He who wields this sword acts with my authority.

108
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,360
I'm giving this sword to you. Find out the truth.

109
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,360
Move fast.

110
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,170
Otherwise, what awaits us is a bloody storm.

111
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,100
Let's go. I'll take you home.

112
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,790
   

113
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,640
Sir.

114
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,660
Sir.

115
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,430
Xiao Hai, w-we've been waiting for you all night.

116
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,440
Mr. Gao Ming said you would come.

117
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,360
Master.

118
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,400
Miss, you've suffered in there.

119
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,120
I hope they didn't torture you.

120
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,440
I'm fine. Thank you, Mr. Gao Ming.

121
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,070
Stop wasting time. Let's go.

122
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,060
Sir, get in the carriage with Miss Xiang first.

123
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,880
Master, I...

124
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,700
What are you waiting for? Do you want to stay longer?

125
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,800
Master, I...

126
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,820
Let's go home.

127
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,500
Let's go. Let's go home.

128
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,660
Come on.

129
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,380
Zhen Tower has been shut down.

130
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,110
I'm looking for the right person to take over.

131
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,670
The servants and maids of Zhen Tower are quick-handed.

132
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,040
We'll find a way to keep them around.

133
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,120
I bet it won't be easy. Thank you for your effort.

134
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,870
I'm grateful that they get to stay.

135
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,203
   

136
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,620
Antu, make yourself at home here.

137
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,310
I'll ask someone to change the bedding.

138
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,390
This is your room from now on.

139
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,200
Isn't this your bedroom? Where will you stay?

140
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,980
I'm sure I can find a room in this huge residence.

141
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,240
So, don't worry.

142
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,740
You must be tired. I prepared hot water and clothes.

143
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,200
Get some good rest.

144
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,020
Don't go. I don't want to be alone.

145
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,550
All right. I'll keep you company.

146
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:29,500
You fool. You risked everything just to save me.

147
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,280
Didn't I tell you that I wouldn't let you go?

148
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,580
From now on, you are my family.

149
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,870
Did Cao Jingxian do anything when I was in jail?

150
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,360
He's dead.

151
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,330
You killed him?

152
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,090
When His Majesty's people found him, he was already dead.

153
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,890
It's a pity that I didn't kill him in person to avenge my mother.

154
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,110
It's over.

155
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,960
His Majesty has demoted me to a commoner.

156
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,440
Dongxia no longer recognizes me as a princess.

157
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,560
From now on, I'm nobody.

158
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,580
Look. I used to be broke.

159
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,520
And you're an ordinary lady now.

160
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,530
We don't get to look down on each other anymore.

161
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,780
You're always such a smooth talker.

162
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,330
I'm actually terrible with words when I'm with you.

163
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,320
Antu.

164
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,430
- Your Highness. 
 - Your Highness.

165
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,920
This is great. You're finally back.

166
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,450
That's enough. I'm all right. It's over.

167
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,010
Why are you standing there?

168
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,680
I thought that you might be overwhelmed.

169
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,070
So, I came to help you.

170
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,970
You'll just stand there?

171
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,440
What are you cooking, Master?

172
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,810
You'll see when they're ready.

173
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,060
I've never seen you cook. I swear I will eat more.

174
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,870
Don't flatter yourself. These are not for you.

175
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,180
Not this one.

176
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,720
Master, forgive me.

177
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,350
You're always right.

178
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,110
What did you do wrong?

179
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,620
I shouldn't have left without telling you in advance.

180
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,390
You did well by not telling me.

181
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,700
I would have caused you trouble.

182
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,190
No, Master.

183
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,630
I made a mistake.

184
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,480
You once told me

185
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,670
the most important thing in revenge is staying alive.

186
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:27,340
You did what you did to save Miss Xiang.

187
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:33,870
I believe you did that with absolute confidence.

188
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,680
But you never know.

189
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,380
Even the tightest plan may have gaps.

190
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,380
I can't put you in danger.

191
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,710
Master, let me see.

192
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,230
Tell me. What binds a master to their disciple?

193
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,760
You said that a master should protect his disciple

194
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,810
and the disciple should follow the master's lead.

195
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:17,290
So, you remember... that the master should protect his disciple.

196
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,550
No true master would ever let his disciple take a blow

197
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,940
while he stood aside.

198
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,900
Master.

199
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,630
Ten years ago,

200
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,070
Master Xing Dou and you looked after me and taught me everything you knew.

201
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,210
That was how I survived to this day.

202
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,010
I've long since seen you as my father.

203
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:56,840
As your son, I want you to stay safe and sound.

204
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,900
So, I'll do the same...

205
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,300
if it happens again.

206
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:21,170
Parents would rather die for their children

207
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,010
than to live alone.

208
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,760
To take revenge, you must first survive.

209
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,100
To save lives, try harder to survive.

210
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,150
You made it this time.

211
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,110
And here you are, apologizing to me.

212
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,460
But what if you lost?

213
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,970
Then I'd lose my disciple.

214
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,300
I've aged. You're my only disciple.

215
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:00,140
If you're killed, who's going to take care of me till I die?

216
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,720
Master, I swear I'll...

217
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,020
You must stay alive and take care of me.

218
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,480
Enough. Tell me everything.

219
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,460
What trick did you pull to deceive His Majesty?

220
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,390
Actually, I just told His Majesty the truth.

221
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,770
You deceived him with the truth?

222
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,000
If there is going to be a "Fraud Gang,"

223
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,700
I bet you'll be the gang leader.

224
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,800
Tell me. How did you deceive him?

225
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,420
Master, your hand... Let me get some medicine.

226
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,230
Stop there.

227
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,340
Don't divert the subject or keep me curious.

228
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,620
Do you know what I regret most after slapping you?

229
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,250
I don't feel sorry for you.

230
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,090
But I can't bring myself to ask you what happened last night.

231
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,070
You're lying again.

232
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,940
You don't easily feel awkward.

233
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,000
You obviously feel sorry for me.

234
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,590
You... want another slap?

235
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,150
Just say it.

236
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,920
Fine.

237
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,720
I didn't lie to His Majesty.

238
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,640
I just... I...

239
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,000
Master, the soup.

240
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,080
My soup.

241
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,230
- Be careful. 
 - It's burning.

242
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,910
Remove the lid.

243
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,580
   

244
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,150
Come on, the food is ready.

245
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,900
 Mr. Gao Ming made all these. 

246
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,760
 Really? 

247
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,200
Where did Miss Feng Liu go?

248
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,690
She went to pack at the Hostage's Mansion.

249
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,420
So, are they moving here?

250
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,830
A-Aren't you silly?

251
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,880
Miss Xiang has moved here.

252
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,580
Of course, they will move here.

253
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,390
Okay, smartypants. Why did you hit me?

254
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,630
- Shut up. 
 - A gentleman shouldn't...

255
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,380
I heard that Mr. Gao Ming made all these dishes in person

256
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,480
with Mr. Zang's assistance.

257
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,720
Mr. Gao Ming, tell us.

258
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,860
Why did you choose to make these dishes?

259
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,680
Let me tell you about these dishes.

260
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,150
This is stir-fried pork liver and tripe,

261
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,830
which is nourishing, but it's "heartless".

262
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,250
That is fried chicken.

263
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,350
That chicken was ungrateful

264
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,070
and ran around without crowing.

265
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,300
So, I cooked it.

266
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,830
This is fish with vinegar.

267
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,550
This fish has no spine, no bones, and "no shame."

268
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,550
Feel free to dig in.

269
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,630
Fish is brain food.

270
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,590
These are grilled oysters.

271
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,870
Like an oyster, someone only opens up under fire...

272
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,970
Master, I'll punish myself with three drinks.

273
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,140
Mr. Gao Ming, he did it to save me.

274
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,320
Let me drink on his behalf.

275
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,680
Miss Antu, take it slow.

276
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,580
It has nothing to do with you.

277
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,590
This rascal tricked me.

278
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,960
I can't get over it.

279
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,680
What's your problem?

280
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,310
A great teacher produces good students.

281
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,940
Shouldn't you be happy about it?

282
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,050
Master Liu Chu.

283
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,480
Am I late for the Survivor's Feast?

284
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,040
Please stop teasing us.

285
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,080
As the saying goes, "What doesn't kill you makes you luckier."

286
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,910
This should be the Fortune Feast.

287
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,520
Sister Liu Chu.

288
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:38,660
I didn't expect that a beauty like you would become so pale in such a short time.

289
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,420
I brought you some rouge and powder.

290
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,180
Antu, those things are over.

291
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,100
Pull yourself together.

292
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,730
We have to live on and live well.

293
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,940
Thank you, Sister.

294
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,430
Don't stand around. Be seated.

295
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,910
Master Liu Chu, come and sit here.

296
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,720
Everybody's happy.

297
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,870
Why are you pulling a long face?

298
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,770
Look at me.

299
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,250
Look at me.

300
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,480
Smile.

301
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,770
Smile.

302
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,100
Forget it. It's worse than crying.

303
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,530
- Get lost. 
 - Xiao Hai, you did well by rescuing Antu.

304
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,660
Caring and loyal.

305
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,310
Yeah, caring and loyal.

306
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,210
Everyone is here. Let's drink to celebrate our reunion.

307
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,920
Yeah, let's have a drink.

308
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,720
- Come on. Cheers. 
 - To our reunion.

309
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,280
To our reunion.

310
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,940
Come on.

311
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:44,110
The moon hangs nearly full tonight, but not quite.

312
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,390
But it will be complete.

313
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,630
What's wrong?

314
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,070
Although Cao Jingxian is dead,

315
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,940
I don't feel relieved.

316
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,040
The third enemy has surfaced.

317
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,330
Your mind is occupied.

318
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,590
From the moment I knew he existed,

319
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,960
only two thoughts remained:

320
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,790
Who is he?

321
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,670
And how will I kill him?

322
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,250
But as I was having food with you,

323
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,110
for a fleeting moment,

324
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,700
my attention seemed to have shifted.

325
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,040
Because you are no longer who you used to be when we first met.

326
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,010
Although I stay with Xiao Hai all day long,

327
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:46,370
you are the one who knows him the best.

328
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,380
I'm also his master,

329
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,750
although I didn't teach him anything.

330
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,480
Be tender like water.

331
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,920
Water can carry a boat, but it can also overturn it.

332
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,040
In the end, he has to learn it himself.

333
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,060
Looks like your "miracle in desperation" prediction...

334
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,940
was spot-on.

335
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,500
If love is true and steadfast through the years,

336
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,930
need we cling to day and night together...

337
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,020
Stop drinking.

338
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,340
You're right.

339
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,320
I drank too much.

340
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,150
Now, both my third enemy and I are deploying our pawns

341
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,590
as if playing chess.

342
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,130
I may seem to have the upper hand,

343
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,890
but my enemy is lurking in the dark

344
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,770
and may fight back at any time.

345
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,290
I have to be extra careful

346
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,900
and keep the bronze fish safe.

347
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,400
Even the slightest mistake...

348
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,830
I used to witness the hustle and bustle of the capital in Zhen Tower.

349
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,590
Sometimes, I would think,

350
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,230
"If only I were nobody but the owner of Zhen Tower."

351
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,800
But deep down, I knew it was impossible.

352
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,040
That was my fate.

353
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,420
Meanwhile, you're bound by fate to getrevenge.

354
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,040
Don't overthink.

355
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,110
Don't worry about us, either.

356
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:03,050
We chose to stand by you.

357
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:09,110
I, Mr. Gao Ming, Guan Feng, Shi Lei, and Sister Liu Chu

358
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,190
are willing to embark on this dangerous journey with you.

359
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,940
No.

360
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,840
I don't want you to be in danger because of me.

361
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,960
Go talk to Mr. Gao Ming.

362
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,650
You're halfway through your revenge.

363
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,670
Ask him if he will let you finish it by yourself.

364
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,070
I can't disobey my master.

365
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,670
But...

366
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,460
I really don't want to implicate you.

367
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,360
You have your way of protecting your family.

368
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,110
I have my way, too.

369
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,590
Deal with the trickery and treachery in the court.

370
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,020
But leave the fights and combats of the martial world to me.

371
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,050
All right. Stop frowning.

372
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,520
Tell me about your plan.

373
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,320
Judging from the tacit understanding between Cao Jingxian and this third person,

374
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,900
my third enemy must be close enough to the core of the court

375
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,940
to be able to handle everything so casually.

376
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,750
Now, I can only utilize the power granted by His Majesty

377
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,630
to look into Cao Jingxian's case as a start.

378
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,230
I don't believe that person is smarter than you.

379
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,040
And you're backed by His Majesty.

380
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,500
I'm sure you'll find your enemy soon.

381
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,460
I hope so.

382
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,840
Once you find your third enemy and take revenge,

383
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,590
let's leave this place.

384
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,050
We will go wherever you want to go.

385
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,150
All right.

386
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,690
Once I get my revenge,

387
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,800
we will leave this place.

388
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,440
Mr. Zang, you have inspected all the bodies.

389
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,800
Any findings?

390
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,940
As the coroners said, there were no external injuries.

391
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,270
They died from poisoning

392
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,960
with fish skin and flesh left in their stomachs.

393
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,880
They must have had a highly toxic fish soup.

394
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,320
Those officers were truly loyal.

395
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,110
They actually killed themselves for Cao Jingxian.

396
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,230
Are you saying that they did it voluntarily?

397
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,840
All the officers died from poisoning in the Cao Mansion.

398
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,960
It does look like a suicide.

399
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,880
But they died with twisted,

400
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,440
agonized expressions as if they were murdered.

401
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,320
Suicide by taking poison is agonizing, anyway.

402
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,860
I carefully inspected the fingers of all the corpses.

403
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,750
Several corpses had soil in their nails.

404
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,840
Even if they were in pain,

405
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,440
where did they find soil in Mr. Cao's room?

406
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,260
Are you saying that they were moved to the room after they died

407
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,070
and disguised as poisoned?

408
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:00,880
Mr. Zuo, I'm afraid the clue we're looking for isn't here.

409
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,000
- It's with Lu Yan. 
 - Lu Yan?

410
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,320
There were 30 officers in the Cao Mansion.

411
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,320
But there are only 29 corpses here.

412
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,110
The missing person is Lu Yan.

413
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:15,400
But we've searched every corner of the Cao Mansion

414
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,690
and didn't find her body.

415
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,030
I'm afraid that Lu Yan is still alive.

416
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:28,260
If this was a targeted poisoning, there'd be no survivors left.

417
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,040
Perhaps Lu Yan noticed something in advance and escaped.

418
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,320
Or she was the one who poisoned them.

419
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,110
We will only find the answer after we talk to her.

420
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,040
I'll ask His Majesty to search for her.

421
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,070
By the way, someone else is involved in this case,

422
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,570
- though not an officer. 
 - Who is it?

423
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:53,570
Shi Quan, Deputy Inspector of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

424
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,920
Lu Yan and Lu Fen are missing.

425
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,860
We need to find another lead and stop wasting time on this one.

426
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,360
Now, the third enemy has obtained the Gui Seal

427
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,110
and is only one step away from gathering all three bronze fish.

428
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,670
He will definitely take action.

429
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,220
In fact, we've narrowed it down quite a lot.

430
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,150
This person ran the Surveillance Office

431
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,270
for quite a while after Cao Jingxian died

432
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,880
and almost made Miss Xiang the scapegoat.

433
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,860
Not many people are capable of that.

434
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,480
Master.

435
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,420
His Majesty allowed me to investigate all officials.

436
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,410
I want to go from top to bottom, starting from the Cabinet.

437
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,400
Xiao Hai,

438
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,110
in that case,

439
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,340
there is someone you should meet.

440
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,630
   

441
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,590
Zang Hai,

442
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:05,300
what you said answered a question that has bothered me for a long time.

443
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,070
What was that question?

444
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:15,620
Why weren't there any consequences after your father stood up for me back then?

445
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,590
Put it aside for now.

446
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,610
Let's talk business.

447
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,720
You've progressed a lot these days.

448
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,840
It seems that we are getting closer to the third enemy.

449
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,800
You also think I should look into the Cabinet?

450
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,170
Zhuang Luyin was the head of the military officers.

451
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,320
Cao Jingxian ran the Directorate of Ceremonial and the Surveillance Office.

452
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,630
This third enemy is in the Cabinet.

453
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,420
They were of similar status.

454
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,300
Tell me.

455
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,550
Who do you want to start with?

456
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,840
The Cabinet is full of high-ranking and powerful ministers.

457
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,210
Even the slightest mistake would alert them.

458
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,040
Moreover, it won't be easy

459
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,020
to remain an official once you offend someone.

460
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:19,750
Naturally, I want to start with the highest-ranking minister.

461
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,090
Shi Yiping, the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

462
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,720
Shi Yiping has always been...

463
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,070
domineering and arrogant

464
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:44,330
in the Cabinet and the Ministry of Personnel.

465
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,060
But after Cao Jingxian died,

466
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,250
rather than expanding his power,

467
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,150
Mr. Shi claimed illness

468
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,720
and stayed at home as if he had no more political ambitions.

469
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,320
If the third enemy had obtained the Gui Seal,

470
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,950
he would no longer care about the officialdom.

471
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:13,810
Sir, it seems that you know Mr. Shi quite well.

472
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:27,050
That's why I came to see you.

473
