2
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:30,070
   

3
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,840
   

4
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,940
   

5
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,620
   

6
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,540
It seems you have all read the decree.

7
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,040
I drafted it last night

8
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,510
and submitted it to the cabinet this morning.

9
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,760
In case there's still any confusion among you,

10
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,560
let me reiterate it.

11
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,400
Effective immediately, three prohibitions apply to all personnel in the bureau.

12
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,120
Every division must perform its duty with diligence and continuous improvement.

13
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,710
There must be no dereliction of duty.

14
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,320
That is the first prohibition.

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,610
As for all funeral arrangements involving officials,

16
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,630
site selection must comply with laws and regulations.

17
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,840
The unauthorized establishment of burial sites is strictly prohibited.

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,170
That is the second prohibition.

19
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,960
Private exhumations and ghost marriages are strictly banned.

20
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,870
Any indulgence will be severely punished.

21
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,360
That is the third prohibition.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,470
Official Zang, if you were going to issue a decree,

23
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,810
why didn't you inform us in advance?

24
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,230
Are we not worthy of your trust?

25
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,150
Since we hold official positions here,

26
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,240
we must serve His Majesty loyally.

27
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,510
These are fundamental rules that need no discussion.

28
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:14,650
It seems what you said isn't groundless.

29
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,000
Indeed.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,300
I've heard rumors

31
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,840
that the Imperial Astronomical Bureau occupied farmers' land

32
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,740
to select burial sites for officials,

33
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,310
and even caused the deaths of common women

34
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,990
for the ghost marriages of officials and nobles.

35
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,260
I wonder if you've heard these things.

36
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,150
Official Zang, we have carefully studied

37
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,980
the three prohibitions you have decreed.

38
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,420
The first one makes good sense.

39
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,120
Everyone should fulfill their duties.

40
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,730
It's the foundation of our role as officials.

41
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,400
As for the second one, about ghost marriages,

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,280
the court has tried banning them many times.

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
However, it's a deeply-rooted custom.

44
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,240
Forcing a ban on such life-and-death matters

45
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,520
will stir resentment.

46
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,500
That's why we have no choice but to look the other way.

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,660
As for the farmers' land you mentioned,

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,310
that was Official Chu's decision during his term.

49
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,780
- We didn't... 
 - So, are you suggesting...

50
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,390
I confront Chu Huaiming to hold him accountable

51
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,310
or punish the people?

52
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,070
No... That's not what I meant.

53
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,430
Please don't jest.

54
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,240
I am but a humble Calendar Manager.

55
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,360
I wouldn't dare suggest that.

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,950
I issued the decree to put an end to such misconduct.

57
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,410
Gentlemen,

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
take it as a reminder if you're not involved.

59
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,650
But if anyone is, I will handle it impartially.

60
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,270
What is with this new director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau?

61
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,530
Is he seriously making this a clean, no-profit office?

62
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,680
What's next?

63
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,960
Are we all going to starve?

64
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,650
New officials always pretend to be upright.

65
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,310
Look at how he's playing the impartial one now.

66
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,390
He's just fishing for bribes from us.

67
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,950
Once we give him gifts, he won't act like that anymore.

68
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,800
It'll be all about personal ties.

69
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,060
What if he plans to make an example of us?

70
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,160
If the files contain records involving us,

71
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,430
and he really digs something up...

72
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,500
Why worry?

73
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,970
Let him.

74
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,090
I've cleaned everything long ago.

75
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,210
If he dares come after us,

76
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,720
I don't care who's backing him.

77
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,630
If this director doesn't know how things work,

78
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,660
someone who does will take his place.

79
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,070
Who are you burning these for?

80
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,880
Offical Zang, Chu Huaiming died while being banished.

81
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,870
You're quite well-informed.

82
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,290
We at the Mortuary Division deal with the dead every day.

83
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,250
Anything related to death reaches us first.

84
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,500
I reviewed records at the bureau.

85
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,190
Chu Huaiming didn't treat you well.

86
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,270
Why are you mourning him?

87
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,580
We studied together in our youth.

88
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,380
Yet our paths diverged drastically.

89
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,000
He was more adept at managing relationships

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,730
and quickly latched onto the Marquis of Pingjin's support.

91
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,450
He was in his prime,

92
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,290
just like you now.

93
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,160
But at that time, I had hit rock bottom.

94
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,620
I was going to return to my hometown.

95
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,730
He asked me to stay, saying he needed people.

96
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,020
But I didn't expect

97
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,920
he only kept me to assist in his corruption.

98
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,410
He was competent.

99
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,270
If he'd put his abilities to proper use,

100
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,430
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

101
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,240
But Chu Huaiming didn't value your bond.

102
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,770
He marginalized you and gave you the toughest work.

103
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,250
That was after he realized I wouldn't join him in corruption.

104
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,710
So, he stopped seeing me as one of his own.

105
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,630
Still,

106
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,020
when he rose to power,

107
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,540
I was the first person he thought of.

108
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,030
And despite how much he disapproved of me, he never drove me away.

109
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,980
I still appreciate him for that.

110
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,180
   

111
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,180
May I take a look...

112
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,910
at these letters?

113
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,700
Sure, they are going to be burned anyway.

114
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,253
   

115
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,880
   

116
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,120
   

117
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,030
   

118
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,030
   

119
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,480
This is a sincere letter.

120
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,900
Your letter contains valuable suggestions.

121
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,990
You flatter me.

122
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,540
Advice that no one bothers to listen to can hardly be called valuable.

123
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,910
Everyone knows how to improve the bureau.

124
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,080
So did Chu Huaiming.

125
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,250
They just didn't want to do it.

126
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,400
No one was willing to sacrifice their interests.

127
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,620
Huaiming, I'm burning these letters for you.

128
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,630
You can read them down there.

129
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,870
Then are you willing to help me reform the bureau

130
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,870
following what you wrote in the letters?

131
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,650
If I hadn't seen you issue the decree today,

132
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,630
I wouldn't know if you truly meant it.

133
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,080
I am not Chu Huaiming.

134
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,200
If I fail to do my duty,

135
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,590
please write me just as many letters.

136
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,730
I will.

137
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,020
Official Zang.

138
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,000
If you truly want to change things, there's a place you should visit.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,150
You will gain something from there.

140
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,630
Where?

141
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,530
West of the city.

142
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,300
Tai'an Alley.

143
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,010
Sir Chang, how is my sister?

144
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,300
Wensheng, let's talk outside.

145
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,890
It's okay.

146
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,880
Sir Chang,

147
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,320
is there still hope for my sister?

148
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,060
Wensheng, I will be honest with you.

149
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,030
The illness has seeped into her marrow.

150
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,720
She may only have about a month left.

151
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,200
It's time to make early arrangements.

152
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,590
For families like ours,

153
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,030
there's little we can afford to do.

154
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,600
We've spent all our savings on my sister's treatment.

155
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,390
I understand.

156
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,630
I've prepared everything for you.

157
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,290
Here.

158
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,720
Sir Chang, what do you mean by this?

159
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,960
Just the other day,

160
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,360
I paid respects at the Marquis of Dingyi Mansion.

161
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,150
That's when I learned

162
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:53,070
their third son had died before his time of an incurable illness.

163
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,480
He hadn't married yet.

164
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,460
The Dowager Marchioness wants to match him with a girl in the afterlife.

165
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,810
I thought it over,

166
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,200
and your sister seems the best fit.

167
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,410
You mean to match her with the deceased?

168
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,200
Your sister is lucky.

169
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,080
A girl from a humble family

170
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,440
rarely gets to be matched to a marquis' son after death.

171
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,550
It's an honor.

172
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,620
They said this is just a deposit.

173
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,730
Once the ritual is complete, they'll take care of the coffin and burial.

174
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,130
And after that, you will receive more silver.

175
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:34,660
As long as it does no harm to her, it should be fine.

176
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,080
Here, Wensheng.

177
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,060
Take the silver.

178
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,990
But they have one condition.

179
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,630
Their third son is to be buried at dusk tomorrow.

180
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,150
So, your sister should match that timing.

181
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,750
But... But she isn't dead yet!

182
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,510
Wait, sir, I thought you said she had a month left.

183
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,630
I meant a month at most.

184
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,130
Besides, your younger sister is suffering so much.

185
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,060
She...

186
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,120
Wensheng, this is a special concoction from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

187
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,600
She won't feel anything.

188
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,980
You...

189
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,510
You... You want me to kill my own sister?

190
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,480
Wensheng, calm down.

191
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,740
Your sister's been sick for years.

192
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,600
You've nearly used up all your savings.

193
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,940
You're already 28, aren't you? And you're still unmarried.

194
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,120
Are you planning to stay poor like this?

195
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,270
I will never trade my sister's life for money!

196
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,200
Liang Wensheng.

197
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,360
Must you be so stubborn?

198
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,190
If not for my kindness, your younger sister would be dead already.

199
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,790
If it weren't for her, you would have starved to death.

200
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,120
What do you think the clinic is keeping her alive for?

201
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,980
Everything you have today is thanks to your sister.

202
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,600
So, this was your plan all along.

203
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,870
You've been plotting to offer her for a ghost marriage.

204
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,840
Have you ever tried to cure her?

205
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,340
Let go!

206
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,290
I came today for this exact reason.

207
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,480
If you don't do it, I will.

208
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,790
You...

209
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,690
Liang Wensheng!

210
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,270
The Marquis' family choosing Liang Xiaoyan is a huge honor for you!

211
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,890
You're too blind to appreciate it!

212
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,240
You...

213
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,840
You insolent peasant!

214
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,240
- Stop it... 
 - Wrench!

215
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,390
- Please... 
 - Wretch!

216
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,500
- Stop it. 
 - Insolent Peasant!

217
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,320
Please let my brother go.

218
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,600
Ungrateful brute. You won't get a single copper from me!

219
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,440
Who... Who are you? Who are you?

220
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,486
   

221
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,260
Calling us out in the middle of the night...

222
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,790
Couldn't it wait until morning?

223
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,670
I was asleep and woken up by the servant.

224
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,390
What a bother.

225
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,200
Official Zang.

226
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,260
You're all here.

227
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,730
Take your seats.

228
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,870
Gentlemen, do you know this lady?

229
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,830
Her name is Liang Xiaoyan.

230
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,770
Miss Liang suffers from a stubborn illness,

231
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,320
but she is not beyond medical help.

232
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,650
Yet, someone tried to force poison down her throat.

233
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,060
Why?

234
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,120
Liang Xiaoyan had no say in her life,

235
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,280
but for those with evil intent, even a day's difference is critical.

236
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,770
Shi Lei, bring him in.

237
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,120
Stay put.

238
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,740
These are Chang Wuyi's dirty dealings all these years.

239
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,840
Using the clinic as his cover and claiming to treat the sick,

240
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,660
he secretly sought out dying women

241
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,290
and forced them into marrying dead noble sons, causing their deaths.

242
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,750
If His Lordship hadn't arrived in time today,

243
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,590
my sister and I would both be dead now.

244
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,010
You plan to arrange ghost marriages and even demand auspicious burial dates.

245
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,660
Did you think you could get away with it?

246
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,720
Min Shining, Chang Wuyi has admitted it all.

247
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,860
What do you say?

248
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,240
Official Zang, I was wrong.

249
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,670
I was wrong...

250
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,890
Min Shining. Chang Wuyi. Your hearts are wicked

251
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,630
and your crimes are monstrous.

252
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,550
Effective immediately, you are dismissed and will be investigated!

253
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,100
- Official Zang! 
 - Official Zang!

254
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,380
He made me do it!

255
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,590
Official Zang, it was him.

256
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,310
- Chang Wuyi made me do it. 
 - It was his idea!

257
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,680
Official Zang, it was him!

258
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,510
- Have mercy, Official Zang! 
 - Official Zang!

259
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,000
- Have mercy! 
 - Have mercy!

260
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,640
 - Have mercy! 
 - Have mercy! 

261
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,500
- Official Zang... 
 - Have mercy...

262
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,900
I have another name list here. It involves quite a few people

263
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,270
who followed them in corruption and favoritism.

264
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,720
I will be staying here tonight,

265
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,200
waiting for people to come and confess their crimes.

266
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,830
Those who confess early will be treated with leniency.

267
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,030
But if I uncover something myself,

268
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,000
this won't just be about a few individuals.

269
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,630
It will implicate the entire bureau.

270
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,110
Official Zang, I have something to report.

271
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,640
Please judge with discernment.

272
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,400
Official Zang, I also have something to report.

273
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,830
Please let me speak first.

274
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,010
Official Zang, I also have something to say.

275
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,200
Official Zang, I have matters to report, too.

276
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,800
Official Zang.

277
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,017
   

278
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,490
- Second Young Master. 
 - Lord Zang.

279
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,000
I just met with the Marquis.

280
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,650
I meant to congratulate you in person, but didn't expect to run into you here.

281
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,080
Perfect timing. This is for you.

282
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,750
Thank you, Second Young Master.

283
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,920
My father trusts you more and more these days.

284
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,550
And you've been granted an official post.

285
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,860
I fear the gap between us will only grow wider.

286
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,520
Lord Zang, what should I do next?

287
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,750
I came today to discuss this with you.

288
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,300
The Ministry of War has issued the conscription order.

289
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,680
I want you to join the army.

290
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,750
Join the army?

291
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,930
That's right.

292
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,000
If you want to surpass Zhuang Zhifu,

293
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,310
you must forge a new path and do what he cannot.

294
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,070
You must temper yourself in the military.

295
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,730
Only then can your future truly change.

296
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,210
But even if I choose to go, I doubt my father will approve of it.

297
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,860
Then you must beg him.

298
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,540
If once isn't enough, ask him again.

299
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,950
If that fails, another time. Keep asking until he agrees.

300
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,290
The key is to show him your resolve.

301
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,080
Understood.

302
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,720
Come on. Put it here.

303
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,840
Here. Put it here.

304
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,350
Here? Okay.

305
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,950
Yes, that one goes here. Good.

306
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,830
Official Zang.

307
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,340
Shi Lei, give us a minute.

308
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,770
Yes, sir.

309
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,550
It took you long.

310
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,190
Have you taken care of those obstacles?

311
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,500
Congratulations, My Lord.

312
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,320
Master, stop calling me that.

313
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,550
I'm not used to it.

314
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,110
Well, you have to.

315
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,550
From now on, watch your words and actions.

316
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,380
Act the whole way out.

317
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,420
Understood, Steward Gao.

318
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,300
Well, Lord Zang, how about a raise in my monthly salary?

319
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,560
Do you need to ask me that?

320
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,520
You're in charge of everything here now.

321
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,670
Then tell me, am I doing a great job?

322
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,510
Xiao Hai, this is your home.

323
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,220
I should at least make sure you live here with peace of mind.

324
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,410
Thank you, Master.

325
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,660
But... this isn't my home.

326
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,270
All right.

327
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,240
Think of it as my home.

328
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,550
A place where you can rest. Okay?

329
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,110
Xiao Hai, as long as you're with family and friends,

330
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,470
anywhere can be home.

331
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,890
Come on. Let's have a good drink tonight.

332
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,790
Let's go.

333
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,270
- Tastes good? 
 - Good.

334
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,430
I had the chef make it for you.

335
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,000
Getting Shi Lei some meat to help boost his brain.

336
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,310
Then you'd better eat more.

337
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,440
I'll eat more.

338
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,200
- These shrimp are good. 
 - Right? Have more.

339
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,100
With Xiao Hai here, I believe the Imperial Astronomical Bureau will become what it used to be.

340
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,350
Here's to your promotion.

341
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,480
Wishing you more to come!

342
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,320
- Come on. 
 - Thank you.

343
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,630
- Come on. 
 - Congratulations!

344
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,230
So, can we draft memorials

345
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,000
to impeach the Marquis of Pingjin and Cao Jingxian

346
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,440
to let His Majesty know all their wicked deeds?

347
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,170
- Insane. 
 - Enough.

348
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,000
It's useless.

349
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,270
Those memorials will never reach His Majesty.

350
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,640
They'll only expose me.

351
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,750
Did you hear that?

352
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,860
From now on, we need to be more careful.

353
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,400
Never run your mouth. Understand?

354
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,650
You got that?

355
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,000
I've arranged everything properly in the house.

356
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,540
From now on, Shi Lei will be the household guard.

357
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,500
Guan Feng will be the physician.

358
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,510
All the servants have clean records.

359
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,480
No need to worry.

360
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,490
Steward Gao, your arrangements are excellent.

361
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,790
It's all thanks to Official Zang. Come on.

362
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,480
- Thank you, Official Zang. 
 - Thank you, Official Zang.

363
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,680
Oh, you lot. Now you're making fun of me, huh?

364
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,050
Here.

365
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,170
Eat up while the food's still warm.

366
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,270
Try this.

367
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,380
- Lord Zang. 
 - This looks...

368
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,830
Miss Xiang from Zhen Tower sent in her visiting card.

369
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,680
She's waiting at the gate with many gifts.

370
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,230
Gifts!

371
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,950
What is it?

372
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,600
You've just moved in, and Miss Xiang is paying a personal visit.

373
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,540
That's quite something.

374
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,480
Xiao Hai, so is Miss Xiang one of us now?

375
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,950
What has she brought? Hurry up and let her in.

376
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,240
Miss... Xiang is not someone to trifle with.

377
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,550
Don't keep her waiting.

378
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,640
Fine. I'll bring her in.

379
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,350
Remember, don't say anything you shouldn't say.

380
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,090
You stay quiet.

381
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,110
You aren't the same as when you first arrived in the capital.

382
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,380
I nearly couldn't get in.

383
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,960
Miss Xiang, your visit honors me.

384
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,380
My apologies for not receiving you sooner.

385
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,590
Look at that tone.

386
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,690
Should I give you a formal bow?

387
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,340
- My humble... 
 - Miss Xiang, please don't do that.

388
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,650
You helped me.

389
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,090
If anyone should be bowing, it's me.

390
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,960
Leave the things here and wait outside.

391
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,540
Aren't you going to show me your new mansion?

392
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,080
Please.

393
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,060
Lord Zang, you've got quite a place.

394
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,510
The Marquis of Pingjin must really favor you.

395
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,440
It's nothing compared to your Zhen Tower.

396
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,700
The courtyard may be smaller than mine, but it's quite elegant.

397
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,430
It is a pity that there are no stars tonight.

398
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:19,060
Why does it feel like she's at her own home?

399
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,660
I haven't really looked around yet.

400
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,030
Have you not noticed anything?

401
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,800
Like what?

402
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,140
Stop the guessing game.

403
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,790
Check what she brought as gifts, and see if we can accept them.

404
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,730
- Hurry up. 
 - Hurry up.

405
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,040
It's happening. This is big.

406
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,100
You fought Chu Huaiing in astronomy.

407
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,550
Now that I think about it,

408
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,060
the night you showed me stargazing on the boat,

409
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,930
you weren't just making things up.

410
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,090
You really have foresight.

411
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,930
It's nothing more than ancient wisdom passed down.

412
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,690
If Chu Huaiming, besides staring at the sky,

413
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,540
had taken a look at what was on the ground

414
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,650
and shown humility and respect,

415
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,590
he wouldn't have fallen so hard.

416
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,960
His skills weren't empty talk.

417
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,580
He just couldn't hold onto his integrity.

418
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,100
You're truly a good person.

419
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,590
Then with your geomantic skills,

420
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,900
can't you just turn every misfortune into fortune?

421
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,000
As the old saying goes,

422
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,210
"Knowing fate is easy; Resisting it is not."

423
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,210
Most of the time, even if we know what lies ahead,

424
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,970
we cannot stop it.

425
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,670
But everything that's happened to you has been good.

426
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,100
I used to marvel

427
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,360
at how you became the Marquis' chief aide in just a few months.

428
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,670
And just a little while later, you've become a fifth-rank official.

429
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,750
Without your help,

430
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,770
my fate would've been entirely different.

431
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,540
That night on the boat,

432
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,700
you said nothing good ever happened when we met.

433
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,900
So, do you still want to see me often?

434
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,200
Of course.

435
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,690
I'd love for you to visit Zhen Tower and spend your silver.

436
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,340
I've become a fifth-rank official,

437
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,180
but I'm still as broke as ever.

438
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,980
In the capital, officials are the people I dislike most.

439
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,010
The higher the rank, the more I dislike them.

440
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,480
Don't become one of them.

441
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,370
What? Going to throw your weight around?

442
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,250
What you said reminds me of something I heard.

443
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,150
What was it?

444
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:55,640
Someone told me that once you're an official and get to ride in a carriage,

445
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,920
you'll be too lazy to walk again and will never step down from it.

446
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,950
Makes sense. Don't tell me you said that.

447
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,970
Thank you for the reminder.

448
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,900
I will keep it in mind.

449
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,510
Well, you are quite obedient.

450
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,140
I wasn't expecting your visit today.

451
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,960
Sorry for not being more welcoming.

452
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,210
Would you like to go to the garden and share a drink with them?

453
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,410
Drinking with them is boring.

454
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,260
If you ever want a drink, come and find me at Bazheng Pavilion.

455
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,100
I didn't just come to congratulate you on your promotion.

456
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,420
I have a question for you.

457
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,170
Please go ahead.

458
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,350
That day on the boat,

459
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,060
was there something you wanted to tell me?

460
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,340
 Your brows are like slender willows 

461
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,510
 and your eyes, a river of stars. 

462
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,480
 Few women can compare. 

463
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,700
 Then tell me, do you want to see me often? 

464
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,720
 You can't answer that? 

465
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,340
If there is nothing, never mind. Take care.

466
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,790
Miss Xiang.

467
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,230
Please give me some time.

468
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,910
For now, I don't have an answer.

469
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,750
How much would this all cost?

470
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,750
Look at this radish. It's got a long root!

471
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,790
What radish? It's ginseng.

472
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,480
Xiao Hai, look. I've never seen such huge lingzhi.

473
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,680
Miss Xiang is truly generous.

474
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,410
And the wine. It's top-quality.

475
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,920
We'll make medicinal wine out of it.

476
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,800
It's good for your body.

477
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,300
Xiao Hai, the gifts are carefully chosen,

478
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,780
with nothing that could be used against you.

479
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,420
She's really thinking ahead for you.

480
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,770
She's gone already?

481
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,220
What did you talk about?

482
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,150
She reminded me not to lose myself in officialdom.

483
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,330
That's it? Nothing else?

484
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah.

485
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,580
We're doomed.

486
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,490
We came to the capital too early.

487
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,490
Master, what do you mean?

488
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,140
Nothing. Forget about that. Eat.

489
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,800
   

490
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,220
Master, why are you still awake?

491
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,960
My disciple is troubled.

492
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,730
As the master, how could I sleep soundly?

493
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,380
Sit.

494
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,790
I knew I couldn't hide anything from you.

495
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,590
Naturally.

496
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,450
Actually, I didn't tell you everything today.

497
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,140
About Miss Xiang, right?

498
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,710
She asked me a question that I didn't know how to answer.

499
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,030
So, she left.

500
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,900
Is it that you didn't know the answer

501
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,380
or you didn't dare say it?

502
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,340
Liu Chu isn't around anymore,

503
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,180
and there are things I can't teach you.

504
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,660
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

505
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,177
   

506
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,100
It's me, Father.

507
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,030
What are you doing here?

508
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,890
What is it?

509
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,620
I have something urgent to discuss with you.

510
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,140
If it's about money,

511
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,190
talk to your mother.

512
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,870
It's not about money.

513
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,960
I want to join the army.

514
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,730
Why?

515
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,830
I dreamed of Mother.

516
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,160
She kept crying in the dream.

517
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,110
I asked her why.

518
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,570
She didn't say a word and just hit me.

519
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,380
She must be very disappointed in me.

520
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,100
That all these years,

521
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,680
I've been living in luxury, contributing nothing to the family.

522
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,520
Father.

523
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,790
I feel deeply ashamed.

524
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,930
So, you want to join the army?

525
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:11,120
Long ago, Mother once told me

526
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,160
she hoped I would become someone like you.

527
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,760
But I've been lost all these years.

528
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,940
After I woke from that dream, I thought for a long time.

529
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,260
Mother was right. I can't keep disappointing her.

530
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,630
Enlisting is no child's play like your usual mischief.

531
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,630
You'll live in the wild and face the real war.

532
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,380
Do you think it's that easy?

533
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,510
Not to mention marching,

534
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:41,140
even feeding horses could be enough to finish you.

535
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,980
Father!

536
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,960
Please give me a chance.

537
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,100
The Five Armies Camp is recruiting.

538
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,030
I've prepared my statement without asking.

539
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,940
I didn't use our name and will enlist as a commoner.

540
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,980
I beg your approval.

541
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,269
   

542
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,800
If you're going, commit to it.

543
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,460
Don't come back in less than a year.

544
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,880
Yes, Father.

545
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,590
After the massacre, this place became a haunted house,

546
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,580
abandoned, forgotten by the world.

547
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,589
   

548
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:35,670
You're home, Zhinu.

549
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:11,480
â™«  The scattered fallen stars quietly gather in my eyes  â™«

550
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:18,200
â™«  Blurring the memories into obscure outlines  â™«

551
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,650
â™«  Wanting to touch  â™«

552
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,900
â™«  but only able to cling to yearning  â™«

553
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:31,900
â™«  In silence, I quietly brush them deep into my heart  â™«

554
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:38,640
â™«  The moonlight falls silently on this night  â™«

555
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,770
â™«  The hazier it is, more pain is stimulated  â™«

556
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,250
 - Yuenu. 
 - Father. Elder Brother. 

557
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,510
 - How have you been today? Were you good? 
 - Yes. 

558
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,690
 Father, my wooden dragonfly is broken. Please fix it quickly. 

559
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,270
 Oh, it's broken? 

560
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,560
â™«  Let the moon rise and the stars flow like the river  â™«

561
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,770
â™«  I will first hide in the deeper depths of the night  â™«

562
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:14,180
â™«  Let the flying dust rush to be the fire beacon of the path  â™«

563
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,600
â™«  Once I fall into the ocean  â™«

564
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,190
â™«  How can I talk about sincerity?  â™«

565
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:27,460
â™«  I only wish for a small leak of light to sew up my heart  â™«

566
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:34,250
â™«  Let the stars in the pond fill up the deepest vortex in my heart  â™«

567
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:41,400
â™«  Let the winds and clouds surge. I've a hiding place where I can anchor  â™«

568
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,970
â™«  A moment of companionship  â™«

569
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:48,410
â™«  Time is not up to me  â™«

570
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,090
â™«  Is there an outlet  â™«

571
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:55,620
â™«  to vent this hidden pain?  â™«

572
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,630
â™«  Is there an outlet  â™«

573
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:03,700
â™«  to vent this hidden pain?  â™«

574
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,230
 Father. Mother. Does dying hurt? 

575
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:11,100
 Don't let them win. 

576
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,840
 Zhuang Luyin, 

577
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,440
 you will never have it! 

578
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,900
 - Father. Mother. Please help me kill the Marquis of Pingjin. 
 - Your father returned from Dongxia. 

579
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,320
 - Revenge needs conviction. 
 - He brought something back to the capital. 

580
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,000
 - If you hold onto this belief, any skill in the world can be deadly. 
 - Be good. Don't be afraid. 

581
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,820
 - Every day I remain in this world is pure torment... 
 - You don't want to kill innocent people. 

582
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,290
 Did the Marquis spare even one person in your family? 

583
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,000
 Yet what I fear most is not the waiting, 

584
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,130
 - but failing to get revenge, even after a whole life. 
 - Are you sure that you want to take revenge? 

585
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,430
 If I can't get revenge, I'd rather die. 

586
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,950
Master.

587
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:18,960
Tearing open old wounds and facing what hurts mostâ€‹

588
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,960
will stir the hatred buried in your heart.

589
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,410
Of course,

590
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,290
you may choose to forget.

591
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,070
You're young.

592
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,150
Your life has just begun.

593
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,960
Let your heart guide you.

594
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,590
Just never hesitate.

595
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:53,180
I know how to answer her.

596
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,860
   

597
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,817
