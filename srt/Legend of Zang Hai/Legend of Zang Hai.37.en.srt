00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,180
[Zhao's Mansion]

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,460
Is he suspecting something?

5
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,100
Hai administers to the Cabinet affairs with you every day.

6
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,180
He's too busy even to get any sleep.

7
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,130
I doubt he has any other thoughts.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,410
Judging from Zang Hai's intelligence,

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,980
do you think he's getting farther away

10
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,130
or closer to the truth?

11
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,560
Since you can't

12
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,220
locate the bronze fishes,

13
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,540
I won't wait any longer.

14
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,220
It's time to do it my way.

15
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,450
Sir.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,220
Let me search around a bit more.

17
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,940
You won't find what he's hidden

18
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,450
with a simple search.

19
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,730
Then...

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,730
Master.

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,540
What's wrong?

22
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,130
Mr. Zang invited you to dinner tonight.

23
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,890
I see.

24
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,610
Sir...

25
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,010
I know what you want to say.

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,850
Don't worry.

27
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,130
I only want what's best for him.

28
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,850
You may leave.

29
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,500
It's time.

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,010
Go ahead.

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,010
Understood.

32
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,410
Sir.

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,500
Sir.

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,100
Please.

35
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,380
Hai.

36
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,140
It seems that you made

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,760
quite a few dishes without me.

38
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,360
You always cook for us.

39
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,540
It's my turn to cook for you.

40
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,890
The disciple surpasses the master.

41
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,500
Gao Ming.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,290
You are going to lose your job

43
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,100
as a master.

44
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,130
Sir, please sit.

45
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,610
Where is everyone?

46
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,290
I made enough dishes for everyone.

47
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,940
But Fengliu and Yingqi

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,660
dragged Antu to see the lanterns.

49
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,940
Guanfeng and Shilei went with them.

50
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,730
Just like that, I'm left home all alone.

51
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,250
Master, sit.

52
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,140
Alright.

53
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,660
Sir.

54
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,490
I've learned a lot

55
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,250
from you while working in the Cabinet.

56
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,370
Here's to you.

57
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,100
Zang Hai.

58
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,900
You joined the Cabinet

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,810
to share my burden

60
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,290
and perfect my work.

61
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,290
I should be the one proposing this toast.

62
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,900
Please help yourself, sir.

63
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,900
Alright.

64
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,370
Try the stir-fried eggs with tomatoes.

65
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,850
Alright.

66
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,540
My mother taught me how to make this.

67
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,220
Our family was too large

68
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,460
for lavish meals every day.

69
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,290
But we had plenty of hens that laid eggs.

70
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,050
Try this one. Cold tofu with green onions.

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,140
It's my father's favorite food.

72
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,250
There is a well-known story about this dish.

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,780
A minister of the founding emperor

74
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,610
discovered that his hometown friend

75
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,220
and the local officials were accepting bribes.

76
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,780
Instead of covering for his friend,

77
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,290
he abided by the law and executed him.

78
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,900
But the local officials were afraid that they would be implicated

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,660
and made false accusations against him.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,580
Later, in the winter,

81
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,020
that minister served the emperor a pottery jar

82
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,410
filled with cold tofu with green onions.

83
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,490
The emperor caught the hidden meaning.

84
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,700
He punished all the corrupt officials

85
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,580
and did justice to the minister.

86
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,730
Homophone of "incorruptible".

87
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,850
It's a bit like the story of my demotion back in the day.

88
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,700
He didn't win the emperor's trust

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,850
with that dish,

90
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,490
but with the fact that he had helped the emperor

91
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,580
conquer the world.

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,490
It was the same with my father.

93
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,050
He spoke out for you in court

94
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,780
to seek justice,

95
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,610
leveraging his connections with His Majesty.

96
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,610
If it weren't for my father,

97
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,900
I'm afraid you wouldn't have resumed your officialdom.

98
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,410
Your father helped me,

99
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,850
but I failed to repay him.

100
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,140
My father never expected anything in return when helping others.

101
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,980
But even if someone

102
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,540
can't repay other people's kindness,

103
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,250
they shouldn't return favors with betrayal.

104
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,980
Mr. Zhao.

105
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,580
Should I call you my benefactor

106
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,370
or my enemy?

107
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,020
Hai.

108
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,930
Zang Hai.

109
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,220
I take it

110
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,900
you're not just probing for information.

111
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,930
You assigned such great masters to teach me everything.

112
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,900
How can you expect to deceive me

113
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,490
with Shi Yiping's death?

114
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,290
Even if your plan was foolproof,

115
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,170
it was you who took me to the Shi Residence, after all.

116
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,290
As long as I have a trace of doubt,

117
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,010
I'll find out the truth eventually.

118
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,250
What did you find out?

119
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,290
Lu Min.

120
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,340
Lu Min?

121
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,050
He was your classmate at the Academy of Yong.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,810
Back then, Lu Min, Zhuang Luyin, and you

123
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,460
attended the Academy of Yong

124
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,250
and became classmates.

125
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,610
Remember?

126
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,460
A tiny flaw in perfect planning.

127
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,220
I didn't expect

128
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,370
that you'd look into the Academy of Yong.

129
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,490
Zhinu, congratulations.

130
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,490
Finally,

131
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,490
you've reached

132
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,980
the end of this path.

133
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,220
Since you're well prepared,

134
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,700
I bet everyone is here.

135
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,490
Please come out.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,460
You...

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,420
I've considered several possibilities.

138
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,460
For example,

139
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,370
you're indeed my third enemy,

140
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,010
but you are not the mastermind.

141
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,340
You were one step late

142
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,580
to stop Zhuang Luyin and Cao Jingxian

143
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,890
from killing my family.

144
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,580
Today,

145
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,300
I demand an answer.

146
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,130
Because only you

147
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,340
know the truth now.

148
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,610
Zang Hai.

149
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,650
You are a real genius.

150
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,250
I really can't tell

151
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,180
if it's a blessing

152
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,980
or a curse.

153
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,580
But it's a pity

154
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,220
that I'm better informed

155
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,370
and have gotten ahead of you.

156
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,530
However, I don't want to

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,220
hide the truth anymore.

158
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,100
I am

159
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,420
your last enemy.

160
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,300
I planned for the annihilation

161
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,130
of the Kuai family.

162
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,220
Even if your father hadn't died at Zhuang Luyin's hands

163
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,490
and had surrendered the Gui Seal,

164
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,580
he wouldn't have survived.

165
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,650
After all, you saved me

166
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,420
and kept me alive to this day.

167
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,610
I can make this quick for you.

168
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,770
I am impressed

169
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,180
that you managed to pin this on me.

170
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,530
But you were wrong about one thing.

171
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,300
I didn't stage Shi Yiping's death

172
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,490
to deceive you.

173
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,130
I did it to deceive another person.

174
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,580
- Stay put. - Stay put.

175
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,220
You...

176
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,530
We are here to arrest Zang Hai on His Majesty's orders.

177
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,420
Arrest him.

178
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,730
You may leave.

179
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,060
Let me talk to him alone.

180
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

181
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,010
You...

182
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,820
Zang Hai.

183
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,430
Do you know how it feels to be an emperor?

184
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,580
No, Your Majesty.

185
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,820
It feels lonely.

186
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,820
I have to make decisions for the entire nation.

187
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,850
I must hold on to power,

188
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,940
govern all the ministers,

189
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,980
and take care of the people.

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,770
It's lonely at the top.

191
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,250
That's why Your Majesty likes carpentry.

192
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,300
It's something you do for yourself.

193
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,490
I have missed my old life

194
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,010
every single day

195
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,820
since I ascended the throne.

196
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,100
But if I hadn't become the emperor,

197
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,490
I would have died long ago.

198
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,610
I just don't understand.

199
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,530
Why didn't your father trust me, either?

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,700
Your Majesty.

201
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,940
My father didn't betray you.

202
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,610
Otherwise, he wouldn't have taken the secret

203
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,220
of the Gui Seal to his grave.

204
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,180
I've always wanted to ask your father

205
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,100
why he had chosen

206
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,060
to keep the secret at the cost of his life.

207
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,060
He could have just spilled the beans.

208
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,940
He thought I'd be afraid of those people?

209
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,130
My father died for a just cause.

210
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,610
He wasn't trying to keep your secret.

211
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,850
He just didn't want the Gui Seal to be activated again.

212
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,460
Kuai Duo.

213
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,340
I've underestimated you.

214
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,940
Zang Hai.

215
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,370
You lied to me.

216
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,700
But I won't kill you.

217
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,420
Nor will I vent my anger on your acquaintances.

218
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,300
But

219
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,820
you must hand over the bronze fishes.

220
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,200
The bronze fishes are in Wenyuan Pavilion,

221
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,250
hidden under Zhao Bingwen's seat.

222
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,490
These are the bronze fishes that Kuai Duo hid from me.

223
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,380
Your Majesty.

224
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,570
I gave you the Gui Seal

225
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,660
without offering you the bronze fishes

226
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,090
out of appreciation for my father's painstaking efforts.

227
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,860
What makes you think I would activate the seal?

228
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,810
The Great Yong hasn't waged a war against anyone

229
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,660
for over a decade.

230
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,010
As the world bows in reverence, true peace flourishes.

231
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,490
I wanted the Gui Seal

232
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,250
because my father

233
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,220
told me to obtain it before he died.

234
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,490
You hid the bronze fishes

235
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,570
because you feared your father would die in vain.

236
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,770
You wanted to honor his legacy.

237
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,250
But it's the same for me.

238
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,730
Even if Your Majesty never uses the Gui Seal,

239
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,530
who can guarantee that every emperor

240
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,940
will do the same as Your Majesty

241
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,380
in all the generations to come?

242
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,810
What about you?

243
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,770
If you keep the bronze fishes to yourself,

244
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,900
can you guarantee that your descendants

245
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,770
won't covet the Gui Seal?

246
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,380
Your Majesty.

247
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,330
The Gui Seal is an ominous item.

248
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,980
Countless people have died because of it.

249
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,180
As sovereign of all under heaven,

250
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,010
Your Majesty should govern

251
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,180
with benevolent authority.

252
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,700
I implore you to destroy this item.

253
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,220
One more thing.

254
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,570
My third enemy is still alive.

255
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,050
It's Zhao Bingwen.

256
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,010
Everything that happened before

257
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,660
was just a smokescreen

258
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,730
to deceive us.

259
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,980
He told you about the bronze fishes

260
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,380
to prevent me from avenging my family.

261
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,380
It wasn't Zhao Bingwen who told me about the bronze fishes.

262
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,210
It was Cao Jingxian's subordinate.

263
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,860
Your Majesty.

264
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,180
What's going on?

265
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,620
Your Majesty.

266
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,530
The imperial guards caught this person.

267
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,570
He is Shi Quan from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau who has been wanted.

268
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,770
He kept asking to see you.

269
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,940
And he said something

270
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,660
that shouldn't be said.

271
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,940
I want to tell Your Majesty something

272
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,460
about the treasure of Dongxia.

273
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,290
Leave us alone.

274
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,530
Understood.

275
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,570
I remember that you have another name.

276
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,730
I am Mr. Cao's foster son.

277
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,140
My name is Lu Fen.

278
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,900
You two took something from me.

279
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,980
Since Cao Jingxian is dead,

280
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,180
how come you're still alive?

281
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,490
I should have killed myself.

282
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,810
But I couldn't die without avenging

283
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,140
my foster father.

284
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,570
How do you want to avenge him?

285
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,180
Let's hear it.

286
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,620
Your Majesty,

287
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,730
do you know that it takes three bronze fishes to activate the Gui Seal?

288
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,220
What did you say?

289
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,810
I denounce Zang Hai for hiding Your Majesty's treasure

290
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,380
and deceiving Your Majesty for personal gain.

291
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,140
Sir.

292
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,490
Sir.

293
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,660
You finally came.

294
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,090
I did everything you told me.

295
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,810
Please look into it.

296
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,940
Zhao Bingwen has admitted to me

297
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,980
that he was my third enemy.

298
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,660
Besides, it was him who took me

299
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,050
to visit Shi Yiping.

300
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,490
He instigated Lu Yan to kill Mr. Shi.

301
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,770
He also instigated Lu Fen to snitch on me.

302
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,810
Enough.

303
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,460
I will look into

304
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,140
Zhao Bingwen by myself.

305
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,660
Be careful, Your Majesty.

306
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,490
He must be coveting the Gui Seal.

307
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,380
I'm tired.

308
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,940
Take him away.

309
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,530
I will see what to do about him.

310
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,140
Guards.

311
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,330
Tomorrow morning,

312
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,940
summon Zhao Bingwen

313
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,380
to the palace.

314
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

315
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,460
[The Great Prison]

316
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,530
What lie have you told His Majesty now?

317
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,660
His Majesty didn't ask me anything.

318
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,810
Why should I lie?

319
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,490
You made Lu Fen snitch on me

320
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,180
and forced me to hand over the bronze fishes.

321
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,010
Now, you can't get them, either.

322
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,380
Something happened to His Majesty last night.

323
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,490
His life is at stake.

324
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,010
You were the last person to see him,

325
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,420
and he put you in jail.

326
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,700
Mr. Sun knows what happened.

327
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,860
- He wouldn't... - I'm the Chief Cabinet Secretary

328
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,620
deeply trusted by His Majesty.

329
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,180
His Majesty was in trouble.

330
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,530
Sun Defang and Xue Zhao failed to protect him.

331
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,250
I've put them in jail.

332
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,810
Now, His Majesty is under my protection.

333
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,250
Getting the bronze fishes and the Gui Seal

334
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:03,140
is as easy as taking candy from a baby.

335
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,290
Zang Hai.

336
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,050
What a pity.

337
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,740
All this is destined to happen.

338
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,460
If you hadn't discovered my real identity,

339
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,860
I could release you

340
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,380
as the Chief Cabinet Secretary right now

341
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,940
so that you keep working for me.

342
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,290
There are so many things

343
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,140
we can work on together.

344
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,620
One lie needs a hundred more to cover it.

345
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,620
Sooner or later, the truth will be revealed.

346
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,700
If deception is a conspiracy, then strategy and diplomacy

347
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,460
represent a trap set in broad daylight.

348
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,700
Fight dirty if you must,

349
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,010
but prevail by undeniable means.

350
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,290
Can you grasp the difference?

351
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,090
When did you start plotting against me?

352
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,860
When you told me

353
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,090
that Kuai Duo gave the Gui Seal to His Majesty.

354
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,490
I learned where the Gui Seal was,

355
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,380
but it made me deeply concerned.

356
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,620
Because you had His Majesty's support.

357
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,010
But the real challenge

358
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,770
lies in getting the last bronze fish from you.

359
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,570
So you placed the bronze fishes and the Gui Seal

360
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,570
at Shi Yiping's residence.

361
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,490
This is about framing Shi Yiping as the fall guy,

362
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,180
allowing His Majesty to secure the Gui Seal

363
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,980
and lay his doubts to rest,

364
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,660
and driving a wedge between His Majesty and me

365
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,700
with the bronze fish I have.

366
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,490
You have to give something

367
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,900
to get something.

368
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,140
General.

369
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,730
There is no one here.

370
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,940
It seems that they've run away.

371
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,090
Put the whole city under lockdown.

372
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,730
Understood.

373
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,980
You want me to weigh

374
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,460
personal revenge

375
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,330
against world peace.

376
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,380
If I hand over the bronze fishes,

377
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,620
the Gui Seal may be activated at any time.

378
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,490
But if I don't,

379
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,290
I can't prove it to His Majesty

380
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,250
that you're my third enemy.

381
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,490
I know you

382
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,860
all too well.

383
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,050
You crave revenge.

384
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,730
But you can't change who you are.

385
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,730
In this world,

386
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,140
being good

387
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,050
just makes life harder.

388
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:17,570
Because your ties and worries weigh too heavily.

389
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,900
As long as you make the same decision as your father,

390
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,620
you can't use His Majesty against me.

391
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,050
You know my father so well.

392
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,290
Is your story with him

393
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,730
true or false?

394
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,050
The most powerful trick

395
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,940
is to deceive people by telling the truth.

396
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,860
Mix one lie

397
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,900
with nine truths.

398
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,380
That's the art of deception.

399
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,900
Kuai Duo did speak out for me in court.

400
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:09,770
I did write a petition, asking His Majesty to punish the culprits.

401
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,220
However,

402
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,900
we have no correspondence.

403
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,980
I have never received any letter from him in Yuezhou.

404
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,220
The letter was sent to me by Zhuang Luyin.

405
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,490
I asked Gao Ming to stay in Yuezhou on my behalf

406
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,290
and hurried back to the capital.

407
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,420
I told Cao Jingxian to guard the city gates

408
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,140
with Surveillance Officers.

409
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,220
Sure enough,

410
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,570
we found your father's tracks that day.

411
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,660
But then he vanished into thin air.

412
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,090
Little did we know

413
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,820
that he took the secret passage to the palace.

414
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,570
Anyway, we waited for him

415
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,090
near the mansion.

416
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,570
So I was right.

417
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,250
You manipulated the bandits into getting caught

418
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,420
and made them admit to killing my family.

419
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,010
Then you implored His Majesty to punish the culprits.

420
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,940
That was how you killed everyone involved.

421
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,250
After that,

422
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,410
I've been waiting

423
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,660
for someone to do Kuai Duo justice.

424
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,010
I waited for the person who hid the Gui Seal to show up.

425
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,460
But I didn't expect

426
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,730
that Kuai Duo's death was like a rock sinking into the sea,

427
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,700
which never stirred anything up.

428
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,380
Eventually, I learned from you

429
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,860
that His Majesty held the Gui Seal.

430
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,490
Zhuang Luyin tipped you off.

431
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,860
Cao Jingxian guarded the gates for you.

432
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,570
You managed to make them

433
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,860
follow your plan

434
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,140
and keep you behind the scenes.

435
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,090
Are you interested in what happened at the Academy of Yong?

436
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:17,380
I was born in a border town constantly caught up in wars.

437
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,610
[Academy of Yong]
My father named me "Bingwen"

438
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,570
to uphold King Wen's morality

439
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,380
and become a court official one day.

440
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,010
In the end, I lived up to his expectations

441
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,530
and was admitted to the Academy of Yong at the age of ten.

442
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,280
[Hiding brilliance and biding time]

443
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,570
There,

444
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,860
most students were children of noble families.

445
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,340
Soon, I became a thorn in their eyes.

446
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,090
Because my family was poor,

447
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,420
but I was extremely talented.

448
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,490
Let go.

449
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,170
You want to be someone like us?

450
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,420
In your dreams.

451
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,090
The physically imperfect

452
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,900
are barred from the imperial court.

453
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,610
I will cut off your finger

454
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,340
and stop you from daydreaming.

455
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,460
The son of a defeated general dares to stand up for him?

456
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,010
You're losing a finger, too!

457
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,340
Master, come here. They are there.

458
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,300
Consider yourself lucky.

459
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,460
Just you wait.

460
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,130
Are you hurt?

461
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,610
No, I'm fine.

462
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,740
I am Lu Min.

463
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,260
He is Zhuang Luyin.

464
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,650
What is your name?

465
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,980
Zhao Bingwen.

466
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,740
Just like me, Lu Min was born

467
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,130
into a poor family.

468
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,980
Zhuang Luyin's father died in a battle at the border.

469
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,610
His family fell from grace.

470
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,610
After that,

471
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:48,260
the three of us were excluded by the other students

472
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,490
and we were often bullied.

473
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,690
We tried to fight back.

474
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,650
But even the masters sided with them.

475
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,740
Right then, I realized

476
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,530
that there is something in the world

477
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,860
called power.

478
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,660
If you don't want to be bullied,

479
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,090
make him scared of you.

480
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,300
You go first.

481
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,500
How dare you hit me?

482
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,370
Behave.

483
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,530
I won't let you off.

484
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,170
I will tell my father.

485
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,730
Once he comes,

486
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,260
he will kill you all.

487
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,020
Stop running.

488
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,410
Help...

489
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,940
Help...

490
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,810
Help...

491
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,540
Does it mean

492
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,090
that we won't be bullied anymore?

493
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,690
Sooner or later, someone else will bully us.

494
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,420
We can only survive

495
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,740
by constantly gaining power.

496
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,490
But we couldn't hide the truth forever.

497
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,300
Nor would hatred disappear.

498
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,460
Lu Min's wounds made people believe

499
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,900
that he was related to the drowning.

500
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,880
[Jinghe Gate]

501
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,010
Lu Min's life was destroyed.

502
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,090
He could no longer stay at the Academy of Yong

503
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,860
and had to enter the palace as a eunuch.

504
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,010
Let's go.

505
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,740
Since you've taken this step,

506
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,420
the outside world no longer has anything to do with you.

507
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,570
Many years later,

508
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,340
Lu Min, who had long been renamed Cao Jingxian,

509
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,420
became the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director.

510
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,570
Zhuang Luyin defeated the Dongxia army

511
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,420
and became a prominent general.

512
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,380
I also became the deputy chief grand secretary.

513
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,820
Only we knew

514
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,740
that we were true allies.

515
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,610
If it weren't for you,

516
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,490
they wouldn't have ended up like this.

517
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:45,540
[Wanted]

518
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,340
Miss, take it easy.

519
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,530
We will hear from Guanfeng soon.

520
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,420
Antu.

521
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,490
Tong'er, you finally came.

522
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,820
Antu.

523
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,580
I finally lost the tails.

524
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,090
But I can't stay long.

525
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,050
How did you find this place?

526
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,180
I thought you had left.

527
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,450
Zang Hai made this place a safe house.

528
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,290
We rushed here once the imperial guards

529
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,180
left last night.

530
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:10,970
Antu.

531
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,660
You're wanted throughout the capital.

532
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,340
Be very careful.

533
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,460
But His Majesty promised to set us free last night.

534
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,890
Why are we wanted today?

535
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,250
What happened to Zang Hai?

536
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,340
Come here.

537
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,780
I don't know

538
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,820
what Mr. Zang said to His Majesty.

539
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,140
But everyone in the palace is saying

540
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,570
that he attempted to kill His Majesty.

541
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,780
He wouldn't do that.

542
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,970
He was set up.

543
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,290
Where are you going?

544
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,010
To save him.

545
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,570
Zang Hai is in jail.

546
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,420
How can you save him?

547
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,010
Maybe you'll be arrested

548
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,330
even before you get to see him.

549
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,820
I'll go to Prince Yongrong.

550
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,970
He can save Zang Hai.

551
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,140
He is the most powerful member of the imperial clan.

552
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,100
That makes him

553
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,290
the major suspect.

554
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,060
Besides, he's locked up in his mansion

555
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,220
and can't even go out.

556
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,410
Who can save Mr. Zang now?

557
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,540
Antu.

558
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,410
Calm down.

559
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,940
We will figure something out.

560
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,770
Should I ask my father for help?

561
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,130
Tong'er.

562
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,740
What I'm about to say

563
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,970
may put you in a difficult position.

564
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,610
But I have to tell you, anyway.

565
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,220
It's about my father?

566
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,860
Why did you save me?

567
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,780
Why did you train me?

568
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,260
If you hadn't told me about the third enemy,

569
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,460
I might be kept in the dark forever.

570
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,050
How are you going to live

571
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,490
without hatred?

572
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,300
I told you about your three enemies

573
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,780
so that you would keep taking revenge

574
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,380
until you help me find the Gui Seal.

575
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,170
You are the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

576
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,340
Why are you obsessed with the Gui Seal?

577
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,780
The Great Yong is a huge place.

578
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,570
There's way too much work.

579
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,460
And we need loads of ministers.

580
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,260
As long as those people exist,

581
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:29,300
even His Majesty can encounter obstacles.

582
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,300
I want to change the world.

583
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,900
However,

584
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,210
we can't count on people like Kuai Duo to do that.

585
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,940
But the Gui Seal is different.

586
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,060
As long as I obtain it,

587
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,130
I can turn all the people in Dongxia into ghost soldiers

588
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,540
and form an invincible army.

589
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,130
I will make all rulers submit to the Great Yong

590
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,460
and make their people

591
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,010
work for the Great Yong.

592
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,460
That will only

593
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,380
bring endless war.

594
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,740
The great unity

595
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,940
must be achieved through harmony.

596
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,260
History

597
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,900
will record you as a scourge of the nation.

598
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,740
Only losers

599
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,260
will be despised.

600
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,050
As long as I succeed,

601
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,570
history will write my praises.
