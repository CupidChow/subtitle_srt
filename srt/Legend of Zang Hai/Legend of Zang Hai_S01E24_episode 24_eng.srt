4
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,460
   

5
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,390
 How beautiful. 

6
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,910
 Indeed. 

7
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
What a beautiful dance.

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,300
   

9
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,730
Cheers, Official Zang.

10
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,330
Today is my birthday.

11
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,630
Thank you all for coming to celebrate.

12
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,990
Let me toast you all.

13
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:31,240
 - My Lord, wishing you joy year after year. 
 - My Lord, wishing you joy year after year. 

14
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,440
Please, everyone, be seated.

15
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,130
 - Sit down. 
 - Yes. 

16
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,420
Look.

17
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,930
Why the long face, My Lord?

18
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,610
Isn't today a joyous occasion?

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,030
You may not have heard, Official Qi.

20
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,560
Word is, Eldest Young Master was taken by Eunuch Cao to the Imperial Surveillance Office.

21
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,870
He's always been upright and decent.

22
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,360
I never thought something like this could happen.

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,280
Of course, I believe Zhifu is innocent.

24
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,140
But the longer he's held by Cao Jingxian, the more I worry.

25
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:28,190
In that place, even the innocent are forced to confess.

26
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,310
My Lord, you should report this to the court.

27
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,310
Your family has served the throne and the nation for generations.

28
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,520
His Majesty wouldn't turn a blind eye.

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,960
But now Cao Jingxian wields power in the Emperor's name.

30
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,430
Even our petitions land is in his hands.

31
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,790
Should I go straight to the palace and plead in person?

32
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,910
All of you here watched Zhifu grow up.

33
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,360
Now that he's in trouble,

34
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,180
surely you won't sit back and do nothing?

35
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,580
Of course not.

36
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,340
Your troubles are ours, too.

37
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,020
My Lord, if you ask me, this might all be a misunderstanding.

38
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,240
Why not talk to Eunuch Cao directly and clear things up?

39
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,140
That's naive, Official Lv.

40
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,560
Eunuch Cao's been arrogant for a long time.

41
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,210
He's never cared about the Marquis's dignity.

42
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,020
Backing down now will only embolden him.

43
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,310
And Zhifu is a Vice Minister of Works.

44
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,360
Eunuch Cao is detaining a court official without cause.

45
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,060
That's already a crime.

46
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,400
Why should the Marquis lower himself and beg a eunuch for mercy?

47
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,460
No, I didn't mean that!

48
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,240
Plenty have already bowed to Cao Jingxian.

49
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,270
If I remember right,

50
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,770
didn't Official Lu offend Eunuch Cao once, too?

51
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:03,720
Have you regained the title you lost?

52
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,480
Official Lv, you used to be a Vice Minister, right?

53
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,210
How much silver did you send to beg for forgiveness?

54
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,360
Yet you were still demoted.

55
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,390
Have you forgotten so soon?

56
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,000
All of you sitting here,

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,480
how much have you suffered under Cao Jingxian?

58
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,830
How many times has the Imperial Surveillance Office wronged you?

59
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,950
Don't you want to strike back?

60
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,340
Cao Jingxian is a tyrant and a traitor!

61
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,870
Shall we let him ruin our Great Yong?

62
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,750
I will never stand with such a villain!

63
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,240
Nor will I!

64
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,830
Say the word, My Lord. What do you need us to do?

65
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,950
Good!

66
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,410
Zhuang Shan.

67
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,980
Here!

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,270
At tomorrow's morning court,

69
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,120
I will present a formal impeachment to His Majesty.

70
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,310
Gentlemen, it's time we stood for Great Yong.

71
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,280
Join me in exposing Cao Jingxian!

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,720
I've already signed my name.

73
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,340
Everyone,

74
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,700
it's your turn.

75
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,360
I'm the Deputy Censor-in-Chief of the Censorate.

76
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,080
I'll go first!

77
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,030
Count me in, too!

78
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,950
Official Lv.

79
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,370
Official Lv.

80
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,900
Your turn.

81
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,003
   

82
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,070
Such a grand banquet, Marquis of Pingjin.

83
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,070
Why wasn't I invited?

84
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,590
Am I not worthy?

85
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,120
Eunuch Cao? What brings you here?

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,880
I came to wish you a happy birthday.

87
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,920
I searched the land and found this Lumo Blade.

88
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,460
Even after a thousand years, it's still razor-sharp.

89
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,000
No beast can withstand it.

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,800
You may not consider me a friend,

91
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,530
but I've always cared about you.

92
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,390
We went through a lot together back then.

93
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,590
Thank you, Eunuch Cao.

94
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,190
Please, sit.

95
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,480
Let's have a drink.

96
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,850
Then I'll find myself a seat.

97
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:30,310
This banquet of yours isn't just for your birthday, is it?

98
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,600
Am I right, Official Lv?

99
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:51,490
So, you've been building your own faction to impeach me?

100
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,910
Such nasty things written between the lines...

101
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,130
I've been so wrongly accused!

102
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:34,320
So, are you all here to impeach me, too?

103
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,600
It's getting late.

104
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,290
I just remembered my elderly mother is home alone.

105
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,250
So, I'll take my leave now.

106
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,910
Marquis of Pingjin, Eunuch Cao.

107
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,400
I have pressing matters, too. I'll take my leave.

108
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,300
- I'll take my leave. 
 - Farewell. Excuse me.

109
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,540
Let's see who dares walk out!

110
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,510
Cao Jingxian, not only did you detain my son,

111
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,020
now you show up uninvited to cause a scene!

112
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,550
What exactly are you after?

113
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,250
I came tonight to return him to you.

114
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,920
Bring him in!

115
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,690
They beat him this badly?

116
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,480
Zhifu!

117
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,340
Zhifu!

118
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,750
What did you do to him?

119
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,440
Guards!

120
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,180
I had both his knees carved out.

121
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,750
Zhuang Zhifu embezzled state funds over the years.

122
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,790
The Emperor was furious and ordered a full investigation.

123
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,630
He wouldn't talk, so I had to use force.

124
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,630
And plenty came to light.

125
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,240
These are all signed with his confessions,

126
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,510
in black and white, clear as day.

127
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,370
And that's not even the whole story.

128
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,960
Zhifu, I watched you rise through the Ministry of Works.

129
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,340
You don't have the guts to steal that much.

130
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,630
So, tell me, was it your father pulling the strings?

131
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,320
Is he recruiting soldiers and procuring horses?

132
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,440
Or forging weapons and armor?

133
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,110
Enough!

134
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,080
Zhuang Luyin, kneel and confess,

135
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,100
and your son will be spared.

136
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,080
Father, please save me!

137
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,110
- My Lord... 
 - Surround them!

138
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,350
You've harmed a court official

139
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,120
and now you dare frame me?

140
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,870
I'll arrest you myself and take you to the Emperor!

141
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,530
You...

142
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,080
You-You actually dared to stab me!

143
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,910
Guards! Help!

144
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,600
The Marquis of Pingjin is trying to kill me!

145
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,790
Murder!

146
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,480
Zhuang Luyin is trying to kill me!

147
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,610
The Marquis of Pingjin is trying to kill me!

148
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,670
- Help! 
 - Murder!

149
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,320
Murder! Murder!

150
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,130
- The Marquis! 
 - He's trying to commit murder!

151
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,820
Son...

152
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,930
You've suffered so much.

153
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,700
How did it come to this?

154
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,080
Zhuang Luyin plotted a rebellion,

155
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,910
and I caught him red-handed.

156
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,900
He tried to silence us with murder!

157
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,870
Every official here saw it happen!

158
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:52,480
By tomorrow, the whole capital will know.

159
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,960
And the Emperor will hear, too.

160
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,280
Zhuang Luyin, how will you explain this to His Majesty?

161
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,920
Cao Jingxian, you filthy rat!

162
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,270
Marquis, there may still be room to fix this.

163
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,960
Whether your son embezzled funds,

164
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,200
or you've raised a private army,

165
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,550
that's for the Imperial Surveillance Office to say.

166
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,320
It all depends on whether you want this settled peacefully.

167
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,390
Hand over the Gui Seal.

168
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,320
As for tonight's events,

169
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,870
I can smooth them over before the Emperor.

170
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,080
We'll call it a misunderstanding.

171
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,720
The Gui Seal?

172
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,630
Why would I have the Gui Seal?

173
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,250
Zhuang Luyin, don't play dumb with me.

174
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,630
You've been after the Gui Seal all along.

175
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,750
Weren't you searching, too?

176
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,600
One last time, will you hand it over or not?

177
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,120
Even if I have it,

178
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,320
a eunuch like you will never get it!

179
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Guards!

180
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,080
Search the place!

181
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,940
Turn it upside down!

182
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,280
Anyone who resists, kill them!

183
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,960
Let's see if you've got what it takes!

184
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,780
Search!

185
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,960
Lu Yan has gone ahead.

186
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,930
Keep the Marquis occupied.

187
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,000
Who's there?

188
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,980
Eunuch Cao sent me to help Your Highness.

189
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,320
I even have to clean up such a mess?

190
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,870
You clearly couldn't come yourself.

191
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,700
Why did you promise her, then?

192
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,440
That terrifying woman's on her way.

193
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,500
How am I supposed to explain this?

194
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,480
Can I hold her off?

195
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,490
I'll be lucky if she doesn't beat me up.

196
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,820
Official Zang.

197
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,100
Who... Who are you?

198
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,960
Who are you?

199
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,390
Your Highness, this way.

200
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,930
What are you looking for?

201
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,270
Don't make a move.

202
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,460
That's not water on the floor.

203
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,260
It's oil.

204
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,880
They say Dongxia's hostage hasn't left the palace for years.

205
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,380
And now here you are, in the Marquis's cellar.

206
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,620
You must be after something important.

207
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,160
Ever since the late Queen of Dongxia passed away,

208
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,570
your kingdom lost a precious heirloom, the Gui Seal.

209
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,880
Ten years ago, the Imperial Astronomer Kuai Duo

210
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,270
brought the Gui Seal back to Great Yong.

211
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,440
You knew he had obtained it,

212
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,720
so you joined forces with Cao Jingxian and Zhuang Luyin

213
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,320
to wipe out his entire family.

214
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,680
But the seal still vanished without a trace.

215
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,590
All these years, you've never stopped searching for it.

216
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,460
Am I wrong?

217
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,470
But you were tricked.

218
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,270
There's no Gui Seal here.

219
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,030
Zhuang Luyin never had it.

220
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:11,730
All of this was a trap I set to draw you out.

221
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,940
You're already infected with my arrow's toxin.

222
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,790
Don't move another inch.

223
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,390
Or this arrow will go straight through your skull.

224
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,640
Why... Why is it you?

225
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,970
Zang Hai, you shouldn't have come here today.

226
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,190
So...

227
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,100
you're the hostage.

228
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,410
The person I've been searching for was by my side all along?

229
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,650
What are you talking about?

230
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,110
You came to Great Yong as a political hostage,

231
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,030
but you've been looking for the Gui Seal, haven't you?

232
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,030
The Gui Seal is Dongxia's greatest treasure.

233
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,550
Of course, I must reclaim it.

234
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,590
So, you and Cao Jingxian made a deal to find it together,

235
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,160
isn't that right?

236
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,590
Yes, I had a deal with him.

237
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,390
But what does that have to do with you?

238
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,700
Haven't you always wanted to know what secret I've been hiding?

239
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,860
Well, let me tell you.

240
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,840
I carry the blood debt of the Kuai family.

241
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,580
Because I am Kuai Duo's son!

242
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,860
Kuai Duo...

243
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,880
You hid behind Cao Jingxian and Zhuang Luyin,

244
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,780
joined them in destroying my family.

245
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,930
You never thought I'd survive, did you?

246
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,630
Zang Hai, it's not what you think...

247
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,280
You...

248
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,970
Xiang Antu.

249
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,960
Do you know what this is?

250
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,900
Beneath those robes is the flayed skin of my parents.

251
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:28,440
After they were killed, their bodies were not left intact.

252
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,100
I swore before their remains,

253
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:44,060
I'd kill their murderers and avenge them.

254
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,410
She won't be waking up any time soon.

255
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,540
Use the chaos and slip out the back.

256
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,760
- Why... Why is it her? 
 - She's the hostage.

257
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,590
Stick to the plan. Move!

258
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,930
Princess!

259
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,100
Hurry!

260
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,970
Zhuang Luyin!

261
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,210
Zhuang Luyin, what do you think?

262
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,780
This scene looks familiar, doesn't it?

263
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:32,310
If you don't hand it over, I'll kill them one by one!

264
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:39,400
My Lord, just give him what he wants!

265
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,610
So, it all comes full circle.

266
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,000
Now I see.

267
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,790
Zhuang Luyin, you really are heartless.

268
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:53,030
Then I'll take my time

269
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,800
and make them suffer, piece by piece.

270
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,790
No!

271
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,170
You think a eunuch like you deserves the Gui Seal?

272
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,100
Dream on!

273
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,450
Zhan Hao! Xiang Hong! You're in charge here. Go!

274
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,930
Father, forgive me for being late!

275
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,930
Good son!

276
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,820
Take the madam away!

277
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,310
Zhixing!

278
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,860
Where is the Gui Seal?

279
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,500
The hostage broke our deal. We didn't get it.

280
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,250
Retreat!

281
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,180
Fall back!

282
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,760
Father, I'm all right.

283
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,580
Get the physician!

284
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,690
Hurry, get the physician!

285
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,490
My Lord.

286
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,900
My Lord, the Second Young Master's bleeding has stopped.

287
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,350
The doctor says the wound missed any vital spots.

288
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,440
You're hurt, too.

289
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,400
It's nothing.

290
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,780
My Lord, we've cleared most of the mess.

291
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,410
As for what happened last night,

292
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:07,280
make sure every mouth stays shut.

293
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,880
Understood.

294
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,280
   

295
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,690
Come here.

296
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,540
Do you know why Cao Jingxian came with soldiers?

297
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,440
That whole show in front of the others

298
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,920
wasn't just because he knew you planned to impeach him.

299
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,960
Last night, the imperial guards clashed with ours in the front courtyard.

300
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,330
And in the treasury, they even left some corpses behind.

301
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,880
There was a fire downstairs, too!

302
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,090
This is bad, My Lord. Your bronze fish...

303
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,960
Don't panic.

304
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,890
I'm not that easy to trick.

305
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:20,410
But that eunuch wasn't here for the bronze fish.

306
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:25,230
He came for the Gui Seal.

307
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,390
The Gui Seal?

308
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:30,720
He's certain the Gui Seal is hidden here.

309
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,710
My Lord, it just occurred to me.

310
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,350
What if the Eldest Young Master learned about the seal and the bronze fish

311
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:45,120
and spilled everything under pressure?

312
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,640
I never mentioned any of that to Zhifu.

313
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,370
How would he know?

314
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,310
Forgive me, My Lord.

315
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,520
But he started visiting me more often lately.

316
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,480
After his last visit to my home,

317
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,490
some sketches and notes related to the Gui Seal went missing.

318
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,740
- What? 
 - It involves the Young Master.

319
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,150
I didn't dare jump to conclusions.

320
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,150
But what happened yesterday was so strange.

321
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,110
Looking back, something felt off.

322
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,550
Why did he suddenly get so close to me?

323
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:20,790
And... what does he want with those sketches?

324
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,450
You and I both know the Gui Seal isn't here.

325
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,410
So, why won't Cao Jingxian believe it?

326
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,000
Get up.

327
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,730
Tell me. Why would Zhifu betray me

328
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:59,450
while Zhixing rushed back from the military to save us at the brink?

329
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:04,960
Was it really not you pulling the strings behind everything?

330
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,330
My Lord, the Second Young Master was badly hurt yesterday.

331
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,000
The blade nearly struck his heart.

332
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,400
He risked his life to come and save you.

333
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,530
That wasn't something I could control.

334
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,570
Zhixing keeps rising while Zhifu becomes useless.

335
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,560
Isn't that what you wanted?

336
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,860
My Lord, Second Young Master is your son, too.

337
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,500
He's the future of this household.

338
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,730
As for why Young Master Zhifu was in Cao Jingxian's hands...

339
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,390
I honestly don't know.

340
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,560
Things between me and Eunuch Cao have gone too far.

341
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,410
The Emperor must be aware by now.

342
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:13,030
The most urgent matter is how to explain this to His Majesty.

343
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:17,800
He surely doesn't want this brought up.

344
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,610
And Cao Jingxian won't tell the truth either.

345
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,220
He'll be hard to deal with.

346
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:35,400
Do you think the Emperor

347
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,990
only believes him and not me?

348
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,670
Eldest Young Master signed a confession to Cao Jingxian.

349
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,460
It's hard to clear his name now.

350
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,200
Given the situation,

351
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,100
I think your best option is to take the blame yourself,

352
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,720
and plead guilty to protect yourself.

353
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,300
My Lord, you also need to show honest regret to the Emperor.

354
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,160
Only then will His Majesty be reassured.

355
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,790
You're right.

356
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,360
I need to ease His Majesty's doubts.

357
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,230
 Hurry! Faster! 

358
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,140
 Fu'er... 

359
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,280
 Fu'er... 

360
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,430
Fu'er, don't scare me like this! What's wrong?

361
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,150
- My Lord. 
 - My Lord...

362
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,880
- I'm going to kill him! 
 - Look at Fu'er...

363
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,540
I'm going to kill him! I'll kill him...

364
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,900
Physician!

365
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,760
Here, My Lord.

366
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,290
What's happening?

367
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,280
Speak up!

368
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,710
My Lord, Eldest Young Master's wound was too large.

369
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,700
It festered and caused a fever.

370
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,590
After last night's shock, his fever hasn't broken.

371
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,930
So, his mind's not clear anymore.

372
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,980
Say that again!

373
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,080
Father... Father...

374
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,740
- Father... 
 - My Lord...

375
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,310
- Father...
- Please save him!

376
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:06,620
Father, save me... Save me...

377
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,210
Can he still be cured?

378
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:29,430
No matter what, you must keep him alive!

379
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,300
Yes, My Lord!

380
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,560
Father...

381
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,810
Father...

382
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,940
- Father... Don't leave me, Father... 
 - Fu'er...

383
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,730
- Father... Don't leave me, Father... 
- Fu'er!

384
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,760
My dear... I'm here!

385
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,600
I am here with you! My dear...

386
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,980
It hurts... Mother...

387
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,110
What do we do now?

388
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,880
Father...

389
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,990
You're wounded. Lie down.

390
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,530
Zhixing...

391
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,980
The weight of the Zhuang family will now fall to you.

392
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,250
How can I be worthy of that?

393
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:04,700
Yesterday, you saved the entire family.

394
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,510
You're not just a good son,

395
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,070
you'll make a great general one day.

396
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,720
Father...

397
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,190
there's something I need to ask you.

398
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:28,010
Last night, why did Cao Jingxian suddenly attack you?

399
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:36,700
Don't ask. One day, I'll tell you everything.

400
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,950
For now, focus on recovering.

401
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:10,040
