00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:46,210
[Prince Yongrong's Mansion]

4
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,930
Should any guest arrive, direct them

5
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,870
to the side entrance.

6
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,700
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,940
[Prince Yongrong's Mansion]

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,180
I am Zang Hai, the Imperial Astronomer. I have come to call on His Highness.

9
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,690
My visiting card was presented yesterday.

10
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,130
Ah, Mr. Zang.

11
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,210
Please come with me.

12
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,600
His Highness said today that fortune comes from the west,

13
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,440
so only the west gate will be opened.

14
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,210
His Highness is so particular about feng shui as well?

15
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,660
Yes.

16
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,170
Mr. Zang, this way, please.

17
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,410
Please wait here for now.

18
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,060
You will be summoned in due order.

19
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,780
Mr. Zang,

20
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,730
please write down your birth characters.

21
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,890
His Highness will review them shortly.

22
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,020
[Zang Hai's birth characters]

23
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,980
This Zang Hai

24
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,340
is rather interesting.

25
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,430
May I have your name, sir?

26
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,340
Zhang Huai. That's "Zhang" with the "li" and "zao" radicals.

27
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,290
May I ask which of you is Mr. Zang?

28
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,410
That would be me.

29
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,820
I am Shen Yong, Assistant Minister of the Court of Imperial Entertainments.

30
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,660
His Highness wishes to speak with you in the front hall.

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,660
Please come with me.

32
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,450
Your Highness.

33
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,100
I am Zang Hai, Imperial Astronomer, here to pay my respects to Your Highness.

34
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,020
Zang Hai,

35
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,900
so we meet at last.

36
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,540
The imperial mausoleum incident

37
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,290
once led me to believe your fate was clouded by misfortune,

38
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,410
with your Four Pillars governed by yin and your father's life cut short.

39
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,660
But upon seeing your birth characters,

40
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,410
I was surprised to find that you are blessed

41
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,220
with the fate of a Heavenly Noble, one who turns adversity into fortune,

42
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,980
with helping hands in hardship

43
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,840
and salvation in danger.

44
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,610
Remarkable.

45
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,900
No wonder you have risen so quickly.

46
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,410
I have heard you made bold changes upon taking up your new post.

47
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,540
It seems you are at the height of your powers.

48
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,140
I am deeply humbled, Your Highness.

49
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,100
You are of royal blood.

50
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,540
How could I, a mere official, presume to be called "noble" by you?

51
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,370
Still, you pique my curiosity.

52
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,480
You seem a man born under a cursed fate,

53
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,660
yet your destiny tells a different story.

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,500
Let me guess.

55
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,050
Has your fate been altered?

56
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,100
I indeed lost both my parents

57
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,220
at a young age, left lonely and helpless.

58
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,900
Yet my fate is not governed solely by yin.

59
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,370
At the imperial mausoleum, I was truly set up by others.

60
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,780
He dared to deceive His Majesty over a matter of national mourning.

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,780
Chu Huaiming's death

62
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,290
was well deserved.

63
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,290
Thank you, Your Highness.

64
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,170
This humble gift is but a token of my respect.

65
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,850
May Your Highness kindly accept it.

66
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,410
Collecting a full set of Zhenyou Tongbao

67
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,980
is uncommon as it stands,

68
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,980
let alone finding one in such excellent condition.

69
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,460
Where did you obtain them?

70
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,140
This set of Zhenyou Tongbao is indeed rare.

71
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,140
I acquired it by chance

72
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,610
from a well-traveled merchant.

73
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,930
I now offer it to Your Highness.

74
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,700
Well-informed, aren't you?

75
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,140
But I like that.

76
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:50,900
Now tell me.

77
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,490
What is it you're after?

78
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,490
I dare not presume too much, Your Highness.

79
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,050
I've heard much of Your Highness's refined taste and noble character,

80
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,730
and have long admired you.

81
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,100
I only hoped for the honor of meeting you

82
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,540
and perhaps receiving a few words of your guidance.

83
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,460
Guidance, you say?

84
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,700
You serve the Marquis of Pingjin.

85
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,220
Surely you know that's a big taboo in the official circles.

86
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,170
Say something.

87
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,040
Weren't you known for your silver tongue?

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,980
Why have you suddenly gone mute in front of me?

89
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,850
Your Highness stands second only to His Majesty.

90
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,730
While I waited earlier,

91
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,700
I saw others leave disheartened,

92
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,810
and feared that the humble gift I brought

93
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,140
might not catch your eye.

94
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,850
Now that Your Highness finds it pleasing, I consider myself most fortunate.

95
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,610
I dare not harbor any further presumptuous thoughts.

96
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,730
I spoke out of turn earlier. Please forgive me, Your Highness.

97
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,600
Forgive!

98
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,290
Forgive!

99
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,450
Forgive!

100
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,140
This creature actually knows how to plead.

101
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,490
It's surprisingly clever.

102
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,810
Many come to my mansion with presents.

103
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,250
If I accepted them all,

104
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,540
my household would be in chaos.

105
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,810
Usually, those whose gifts are accepted

106
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,850
are eager to ask for something in return.

107
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,610
Yet you seem to be holding back.

108
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:25,730
What is it?

109
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,370
Are you planning to secure something big with a long-term strategy?

110
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,730
I wouldn't dare.

111
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,820
Truth be told,

112
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,840
ever since I joined the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

113
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,820
I have come to realize how perilous an official's path truly is.

114
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,220
I fear that someday I might share the same tragic end as Chu Huaiming.

115
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,180
I hope to meet wise mentors and trustworthy friends

116
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,460
and broaden my horizons.

117
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,980
Why didn't you just say that earlier?

118
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,040
Most officials in the Capital

119
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,420
come to me

120
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,420
with the same intentions as you.

121
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,650
Why are you still on your knees?

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,680
Shen Yong,

123
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,610
help Mr. Zang up.

124
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,490
Yes, Your Highness.

125
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,220
Mr. Zang.

126
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,590
Let me ask you this.

127
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,220
You say I have refined taste,

128
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,850
but the things I love most reek of money.

129
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,140
Where's the refinement in that?

130
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,010
As I made my way here,

131
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,420
I couldn't help but notice the elegance in every flower, tree,

132
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,850
and blade of grass in Your Highness's courtyard.

133
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,490
That gnarled and vigorous desert poplar,

134
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,770
twisting like a coiled dragon,

135
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,420
has stood for over a thousand years.

136
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,920
I daresay that single tree alone

137
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,220
is worth ten years of my humble salary.

138
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,460
You've got quite the discerning eye.

139
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,060
I had that tree brought back alive from the desert.

140
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,980
It took quite the effort.

141
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,650
Yet others come by

142
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,480
and wonder why I've placed

143
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,340
a withered, lifeless tree in my courtyard.

144
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,980
Few recognize its worth, as you do.

145
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,610
Having assumed the role of Imperial Astronomer,

146
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,610
I've devoted myself to advancing my expertise in geomancy and object appraisal.

147
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,420
I once fancied myself knowledgeable,

148
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,740
but after visiting Your Highness's mansion today,

149
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,700
I see how much remains beyond my grasp.

150
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,490
You're certainly well-spoken.

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,770
I do like the gift you've brought,

152
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,490
but giving gifts in official circles

153
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,420
requires a bit of finesse.

154
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,940
I can show you the proper way.

155
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,940
Shen Yong.

156
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,010
Yes, Your Highness.

157
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,870
Today, Mr. Zang

158
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,060
is giving you this Zhenyou Tongbao collection.

159
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,340
Yes, Your Highness.

160
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,130
Shen Yong,

161
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,770
that's a fine collection you have there.

162
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,100
Your Highness,

163
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,830
this set of Zhenyou Tongbao was gifted

164
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,540
by Mr. Zang of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

165
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,060
He says it is an exceedingly rare treasure.

166
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,850
As you know, I lack the expertise to fully appreciate it.

167
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,530
Perhaps you could give me something from your collection

168
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,010
so we can exchange and appreciate each other's treasures.

169
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,490
Look at you, so greedy.

170
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,610
I won't take it from you for free.

171
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,180
See?

172
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,850
Now you're not simply here to present me with treasures.

173
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,980
You and Mr. Shen are friends, after all.

174
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,660
It brings me great joy to have received such a precious set today.

175
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,620
I'll surely have a few more drinks tonight.

176
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,370
Shen Yong,

177
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,280
since this new friend of yours

178
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,920
is eager to see the world,

179
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,700
why not invite him to join the banquet tonight?

180
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,100
Your Highness is absolutely right.

181
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,650
Mr. Zang, would you be willing to accompany us?

182
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,630
It would be my utmost pleasure.

183
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

184
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,460
That outfit of yours is somewhat modest.

185
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,300
Shen Yong,

186
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,050
get Mr. Zang something more suitable to wear.

187
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,220
Yes, Your Highness.

188
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,820
Congratulations, Mr. Zang.

189
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,340
This is no ordinary banquet.

190
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,650
After tonight,

191
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,940
you won't be the same as before.

192
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,460
His Highness's night banquets occur once every three years

193
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,700
and are never held at the same venue twice.

194
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,060
If it weren't for His Highness's banquet,

195
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,220
who else in the Capital

196
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,610
could book the entire Zhen Tower?

197
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,730
You probably don't know many people here today.

198
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,520
Shall I tell you who's here?

199
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,610
Much obliged, Mr. Shen.

200
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,850
The gentleman seated to the left of the main seat

201
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,300
is Minister of Rites, Mr. Huang Shen.

202
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,530
Apart from His Highness, he is the highest-ranking official present today.

203
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,010
Next to Mr. Huang is Han Lun,

204
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,630
Right Administration Vice Commissioner of the Huguang Region.

205
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,180
Being from the same area,

206
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,610
they are likely reminiscing about old times.

207
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,100
The gentleman seated to the right of the main seat

208
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,250
is Wang Shiqi, Vice Minister of Personnel.

209
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,100
Next to him

210
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,850
is Li Fu, the Left Administration Vice Commissioner of Dingzhou.

211
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,300
What do you suppose they are discussing?

212
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,300
Perhaps Li Fu is asking Mr. Wang

213
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,180
to have him transferred back to the Capital?

214
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,220
As the saying goes, "The sky is high and the Emperor is far away."

215
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,340
With so many influential officials in the Capital,

216
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,180
why would a local official, the highest authority

217
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,650
in his own domain,

218
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,610
choose to return to the Capital and serve under others?

219
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,610
It is better to be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish in a big pond.

220
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,980
Mr. Zang,

221
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,770
talking like that, you sound anything but a newcomer to official circles.

222
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,980
No wonder His Highness holds you in such high regard.

223
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,340
You flatter me, Mr. Shen.

224
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,100
Your Highness is here.

225
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,180
Your Highness.

226
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,820
His Highness is here.

227
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,650
Greetings, Your Highness.

228
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,420
You're all here.

229
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,560
Mr. Wang.

230
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,880
The one who arrived with His Highness

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,760
is Zhang Keshu, Grand Coordinator of Luzhou.

232
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,650
Mr. Huang.

233
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,650
Your Highness.

234
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,180
Thank you all for waiting.

235
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,530
Allow me to introduce a new face to you:

236
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,370
Zang Hai, Imperial Astronomer,

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,250
a man of exceptional talent.

238
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,060
I am Zang Hai.

239
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,530
Thanks to His Highness's gracious favor,

240
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,340
I have the privilege to meet all of you today.

241
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,650
I've read Mr. Zang's memorials.

242
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,650
He certainly has a bold and decisive style.

243
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,180
In that case, you'd better be careful today

244
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,980
and not offend Mr. Zang.

245
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,730
I wouldn't dare.

246
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,650
In terms of drafting memorials,

247
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,460
I must admit I am but a novice compared to all of you.

248
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,300
Zang Hai,

249
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
we are all officials serving the same court,

250
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,530
and they are quite close to me.

251
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,610
You're new to official circles,

252
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,880
instead of coming to me all the time,

253
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,650
you should be asking them for help more.

254
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,060
Many thanks, Your Highness.

255
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,420
All right.

256
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,300
There's no need for formalities at my banquet.

257
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,630
Just enjoy yourselves to the fullest.

258
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,890
Now, if you please.

259
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,250
I'm sure you've all met His Majesty.

260
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,010
So let's raise the first cup to him

261
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,340
and wish him good health.

262
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,890
May you all join forces

263
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,850
to support my brother in his duties.

264
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:47,890
Cheers.

265
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,080
- Cheers. - Cheers.

266
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,030
- Cheers. - Cheers.

267
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,980
Mr. Zang,

268
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,130
His Highness kept praising you earlier.

269
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,480
Your talent in deciphering astronomical phenomena is truly remarkable.

270
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,490
You even outshine Chu Huaiming.

271
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,100
Well, Chu Huaiming has only himself to blame.

272
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,340
He failed in his own duties

273
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,250
and even schemed against others.

274
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,010
Had he chosen to serve under me back then,

275
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,820
he might not have been exiled.

276
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,180
Then again,

277
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,490
I doubt I would've taken him in.

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,530
Your Highness,

279
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,340
might there be a curse

280
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,420
upon the post of Imperial Astronomer?

281
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,490
Just look at how things ended for Chu Huaiming.

282
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,730
Perhaps Mr. Zang should consider stepping away before misfortune strikes?

283
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,980
Mr. Zhang does have a point.

284
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,650
Have you all forgotten

285
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,580
who held the post before Chu Huaiming?

286
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,130
Kuai Duo was a man of great talent,

287
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,700
yet he died all the same.

288
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,080
Zang Hai, don't panic.

289
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,650
Perhaps you should consider Mr. Zhang's suggestion

290
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,010
and take a different post.

291
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,730
I'll pick one for you.

292
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,240
Many thanks, Your Highness.

293
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,050
However, I remain devoted to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

294
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,250
I heard you mention Mr. Kuai just now,

295
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,180
a name unfamiliar to me.

296
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,090
Might Your Highness kindly tell me more about him?

297
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,380
Do you truly wish to hear about what happened to Mr. Kuai?

298
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,380
I need to find a way to make the most of opportunities

299
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,810
and steer clear of trouble.

300
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,940
Unlike Chu Huaiming,

301
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,290
the issue wasn't within the bureaucracy.

302
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,940
What happened was that his entire family was massacred.

303
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,940
Is that really true?

304
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,010
How come no one from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau ever mentioned it to me?

305
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,620
You just became the Imperial Astronomer.

306
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,980
Who would be foolish enough to talk about that with you?

307
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,090
Kuai Duo

308
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,220
was supposed to be overseeing the construction of the Fengshan Altar in Dongxia.

309
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,010
But before it was finished,

310
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,900
the altar collapsed.

311
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,810
He

312
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,290
secretly fled back to his home in the Capital,

313
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,860
only to be mysteriously attacked and killed by bandits.

314
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,220
His whole family was burned beyond recognition,

315
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,810
and not a single soul survived.

316
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,810
I did not anticipate

317
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,250
such a fate for Mr. Kuai.

318
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,530
In Your Highness's opinion,

319
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,700
could his enemies have been responsible for his death?

320
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,940
You are indeed clever, Mr. Zang.

321
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,250
I thought the same

322
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,620
and even personally investigated the case later.

323
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,730
Kuai Duo's house was looted,

324
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,860
but the robbers were caught

325
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,040
and, under severe punishment, confessed.

326
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,600
Only then was the case closed.

327
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,620
So, what happened to those bandits in the end?

328
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,130
Generally speaking,

329
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,700
some of the culprits might not have warranted execution.

330
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,530
However, Mr. Kuai was a fifth-rank Imperial Astronomer,

331
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,620
and the incident stirred outrage among many court officials.

332
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,530
At the time, Mr. Zhao, Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

333
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,050
submitted a petition

334
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,090
urging His Majesty to punish the offenders severely.

335
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,460
In the end, none were exiled and all were executed.

336
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,730
Your Highness,

337
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,900
there is one thing I do not understand.

338
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,220
If the bodies of the entire Kuai family were burned beyond recognition,

339
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,220
how could anyone be certain

340
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,180
that Mr. Kuai had truly returned from Dongxia?

341
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,940
Zang Hai,

342
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,770
you seem quite interested in Kuai Duo's death.

343
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,140
Your Highness,

344
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,340
I fear for my life too.

345
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,310
I have to find a way to protect myself.

346
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,070
What if

347
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,190
there really is something wrong

348
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,730
with the Imperial Astronomical Bureau's feng shui?

349
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,700
Why bring this up

350
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,090
on such a fine day?

351
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,980
Who started it?

352
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,250
Your Highness,

353
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,530
if you didn't mention Kuai Duo, who else would dare to talk about it?

354
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,420
Look at me, so forgetful.

355
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,480
I'll down a drink as an apology.

356
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,290
I'll down it now.

357
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,780
Come, let's fill our cups too.

358
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,330
Come now, fill them all up.

359
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,490
To Your Highness.

360
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,250
To Your Highness.

361
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,610
- To Your Highness. - To Your Highness.

362
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,010
Shen Yong.

363
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,460
Your Highness.

364
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,220
Didn't you say you invited the Capital's top courtesan today?

365
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,430
Why hasn't she arrived yet?

366
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,490
Today isn't like any other day.

367
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,980
Since she's here to meet Your Highness,

368
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,140
she must be taking her time to get ready.

369
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,010
Then I shall wait a bit longer,

370
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,010
in case the courtesan ruins her makeup

371
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,380
when she's rushed.

372
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,770
Bravo.

373
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,810
Bravo.

374
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,770
Bravo.

375
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,860
Your Highness,

376
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,980
my master is unable to come today,

377
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,620
so I've been sent to present

378
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,940
this top-grade liquor of Zhen Tower as a sign of goodwill.

379
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,730
What liquor is this?

380
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,140
This liquor is called

381
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,700
- the Fall of Mulberry Leaves. - This Zhen Tower's liquor

382
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,900
tastes really good.

383
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,570
Such fine liquor.

384
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:40,770
Your Highness,

385
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,860
may I ask what liquor this is?

386
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,140
Fragrant.

387
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:46,900
Your Highness,

388
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,580
may I have a sip of it?

389
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,960
Don't even think about it.

390
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,090
There's not enough of this liquor for each of you to have a sip.

391
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,570
Well then,

392
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,250
our idle talk ends here today.

393
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,860
Bring out the treasures

394
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,860
you've prepared.

395
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,620
If I find anything I like,

396
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,330
I'll gladly trade

397
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,900
a sip of this Fall of Mulberry Leaves for it.

398
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,220
Mr. Zang,

399
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,880
His Highness always has the habit of appraising treasures

400
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,920
whenever he holds a banquet.

401
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,980
Should there be an item that catches His Highness's eye,

402
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,660
it can be exchanged for something else from him.

403
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,280
What's gained in return

404
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,980
goes beyond mere valuables.

405
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,900
Jade pig-dragon.

406
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,730
Your Highness has such a keen eye.

407
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,730
Go ahead.

408
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:38,900
You shall be rewarded.

409
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,730
Your Highness,

410
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,940
I have recently obtained a rare treasure.

411
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,250
Open it and show me.

412
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:46,940
Yes, Your Highness.

413
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,570
Your Highness, please have a look.

414
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,250
What's so special about this item?

415
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,670
It is said to be an item worn by ghost soldiers.

416
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,380
Ghost soldiers?

417
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,050
That's right.

418
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,700
Aren't ghost soldiers just legends?

419
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,420
How could they possibly use this?

420
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,900
I obtained this item by chance

421
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,140
and don't have much knowledge about it.

422
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,180
Your Highness,

423
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,090
I know a thing or two about this.

424
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,810
I once heard from an old soldier returning from the frontier

425
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,810
that these ghost soldiers have flesh but no blood.

426
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,380
Even if cut by swords or blades,

427
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,250
their wounds heal swiftly.

428
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,660
When an army marches through, corpses are left everywhere.

429
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:44,620
It's said they are summoned by a certain treasure.

430
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,750
A treasure?

431
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,630
Zang Hai,

432
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,570
the treasure you're talking about is the Gui Seal, isn't it?

433
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,700
The Gui Seal?

434
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,380
So this treasure is called the Gui Seal.

435
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,010
The old soldier said he'd never seen it

436
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,460
and that those who had are already dead.

437
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,380
But Your Highness, how do you know about it?

438
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,900
My father died because of the Gui Seal.

439
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,860
Why are you all so anxious?

440
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,420
The late Emperor did not die at the hands of ghost soldiers.

441
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,460
He passed away out of sorrow and frustration

442
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,940
due to the urgent warfare on the front lines.

443
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,320
Even I have never seen the Gui Seal myself.

444
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,460
I, too, am very curious about it.

445
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:08,940
Li Fu.

446
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,900
Your Highness.

447
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,410
In my opinion,

448
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,660
this thing is hardly different from the helmets worn by the Dongxia soldiers.

449
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,090
What Mr. Zang said is far more interesting.

450
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,620
Yes, Your Highness.

451
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,620
All right,

452
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,490
I've seen everything you brought over,

453
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,390
but none has pleased me

454
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,390
quite like this treasure.

455
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,350
Look here.

456
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,840
One of these Zhesan coins

457
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,140
appeared at an auction not long ago.

458
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,860
I sent someone to buy it,

459
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,980
but it was snatched away.

460
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,220
I heard it fetched a hefty price.

461
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,460
I was quite upset about that.

462
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,930
But today, I've managed to get the whole set.

463
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,570
Tell me, am I not a lucky man?

464
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,380
You are most lucky.

465
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,180
You certainly are.

466
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,330
- You are indeed lucky. - You are indeed lucky.

467
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,610
Speaking of these ancient coins,

468
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,930
it's all thanks to Mr. Zang.

469
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,940
Mr. Zang, you should be rewarded!

470
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,330
Thank you, Your Highness.

471
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,660
Mr. Zang,

472
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,090
may your rise through the ranks be swift and smooth.

473
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,770
Thank you, Miss.

474
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,530
Zang Hai,

475
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,490
what do you think of the liquor?

476
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,770
Y-Your Highness,

477
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,330
this liquor is richly aromatic,

478
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,180
but it's far too spicy

479
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,810
for me to drink.

480
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,290
This stuff's wasted on you, young man.

481
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,420
Your Highness,

482
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,010
that hardly seems fair.

483
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,700
Everyone knows you're most fond of ancient coins.

484
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,290
We should bet on something else with this liquor.

485
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,780
[Zhen Tower]

486
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,420
This liquor…

487
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,830
I drank a lot without realizing it today.

488
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,320
I can't keep going.

489
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,750
Shen Yong.

490
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,460
Come here.

491
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,380
Help me get to the back to rest a bit.

492
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,250
Careful, Your Highness.

493
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,730
Wait.

494
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,660
I can't leave my treasure behind.

495
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,610
Be careful.

496
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,450
Don't you all even think about stealing my liquor.

497
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,420
We wouldn't dare.

498
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,180
Come.

499
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
- Take care, Your Highness. - Let's go.

500
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,690
- Take care, Your Highness. - Take care, Your Highness.

501
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,660
Take care, Your Highness.

502
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,850
Miss Xiang.

503
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,850
Mr. Zang, have a drink.

504
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,610
Miss Xiang, why are you...?

505
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,220
What is it?

506
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,810
Are you implying the liquor I poured

507
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,420
isn't as tasty as the one His Highness poured?

508
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,030
That's not what I meant.

509
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,020
Will you drink it or not?

510
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,940
You've made quite the impression at the banquet tonight.

511
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,850
That ancient coin of mine really came in handy.

512
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,220
Thank you for your help, Miss Xiang.

513
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,900
I must be clear about one thing.

514
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,680
About this ancient coin,

515
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,130
I neither sold it to you,

516
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,530
nor gave it to you as a gift.

517
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,460
Now that you have won His Highness's favor,

518
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,260
it should be returned to its rightful owner.

519
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,900
Miss...

520
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,530
Mr. Zang.

521
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,260
Mr. Shen.

522
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,500
Mr. Zang,

523
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,770
this won't do.

524
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,530
Why is there still some liquor left in the cup?

525
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,130
Mr. Shen,

526
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,880
I...

527
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,130
I honestly can't drink another drop.

528
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,740
Mr. Zang,

529
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,570
His Highness

530
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,020
wants you to enjoy yourself today.

531
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,600
So don't hold yourself back.

532
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,570
Cheers.

533
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,610
Cheers.

534
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,130
Your Highness.

535
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,700
Your Highness.

536
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,500
Please wake up.

537
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,180
Let's keep drinking.

538
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,050
I...

539
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,130
I can't drink anymore.

540
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,260
Your Highness,

541
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,700
you've returned to the mansion.

542
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,900
Let me help you to bed to rest.

543
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,330
No need.

544
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,610
Here is fine.

545
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,500
Your Highness,

546
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,290
your Gui Seal is missing.

547
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,850
The Gui Seal?

548
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,130
Where is it?

549
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,610
Where is it?

550
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,900
But Mr. Zang,

551
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,980
His Highness truly likes you,

552
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,290
He even granted you some liquor to drink.

553
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,740
This wine is indeed top-grade.

554
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,210
I've never seen His Highness get drunk so quickly before.

555
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,000
So how is His Highness now?

556
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,450
Don't worry.

557
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,540
I just gave him a special hangover cure powder.

558
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,220
He'll sober up in no time.

559
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,570
Have you really never seen the Gui Seal?

560
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,260
Stop right there.

561
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,770
Who are you?

562
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,850
I am here to serve Your Highness.

563
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,370
Were you talking to me just now?

564
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,090
Tell me.

565
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,290
What did you just do?

566
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,570
Your Highness.

567
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,500
Look

568
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,330
what I found here.

569
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,770
You left the Zhesan coin on the couch outside.

570
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,470
If it gets lost,

571
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,980
where am I supposed to find another one?

572
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,180
I really drank too much today.

573
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,050
Why are you still standing there?

574
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,330
Go fetch another spittoon for His Highness.

575
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,290
Go now!

576
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,940
Well done, Zang Hai.

577
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,500
You've brought me another one of these Zhesan coins.

578
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,980
Your Highness,

579
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,130
how about

580
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,020
granting me another cup of your fine liquor?

581
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,620
I was mocked when I drank

582
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,500
the first cup.

583
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,530
I've got to keep

584
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,850
my pride intact, haven't I?

585
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,300
Your wish is granted.

586
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

587
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,900
I'll go get the liquor now.

588
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,020
Wait.

589
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:27,780
Someone just whispered something in my ear.

590
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,030
I saw Shen Yong leave your side not long ago.

591
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,650
Could it be that Mr. Shen said something to you?

592
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,050
No. It was a woman.

593
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,050
A woman?

594
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,340
What was she saying?

595
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,250
Your Highness.

596
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,690
- You've had too much to drink. - Go away!

597
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,840
Your Highness, I'm coming in.

598
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,180
Your Highness sure know how to make an escape,

599
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,160
sneaking off here to avoid drinking,

600
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,940
and on top of that, you forgot all about me.

601
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,340
I was wondering which courtesan was putting on such airs.

602
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,250
Turns out it's you, Liuchu.

603
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,740
Your Highness is hosting a banquet at the Zhen Tower today.

604
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,720
How could I not come to join the fun?

605
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,380
Your Highness,

606
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,730
I asked you just now

607
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,820
what outfit you liked on me,

608
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,610
and which dance you wanted to see.

609
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,690
But you

610
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,420
didn't even say a word.

611
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,820
Is that so?

612
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,280
I came today without letting you know in advance.

613
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,130
You're not upset with me, are you?

614
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,500
You gave me such a pleasant surprise.

615
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,820
How could I possibly be upset with you?

616
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,020
Liuchu,

617
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,900
come meet someone.

618
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,050
This is a new friend of mine.

619
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,120
So, he is...

620
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,690
I am the Imperial Astronomer,

621
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,020
- Zang Hai. - Yes, that's right.

622
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,090
You are quite good-looking.

623
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,730
Greetings, Miss Liuchu.

624
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,650
Miss?

625
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,780
It's been ages since anyone's called me that.

626
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,570
How refreshing.

627
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,500
Your Highness,

628
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,380
I've prepared a special dance for the occasion.

629
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,380
Would you care to come take a look?

630
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,820
Sure,

631
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,340
Miss Liuchu.

632
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,860
Might Your Highness

633
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,340
kindly tell me more about Mr. Kuai?

634
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,500
Kuai Duo was a man of great talent,

635
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,090
yet he died all the same.

636
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,900
His whole family was burned beyond recognition,

637
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,090
and not a single soul survived.

638
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,050
You seem quite interested in Kuai Duo's death.

639
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,730
The treasure you're talking about is the Gui Seal, isn't it?

640
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,300
My father died because of the Gui Seal.

641
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,860
Even I

642
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,130
have never seen the Gui Seal myself.

643
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,980
I, too, am very curious about it.

644
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,340
You are awake.

645
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,380
Master Liuchu.

646
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,380
You drank so much.

647
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,570
You probably don't even remember how you got into the carriage.

648
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,940
It's a shame that after all that talking,

649
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,420
I still can't be sure if Prince Yongrong is the third person.

650
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,690
It's not him.

651
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,250
You don't need to investigate anymore.

652
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,860
When misfortune befell your family,

653
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,860
His Highness was attending a night banquet.

654
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,690
Was it the very night my family was wiped out?

655
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,980
So many years have passed,

656
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,860
yet I still remember the fire that night.

657
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,530
The banquet was held on a luxurious boat,

658
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,180
and I was there as well.

659
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,530
At dusk, everyone boarded the boat,

660
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,100
which sailed northeast

661
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,300
along the Guangji River.

662
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,050
We only docked at dawn,

663
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,450
and it was His Highness who first noticed

664
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,640
the distant sky glowing red.

665
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,020
Only then did everyone step outside to take a look.

666
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,340
That means

667
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,650
none of the guests at the banquet that night

668
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,130
could have been involved in the massacre of my family.

669
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,420
Yes.

670
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,510
As soon as Gao Ming told me you were going to visit His Highness,

671
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,170
I rushed over

672
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,250
so you wouldn't waste your effort.

673
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,340
Thank you, Master, for coming to help me today.

674
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,560
This helps with hangovers.

675
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,910
Dissolve it and have him drink it.

676
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,130
All right.

677
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,520
Good thing you informed me,

678
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,420
otherwise he might not have made it through today.

679
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,050
He set out before completing his training,

680
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,940
so he's not exactly fully prepared.

681
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,250
Right.

682
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,460
So, if he were like you, he'd manage just fine?

683
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,570
Of course. I'm his master, after all.

684
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,690
I'm leaving.

685
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:32,860
You're leaving already?

686
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,570
Hai?

687
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,050
Master, please come in.

688
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,530
You're up.

689
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,250
I made you some congee.

690
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,090
Come.

691
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,050
Thank you, Master.

692
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,530
Here.

693
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,860
Have some.

694
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,500
How do you feel?

695
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,730
Are you sober now?

696
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,650
You came back last night and said nothing.

697
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,300
I was worried you'd wake up

698
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,300
and forget everything.

699
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,380
Did you find any leads?

700
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,450
Throughout last night,

701
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,340
I was suspicious of Prince Yongrong,

702
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,860
but Master Liuchu's words

703
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,340
made me completely dismiss those doubts.

704
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,050
That said,

705
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,860
a person brought up during the night banquet

706
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,860
caught my attention.

707
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,050
Who is it?

708
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,500
Mr. Zhao Bingwen, Minister of Revenue.

709
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,020
Is there a problem with Mr. Zhao?

710
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,730
He's not directly related to my family's massacre,

711
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,940
but after the incident,

712
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,340
he did petition His Majesty to punish the culprits harshly,

713
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,260
resulting in the execution of all those bandits.

714
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,530
Those bandits

715
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,340
were either bought off or tortured into confessing.

716
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,860
Either way,

717
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,430
if even one of them lives,

718
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,210
the truth will inevitably be exposed.

719
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,170
However, what Mr. Zhao did

720
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,860
is understandable.

721
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,340
My father was an upright man,

722
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,610
and it's natural that some officials in the court

723
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,090
were filled with righteous indignation.

724
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,050
But

725
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,170
as long as there's even a slight chance

726
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,570
that a third party is covering up the truth,

727
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,570
I won't let it go.

728
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,300
Yes.

729
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,730
After all, this is the only lead

730
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,250
we have now.

731
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,900
It seems I must find a way to meet him.

732
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,980
♪Conceal the ambition in my eyes♪

733
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:36,140
♪In my palm, I hold a dangerous desire♪

734
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,420
♪Turbulent waves hidden in my sleeves♪

735
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,740
