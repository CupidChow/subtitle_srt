00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,740
This... This is...

2
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,480
Go get help. Now!

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:27,900
Yes, sir!

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,330
Hurry!

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,770
You two, come with me.

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,300
Hurry up!

7
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,680
Hurry!

8
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,370
In the sixth year of the Zhenshun era,

9
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,730
Great Yong dispatched an army of two hundred thousand

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,130
to conquer Dongxia.

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,210
The Dongxia forces were utterly routed

12
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,900
and surrendered soon after.

13
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,690
Great Yong stationed its troops along the border with Dongxia,

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,050
and built a Fengshan Altar

15
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,900
at the southern foot of Mount Dansui,

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,460
proclaiming its might across the land.

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,380
[The ninth year of the Zhenshun era]

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:44,980
Sir,

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,740
the Fengshan Altar

20
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,490
is expected to be finished in three months.

21
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,490
What's the situation underground?

22
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,570
They've already dug over a thousand chi deep.

23
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,100
That should do.

24
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,740
Tell them to stop now.

25
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,260
Sir,

26
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,050
bad news.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,290
Something's gone wrong underground.

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,780
Lower it!

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,500
What's going on?

30
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,060
What happened to all of them?

31
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,100
They're still alive.

32
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,060
They've just passed out.

33
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,060
Sir,

34
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,610
it's too dangerous ahead.

35
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,060
You mustn't go any further.

36
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,980
Sir.

37
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,690
Go get the rope.

38
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,220
Yes, sir.

39
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:01,850
Sir,

40
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,100
what

41
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,140
are those?

42
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,930
Don't go over there.

43
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,220
Could those noises we just heard

44
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,100
be from them?

45
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,780
Li Zheng,

46
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,540
don't tell anyone

47
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,700
what happened here.

48
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,100
Stay where you are.

49
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,370
Back off!

50
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,490
Hurry!

51
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,100
Watch out!

52
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,170
Li Zheng!

[Legend of Zang Hai]

54

[Episode 1]

55
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,390
Senior, here it is.

56
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,790
Come with me.

57
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,010
Hey, watch where you're going!

58
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,650
Zhinu!

59
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,890
Zhinu!

60
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,340
Come out!

61
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,060
Come out!

62
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,980
Where is he?

63
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,010
I'm over here.

64
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,820
What is it?

65
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:18,940
Zhinu,

66
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:19,700
they...

67
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,420
they've returned from Dongxia.

68
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,100
What?

69
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,580
The Marquis is mighty!

Great Yong reigns supreme!

81
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,980
Marquis of Pingjin.

82
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,420
Whose troop is this?

83
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,340
It's the Marquis of Pingjin's.

84
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,910
[Zhuang]
He's been stationed at the border

85
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,580
for ten years.

86
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,530
Following his decisive victory at Dongxia,

87
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,060
he's returning to the Capital today in triumph.

88
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,340
That's great!

89
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,530
What about those from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau?

90
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,940
What Imperial Astronomical Bureau?

91
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,940
I don't know much about that.

92
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,100
- The Marquis is mighty! - The Marquis is mighty!

93
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,180
Let's go.

94
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,850
Let's check if my father

95
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,610
is in that carriage.

96
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,060
Please make way.

97
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,100
Please let us through.

98
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,180

Great Yong reigns supreme!

100
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,220
That's the Marquis of Pingjin's second son.

101
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,530
He's quite handsome.

102
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,100
Indeed.

103
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,490
This kid's really good-looking.

104
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,990
The Marquis is mighty!

105
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,080
The Marquis is mighty!

106
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:37,980
Let's go.

107
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,250
What are you doing? You can't go in.

108
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,250
Step back!

109
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,420
- Zhinu! - Step back!

110
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,890
Why isn't this the one either?

111
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,820
Who are you?

112
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,100
How dare you lift my carriage curtain?

113
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,980
I merely took a look at you.

114
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,730
Why take such offense?

115
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,770
It's not like it did you any harm.

116
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,310
The Marquis is mighty!

117
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,490

Great Yong reigns supreme!

121
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,370
Why did you hit me?

122
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,060
How dare you speak to me like that?

123
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,180
You're asking for a beating.

124
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,820
Hurry, run!

125
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,720
Out of the way!

126
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,610
Hurry!

127
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,610
Out of the way!

128
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,220
Out of the way!

129
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:57,940
Help!

130
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,410
Move aside! Quick!

131
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,770
Help!

132
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,060
Help!

133
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,610
Help...

134
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,100
Help...

135
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,530
Please help.

136
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,610
Be gentle, Senior.

137
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,300
Your skin's been flayed open.

138
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,370
Of course, it's going to hurt.

139
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,700
Master's not around.

140
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,940
With my limited medical skills,

141
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,340
I can only help you apply some ointment for now.

142
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,300
That wild lass was truly ruthless.

143
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,490
Look at these two gashes,

144
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,340
one horizontal and one vertical.

145
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,610
It's as if a sword's been carved into your back.

146
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,130
What did you do to offend her?

147
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,340
I didn't offend her,

148
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,820
I swear.

149
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,010
I merely wished to see if my father

150
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,130
was inside the carriage.

151
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,980
Who knew she'd fly into such a rage?

152
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,700
Who is she

153
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,940
to act so high and mighty?

154
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,820
So noisy.

155
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,490
What a bunch of clueless bumpkins.

156
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,700
You don't even know the Princess of Dongxia?

157
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,060
What did you say?

158
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,730
That girl is the Princess of Dongxia?

159
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,700
What is the Princess of Dongxia

160
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,890
doing here in Great Yong?

161
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,610
The Princess of Dongxia

162
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,940
is an honored guest of His Majesty.

163
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,850
She's never been treated with such disrespect.

164
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,130
Who cares about that savage?

165
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,820
Answer me this.

166
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,820
Did my father

167
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,840
not return with you?

168
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,100
Who is your father?

169
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,650
My father is Kuai Duo, the Imperial Astronomer.

170
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,060
You brought me here

171
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,580
to ask me questions.

172
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,850
Well, I am thirsty

173
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,250
and need a cup of water.

174
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,490
Seriously?

175
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,060
What kind of water is this?

176
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,420
It's so murky

177
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,650
and has a foul taste.

178
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,770
Then don't drink it.

179
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,220
Spare us the whining.

180
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,340
You have a mouth fit for muck!

181
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,130
Tell me.

182
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,460
Have you ever seen my father?

183
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,650
I'm not telling you.

184
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,130
What can you do to me?

185
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,160
You won't tell us, huh?

186
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,730
Beat him up!

187
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,130
Are you going to talk or not?

188
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,850
- Are you going to talk or not? - That's enough. Stop beating him.

189
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,700
No, I refuse to talk.

190
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,370
You refuse to talk, huh?

191
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:13,890
Stop it!

192
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,580
I won't tell you!

193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,650
Are you going to talk or not?

194
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,370
I won't tell you!

195
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,980
You three against me alone.

196
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,730
How despicable!

197
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,490
When I rise as General,

198
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,580
I'll have you all killed!

199
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,770
Even the Marquis of Pingjin has returned.

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,220
Why is our master still not back?

201
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,010
He should be back soon, I suppose.

202
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,460
It must be the seniors returning.

203
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,130
Zhinu,

204
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,300
I'll go out to stall them.

205
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,100
Gousheng.

206
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,460
You take care of things here.

207
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,130
Let's go.

208
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,700
Let's go.

209
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,340
My mother made this.

210
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:07,890
Eat up.

211
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,010
You definitely haven't had

212
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,060
something this delicious.

213
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,530
I won't...

214
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,100
What do you think?

215
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,100
The ingredients are low-quality

216
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,340
and unrefined,

217
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,610
but...

218
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,530
but the flavor is acceptable.

219
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,580
I don't know you,

220
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,010
nor do I wish to bully you.

221
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,730
I only have some questions.

222
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,940
Answer me,

223
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,010
and I'll let you go.

224
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,490
Then tend to my wounds first.

225
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,700
On our way back to the Capital,

226
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,300
I heard people say

227
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,010
that the Fengshan Altar collapsed.

228
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,130
Fengshan Altar collapsed?

229
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,700
Yes.

230
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,300
Your father won't be coming back.

231
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,890
When the Fengshan Altar collapsed,

232
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,340
everyone from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

233
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,730
was buried underground.

234
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,980
You're lying.

235
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,300
My father built the Fengshan Altar.

236
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,010
There's no way it could collapse.

237
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,980
He's the best geomancer in Great Yong.

238
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,610
Geomancers are only human, after all.

239
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,100
The Fengshan Altar did collapse.

240
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,420
According to my father's men,

241
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,610
all the workers who built it

242
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,890
were buried underground

243
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,530
and died.

244
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,220
Nonsense!

245
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,890
My father didn't die.

246
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,060
He surely didn't!

247
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,890
It's a little tiger.

248
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,060
Did you really think I'd forget?

249
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,940
I'll always keep my promise to you.

250
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,770
What did you see

251
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,610
while stargazing tonight?

252
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,300
My seniors told me

253
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,580
there would be meteors in the Seven Mansions of the Eastern Azure Dragon,

254
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,730
but after I got here,

255
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,050
I didn't see a single one.

256
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,490
It's all right.

257
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,530
Those are meteors from the Heart Mansion.

258
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,180
Just wait until next year.

259
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,290
If you're patient,

260
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,660
you'll definitely get to see them.

261
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,250
But when I stargaze next year,

262
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,250
you won't be here with me anymore.

263
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,700
When I'm not home,

264
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,770
listen to your mother,

265
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,290
look after your sister,

266
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,940
and when I return,

267
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,900
I'll make you a bigger one.

268
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,730
All right?

269
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,620
Besides practicing what I've taught you

270
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,290
about geomancy and construction,

271
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,900
stay diligent in your studies.

272
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,180
Read regularly, work on your calligraphy,

273
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,490
and if there's anything you don't understand, ask your mother.

274
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,460
Since you're leaving tomorrow,

275
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,700
why don't you

276
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,330
come with me to take a look

277
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,420
at my big project?

278
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,770
Let's go.

279
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,090
Father, look.

280
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,010
When

281
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,530
did you dig

282
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,570
such a huge cellar here?

283
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,180
It didn't take long.

284
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,770
I used the techniques you taught me

285
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,810
and finished it quickly.

286
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,090
I even dug a tunnel from here

287
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,530
to the kitchen.

288
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,050
It's right behind the water bucket.

289
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,940
So that's why food

290
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,700
kept disappearing from the kitchen lately.

291
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,250
It was you all along.

292
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,660
Don't tell my mother about this.

293
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,380
I'm going to dig

294
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,700
lots of secret tunnels

295
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,290
to different places.

296
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,940
I'll stash food and water

297
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,380
in the cellar,

298
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,980
and when she tries to punish me,

299
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,050
I'll hide down there

300
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,180
for a couple of days.

301
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,380
This really is a massive project.

302
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,290
By the time you get back,

303
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,180
it'll definitely be finished.

304
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,900
Then you can see

305
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,860
if I'm cut out

306
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,700
to be a qualified Calendrical Official in the Five Offices.

307
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,380
You've still got a long way to go.

308
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,860
First, promise me

309
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,380
you won't bring the house down

310
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,330
while digging tunnels.

311
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,250
Help...

312
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,420
Mother!

313
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,770
Mother!

314
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,620
No wonder the Marquis's people

315
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,700
have been looking for him in the streets.

316
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,980
Turns out you were hiding him here.

317
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,090
Mother,

318
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,380
I didn't suffocate him.

319
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,570
How did he end up like this?

320
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,090
Shut up.

321
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,730
He was badly injured,

322
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,940
yet you still had him tied up.

323
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,180
That's just downright reckless.

324
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,290
This kid was lucky

325
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:57,980
to survive today.

326
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,980
I'll send him home

327
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,980
and apologize to his family.

328
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,810
But his father is the Marquis of Pingjin.

329
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,810
He'll definitely tell on us.

330
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,010
Only cowards

331
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,980
go crying to grown-ups.

332
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,940
Once I've recovered,

333
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,940
I'm coming back to settle this.

334
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,420
Come, I'll take you home.

335
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,460
Come now.

336
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,220
You three really crossed the line.

337
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,050
No one's getting off easy.

338
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,380
Guanfeng,

339
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,810
go to the back mountain and chop ten days' worth of firewood.

340
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,530
No coming back till it's done.

341
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,620
Gousheng,

342
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,770
you shall clean the latrines for a full month.

343
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,940
No slacking off.

344
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,530
As for you,

345
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,770
seal off all those tunnels.

346
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,730
And no more playing underground from now on.

347
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,620
Mother,

348
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,980
you can punish me however you want,

349
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,330
but please don't make me block the tunnels.

350
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,660
I meant to show Father those tunnels.

351
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,620
It was him.

352
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,420
He was the one who said Father was buried underground,

353
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,290
that's why I…

354
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,140
You're spouting complete nonsense.

355
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,290
Let's go.

356
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,770
What are you doing, Zhinu?

357
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,620
Go away!

358
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,730
Have some candies, Zhinu.

359
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,180
I'm not eating your stuff,

360
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,290
you little tattletale!

361
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,380
I'm sorry, Zhinu.

362
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:53,860
Father!

363
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,090
Zhinu.

364
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,810
Father,

365
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,980
you are back.

366
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,090
I thought you were dead.

367
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,290
It's all right.

368
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,770
I'm back, aren't I?

369
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,980
As long as you're back,

370
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,140
that's what matters.

371
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,250
Hurry up and pack your things.

372
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,900
Gather everyone.

373
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,460
We're leaving the Capital tonight.

374
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,140
We're leaving tonight?

375
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,380
What happened?

376
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,530
No time to explain now.

377
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,090
I'll tell you everything on the way.

378
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,570
Go

379
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,380
and wake up Yuenu first.

380
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,860
All right.

381
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,140
Hurry, Zhinu.

382
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,250
Wake everyone up.

383
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:57,900
Go now.

384
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,490
Be quick.

385
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,490
Yuenu,

386
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,330
wake up.

387
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,730
Come here.

388
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,420
I will hold you.

389
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,620
Mother,

390
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,620
what's the matter?

391
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,810
Your father's back.

392
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,170
Father's back?

393
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,470
Wake up!

394
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,680
Wake up!

395
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,930
My father's back!

396
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,760
Gousheng!

397
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,770
Gousheng, wake up now!

398
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:21,910
Master?

399
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,260
- Get up! - Master's back.

400
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,170
- What's going on? - Get up.

401
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,030
It's the middle of the night.

402
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,140
Gousheng, my father...

403
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,090
My father has returned.

404
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,380
Master.

405
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:28,890
Master.

406
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,520
- Master. - You are back.

407
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,680
- Master. - Are you all up?

408
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,570
Everyone, pack up quickly.

409
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,620
We need to leave here tonight.

410
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,700
Where are we going?

411
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,490
Who's up there?

412
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,860
Run!

413
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,290
Take your sister to the haystack in the backyard

414
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:21,810
and hide there.

415
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,730
Don't come out

416
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,090
unless I say so.

417
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,560
Mother,

418
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,570
is it because of me?

419
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,600
I made the mistake,

420
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,460
so I'll own up to it.

421
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,050
Good kid,

422
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,620
it's not your fault.

423
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,700
Go now.

424
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,570
Hurry and go!

425
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,250
Hurry.

426
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,010
Let's go.

427
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,330
Yuenu, hide inside.

428
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,730
Stay put and don't make a sound.

429
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,810
I'll go check what's going on.

430
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,860
Wait for me.

431
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,050
Mr. Kuai,

432
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,010
it's been a while.

433
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,220
My Lord, we weren't expecting your visit.

434
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,730
Forgive me for not receiving you properly.

435
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,810
You were appointed by the court

436
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,460
to oversee the construction of the Fengshan Altar.

437
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,810
Why have you returned to the Capital without permission?

438
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,010
I am guilty.

439
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,980
Are you guilty

440
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,380
of the Fengshan Altar's collapse

441
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,770
or of taking something

442
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,420
that never belonged to you?

443
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,140
I

444
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,460
do not understand what you are trying to say, My Lord.

445
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,330
Word has it you're blessed

446
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,380
with both a son and a daughter.

447
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,380
Qu Jiao,

448
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,420
go find them now.

449
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,180
Perhaps once the children are brought before him,

450
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,980
Mr. Kuai will understand

451
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,770
what I mean.

452
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,620
Yes, My Lord.

453
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,530
I plead guilty,

454
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,530
but it is for the court to punish me.

455
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,420
I represent the court.

456
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,730
Hand it over,

457
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,290
and I'll spare your life.

458
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,860
I'm not sure what you want from me.

459
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,180
Then don't say

460
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,250
I didn't warn you.

461
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,940
Qu Jiao!

462
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,220
No!

463
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,380
Run!

464
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,090
Where did you hide it?

465
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,050
Take my life if you want.

466
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,860
But spare these kids.

467
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,810
They're innocent.

468
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,260
So brave of you to face death head-on.

469
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,530
I won't kill you,

470
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,420
but can you bear to watch them all die,

471
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,050
one by one, because of you?

472
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,010
Zhuang Luyin!

473
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,730
Hurry up and hide!

474
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,250
Are you Kuai Duo's daughter?

475
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,220
Come.

476
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,250
I'll take you to see your parents.

477
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,330
My Lord.

478
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,160
Yuenu.

479
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,330
Father, Mother.

480
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,420
Yuenu.

481
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,060
Kuai Duo,

482
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,220
what's the point?

483
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,380
The Fengshan Altar incident

484
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,660
already sealed your fate.

485
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,460
What I want

486
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,380
is the item you took from Dongxia.

487
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,940
Hand it over,

488
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,620
and I'll plead your case before His Majesty.

489
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,660
If you really meant that,

490
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,010
why would you kill so many people?

491
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,330
Their lives are worthless anyway.

492
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,980
You can always recruit new ones.

493
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,290
But if you keep resisting...

494
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,220
Mother.

495
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,980
It won't

496
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,140
just be the disciples who end up dead.

497
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,660
If you still won't talk,

498
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,510
I'll kill your son first,

499
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,330
and then your daughter.

500
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,090
Don't kill him.

501
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,660
He's only my disciple.

502
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,860
We know you have

503
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,810
a ten-year-old son.

504
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,530
Kid,

505
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,380
is he your father?

506
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,180
Father, Mother,

507
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,660
I have no fear of death.

508
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,980
No!

509
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,180
No!

510
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,620
No!

511
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,050
No!

512
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,250
Father!

513
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,290
Don't kill him.

514
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,810
Now,

515
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,380
you only have one daughter left.

516
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,250
Kuai Duo.

517
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,700
Father, Mother.

518
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,220
Yuenu.

519
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,530
Yuenu,

520
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,380
be good.

521
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,770
Don't be afraid.

522
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,140
Yuenu,

523
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,730
I'm here.

524
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,220
I'm so sorry.

525
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,710
Yuenu!

526
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,560
Yuenu, my daughter!

527
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,700
Yue...

528
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,730
Yue...

529
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,860
Now all you have left is your wife.

530
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,260
I will take her back

531
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,740
and cut off her fingers one by one.

532
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,380
When that happens,

533
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,130
will you still be able to stay silent?

534
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,380
Shangxian!

535
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,570
My dear.

536
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,490
Shangxian.

537
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:57,170
Don't let them have their way.

538
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,490
Shangxian.

539
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,780
Mother.

540
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,650
The thing you're looking for

541
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,210
was indeed taken by me,

542
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,090
but even if you turn this place

543
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,210
upside down,

544
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,340
you won't find it.

545
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,570
Zhuang Luyin,

546
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,610
you will never get it!

547
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,460
Don't let him…

548
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,090
Father.

549
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,380
Stay alive.

550
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,130
My Lord,

551
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,900
this place

552
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,690
has been under watch all night.

553
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,980
Since Kuai Duo returned,

554
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,610
he hasn't had time to hide anything.

555
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,460
Search him.

556
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,010
Yes, My Lord.

557
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,780
My Lord,

558
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,780
dawn is approaching.

559
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,530
You know what to do.

560
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,130
Yes, My Lord.

561
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,010
Find all the valuables

562
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,380
and take them away.

563
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,490
- Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

564
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,130
Set the place on fire.
