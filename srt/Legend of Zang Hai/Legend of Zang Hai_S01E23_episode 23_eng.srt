00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,776
   

4
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,680
Eldest Young Master, apologies for not greeting you sooner.

5
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,700
What were you doing? Why didn't you announce Eldest Young Master's arrival?

6
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,950
My apologies, sir.

7
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,950
You seemed busy, so I told him to stay quiet.

8
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,500
You're...?

9
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,680
   

10
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,540
It's nothing important. Just a sketch to keep my hands practicing.

11
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,020
Here. Take these to the study.

12
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,460
Eldest Young Master?

13
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,230
I came by today to see if you'd join me for some drinks and music.

14
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,010
You've been working nonstop. You need some relaxation.

15
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,150
You may not know this, but my alcohol tolerance is very low.

16
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,460
Even a sip gets me drunk, and once I'm drunk,

17
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,000
I ramble and say all the things I shouldn't say.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
Let's just enjoy the music. Skip the drinks.

19
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,870
Fair enough. Just the music.

20
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,000
I promise you won't get even a sip of alcohol.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,560
Come on. Let's go.

22
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,800
   

23
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,370
Where was I?

24
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,870
- You've already said too much. 
 - No, don't interrupt.

25
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,330
I remember now. Yes...

26
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,900
That Chu Huaiming! That bastard... He made my life miserable...

27
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,750
Zang Hai, my friend, your alcohol tolerance really is...

28
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,750
Official Zang... Official Zang...

29
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,090
- Why did you drink so much? 
 - Come on. Help your master inside to rest.

30
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,360
Official Zhuang, it's so late. Shall I send someone to escort you home?

31
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,140
No need. I'm exhausted, too.

32
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,550
I'll just stay here tonight. Find me a room later.

33
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,200
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,460
- Official Zang, come on. 
 - Where are we going?

35
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,780
Back to your room. Easy now.

36
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,000
- Where are we going? 
 - To your room, sir.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,110
Take it slow.

38
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,034
   

39
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,660
Official Zhuang has worked hard. Take him to rest.

40
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,340
Yes, sir.

41
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,870
Father, this looks like the structure of some kind of box,

42
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,510
along with instructions for disabling its mechanism.

43
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,660
And the thing to the side is a bronze fish.

44
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:28,810
Indeed. Zhuang Luyin even told Zang Hai about the bronze fish.

45
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,270
It really is connected to the Gui Seal.

46
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,650
This...

47
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,950
Could it be that Zhuang Luyin already has the seal?

48
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,390
What will you do, Father?

49
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,560
This time, I'm going to confirm it myself.

50
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,000
Xiao Hai, Zhuang Zhifu sent word.

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,400
He's inviting you to lunch tomorrow at Zuichun Pavilion.

52
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,000
Brother Zang Hai,

53
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,800
this here is Zuichun Pavilion's newest fine wine.

54
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,410
It's smooth and rich. You've got to give it a proper try.

55
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,870
Today is a joyous day.

56
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,120
We can't go home until we're drunk.

57
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,730
Here.

58
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,900
Thank you, Eldest Young Master. I'll listen to you.

59
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,610
Cheers.

60
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,470
- What do you think? 
 - It's excellent.

61
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,350
Since you like it, have a few more cups. Come on.

62
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,930
Please.

63
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,650
Great! One more.

64
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,590
Eldest Young Master, maybe we should have some food first.

65
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,150
Brother Zang Hai, if you want to stay in everyone's good graces at court,

66
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,240
you'll need to learn to hold your liquor.

67
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,510
So, today, let me help you train.

68
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,100
Zang Hai.

69
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,480
You're drunk.

70
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,050
No, you're drunk.

71
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,920
Did you find that thing my father asked you to find?

72
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,120
What thing?

73
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,870
I thought that after the past few days, we were already friends.

74
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,850
Friends?

75
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,020
Wasn't it your mother who went to the Marquis to speak ill of me?

76
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,150
Didn't you two try to get me kicked out?

77
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,640
Don't think I don't know.

78
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,630
You really dare say that to my face?

79
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,430
Why wouldn't I? Why wouldn't I?

80
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,550
Let me tell you! Do you have any idea how much the Marquis values me now?

81
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,440
I'm more capable than any of you ever imagined.

82
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,120
Come on.

83
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,410
Brother, I admit it.

84
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,920
Being close with Yang Zhen and the others made me somewhat biased against you.

85
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,190
But we have to look ahead, right?

86
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:52,180
Honestly, I'm just like my father â€“ I admire you so much.

87
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,750
From now on, we'll only grow closer.

88
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:00,550
I really hope you'll treat me as a friend you can speak freely to.

89
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,970
A friend I can say anything to...

90
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,910
I'm so glad you see me...

91
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,940
as a friend.

92
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,620
So, Brother Zang, tell me.

93
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,430
Did you find that thing my father asked you to find?

94
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,910
The Gui Seal? You mean the Gui Seal?

95
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,200
The Marquis indeed mentioned it.

96
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,490
He said he went through so much just to track it down.

97
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,490
He said that with the Gui Seal,

98
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,980
anything's possible.

99
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,200
Anything's possible...

100
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,450
Hey, don't pass out!

101
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,120
So, did you find it or not? Where is it?

102
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,780
Did I find it? No...

103
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,900
Zang Hai. Don't go, Zang Hai. Come back here.

104
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,630
Careful.

105
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,206
What's wrong?

106
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:22,080
I can't. I can't say...

107
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,120
The Marquis told me never to tell outsiders.

108
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,640
Outsiders? Am I an outsider?

109
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,900
I swear I won't tell a soul. All right?

110
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,830
Hey.

111
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,900
I bet Father never told you anything.

112
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,420
You think he values it? No way!

113
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,040
Nonsense!

114
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,250
Come here.

115
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,470
Come closer!

116
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:12,890
The thing is in the underground vault of the Marquis's treasury.

117
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,350
Zang Hai?

118
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,480
Zang Hai?

119
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,660
Zang Hai?

120
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,350
Sir.

121
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,580
Sir.

122
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,630
Did you hear all that?

123
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,810
I got him to talk.

124
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,910
He said the Marquis found the Gui Seal

125
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,450
and hid it in the treasury of the Marquis' residence.

126
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,830
You didn't know?

127
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,710
So, the Marquis never told you?

128
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,550
I've never heard my father mention that.

129
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,330
Zhifu,

130
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,270
there's something you need to know.

131
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:34,900
What he just said is your father's biggest secret.

132
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,390
Your father told him all of these secrets.

133
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:46,120
That makes him your father's true confidant.

134
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,630
But now, he's chosen to side with your younger brother.

135
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,000
What does that tell you?

136
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,590
As long as he's around, Zhuang Zhixing will be the heir of the Zhuang household.

137
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,500
Impossible!

138
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,480
I'm the rightful heir. I'm the son of my father's principal wife!

139
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,290
Your mother, Jiang Xiang, may remain in favor,

140
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,380
but it's not what it once was.

141
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,360
How much can she do for you now?

142
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,830
Jiang Xiang...

143
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,850
Jiang Xiang killed Shen.

144
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,200
What are you talking about?

145
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,480
I'm not making it up. Everyone knows.

146
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,320
Even Zhuang Zhixing knows.

147
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,440
No... No.

148
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,020
Zhifu, how about this?

149
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:51,250
Zang Hai may have sided with your brother, but I can side with you.

150
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,750
Kill him, and I'll guarantee your wealth and power.

151
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,420
What do you say?

152
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:15,640
As long as you kill him, Zhuang Zhixing will go back to his old self.

153
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,630
On his own, he's no threat.

154
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,360
And the position as the Zhuang family's head will surely be yours.

155
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,300
What are you waiting for?

156
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,720
I... I'm sorry!

157
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,810
Eldest Young Master...

158
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,560
Eldest Young Master...

159
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,050
Why... Why...

160
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,250
Good boy. From now on, I'll do everything in my power to help you.

161
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,730
Hang in there.

162
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,210
Father!

163
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,180
Father.

164
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,580
Someone rescued Zang Hai.

165
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,310
Did you see who?

166
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,530
His guard.

167
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,200
So, Zang Hai didn't die.

168
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,250
That complicates things.

169
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,830
Sir, what do you mean?

170
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,550
Official Zhuang, you're not only corrupt,

171
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,260
but you also tried to kill a court official.

172
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,530
- No, I didn't. 
 - Guards.

173
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,690
What are you doing?

174
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,030
Since you won't admit it,

175
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:49,340
just wait for the Imperial Surveillance Office to get to the bottom of things.

176
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,540
Come with us.

177
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,480
Sir... I already did everything you told me to do!

178
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,180
Shut up!

179
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,750
Shi Lei, drive us, now!

180
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,350
Got it.

181
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,640
Master is tailing Cao Jingxian as planned.

182
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,110
We should head back and stop the bleeding.

183
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,340
We can't go back. I can still hold on.

184
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,560
You won't last much longer. You'll bleed to death!

185
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,750
We can't change the plan. Take me to the Marquis Residence.

186
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,720
Xiao Hai, are you insane? You'll die!

187
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,680
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

188
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,040
Take me to the Marquis Residence!

189
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,440
Shi Lei, to the Marquis Residence.

190
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,010
Got it.

191
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,740
My Lord! My Lord! My Lord!

192
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,750
- What's wrong? Why the panic? 
 - Something happened!

193
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,930
Why are you bleeding?

194
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,000
This isn't my blood.

195
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,460
It's Official Zang's. He's badly hurt.

196
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,590
Zang Hai!

197
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,580
Stop standing around. Get a physician!

198
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,240
Yes, My Lord.

199
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,780
What happened?

200
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,190
My Lord... I can't hold on much longer,

201
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,450
but there's something I must tell you.

202
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,200
The one who tried to kill me today... was...

203
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,210
Who was it?

204
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,060
It was...

205
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,430
Eldest Young Master.

206
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,650
Zhifu tried to kill you?

207
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,580
He invited me to lunch.

208
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,640
Then he suddenly attacked me.

209
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,580
Then... Cao Jingxian showed up.

210
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,820
Cao Jingxian?

211
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,720
Cao Jingxian must have some leverage over Eldest Young Master

212
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,520
so he was forced to attack me.

213
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,880
Eldest Young Master must be in danger now.

214
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,350
Hurry... Go save him!

215
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,320
Zang Hai. Zang Hai!

216
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,820
You can't die now.

217
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,860
Hang in there!

218
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,060
Zang Hai? Zang Hai! Where's the physician?

219
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,030
My Lord.

220
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,570
Come in.

221
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,540
My Lord, the Imperial Surveillance Office still won't release him.

222
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,340
Zhuang Shan, go summon two people for me:

223
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,700
Xu Daishan, the Deputy Censor-in-Chief of the Censorate,

224
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,080
and Qi Ming, the Assistant Censor.

225
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,570
Understood.

226
00:22:52,820 --> 00:23:00,880
Xu Daishan and Qi Ming have been visiting the Marquis Residence frequently.

227
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,960
They and the Marquis of Pingjin are very close now.

228
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,090
Father, the Marquis's birthday is in a few days

229
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,960
I've heard he's planning a grand banquet.

230
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,930
And this time, he's invited many officials who don't see eye to eye with you.

231
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,790
Looks like the past doesn't matter to him anymore.

232
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:25,360
Now that he has the Gui Seal, he's ready to move against me.

233
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,990
   

234
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,560
Master...

235
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,190
Master.

236
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,680
Boy, you're finally awake.

237
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,630
Once your condition stabilized, the Marquis had you sent back.

238
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,280
You've been out for days.

239
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,460
Easy now.

240
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,480
Here, Xiao Hai.

241
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,490
Take it slow.

242
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,960
Master, how are things at the Marquis Residence?

243
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,610
Zhuang Zhifu got detained by the Imperial Surveillance Office that day

244
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,100
and hasn't returned since.

245
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,150
The Marquis of Pingjin has invited his allies from the Censorate to the residence.

246
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,840
Looks like he's rallying support from officials to impeach Cao Jingxian.

247
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,350
So, he believed me.

248
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,880
Your act really caught him off guard.

249
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,590
Only by doing this

250
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,960
will the Marquis of Pingjin believe me, no matter what I say.

251
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,960
I think Cao Jingxian already knows...

252
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,310
the Marquis is coming for him.

253
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:15,680
 â™ª When will the green mountains be gone? â™ª 

254
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:24,720
 â™ª How many people are buried here? â™ª 

255
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:34,440
 â™ª Who will sweep the lonely graves? â™ª 

256
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:56,630
 â™ª Wind sends joss paper from the neighboring graves â™ª 

257
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,340
   

258
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,310
Cao Jingxian learned from me that the Gui Seal was hidden in the Marquis's treasury.

259
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,400
Given his nature, he'll want to strike first.

260
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,960
If I were him, and I needed to take down the Marquis

261
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,920
while also finding the seal,

262
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:25,150
I'd need help from someone. And this person would need to know what happened back then.

263
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:29,960
That person is very likely my third enemy.

264
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,030
Shi Lei and I will keep watch on the Cao Residence.

265
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,050
We'll alert you as soon as Cao Jingxian makes a move.

266
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,590
You hungry?

267
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,000
I've had food prepared for you for a while.

268
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,680
I'll go get it.

269
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,790
Xiao Hai.

270
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,190
Xiao Hai!

271
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,650
Cao Jingxian finally left his residence.

272
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,640
I've sent Shi Lei to tail him.

273
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,510
The Marquis of Pingjin has forced his hand.

274
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,210
I'm going after him.

275
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,310
You're still recovering.

276
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,750
No time to worry about that.

277
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,210
Wait... At least put on more clothes!

278
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,651
   

279
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,157
   

280
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,880
Sir, wh-what is this place?

281
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,530
It's the residence that the officials have given to a hostage.

282
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,750
So, your third enemy l-lives here, too?

283
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,510
I can't say for sure.

284
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,970
I'll only know if I get inside.

285
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,350
But there are so many Surveillance Officers outside.

286
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,470
How are we supposed to get in?

287
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,690
Hey.

288
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,160
What... What are you doing?

289
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,070
The land route is blocked,

290
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,200
so I'll go in through the water.

291
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
I know the city's layout.

292
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,310
There's an underground channel that leads to the residence.

293
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,420
- But sir... 
 - Shi Lei, wait for me here.

294
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,980
 Your Highness, I came tonight to discuss something important. 

295
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,960
 I know where the Gui Seal is already. 

296
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,750
 I'm willing to tell you everything, but... 

297
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,880
 you must honor our agreement. 

298
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,440
 If you're here to see me before even getting the seal, 

299
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,030
 it must be hidden somewhere that's giving you trouble. 

300
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,310
 You're sharp as ever, Your Highness. 

301
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:32,550
 To be frank, I'm indeed not fully confident I can retrieve it. 

302
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:37,400
 But I'm willing to be open with you. 

303
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,100
Let's talk and see how we can both come out ahead.

304
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,680
Sure.

305
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,720
We'll stick to our deal.

306
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Then could you tell me

307
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,750
how to use this Gui Seal, Your Highness?

308
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,260
You'll know when we get it.

309
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:03,790
I'm certain the Gui Seal is in the Marquis's hands.

310
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,880
It's hidden beneath his treasury.

311
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,750
 Zhuang Luyin is hosting a banquet the night after tomorrow. 

312
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,310
 I plan to show up uninvited. 

313
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:18,030
If we work together,

314
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,180
getting the seal will be easy.

315
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,290
 Aren't you afraid I'll disappear with it once I have it? 

316
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,960
 Surely you jest, Your Highness. 

317
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,830
 You're a royal hostage from Dongxia. 

318
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,590
What will happen if you vanish?

319
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:42,790
I think you know that better than I do.

320
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,030
 Since it was I who came to you back then, 

321
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,070
 of course I'd come prepared. 

322
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:54,700
 As long as the seal is in our hands, everything is negotiable. 

323
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:00,440
I've searched for it long enough.

324
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,490
I can't wait any longer.

325
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,480
I'm out.

326
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,020
Sir! Are you all right?

327
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,140
So, the third person is the hostage princess from Dongxia?

328
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,440
They say she hasn't left her mansion over the past ten years.

329
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
No one's even seen her face.

330
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,440
She arrived in the capital the day before your family fell.

331
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,980
But she was only ten back then.

332
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,770
History has no shortage of prodigies

333
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,650
who outsmart adults from a young age.

334
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,780
Besides, I heard their conversation clearly.

335
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,820
It makes sense.

336
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,970
The Gui Seal is Dongxia's greatest treasure.

337
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,760
Your father took it from Dongxia.

338
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,590
She has no reason not to look for it.

339
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,990
Here.

340
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,850
Since Cao Jingxian has decided to act, she won't stand by and watch.

341
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:57,110
She won't let him take the Gui Seal alone.

342
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,510
Therefore, she'll show up.

343
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,590
I'll keep watch there,

344
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,610
waiting for my enemies.

345
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,780
Two!

346
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,700
Three!

347
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,630
Four!

348
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,490
Five!

349
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,440
Six!

350
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,280
Seven!

351
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,030
Eight!

352
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,530
Sir, someone's here to see you.

353
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,060
Keep going!

354
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,050
One!

355
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,380
Two!

356
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,730
Three!

357
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,820
What brings you here to see me today?

358
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,650
I have something very important to tell you.

359
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,000
You're off duty tomorrow, right?

360
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,150
Yes.

361
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,740
It's Father's birthday tomorrow. I've prepared a gift.

362
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,240
What's wrong?

363
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,650
Tomorrow night, the Marquis is hosting a banquet for many close allies

364
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,780
to discuss impeaching Cao Jingxian.

365
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,010
And Cao Jingxian has already caught wind of it.

366
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,550
He'll definitely show up.

367
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,110
What's going to happen?

368
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:20,320
Knowing your father and Cao Jingxian, there will be a clash.

369
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,110
What do you want me to do?

370
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:30,450
Tell me. How's your relationship with your men these days?

371
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,940
If I want you to return to the Marquis residence to rescue your father tomorrow night,

372
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,860
will they assist you?

373
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,700
They follow my lead now.

374
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,280
It shouldn't be a problem.

375
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,780
Good.

376
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,260
Then I want you to gather your men and charge back to the residence tomorrow night.

377
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:53,410
Only in a moment of true crisis like this will your father see your worth.

378
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,890
It'll mean thousands more than any birthday gift.

379
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,880
I'm not asking you to do this out of filial duty.

380
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,810
But rather for your own sake.

381
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,450
Zhuang Zhifu's situation is dire now.

382
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:16,090
This is your best chance.

383
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,320
When do we move?

384
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,210
Wait for my signal.

385
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,995
   

386
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,180
Wait here.

387
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,640
Yes, sir.

388
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,450
Miss Xiang, your swordsmanship is truly impressive.

389
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,360
What brings you here?

390
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,480
I just felt like taking a walk today.

391
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,550
And somehow, I ended up here at Zhen Tower.

392
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,920
What a coincidence.

393
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,160
If you hadn't come to find me, I was going to head over to find you.

394
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,960
Do you have something to say to me?

395
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,720
Last time, I said you'd have to trade your secret for mine.

396
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,110
But I've changed my mind.

397
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:17,010
I can tell you everything without you needing to reveal anything to me.

398
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,590
You're not curious anymore?

399
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,360
Friends shouldn't keep secrets from each other anyway.

400
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,400
Tomorrow night at Xu hour, meet me at Qingque Bridge outside the city.

401
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,530
Tomorrow night?

402
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,510
I'm here now, Miss Xiang.

403
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,030
Why not tell me today?

404
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,550
Today's not a good time.

405
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,050
I'll tell you everything after I see you tomorrow night.

406
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,590
But...

407
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,260
But tomorrow night is the Marquis's birthday banquet.

408
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,150
So what if the Marquis of Pingjin has a birthday?

409
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,670
It's not like he won't celebrate it next year.

410
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,590
Are you hoping to make more powerful friends at the banquet?

411
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,550
I warned you, didn't I?

412
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,790
The people I dislike most in the capital are officials.

413
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,700
You've misunderstood, Miss Xiang.

414
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,230
The Marquis helped me once in court.

415
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,230
He was kind to me.

416
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:19,000
So I can't skip his banquet.

417
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,110
Seriously, Zang Hai?

418
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,700
I agreed to tell you my secret, yet you won't accept that kindness?

419
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,360
The Marquis has helped you, but haven't I done a lot for you, too?

420
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,280
If you're willing to share your secret,

421
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,790
it means you truly see me as a friend.

422
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,150
How about this?

423
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,440
Wait for me a little longer tomorrow night.

424
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,780
We can talk later.

425
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,160
Don't even think about it.

426
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,670
If you're not there by Xu hour, you'll never hear that secret.

427
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,710
All right.

428
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,360
You have my word.

429
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,000
Then it's settled.

430
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,670
See you tomorrow night.

431
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,740
Miss, are you really going to tell him?

432
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,800
There's no point in hiding it anymore.

433
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,510
You'll go in my place.

434
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,410
There will be a brutal clash at the Marquis's banquet tomorrow.

435
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,220
I want him far away from it and out of harm's way.

436
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,510
Stay by his side.

437
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,110
Whatever happens, don't let him leave.

438
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,610
No, I need to protect you.

439
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,520
Once it's over, I'll go and meet him.

440
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,230
   

441
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:00,380
Tonight's going to be brutal.

442
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,480
You're my most trusted men.

443
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,860
I've taken care of you for years.

444
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,440
Now it's time for you to repay me.

445
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,130
 - We pledge our lives to you, sir! 
 - We pledge our lives to you, sir! 

446
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,840
Lu Yan.

447
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,320
The Dongxia hostage will surely show up.

448
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,550
Stay close to her.

449
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,130
Understood.

450
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,190
Shi Lei, do you remember everything I said?

451
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:24,530
Guan Feng, don't mess up your part.

452
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,150
Master, I'm heading out.

453
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,670
Be careful.

454
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,010
We'll stick to the plan.

455
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:40,100
Guan Feng, when you see her, tell her I got drunk at the banquet.

456
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,860
Tell her not to wait for me.

457
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,420
You got it.

458
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,000
Go.
