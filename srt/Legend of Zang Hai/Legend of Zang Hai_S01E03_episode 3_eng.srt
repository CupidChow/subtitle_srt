00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,819
   

4
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,100
Master.

5
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,080
Have you memorized everything?

6
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,810
Yes, I have.

7
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,350
Once you arrive in the capital, go to Zhen Tower.

8
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,750
Someone will meet you there.

9
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,590
They won't uncover your identity so easily.

10
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,190
I'll erase all traces of you here.

11
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,310
Master,

12
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,880
there's something I've always wanted to ask you.

13
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,070
You saw the mark on my hand years ago.

14
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,150
Why didn't you ask then?

15
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,580
I...

16
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,010
I didn't dare.

17
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,960
All these years, you must've really wanted to know

18
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,970
who your savior and masters really were.

19
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,590
But none of that matters.

20
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,280
All you need to do is remember that

21
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,800
ever since the night you were rescued,

22
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,690
we've all lived for your sake.

23
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,590
If you insist on knowing,

24
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,380
ask Gao Ming next time you see him.

25
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,160
Now go.

26
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,840
Master, take care.

27
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,850
Until we meet again.

28
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,870
Do as I instructed.

29
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,810
Once it's done, you should all leave.

30
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,070
 What's this? 

31
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,920
 A trap mechanism. 

32
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,900
 And this? 

33
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,390
 A crossbow. 

34
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:43,560
   

35
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,120
"With one stroke of the wine boat, all is emptied."

36
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,750
"Who says we won't meet again?"

37
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,190
Zhinu,

38
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,700
thank you.

39
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,418
   

40
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,826
   

41
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,582
   

42
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:22,247
   

43
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,390
Step right up, everyone.

44
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,800
All of you first-time visitors of the capital,

45
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,830
Zhen Tower is a must-visit!

46
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,800
That's right!

47
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,740
Here, not only do we have food, drinks, and fun...

48
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,030
As well as things to amuse you...

49
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,840
...there are also the shadow plays by the Young Master Eight at the Moonview Pavilion.

50
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,790
- You don't want to miss them. 
 - You don't want to miss them.

51
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,670
Are you curious about capital gossip?

52
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,670
- Or court secrets? 
 - Here,

53
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,050
- we have everything you need. 
 - we have everything you need

54
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,600
Come in, everyone.

55
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,460
- This way, please. 
 - Young Master...

56
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,860
- You have to catch Young Master Eight's shadow plays. 
 - Welcome.

57
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,990
- This way, please! 
 - Step right in, everyone.

58
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,010
 Come here, come here! 

59
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,180
 There's good food over there! 

60
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,050
 Sit down! 

61
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,030
 Over here! 

62
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,220
 Over here. 

63
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,230
- Look at this. 
 - Wow, it's beautiful.

64
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,040
Let's look over there!

65
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,470
 All top-quality goods! 

66
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,060
 Right this way. 

67
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,390
   

68
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,080
Fire it up!

69
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,460
 That sounds lovely. 

70
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,440
 You're off-key. 
   

71
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,000
Young Master, are you...

72
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,120
A pot of tea, please.

73
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,750
And light the lamp.

74
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,920
You want to light the lamp, Young Master?

75
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,510
Yes. Light it.

76
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,150
One moment, Young Master.

77
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,960
Thank you for waiting, sir.

78
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,590
Your lamp.

79
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,300
Miss, why is this lamp different from all the others?

80
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,200
Sir, you don't know?

81
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,120
I'm new here. I don't know the rules.

82
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,270
Miss, may I ask, what's special about this lamp?

83
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,690
The seat you took is called the Vermilion Bird Head.

84
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,080
It's reserved for the most honored and generous guests of Zhen Tower.

85
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,430
Whoever sits at the Vermilion Bird Head and lights the lamp

86
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,190
is expressing that he will cover the costs for Moonview Pavilion tonight.

87
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,880
Not only must he tip the stage performers,

88
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,020
he must also unilaterally cover tea and drinks for everyone.

89
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,000
Lighting this lamp costs 1,000 liang.

90
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,850
The last person to light it was Prince Yongrong.

91
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,600
Then I won't light it.

92
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,960
And I'll give up the seat.

93
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,330
Excuse me.

94
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,610
Hold on.

95
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,900
Since you've already sat in the Vermilion Bird Head,

96
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,960
you can't walk away just because you say so.

97
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,000
And once the lamp is lit, you can't simply put it out.

98
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,610
To be honest,

99
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,450
I don't have that much money.

100
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,730
This is my all.

101
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,210
Seven liang of silver.

102
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,000
I really can't afford to sit there.

103
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,770
There are seats downstairs. Come with me.

104
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,000
First time in the capital?

105
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,820
Yes.

106
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,770
Here at Zhen Tower, even standing to watch costs money.

107
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,220
The spot you're standing on is five liang.

108
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,930
You just gave me seven.

109
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,360
Should I return the remaining money to you

110
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,140
or explain tonight's play to you?

111
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,610
I'll just take two liang for that since you're a guest.

112
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,670
All right.

113
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,620
Then please explain the play to me.

114
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,620
 Alas... The winds shift and swirl. 

115
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,200
The phoenix has passed on.

116
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,670
That phoenix must be the Empress Dowager.

117
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,440
You're quite clever.

118
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,790
That phoenix is the Empress Dowager who passed away eight days ago.

119
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,670
The dragon represents the late emperor.

120
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,420
And the koi beside it is Dowager Noble Consort Li, his most beloved consort.

121
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,500
 The divine dragon has already united with the koi 

122
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,920
 and ignores the phoenix's plea. 

123
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,490
By rite, the Empress Dowager should be buried with the late emperor,

124
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,850
but he's already interred with Dowager Noble Consort Li.

125
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,270
This difficult dilemma gets thrust onto the current emperor.

126
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,750
Then that golden dragon must be the current emperor.

127
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,550
What about those toads? Who do they represent?

128
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,390
Obviously, the chattering officials.

129
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,870
Look. Don't they match perfectly?

130
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,170
The Emperor has no son.

131
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,250
For years, the ministers have pressured him to name a successor.

132
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,310
Since the Empress Dowager's death, they've grown ever more insistent.

133
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,030
If they aren't writing memorials, then they're kneeling in protest,

134
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,350
and pleading with him to follow tradition

135
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,650
and remove Dowager Noble Consort Li from the imperial mausoleum.

136
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,590
Now the court is split into two:

137
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,750
One faction, led by the Prince of Linzi,

138
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,530
demands that the Empress Dowager's will must be honored,

139
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,610
while the other refuses to yield.

140
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,530
So, the rooster surrounded by the toads is the Prince of Linzi?

141
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,750
He's the Empress Dowager's son.

142
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,270
The burial dispute was brought up by him in court.

143
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,690
He even wants to use this as a reason to return to the capital and watch over her for one year.

144
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,920
The golden dragon flares in anger

145
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,480
and vanishes into the clouds, gone without a trace.

146
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,240
And what's the Emperor's stance?

147
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,270
Didn't you see the dragon fly away?

148
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,390
He's chosen not to take charge of the matter.

149
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,830
The white tiger accepts the duty and moves to quell the unrest.

150
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,170
The croaking toads raise a clamor.

151
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,450
Now only three days remain.

152
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,850
The white tiger is today's lead character, isn't it?

153
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,100
Exactly.

154
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,590
The white tiger represents the Grand Master for Glorious Happiness,

155
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,480
the Marquis of Pingjin.

156
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,880
At first, the people the Emperor assigned to handle the Empress Dowager's burial affairs

157
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,070
were the Ministry of Works and the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

158
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,000
But the Vice Minister of Works, Zhuang Zhifu, is Marquis Pingjin's son.

159
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,480
To protect Zhuang Zhifu,

160
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,620
Marquis Pingjin had no choice but to step in.

161
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,090
Where are you going? The play's not over yet.

162
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,750
I fear something serious is about to happen here.

163
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,420
- Miss, you'd better leave, too. 
 - What is it?

164
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,330
What did you see?

165
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,700
Come.

166
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,440
Do you see that young master to my right?

167
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,190
There's a steel blade hidden in his folding fan.

168
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,480
And the man on my left, who has been writing nonstop,

169
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,490
I'm afraid he's recording evidence of the crime.

170
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,160
- That one? 
 - Don't point.

171
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,510
Look how upright he's sitting.

172
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,000
He's definitely also armed.

173
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,700
Look up on floor two. There are many men keeping watch upstairs as well.

174
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,770
I think they're here to get Young Master Eight.

175
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,190
Them?

176
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,490
Those men?

177
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,170
They're guards from the Imperial Surveillance Office.

178
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,940
They answer to Eunuch Cao.

179
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,660
Eunuch Cao?

180
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,070
Eunuch Cao is the seal-holding eunuch director of the Directorate of Ceremonial.

181
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,210
He commands the Imperial Surveillance Office and is the head of all eunuchs in the world.

182
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,300
Anywhere from government offices to inns and taverns,

183
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,010
his men are everywhere in the capital.

184
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,400
 - Bravo! 
 - Bravo! 

185
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,720
And Young Master Eight dares to tell such a story with the guards right here?

186
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,740
Did you notice the plaque in the main hall when you came in?

187
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,350
"By Imperial Grace and Honor."

188
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,790
That's a jade plaque personally bestowed by the Emperor.

189
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,120
With it here in Zhen Tower,

190
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,000
it's like having an imperial decree guarding the place.

191
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,710
The guards have kept watch for years, but they've never once made a move.

192
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,810
They may not have dared in the past, but today might be different.

193
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,240
Why?

194
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,070
Though Young Master Eight only alludes to the powerful with code names,

195
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,030
he's surely offended quite a few of them.

196
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,400
And today, he's gone for the Emperor himself,

197
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,240
revealing too many secrets from within the palace.

198
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,310
Additionally, Eunuch Cao is deeply trusted by the Emperor,

199
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,110
the guards have perfect reasons to strike.

200
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,770
Even if Zhen Tower has the jade pendant, his actions may still attract his murder.

201
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,400
Then by your logic, Young Master Eight is surrounded by many dangers, but little luck.

202
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,850
Miss, if you know Young Master Eight,

203
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,920
you'd best tell him to leave immediately.

204
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,140
This place is full of agents.

205
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,640
With their skill and methods,

206
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,820
he wouldn't escape even with wings.

207
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,200
You're so clever. Think of something for him.

208
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,580
Me?

209
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,110
What can I possibly do?

210
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,820
This has nothing to do with me.

211
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,500
Nonsense. You could do him a great favor.

212
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,170
- Me? 
 - So, you are Young Master Eight!

213
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,280
What an honor.

214
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,060
Miss, what are you doing?

215
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,240
I'd never seen Young Master Eight's face before.

216
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,550
Turns out you're someone so striking.

217
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,620
Turns out that man on stage isn't really you.

218
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,110
How gracious of you to enjoy the play among us.

219
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,270
Young Master Eight?

220
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,440
- Young Master Eight! 
 - Young Master Eight!

221
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,270
Please, accept my humble salute.

222
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,690
What are you trying to do?

223
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,060
No one's ever seen Young Master Eight.

224
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,590
You're him now. So, run.

225
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,680
- I... 
 - Why don't you write a book?

226
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,280
- We'd love that! 
 - Exactly!

227
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,840
Young Master Eight.

228
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,110
Young Master Eight, where are you going?

229
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,690
 - Don't leave. 
 - Don't go. 

230
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,400
 - Where are you headed? 
 - Young Master Eight. 

231
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,070
Why are you running off?

232
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,180
 Tell us more. 

233
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,040
Over there! Go!

234
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,760
Stop!

235
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,310
- Get him! 
 - Go!

236
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,220
Fool.

237
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,360
- Get him! 
 - This way!

238
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,180
- Where did he go? 
 - Over here!

239
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,310
Get over here.

240
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,800
Don't move. Just follow my lead.

241
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,220
Young Master Wang, you're drunk.

242
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,400
Why can't you hold your liquor at all?

243
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,710
You barely had a drop, and you're like this!

244
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,270
Young Master Wang, you're drunk already?

245
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,510
Come on now.

246
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,400
The Earl of Dingyuan's son is still waiting for you at Zhen Tower.

247
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,720
Come on. Let's go.

248
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,880
Come with me.

249
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
We'll keep drinking.

250
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,030
- Anything? 
 - We lost him.

251
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,030
- No sign of him. 
 - All right.

252
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,030
Let's go.

253
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,160
Young Master Wang.

254
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,320
Watch your step.

255
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,720
Master, I didn't expect you'd be the one to pick me up.

256
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
You were headed for the capital.

257
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,890
Of course, I came ahead to make arrangements.

258
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,160
If I hadn't been here, you might've died today.

259
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,830
I really let my guard down today.

260
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,160
Didn't expect to be taught a lesson at Zhen Tower.

261
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,110
Who was that girl who tricked you?

262
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,160
No idea.

263
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,180
I only know she works for the tower.

264
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,790
Master, are those guards really that dangerous?

265
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,110
Don't worry.

266
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,750
They're just a bunch of men carrying out orders.

267
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,340
They've probably realized by now that you weren't their target.

268
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,900
Kid,

269
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,280
you've seen how much danger and hidden power lie in the capital today, haven't you?

270
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,630
You're right. I'll have to be more careful.

271
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,550
Still, I did learn something.

272
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,730
At least I now know what the Marquis of Pingjin is working on right now.

273
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,900
Let's hear it.

274
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,590
It's about the Empress Dowager's burial.

275
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,480
The court is split in two.

276
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,720
One side insists on maintaining the current plan,

277
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,240
keeping the late emperor buried with Dowager Noble Consort Li.

278
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,880
The other demands her coffin be removed

279
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,720
so the late emperor and empress can be buried together.

280
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,550
The Emperor was in a difficult position, so he handed off this touchy subject

281
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,350
to the Marquis of Pingjin's son,

282
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,270
Vice Minister of Works, Zhuang Zhifu.

283
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,640
Now, with only three days left,

284
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,240
the Marquis of Pingjin has stepped up to take charge.

285
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,940
He's been searching throughout the capital for feng shui masters.

286
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,480
Let me ask you.

287
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,070
Who was the Empress Dowager?

288
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,160
The late emperor's wife.

289
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,100
The current emperor's imperial mother.

290
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,490
And who was Dowager Noble Consort Li?

291
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,750
The emperor's birth mother

292
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,620
and the late emperor's deeply loved consort.

293
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,530
Then, who's really caught in this conflict?

294
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,260
The Emperor?

295
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,200
So, while this may look like a ritual dispute between old and new courtiers,

296
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,440
at its heart, it's a power struggle between the Emperor and the court.

297
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
If he doesn't move the noble consort's coffin,

298
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,880
he'll lose the ministers' support.

299
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,570
But if he does, he loses the people.

300
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,480
Whatever he chooses, he loses something.

301
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,560
So, do you still think this can be solved by hiring a feng shui master?

302
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,830
Then surely the Marquis of Pingjin understands this, too.

303
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,920
Why is he going along with it?

304
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,440
Because it's for appearances.

305
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,220
 Take them all! 

306
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,090
Come.

307
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,520
 Let go of me! 

308
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,000
Officials, you've got the wrong man! 
    

309
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,100
I don't know a thing about feng shui!

310
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,790
- You've got the wrong man! 
 - I just make coffins!

311
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,680
Honey...

312
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,760
That carriage is full of feng shui masters they captured.

313
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,820
- Anyone even loosely connected to funerals is being captured. 
 - Please, don't!

314
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,170
- A few days ago, they even took a man who sold incense. 
  - Move! 

315
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,580
This is the Marquis of Pingjin sending a message to the court:

316
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,660
he's doing his best.

317
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,880
Master, allow me.

318
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,670
Master, do I look like a feng shui master to you?

319
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,080
You've found a way to enter the game?

320
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,270
- Son... 
 - Father!

321
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,110
- Official... 
 - Father!

322
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,780
- Move! 
 - Father!

323
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,490
- Son. 
 - Father!

324
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,960
Official... Official... Please spare me, Official!

325
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,830
I'm not a feng shui master.

326
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,880
I just sell joss paper, paper dolls, and paper horses.

327
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,450
I swear I know nothing of feng shui!

328
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,990
Father!

329
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,190
Is that so?

330
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,750
I wouldn't lie to you, Official!

331
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,160
Father...

332
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,510
Son...

333
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,000
Father!

334
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,380
Son...

335
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,160
Father.

336
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,860
Do you know it now?

337
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,160
I do...

338
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,630
Please, Official, don't kill my son!

339
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,240
- Take him. 
 - Official...

340
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,400
- Father. 
- Son.

341
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,930
- Father. 
 - Son!

342
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,750
Official, we're still short one man.

343
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,880
- Wait. 
 - Father.

344
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,360
If you know it,

345
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,030
then your son must know it, too.

346
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,480
Let him help you.

347
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,540
Official, you just promised not to kill him!

348
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,030
He's just a child!

349
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,350
Please, let him go.

350
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm not killing him.

351
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,480
But I never said I wouldn't take him.

352
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,060
- Take them both. 
 - Son... Oh, my boy.

353
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,810
 Official, please wait! 

354
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,860
Who is this?

355
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,790
I heard you were searching for feng shui masters.

356
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,030
I'm no expert, but I know a thing or two about the art.

357
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,490
I'm willing to help.

358
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,360
Would you consider letting the child go?

359
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,210
You're interesting.

360
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,880
You walked right into this yourself.

361
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,900
Very well. Come along, too.

362
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,940
- Move! 
 - Official, wait.

363
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,250
Feng shui is delicate work.

364
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,030
Kids are clumsy by nature.

365
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:07,250
We wouldn't want the child to mess up your plans. Right?

366
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,400
Oh, son.

367
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,840
Now move.

368
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,030
- Up! 
 - Father!

369
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,730
I'm fine, son. I'll be fine!

370
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,410
I'm just a butcher.

371
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,270
I've helped a Taoist priest gut a piglet.

372
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,680
What would I know about stupid feng shui?

373
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,920
Marquis of Pingjin, even a pig's better than you!

374
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:07,240
I just wish I could trade my life for my son's safety.

375
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,670
Then I'd die content.

376
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,830
Kind sir...

377
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,350
Kind sir, thank you for saving my boy just now.

378
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,820
Get up now.

379
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,100
Your kindness is beyond measure.

380
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,100
I may never have the chance to repay it in this life.

381
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,350
But in the next, I, Fan Liu, will gladly serve you,

382
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,410
to repay your great kindness.

383
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,540
No need for that.

384
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,720
With luck, we might just make it back alive.

385
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,000
Aren't you running to your death?

386
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,490
We all tried so hard to run, and you volunteered?

387
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,850
Do you really know this stuff, or are you just faking it?

388
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,270
Come on, everyone.

389
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,010
We're just going to see the Marquis of Pingjin, not the King of Death.

390
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,390
Are you saying you can fix this?

391
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,080
Let fate decide.

392
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,160
I'm tired. I'll sleep for a bit.

393
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,790
Brother Fan, please wake me when we arrive.

394
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,190
Thanks.

395
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,930
All right.

396
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,110
We're about to die, and he has the heart to take a nap?

397
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,510
Out!

398
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,240
What are you staring at? Move!

399
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,440
Hurry!

400
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,430
- Hurry, now! 
 - Let's go!

401
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,350
- Move it. 
 - Hurry up!

402
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,110
- Hurry! 
 - What are you looking at?

403
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,550
Keep moving!

404
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,000
- Move it. 
 - Go!

405
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,960
- Go. 
 - Move.

406
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,510
- Move it! 
 - Hurry!

407
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,140
Move.

408
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,320
Move it.

409
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,750
- Get in. 
 - Move it.

410
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,680
Inside. Go!

411
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,780
Get in.

412
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,650
- Get in! 
 - Move!

413
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,350
Shut the gate!

414
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,790
Open up!

415
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,870
- Let me out! 
 - Open the gate!

416
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,880
- Let me out! 
 - Let us out!

417
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,170
Stay close to the wall.

418
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,780
If you want to live, don't move!

419
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,000
What is this place?

420
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,740
We have no other choice but to move forward now.

421
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,420
But this tomb is full of traps.

422
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,510
You must step exactly where I tell you.

423
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,070
And don't touch anything.

424
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,710
Is that clear?

425
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,180
This is the Wing-Chariot Turtle, facing south with its back to the north.

426
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,360
"Of the five elements, water and earth are inseparable.

427
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,070
Among the Nine Stars, Fuxing and Bixing stay close."

428
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,060
This place must've been built following the Nine-Star Layout.

429
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,700
That way is west.

430
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,670
You mean you can get us out?

431
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,030
I can only try.

432
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,550
I'm going to count to three.

433
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,150
All of you listen to me, and we'll move together.

434
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,490
Fan Liu, come here.

435
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,280
You'll step on the second tile to the west from here.

436
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,280
Butcher, you'll step on the third tile to the west.

437
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,290
Got it?

438
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,280
One, two, three!

439
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,410
The traps here are all linked.

440
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,750
As long as you walk in the right spot, you'll be safe.

441
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,950
Brother.

442
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,320
On my count, take one step back. In other words, the first tile to your east.

443
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,740
And you in the back, step onto the first tile to the west.

444
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,430
Are you sure this is the one?

445
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,990
Trust me.

446
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,080
All right.

447
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,380
I... I'll do it.

448
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,930
Ready?

449
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,740
One,

450
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,660
two,

451
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,640
three!

452
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,330
"The Bumu and Jiaoyi Stars bring ill omens.

453
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,220
When the Renzhuan Star presides, all remains calm and smooth.

454
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,390
Lizao, Demon, and Confusion Stars together,

455
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,760
and joined by Hedao, the four spell disaster."

456
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,160
You may have left the battlefield long ago, My Lord,

457
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,960
but your strength is undiminished.

458
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,290
Every arrow hits the mark.

459
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,350
Your grace hasn't faded one bit.

460
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,380
- Indeed. 
 - Exactly.

461
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,760
Since he doesn't know when to shut up, cut his tongue out.

462
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,810
Have mercy, My Lord!

463
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,910
My Lord...

464
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,150
- Let's go. 
 - My Lord...

465
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,350
My Lord, they're all inside the tomb passage now.

466
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,950
My Lord, another batch of feng shui masters has arrived.

467
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,760
What about the previous ones?

468
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,390
They've been dealt with, as you ordered.

469
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:26,350
Over 80 men, and not one with a working solution?

470
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:30,540
True masters of feng shui tend to live in seclusion.

471
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,980
I've sent more men across the land to seek them out.

472
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,060
We'll find one, My Lord, and quell the flames of this crisis.

473
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,980
Official Chu, if I simply wait for you to resolve this,

474
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,420
then my own residence may soon go up in flames.

475
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,720
Calm down, My Lord.

476
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,360
I'll do everything I can.

477
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,160
Switch bows.

478
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,680
Here, Father.

479
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,600
May I ask you something?

480
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,850
Isn't the Empress Dowager's burial

481
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,160
a matter between the Emperor and the court?

482
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,200
Why insist on turning to feng shui masters for a solution?

483
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,230
Everyone has their own opinion on the matter,

484
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,890
but only the Emperor's view truly matters.

485
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,530
While his intentions are easy to guess,

486
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:30,510
finding a solution that satisfies both sides is a real challenge.

487
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,160
What if we never find a qualified master?

488
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,560
Then I'll find another way.

489
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,450
But first, you must play your part well.

490
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,480
Don't give them anything to use against you.

491
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,290
No matter what, I will protect you.

492
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,490
I understand.

493
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,280
Thank you, Father.

494
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,150
"When Earth's essence aligns with virtue, destiny flows without hindrance.

495
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,070
Whether the Five Energies are imbalanced or whole decides fortune or ruin.

496
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,690
Heaven above, Earth below, it is Man who holds the highest worth.

497
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,790
Follow the way, and you find fortune; Resist it, and ruin follows."

498
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,840
I think I stepped on the wrong tile.

499
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,940
Get down!

500
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,890
What was that?

501
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,560
Don't move!

502
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,640
Those are Bone-Cutting Wires.

503
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,760
A tomb trap passed down from the previous dynasty.

504
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,060
I didn't expect to see them here.

505
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,410
How are we supposed to get through?

506
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,880
These wires can slice through iron,

507
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,320
but they're very rare.

508
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,550
No tomb builder would lay them without a plan.

509
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,690
There must be a pattern they followed.

510
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,200
Butcher, step on the fourth tile to the west.

511
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,260
Fan Liu.

512
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,740
Step on the fourth tile to the southwest.

513
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,300
We'll move together toward the edge of the trap.

514
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,080
On my count:

515
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,190
One,

516
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,550
two,

517
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,020
three!

518
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,480
"Study the Stems and Branches,

519
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,790
and fate shall reveal its blessings and misfortunes."

520
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,760
"To awaken the unaware,

521
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,490
one must grasp the laws of harmony and opposition."

522
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,740
One, two, three!

523
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,880
I've reached the end.

524
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,490
Then open the gate already!

525
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,860
I can't leave yet.

526
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,190
This is the passage to the imperial tomb.

527
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,980
Its defenses are far tighter than any ordinary burial chamber.

528
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:49,630
If I leave this tile, yours will shift,

529
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,210
and the trap will be triggered.

530
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,800
- What do we do? 
 - Don't panic.

531
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,060
Just keep following my lead.

532
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,360
We're standing in a Nine-Star Layout.

533
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,830
Next... we need to reverse the path from the Yellow Star in the Center Palace.

534
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,250
The Yellow Star in the Center Palace...

535
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,570
Butcher, step on the second tile to the northwest.

536
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,510
Fan Liu, step on the fourth tile to the southwest.

537
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,060
Okay... Get ready.

538
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,070
One, two...

539
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,630
Sir...

540
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,750
Trust me.

541
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,880
All right. Let's go.

542
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,630
One,

543
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,400
two,

544
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,860
three!

545
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,640
My eyes!

546
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:16,930
