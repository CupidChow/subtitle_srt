00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 30]

3
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,010
Your Majesty.

4
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,290
This place is empty.

5
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,500
Where is she?

6
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,540
She's right in there.

7
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,380
The switch for the passageway

8
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,570
is right there.

9
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,380
Go ahead.

10
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,660
Find another entrance.

11
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,900
Come and eat.

12
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,730
Where is Zang Hai?

13
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,370
He...

14
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,020
has work to do.

15
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,660
He went to my mother?

16
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,780
He went to kill my mother?

17
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,410
Didn't he?

18
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,050
Just

19
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,170
spare me the questions.

20
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,170
Alright.

21
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,220
Let my mother and me

22
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,100
die with him and his child

23
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,610
on this very day.

24
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,340
What do you mean?

25
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,410
You're a physician.

26
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,610
Can't you tell I'm pregnant?

27
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,340
No way.

28
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,140
Hai couldn't have...

29
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,100
Take my pulse

30
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,580
if you don't believe me.

31
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,700
Deficient pulse filling.

32
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,410
No signs of fetal pulse.

33
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,410
You lied to me?

34
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,050
But why are you...?

35
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,370
Why am I so powerful, huh?

36
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,610
The soup is mixed with

37
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,460
Tendon-weakening Powder.

38
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,140
Isn't it?

39
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,730
What a pity

40
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,980
that I threw them away

41
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,900
these days.

42
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,410
I'm in a bad mood.

43
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
Tell me where Zang Hai is.

44
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,980
How dare you trick me?

45
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,140
Listen carefully.

46
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,050
Nobody

47
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,250
from the Kuai family

48
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,290
would be coerced.

49
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,490
I won't tell you where he is

50
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,540
even if you kill me.

51
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,660
Your Majesty, be careful!

52
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,490
What do we do?

53
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,580
They are blocked

54
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,140
outside.

55
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,140
Keep going.

56
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,020
Why isn't it working?

57
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,460
Poisonous smoke.

58
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,020
Protect Her Majesty.

59
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,610
Go back.

60
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:46,650
Let's go.

61
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,100
Antu.

62
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,180
Where are you going?

63
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,730
Let him go.

64
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,530
We're the only ones here.

65
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,700
No one can beat you.

66
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,100
Besides,

67
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,730
how would he know

68
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,130
where Hai took your mother?

69
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,850
Where is he?

70
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,580
He is showing your mother

71
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,580
around the capital.

72
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,250
How many people did he bring?

73
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,850
He went to

74
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,650
see her alone.

75
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,530
If things go south,

76
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,060
Gao Ming and Shilei

77
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,580
will secretly cover him.

78
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,460
He's way too reckless.

79
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,370
How can

80
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,530
the three of them handle

81
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,340
the Queen of Dongxia?

82
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,180
Don't underestimate them.

83
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,730
Tell you what.

84
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,530
You thought he operated in the shadows,

85
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,610
while my mother stood in the light.

86
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,490
But she knows

87
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,530
who he is all along.

88
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,580
She's well prepared.

89
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,980
His plan won't work.

90
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,580
No way.

91
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,850
I don't believe you.

92
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,530
Tell me where he is.

93
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,850
I have to stop him.

94
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,770
But the revenge is his to take.

95
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,980
None of us can stop him,

96
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,180
including you.

97
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,530
I'm afraid

98
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,300
that everything will come to an end today.

99
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,770
Liuchu.

100
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,580
Please tell me where he is.

101
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,890
But it wouldn't help

102
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,100
even if you find him.

103
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,580
Your Majesty.

104
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,250
The smoke dissipated as soon as we came out.

105
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,490
He just didn't want us to enter.

106
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,730
Your Majesty, be careful.

107
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,820
There were six lotuses

108
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,940
on the wall of the first corridor.

109
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,730
And there were six of us.

110
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,250
Five lotuses in the second corridor.

111
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,010
There are five of us.

112
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,850
Stay here and wait.

113
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,300
The rest of you, follow me.

114
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,180
Your Majesty.

115
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,370
Let's go.

116
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,180
Only four lotuses left.

117
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,940
I think there are mechanisms

118
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,980
under the entire passageway.

119
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,610
If more people enter

120
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,980
than the number of lotuses,

121
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,220
the stone gates

122
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,370
will remain sealed.

123
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,010
Zang Hai intends to

124
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,940
break us up.

125
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,890
So he wants to see me alone.

126
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,300
All of you, go back.

127
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,820
No, Your Majesty.

128
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,980
The smoke wasn't poisonous.

129
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,060
I don't think he wants to kill us.

130
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:08,940
Your Majesty...

131
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,490
Your Majesty...

132
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,730
Say no more.

133
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,420
I'll enter alone.

134
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,530
- Understood. - Understood.

135
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,420
The door

136
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,010
has been locked.

137
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,420
It won't open from the inside ever again.

138
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,420
So my daughter is not here.

139
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,850
She is somewhere safe.

140
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,370
Whose tomb is this?

141
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,610
It's the tomb of Princess Yongning,

142
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,340
the daughter of the late Emperor Zhenzong.

143
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,220
Emperor Zhenzong loved her very much.

144
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,610
But Princess Yongning

145
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,940
died in a foreign land.

146
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,130
So her tomb was abandoned

147
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,700
before it was even

148
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,220
completed.

149
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,530
I know her story.

150
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,340
She married Khan far away from home

151
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,460
and had a son and a daughter with him.

152
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,770
They lived a happy life.

153
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,730
But it didn't last long.

154
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,220
Khan's big brother Chiwu Zhu

155
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,220
launched a coup

156
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,220
and killed Khan.

157
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,890
Princess Yongning

158
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,530
and her children

159
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,460
were tied to wooden posts

160
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,820
and burned to death.

161
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,820
Emperor Zhenzong didn't have the power

162
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,610
to take down Chiwu Zhu once and for all,

163
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,650
so he bided his time.

164
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,650
Five years later,

165
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,730
Emperor Zhenzong led an army of 300,000 troops

166
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,300
to pacify the entire Mobei.

167
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,220
Chiwu Zhu was also tied to a wooden post

168
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,420
and burned into charcoal.

169
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,890
All the murals here

170
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,850
were hand-painted

171
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,220
by Emperor Zhenzong.

172
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,610
He did this

173
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,650
to etch his daughter's death

174
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,700
into his soul.

175
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,010
You didn't lure me here

176
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,220
just to tell me

177
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,700
the story of Princess Yongning, right?

178
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,890
The night

179
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,100
when my whole family was killed,

180
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,700
what were you thinking

181
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,010
while staring at the blazing fire?

182
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,180
You have a daughter, too.

183
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,980
If she were the one who died there,

184
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,700
what would you have done?

185
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,460
Of course, I would have avenged her.

186
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,940
But remember.

187
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,340
If you kill me now,

188
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,420
you'll lose any chance

189
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,370
with my daughter forever.

190
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,010
Using your daughter to get yourself out of trouble?

191
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,490
That wasn't a great idea.

192
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,460
I'm not the kind of person you think.

193
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,460
Really?

194
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,130
Then why did you

195
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,340
paint over

196
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,490
the murals here?

197
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,530
Were you scared that you would

198
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,770
slowly forget to take revenge?

199
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,700
As people live on,

200
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,980
their hatred will eventually be worn out.

201
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,010
So you kept

202
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,850
repainting these

203
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,300
to burn yourself

204
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,530
with the flame of hatred.

205
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,530
You'd rather pause your life

206
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,130
on that tragic night.

207
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,530
But time won't stop.

208
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,730
It will push you

209
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,820
to keep going forward.

210
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,700
You'll meet someone

211
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,290
who makes you feel for the first time

212
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,900
that there is

213
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,330
a meaning to life apart from hatred.

214
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,810
But that pains you even more.

215
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,860
Because you will sense

216
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,860
your hatred fading away.

217
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,090
So you have to force yourself

218
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,420
to give up all that

219
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,660
and continue to seek revenge.

220
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,530
Are you really going to

221
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,700
kill me with that?

222
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,250
Look at the bags

223
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,460
above your head.

224
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,700
They are filled with wheat flour.

225
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,860
Once I pull the rope,

226
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,050
the wheat flour

227
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,490
will pour out.

228
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,420
It's not easy to kill you

229
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,220
with this arrow.

230
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,770
But it's really easy

231
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,700
to set the chamber on fire

232
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,980
with it.

233
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,900
I didn't expect you

234
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,810
to set up such a trap.

235
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,660
You're surely Kuai Duo's son.

236
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,810
If you kill me,

237
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,570
you will die, too.

238
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,290
Are you willing to die like this?

239
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,250
You keep talking

240
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,490
because you are afraid of death.

241
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,490
The Queen of Dongxia

242
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,290
turns out to be nothing extraordinary.

243
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,140
Zang Hai.

244
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,010
You've worked hard.

245
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,810
But this is

246
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,010
not a good decision.

247
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,860
Do you know

248
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,090
what you're doing

249
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,090
to my daughter?

250
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,180
She will end up just like you,

251
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,250
tormented by hatred.

252
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,010
Will you still do this

253
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,980
if that's the case?

254
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,010
I'll feel sorry

255
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,330
for Antu once I kill you.

256
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,140
But if I don't kill you,

257
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,980
I'll feel sorry for my family.

258
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,730
I must

259
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,220
take revenge.

260
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,530
Mother.

261
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,770
Antu.

262
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,250
Leave.

263
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,220
I'll do it for you.

264
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,530
Antu.

265
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,570
Stay back, both of you.

266
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,180
Zang Hai.

267
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,330
I'll die for my mother.

268
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,290
From now on,

269
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,980
the grudge between our families is over.

270
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,700
Alright?

271
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,250
Mother.

272
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,770
Please

273
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,090
don't give him a hard time.

274
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:20,860
Stop!

275
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,420
You.

276
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,290
Take her away.

277
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,010
No.

278
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,220
You have to avenge your family.

279
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,620
If you give it up for me,

280
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,980
you will regret it forever.

281
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,980
Both of us will suffer.

282
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,050
You have to

283
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,380
take revenge.

284
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,380
Silly girl.

285
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,490
Ten years in Yong

286
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,700
made you so irritable.

287
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,490
Thankfully, you haven't been

288
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,490
fully twisted by hatred.

289
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,530
But how are you

290
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,900
going to take down

291
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,980
your real enemies?

292
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,490
The person who killed my family

293
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,220
with Zhuang Luyin and Cao Jingxian

294
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,980
was not you?

295
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,530
Zhuang Luyin...

296
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,730
Cao Jingxian...

297
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,620
Tell me.

298
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,620
Why are you so certain that I was one of them?

299
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,090
I don't know your relationship

300
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,250
with Zhuang Luyin.

301
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,250
But you have been allied

302
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,220
with Cao Jingxian for years.

303
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,290
That petty eunuch.

304
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,900
Why would I need help

305
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,940
to kill Kuai Duo?

306
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,980
Your speculation

307
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,700
is understandable.

308
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,570
Let me tell you a story first.

309
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,700
You can decide

310
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,900
whether to believe me.

311
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:37,980
Zhinu.

312
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,490
You are so much like him.

313
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,250
Dongxia lost the war back then.

314
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,490
The royal court was in chaos.

315
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,700
My reign was under threat.

316
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,530
One day,

317
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,050
some rebels attempted to assassinate me.

318
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,140
I fell off the cliff

319
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,140
and thought I would die for sure.

320
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,090
But I woke up

321
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,980
and found myself in an army tent.

322
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,220
A man from Yong saved me.

323
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,090
That man was your father.

324
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,420
Kuai Duo.

325
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,860
You woke up?

326
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,620
Who are you?

327
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,140
Where am I?

328
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,980
We're on Mount Dansui,

329
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,810
in the Artisan-Soldier Camp of the Great Yong.

330
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,250
I am Kuai Duo,

331
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,010
the Imperial Astronomer of the Great Yong.

332
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,140
I am commissioned

333
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,460
to build the Fengshan Altar here.

334
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,290
Fortunately,

335
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,290
the arrow missed any vital organs.

336
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,220
But you must rest for at least half a month.

337
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,900
Once you recover,

338
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,620
I'll send you away.

339
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,570
You

340
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,250
don't trust me?

341
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,090
Of course not.

342
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,180
Why are you pushing yourself?

343
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,660
It's freezing out there.

344
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,460
You'll die from the cold

345
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,330
very soon

346
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,220
if you try to leave.

347
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,380
Take a good rest here.

348
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,730
We don't have tents

349
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,180
specifically for ladies.

350
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,660
Sorry for the inconvenience.

351
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,810
Here.

352
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,660
You asked for water.

353
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,810
You didn't have to boil it.

354
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,010
Are you married?

355
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,530
I'm married

356
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,140
and have a daughter and a son.

357
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,940
I can get them

358
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,730
to Dongxia.

359
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,490
I won't

360
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,660
stay here forever.

361
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,140
They're waiting for me at home.

362
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,180
How dare you look down on Dongxia?

363
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,290
What's so great about Yong?

364
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,330
Dongxia is great.

365
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,380
But my family lives

366
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,980
in the Great Yong.

367
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,460
Where are we

368
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,380
at the project now?

369
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,420
We dug 100 chi deeper.

370
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,010
Listen.

371
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,530
It's snowing heavily.

372
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,460
The east and south constructions

373
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,380
are quite unstable.

374
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,490
Tell the artisans

375
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,530
to pay extra attention.

376
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,290
Understood.

377
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,140
This is the Fengshan Altar you're building

378
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,660
for the Emperor of Yong?

379
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,140
That's right.

380
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,570
His Majesty will conduct the Fengshan ceremony here

381
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,250
to show his ambition

382
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,900
of unifying all lands.

383
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,810
You people

384
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,220
always aspire to grasp the whole world

385
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,940
in your fist,

386
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,250
claiming that

387
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,530
it's for the eternity of the nation.

388
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,330
But

389
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,620
when your last day comes,

390
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,700
what can you take with you?

391
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,220
That is not up to me.

392
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,220
But people

393
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,860
should aspire

394
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,180
to leave something behind.

395
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,220
The eternity of the nation belongs to His Majesty

396
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,220
as well as the people of the Great Yong.

397
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,530
You're thinking too much.

398
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,140
It's better to live for yourself

399
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,140
as a commoner.

400
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,980
We should

401
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,490
make the most

402
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,570
of our limited time.

403
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,290
Though

404
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,770
I cherish life,

405
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,290
I value

406
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,980
righteousness more.

407
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,140
When forced to choose,

408
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,900
I sacrifice my life for principle.

409
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,180
What's this?

410
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,250
A hand-made toy for my son.

411
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,660
I can tell

412
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,660
that you really miss your family.

413
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,730
What are their names?

414
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,140
My son is called Zhinu.

415
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,220
And my daughter Yuenu.

416
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,220
"Nu" as in slave?

417
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,010
You people

418
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,770
really want your kids

419
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,420
to be slaves?

420
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,250
It's a term of endearment,

421
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,700
meaning that they should grow up slowly.

422
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,380
I have two daughters.

423
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,770
One is called Yinzhu.

424
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,980
The other is called Antu.

425
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,940
So

426
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,460
are they...?

427
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,620
They are in a safe place.

428
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,330
Time flew.

429
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,900
After half a month

430
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,980
in the Artisan-Soldier Camp,

431
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,330
I got used to

432
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,380
life there.

433
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,460
If only wounds weren't so eager to heal...

434
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,530
I heard that Dongxia people are good at horse riding.

435
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,460
We just

436
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,980
rode around.

437
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,730
How do you feel?

438
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,980
Not bad.

439
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,900
We're quite far

440
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,530
from your tent.

441
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,860
Why did we come this far?

442
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,940
I promised

443
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,420
to send you back

444
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,460
once you recover.

445
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,010
Now,

446
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,490
it's time to go home.

447
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,620
How do you know where I live?

448
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,660
Your family has been looking for you.

449
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,380
Your Majesty!

450
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,220
The civil strife within your royal court

451
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,490
remains unresolved.

452
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,860
Your Highness.

453
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,140
Your people need you.

454
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,980
You knew all along?

455
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,220
There are things

456
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,860
we have to face eventually.

457
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,180
We humbly welcome Your Majesty's return.

458
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,140
Let's go.

459
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,050
Kuai Duo.

460
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,250
Thank you.

461
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,380
Later,

462
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,900
I ended the civil strife.

463
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,620
Everything went back to normal.

464
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,620
But deep down,

465
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,860
I knew that something

466
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,180
had changed forever.

467
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,380
Your Majesty.

468
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,810
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau

469
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,050
and the Ministry of Works of Yong have extended

470
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,290
the Fengshan Altar to over 100 chi.

471
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,010
Anything else?

472
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,530
Kuai Duo is working

473
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,050
from dawn to midnight

474
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,810
as usual.

475
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,050
Your Majesty.

476
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,140
What's wrong?

477
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,570
There was an earthquake.

478
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,620
The Fengshan Altar collapsed.

479
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,620
Many Yong artisans

480
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,730
got injured or died.

481
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,090
Many are trapped under the ruins.

482
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,810
What about Kuai Duo?

483
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,460
We...

484
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,730
We don't know yet.

485
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,420
We're already looking for him.

486
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,140
Your Majesty.

487
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,250
Someone saw Kuai Duo

488
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,090
coming out from the collapsed Fengshan Altar.

489
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:16,980
He returned to the camp.

490
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,940
But very soon,

491
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,180
he headed southwest on horseback.

492
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,290
Your Majesty.

493
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,380
Kuai Duo went to the woods in the west.

494
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,860
Stay here.

495
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,660
Don't follow me!

496
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,180
Your Majesty!

497
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,940
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

498
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,730
Kuai Duo!

499
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,460
Kuai Duo!

500
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,260
Kuai Duo!

501
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,900
Where are you going?

502
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,170
Your Highness.

503
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,380
There was an earthquake.

504
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,820
The Fengshan Altar collapsed.

505
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,010
I have to report it.

506
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,170
That wasn't an earthquake.

507
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,860
What happened?

508
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,740
What did you do?

509
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,170
You found the Gui Seal?

510
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,780
So it was hidden

511
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,210
under Mount Dansui.

512
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,690
You detected it long ago?

513
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,460
You're here for that?

514
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,690
Your Highness, please stop asking questions.

515
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,820
You must give it to me.

516
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,570
Kuai Duo.

517
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,340
Do you know what exactly

518
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,260
the Gui Seal does?

519
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,650
Do you have any idea

520
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,010
why I'd rather lose the war

521
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,050
than resort to that?

522
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,530
My mother

523
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,820
used the Gui Seal

524
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,010
in a war against you.

525
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,170
It triggered

526
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,460
a devastating tragedy.

527
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,420
And she died because of that.

528
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,740
She left a will,

529
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,460
forbidding all her offspring

530
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,010
to ever look for it.

531
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,650
Even I didn't know

532
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,380
where it was hidden

533
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,610
until this moment.

534
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,340
Kuai Duo.

535
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,490
The Gui Seal is an ominous item.

536
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,900
It will bring you

537
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,530
endless trouble if you keep it.

538
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,050
Thank you for telling me that.

539
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,010
But I have to bring it back.

540
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,490
Kuai Duo.

541
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,380
Give it to me.

542
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,010
I won't use it against Yong.

543
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,690
And please stay.

544
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,780
Let's stay in Dongxia

545
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,300
just like when I was recovering.

546
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,860
Alright?

547
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,300
Have you

548
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,210
fully recovered?

549
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,380
Good to know.

550
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,010
You have to leave, don't you?

551
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,130
Give me a hug.

552
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,260
Will you?

553
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,940
I'm afraid

554
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,690
we won't see each other again.

555
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,210
Don't worry.

556
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,570
It's just anesthetic.

557
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,340
You will recover soon.

558
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,530
I compiled

559
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,380
this book over the years.

560
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,170
It contains

561
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,740
knowledge of geoscience

562
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,860
and techniques such as mortise and tenon joints.

563
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,050
I'm leaving it

564
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,980
to you.

565
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,260
Perhaps, it will be

566
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,940
useful to your people.

567
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,460
Sorry.

568
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,570
Kuai Duo.

569
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,610
You're such a fool.

570
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,210
Your Highness.

571
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,490
Take care.

572
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,980
Actually,

573
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,010
the ending of this story

574
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,010
was written in the beginning.

575
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,860
Your father only

576
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,490
showed up briefly in my life,

577
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,740
but he taught me something.

578
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,860
We all have

579
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,260
our own missions.

580
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,460
I never

581
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,490
