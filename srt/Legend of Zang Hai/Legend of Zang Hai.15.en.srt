[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,940
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,130
Lu Yan.

4
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,650
Do you think your brother would betray me?

5
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,570
Never.

6
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,410
Check this note.

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,100
Is it his handwriting?

8
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,460
I've heard the Marquis of Pingjin has learned the whereabouts of the object.

9
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,900
I would go undercover and investigate.

10
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,460
If I am dead,

11
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,740
it proves he is lying.

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,180
Yes.

13
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,380
I asked Lu Jin to investigate Zang Hai.

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,060
The evidence leads all the way to Zhuang Luyin.

15
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,290
Lu Jin pretended to defect to Zhuang

16
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,450
but got killed instead.

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,500
Everything is

18
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,220
about the object.

19
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,100
Zhuang Luyin.

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,380
What have you found?

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,690
You went so far as to kill Lu Jin

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,660
to prevent me from knowing the truth.

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,940
Lu Yan.

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,500
Arrange a proper funeral for Lu Jin.

25
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,450
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,500
One more thing.

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,610
Bring your brother to me.

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,660
What did Cao Jingxian come for?

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,220
He was looking for you,

30
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,940
claiming

31
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,380
that Mr. Lu came to our mansion last night.

32
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,290
Later Mr. Lu was found

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,500
drowned in the Guangji River.

34
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,340
There must be something going on.

35
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,500
But I haven't figured it out yet.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,690
I'm afraid that Lu Jin was not murdered by his enemy.

37
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,060
Cao Jingxian tried to fool me.

38
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,340
With all due respect,

39
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,060
I have a bold theory.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,290
The Surveillance Office under Mr. Cao

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,540
is monitoring almost each official in the capital.

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,100
Since he has nothing against you,

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,780
why are you

44
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,100
drawing his attention suddenly?

45
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,260
Is there something

46
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,610
unusual happening in the mansion

47
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,500
that raises his suspicion?

48
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,500
What's your opinion?

49
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,660
As a newcomer,

50
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,610
I'm not sure about a lot of things,

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,380
including Mr. Cao.

52
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,010
He arrested me

53
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,260
without notifying you in person.

54
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,100
It seems that I'm on his hit list.

55
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,980
I don't know

56
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,660
what is going on actually.

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,290
He and I have a history.

58
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,340
We've been at peace all these years.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,810
Now he is looking for trouble

60
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,220
because he is jealous of me

61
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,220
that I've recruited such a remarkable talent like you.

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,810
My Lord.

63
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,730
Is Mr. Cao really giving you a hard time

64
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,170
because of me?

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,170
Enough.

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,410
Let me think about it.

67
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,980
You may leave.

68
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,140
My Lord.

69
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,730
Could you send some guards

70
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,490
to protect me?

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,580
I offended Mr. Cao today.

72
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,050
I'm in danger

73
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,410
and I need protection.

74
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,250
If he decides to kill you,

75
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,660
it's no use having more guards.

76
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,050
I have a plan.

77
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,580
Listen.

78
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,140
I would arrange a position for you in the court.

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,900
As long as you present in front of the Emperor,

80
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,850
he would think hard before killing you.

81
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,900
I prefer to stay in the mansion

82
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,850
and serve you.

83
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,700
I never intend to leave you.

84
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,900
Don't worry.

85
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,660
You can serve in the court

86
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,610
and work for me at the same time.

87
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,020
Thanks, My Lord. Always at your service.

88
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,490
Come on. Master. A toast to you.

89
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,100
Drink.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,140
The Marquis of Pingjin is going to promote you?

91
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,660
Which rank?

92
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,930
How much is your salary?

93
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,000
He hasn't told me yet.

94
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,370
I feel that he would offer me an inferior position

95
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,370
who is just qualified to meet the Emperor.

96
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,170
I prefer to join the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

97
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,370
Do you want to get rid of Chu Huaiming?

98
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,730
Chu Huaiming is evil

99
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,050
and cold-blooded.

100
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,460
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau under him

101
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,580
is in total chaos.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,410
I won't allow him to ruin my father's legacy.

103
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,360
One more thing.

104
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,610
After joining the Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion,

105
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,460
I feel that the Marquis

106
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,810
is looking for something secret.

107
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,780
He has not given up yet.

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,430
He chose you

109
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,410
because you are familiar with geomancy techniques.

110
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,610
He can use you to help him find the object.

111
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,730
That's why I have to join the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

112
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,370
Chu Huaiming has not found it over these years.

113
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,340
At least I need to convince the Marquis of Pingjin

114
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,410
that I can find it.

115
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,170
A gift for you.

116
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,810
No logo.

117
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,930
Trying to fool me with some cheap stuff?

118
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,270
I've made it myself.

119
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,050
Please forgive

120
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,580
my poor craftsmanship, Miss Xiang.

121
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,100
Mr. Zang. You're really versatile.

122
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,780
Beautiful decoration.

123
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,700
Does Cao Jingxian

124
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,700
find anything strange about Lu Jin's death?

125
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,810
He suspects the Marquis of Pingjin

126
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,580
but he would not take radical actions yet.

127
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,780
You not only have brains

128
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,410
but also courage. Impressive!

129
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,490
Don't you think

130
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,780
we are the same?

131
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,780
You owe me a lot. Maybe you should return a favor.

132
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,730
Of course.

133
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,460
At your bidding.

134
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,340
The Ghost Festival is coming.

135
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,300
Are you available?

136
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,530
Take me out and have some fun.

137
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,640
On the day of the Ghost Festival?

138
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,770
Are you scared of ghosts?

139
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,610
Of course not.

140
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,130
I just think this is not enough

141
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,340
to pay your debt.

142
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,730
It's fine.

143
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,010
Favor is different from debt.

144
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,180
You can clear your debt.

145
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,770
But you can never pay back a favor.

146
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,730
You would owe me more.

147
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,220
Deal.

148
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,340
If you don't mind.

149
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,020
[Zhuang Clan Ancestral Hall]

150
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,820
My Lord. See?

151
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,340
Doesn't the cloud

152
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,980
look like a rabbit?

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,490
Zang Hai.

154
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,240
Today is the Ghost Festival.

155
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,130
Does the cloud

156
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,220
indicate something?

157
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,230
Yes, My Lord.

158
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,700
The cloud looks quite

159
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,250
different indeed.

160
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,180
But I'm good at reading stars

161
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,420
and moons in different seasons.

162
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,490
Cloud is changing constantly.

163
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,580
To be honest, I don't have a clue for this.

164
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,340
Idiot.

165
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,920
Stop staring at me.

166
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,940
Come here.

167
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,190
Sit.

168
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,530
You look sharp today.

169
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,700
It is the Ghost Festival.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,980
It's a festival for you.

171
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,420
For me?

172
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,180
I'm not dead yet.

173
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,490
Why?

174
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,060
You're a ghost of poverty.

175
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,820
What about you?

176
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,490
Me?

177
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,420
I'm a ghost of loneliness.

178
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,820
You have so many companions

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,370
around you in Zhen Tower.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,850
Why do you still feel lonely?

181
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,100
Do you know why I name it Zhen Tower?

182
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,460
Free from worries.

183
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,770
Smart.

184
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,340
All of them are free from worries

185
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,890
but me.

186
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,730
Zhen Tower

187
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,650
provides shelter to thousands of drifters in Capital.

188
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,010
One Zhen Tower is not enough.

189
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,370
We need a thousand, ten thousands of Zhen Tower

190
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,340
to accommodate all the homeless in the country.

191
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,700

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,620
Yeah.

382
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,030
[It would rain in Zhongzhou soon, putting an end to the prolonged drought.]

383
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,050
My Lord. Have you heard

384
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,830
about the statement released by Imperial Astronomical Bureau?

385
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,860
Yes.

386
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,460
According to Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

387
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,050
it would rain in Zhongzhou very soon.

388
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,380
The prolonged drought would end.

389
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,460
It turns out the rabbit cloud is a good sign.

390
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,800
Zang Hai.

391
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,940
You still need to work

392
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,250
on your astronomical skills.

393
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,700
I'm no match

394
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,940
for Mr. Chu.

395
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,330
But I have a theory

396
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,900
to share with you, My Lord.

397
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,700
Speak.

398
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,660
Perhaps Mr. Chu is wrong this time.

399
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,290
It may rain in Zhongzhou.

400
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,530
But it is an evil rain.

401
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,250
Why?

402
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,380
When I read the stars last night,

403
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,250
I saw rain is coming

404
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,620
in Zhongzhou.

405
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,980
But the long-awaited rain may turn into a flood.

406
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,380
I heard some people

407
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,700
were discussing

408
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,700
that a solar circle

409
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,330
appears in Zhongzhou these days.

410
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,010
Solar circle comes hand in hand with flood.

411
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,420
I'm afraid the rain would not stop for a while.

412
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,620
It would develop into a flood, destroying the dam

413
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,900
and numerous people would become homeless.

414
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,620
But it was a good sign yesterday.

415
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,980
Clouds gather and

416
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,700
separate randomly.

417
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,420
We cannot judge weather by reading clouds.

418
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,180
Are you sure about this?

419
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,330
I swear to you on my life.

420
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,620
Please report to the Emperor immediately,

421
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,860
evacuating people and reinforcing dams.

422
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,420
Get prepared for the upcoming flood.

423
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,180
Have you ever discussed this with others?

424
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,730
Listen. You don't know about this.

425
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,140
I've never heard about this.

426
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,050
But My Lord...

427
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,770
The Emperor is happy with the statement.

428
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,380
I don't want to ruin his mood.

429
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,900
I can report your prediction to the Emperor.

430
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,290
But I would ask for trouble

431
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,700
if the weather doesn't go as expected.

432
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,770
Even if there are floods and casualties in Zhongzhou,

433
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,570
I would not be responsible for it.

434
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,940
What about the people in Zhongzhou?

435
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,330
It's fate.

436
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,770
Forget

437
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,290
the flood.

438
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,460
You may leave.

439
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,570
Yes, My Lord.

440
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,460
The Marquis of Pingjin doesn't want to get involved

441
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,740
because Zhongzhou

442
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,220
is the jurisdiction of Commander Fu Zhisong.

443
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,060
If it's what you think,

444
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,390
the Commander may lose his position

445
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,420
due to his misconduct in flood prevention.

446
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,300
The Marquis covets the position too much.

447
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,730
He uses the people in Zhongzhou

448
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,660
as leverage to pursue power.

449
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,980
When the dam is destroyed by rain,

450
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,190
numerous people would lose families

451
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,490
and homes.

452
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,700
Are you sure the flood

453
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,890
would destroy the dam?

454
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,010
I've checked the maintenance record in the past few years.

455
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,770
Do you know who the responsible person is?

456
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,490
Zhuang Zhifu?

457
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,570
Correct.

458
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,330
He is corrupted to the core.

459
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,860
He must use a lot of cheap materials

460
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,980
to replace the rock in the dam.

461
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,090
There was not much rain in Zhongzhou.

462
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,420
It's difficult to assess the quality of the dam.

463
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,380
The long-last drought

464
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,290
has eroded the dam,

465
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,700
making it vulnerable to flood.

466
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,570
It sounds so dangerous.

467
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,620
Do you still remember that I told you

468
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,980
I would replace

469
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,250
Chu Huaiming

470
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,380
when I have a chance?

471
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,220
He's digging his own grave

472
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,330
this time.

473
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,220
Moreover,

474
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,460
I have to get the Marquis of Pingjin involved

475
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,860
to save the people in Zhongzhou from flood.

476
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,250
Wait.

477
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,420
Wait.

478
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,490
It would be risky

479
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,420
to involve the Marquis of Pingjin.

480
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,860
Don't you have an alternative plan?

481
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,770
My father told me

482
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,330
that the signs of nature

483
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,860
like wind, rain, and stars

484
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,860
have an impact on people's livelihood,

485
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,770
even lives.

486
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,730
People deserve the truth

487
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,530
and the right to prepare for disasters.

488
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,220
Good boy!

489
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,660
You've seen the truth.

490
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,730
However, as the Imperial Astronomer,

491
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,330
Chu Huaiming would use tricks

492
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,050
and absurd theories

493
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,570
to defend his misconduct.

494
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,010
People would be easily misled by him.

495
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,940
Understand?

496
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:25,730
Yes.

497
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,490
Well,

498
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,730
you can only defeat

499
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,940
magic with magic.

500
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,290
Move. Excuse me.

501
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,570
Move.

502
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,380
What

503
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,610
does it say?

504
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,290
It would rain in Zhongzhou soon.

505
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,290
It's an auspicious sign.

506
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,200
Auspicious!

507
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,640
Wonderful!

508
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,660
Rain is coming.

509
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,240
My crops in Zhongzhou would be saved.

510
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,180
Well, I don't think so.

511
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,330
Who is talking?

512
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,960
Who?

513
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,570
Who?

514
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,940
Who are you?

515
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,140
You dare challenge Imperial Astronomical Bureau?

516
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,380
Listen.

517
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,180
Imperial Astronomer Chu Huaiming has never made a mistake.

518
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,460
When he says it is an auspicious sign,

519
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,460
it is auspicious.

520
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,490
Yeah.

521
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,180
Right?

522
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,940
Yes.

523
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,180
You must investigate thoroughly

524
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,570
when reading natural signs.

525
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,460
Chu Huaiming is eager to take credit

526
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,660
and jumps to a conclusion

527
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,860
before conducting a proper research.

528
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,460
This time

529
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,220
he's made a big mistake.

530
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,420
The upcoming rain in Zhongzhou is evil,

531
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,330
which would not save people

532
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,050
but kill people instead.

533
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:35,850
Kill people?

534
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,570
How does it kill people?

535
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,290
Why?

536
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,770
Evil rain?

537
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,680
I'm so scared.

538
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,790
Stop!

539
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,770
Don't hit him.

540
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,460
Don't hold me back!

541
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,370
No!

542
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,940
No more nonsense here.

543
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,050
To be honest,

544
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,660
I've seen some special signs

545
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,980
in the sky.

546
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,840
The heaven was doing magic.

547
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,190
The rain is auspicious.

548
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,100
- Yeah. - Yeah.

549
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,700
I admit that it was a special sign.

550
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,290
But Chu Huaiming has made a mistake.

551
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,590
A disaster would occur in Zhongzhou.

552
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,090
Disaster?

553
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:04,880
Disaster?

554
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,360
- Disaster? - Disaster?

555
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,980
Why do you say that?

556
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,900
There is a bright circle around the sun.

557
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,050
The moon is separated

558
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,330
from the Net Mansion.

559
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,730
It's no auspicious sign at all.

560
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,250
It's ominous.

561
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,490
Ominous?

562
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,530
There would be a flood in Zhongzhou.

563
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,660
Flood?

564
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,810
How?

565
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:24,770
This...

566
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,990
We don't understand

567
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,240
what you are talking about.

568
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,450
Bright circle?

569
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,500
Moon...

570
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,200
Are you from Zhongzhou?

571
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,240
Have you seen a dark shadow

572
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,690
around the sun?

573
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,420
Yes.

574
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,050
It's called sun circle.

575
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,300
It's a sign of rain.

576
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,730
Now we are at the turn of summer and autumn.

577
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,980
The weather is getting cold in July.

578
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,980
The White Tiger of the West, one of Seven Mansions, is emerging.

579
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,620
The Net Mansion indicates rain.

580
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,810
Everyone.

581
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,010
Heavy rain in coming.

582
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,290
Sir.

583
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,330
Is that true?

584
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,220
Has it happened before?

585
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,420
Sima Yi once led the Wei troops to invade Sichuan,

586
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,090
who was defeated by Zhuge Liang.

587
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,940
Both of them saw

588
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,460
the Net Mansion separated from the moon.

589
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,940
Heavy rain is coming this month.

590
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,570
- Sir. - Sir.

591
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,140
Your words make sense.

592
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,050
The drought has lasted for a while in Zhongzhou.

593
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,960
When it rains,

594
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,860
it pours.

595
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,710
That's right.

596
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,900
Once the dam is destroyed,

597
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,180
people would lose their homes

598
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,020
and land.

599
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,290
This...

600
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,620
Chu Huaiming has become Imperial Astronomer

601
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,570
by flattering the powerful.

602
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,860
He knows nothing about geomancy.

603
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,700
If you don't believe me,

604
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,700
spread my words

605
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,280
to people around you.

606
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,420
Let's wait and see

607
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,140
whether Chu is right

608
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,250
or me?

609
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,930
Who is right anyway?

610
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,290
I don't know you.

611
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,180
Sir.

612
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,680
You mean

613
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,860
Zhongzhou is doomed?

614
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,590
Sir. Get up.

615
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,170
Sir.

616
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,860
Trust me.

617
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,340
Send the message

618
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,900
to your families in Zhongzhou

619
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,420
and get them prepared.

620
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,650
- Okay. - Go.

621
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,690
Sir.

622
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,820
No. Master.

623
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,900
Who are you?

624
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,740
I'm the Chief Aide in the Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion,

625
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,900
Zang Hai.

626
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,860
- Zang Hai. - Zang Hai.

627
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,340
Who is Zang Hai?

628
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,770
Who is Zang Hai?

629
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,650
I know him.

630
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,080
He is the one who has repaired the mausoleum.

631
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,080
I've heard of him, too.

632
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,820
The Marquis of Pingjin thinks highly of him after that.

633
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,210
If he is valued by the Marquis,

634
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,860
he must be trustworthy.

635
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,960
Spread the news.

636
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,720
Hurry.

637
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,300
Let's go.

638
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,780
Come on.

639
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,690
Did Zang Hai say

640
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,170
that I've made a mistake?

641
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,300
Yes.

642
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,090
Ridiculous!

643
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,340
You're just a nobody, Zang Hai.

644
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,740
You know nothing at all.

645
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,460
He said something else?

646
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,340
He said

647
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,050
the bright circle around the sun

648
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,460
and moon separated from the Net Mansion

649
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,880
are signs of flood.

650
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,170
The truth would speak for itself

651
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,900
in a few days.

652
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,170
He is talking nonsense.

653
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,690
Does the Marquis know this?

654
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,380
I'm afraid so.

655
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,300
I can

656
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,050
make you succeed

657
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,610
and I can crush you.

658
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,460
I told you to keep the secret

659
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,090
yet you spread the news of flood

660
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,050
in front of Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

661
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,380
Now everyone knows about this.

662
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,570
Are you sure you want to turn against me?

663
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,490
My Lord.

664
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,010
I would never do that.

665
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,130
I just try to find a perfect

666
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,500
solution to this crisis.

667
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,820
My Lord.

668
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,220
Zang Hai

669
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,380
was trying to help.

670
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,690
But he was too anxious

671
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,610
to think clearly.

672
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,010
He doesn't intend to be my enemy.

673
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,010
He thought he could interpret star signs

674
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,210
after reading some books.

675
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,890
Zang Hai.

676
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,210
The Lord trusts you so much.

677
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,570
Why were you so reckless

678
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,170
and didn't look out for him?

679
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,380
My Lord.

680
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,940
I did this

681
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,210
for your benefits actually.

682
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,570
Tell me.

683
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,610
How do you look out for me?

684
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,050
I suggested you

685
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,690
to report the situation to the Emperor.

686
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,900
I admit it's a lack of judgment.

687
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,300
As an influential minister,

688
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,980
you should not take the risk.

689
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,380
So I have to spread the news among citizens.

690
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,860
Mr. Chu was recommended by you.

691
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,940
If he makes a mistake,

692
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,010
someone may make a drama out of it.

693
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,980
I'm your aide.

694
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,740
The credit goes to you

695
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,400
if I am right.

696
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,460
But if you make a mistake,

697
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,690
I'm to blame for that.

698
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,460
You're just an aide.

699
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,690
You're not qualified

700
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,940
to dictate me what to do.

701
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,930
One more thing...

702
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:30,490
My Lord.

703
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,300
I'm impressed by his eloquence...

704
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,420
Please hear me out.

705
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:34,650
Speak.

706
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,940
Think clearly before speaking

707
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,900
as it's your last chance.

708
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,420
I should have told you the truth.

709
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,610
The bright circle around sun

710
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,780
is not only a sign of flood

711
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,050
but also

712
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,940
of fallen generals.

713
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,010
When Zhuanzhu tried to assassinate King Liao of Wu,

714
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,780
a comet was striking the moon.

715
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,050
When Nie Zheng was to kill the Han Kui,

716
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,860
there was a bright circle around the sun.

717
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,900
These signs indicate the fall of generals and ministers.

718
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,530
Chu Huaiming.

719
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,300
Is that true?

720
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,300
This...

721
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,050
Tell me.

722
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,260
Which general would fall?

723
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,610
I don't know.

724
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,940
You don't know

725
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,690
or you won't tell me the truth?

726
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,530
I will never deceive you.

727
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,530
I just

728
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,010
want to avert the risk for you.

729
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,380
For me?

730
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,980
So you mean

731
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,050
I'm falling?

732
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,340
It's hard to interpret the signs of heaven.

733
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,530
I don't know the meaning of these signs yet.

734
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,210
However, even if something bad would happen,

735
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,530
there would be signs.

736
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,010
Please spare my life.

737
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,420
I can help you defuse the crisis when the time comes.

738
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:26,570
Guards.

739
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,300
Yes, My Lord.

740
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,490
If no flood occurs in Zhongzhou,

741
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,740
I have to bring you to justice.

742
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,090
I wish you luck.

743
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:41,980
Lock him up.

744
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,420
Yes, sir.

745
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,170
Please wait for seven days.

746
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,300
If it rains in Zhongzhou within seven days,

747
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,460
it would prove Mr. Chu is right.

748
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,860
Please have some patience, My Lord.

749
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,260
Yin Zhao.

750
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,610
Li Ji.

751
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,340
