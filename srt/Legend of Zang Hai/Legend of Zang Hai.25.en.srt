1
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,900
I heard

4
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,210
there was a battle in the Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion last night.

5
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,770
Zhuang Luyin.

6
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,980
Cao Jingxian claimed

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,770
that you were going to kill him.

8
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,180
Your Majesty, please judge fairly.

9
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,130
If I wanted to kill Mr. Cao,

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,490
why would I do it in my mansion?

11
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,330
Your Majesty,

12
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,620
that's because I was going to investigate

13
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,940
the corruption allegation of Zhuang Zhifu, the Vice Minister of Works,

14
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,610
so I had to investigate the Marquis's Mansion.

15
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,450
To my surprise, the Marquis wanted to silence me.

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,570
Everyone who was there witnessed it.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,410
Your Majesty, please investigate it thoroughly.

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,540
Feng Zhang. Lv Gongchang.

19
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,060
Yes.

20
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,570
Both of you were there last night.

21
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,780
Tell me about it.

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,170
Your Majesty,

23
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,570
I was there last night indeed.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,980
I saw Mr. Cao and his officers

25
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,570
give a birthday gift to Mr. Zhuang.

26
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,820
It was a precious blade.

27
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,590
I was busy so I left early.

28
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,690
What happened after that was...

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,010
You, tell me.

30
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,780
Your Majesty,

31
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,450
I left with him last night as well.

32
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,690
However,

33
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,020
I heard Mr. Cao's scream outside the mansion.

34
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,060
I saw Mr. Cao run out with an injured arm

35
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,690
while claiming that Mr. Zhuang attempted to take his life.

36
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,260
Zhuang Luyin,

37
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,570
what else do you have to say?

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,570
Your Majesty,

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,380
when my son, Zhifu, was taken away by him,

40
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,660
he was a healthy person.

41
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,850
When he returned,

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,570
he became a cripple with broken knees.

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,690
What was that for?

44
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,980
The surveillance officers questioned Zhuang Zhifu as per the law,

45
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,570
but he was stubborn

46
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,060
and wouldn't explain everything

47
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,850
so I tortured him.

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,610
The Vice Minister of Works, Zhuang Zhifu, admitted

49
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,170
to embezzling 30,000 taels of silver from the treasury.

50
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,190
Mr. Zhuang,

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,730
Mr. Cao was merely performing his duty.

52
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,740
Why did you hurt him

53
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,520
and even try to kill him?

54
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,410
Because he tried to frame me for treason.

55
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,690
How could I stand that?

56
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,690
I have heard about the tricks

57
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,730
used by Mr. Cao to eliminate his enemies.

58
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,260
I was shocked

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,690
to witness it myself yesterday.

60
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,060
Facing such a treacherous official

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,940
who is corrupt and frames the good,

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,980
do you want me to do nothing and await my death?

63
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,490
One of you is the Grand Master for Glorious Happiness

64
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,900
and the other is the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director.

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,540
Both of you had a fisticuff in the capital.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,220
Are you disrespecting me

67
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,250
and the law of Great Yong?

68
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,780
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

69
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,290
Your Majesty,

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,020
Zhuang Zhifu admitted

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,940
that he handed over all the money he embezzled

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,660
to Zhuang Luyin to raise an army.

73
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,200
I was anxious

74
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,250
and was afraid that he might harm Your Majesty.

75
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,930
Cao Jingxian broke my son's knees

76
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,660
and tortured a third-rank official.

77
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,660
How can a confession extracted from torture be believed?

78
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,830
I have no intention to committing treason.

79
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,520
Please investigate thoroughly, Your Majesty.

80
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,900
Your Majesty,

81
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,370
I think the case hasn't been investigated thoroughly

82
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,580
so it's hard to determine

83
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,770
whether a treacherous official has been caught

84
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,370
or a loyal official is being framed.

85
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,730
Your Majesty, please assign someone else to investigate this.

86
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:25,500
[Lead with virtue]

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,730
Cao Jingxian,

88
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,290
I asked you to lead the Surveillance Office

89
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,460
to keep watch on the officials

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,460
and get rid of any treacherous officials for me.

91
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,660
It's not for you to abuse your position

92
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,540
to get rid of your enemies!

93
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,410
I know my mistake.

94
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,780
Zhuang Luyin.

95
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,610
Yes.

96
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,290
You are a key official of mine.

97
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,850
You should be someone who stops a fight.

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,220
When you face a problem, you should come to me.

99
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,660
How dare you use your mansion guards to act out of personal spite?

100
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,810
If everyone in the capital does this,

101
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,700
how can I sleep in peace every night?

102
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,460
I was wrong.

103
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,140
I was wrong.

104
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,100
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

105
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,290
Both of you are veterans of the imperial court.

106
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,930
I'm sure you know

107
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,490
where your priorities lie.

108
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,140
Let me ask you again.

109
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,340
Is Zhuang Zhifu the sole cause

110
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,730
of your feud here?

111
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,380
Your Majesty, please investigate it thoroughly.

112
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,100
Before this case is investigated thoroughly,

113
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,330
Cao Jingxian's position as the head of the Surveillance Office will be stripped

114
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,600
as an act of warning.

115
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,170
Thank you, Your Majesty.

116
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,250
Zhuang Luyin, tell me

117
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,900
how you should be punished.

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,900
Your Majesty,

119
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,900
please dismiss Zhuang Zhifu from his position as the Vice Minister of Works

120
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,170
and demote him to a commoner

121
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,700
to punish him.

122
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,050
However, please consider that Zhifu has been rendered a cripple

123
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,290
and spare his life, Your Majesty.

124
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,170
I'll agree to your request and no longer pursue this matter.

125
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

126
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,370
I failed to educate my son.

127
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,220
That's why he committed such a grave crime.

128
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,780
I am at fault.

129
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,540
I request to retire from the imperial court.

130
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,170
Please approve my request, Your Majesty.

131
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,050
As you wish.

132
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,220
Father.

133
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,730
Zhuang Luyin tendered his resignation.

134
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,900
It seemed like he had made a painful sacrifice.

135
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,980
He did it to stop the emperor from doubting him.

136
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,780
He was really bold

137
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,930
and nullified

138
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,020
our attack.

139
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,020
Has the hostage been found?

140
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,220
We've searched all over the capital.

141
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,900
We also have men keeping a close eye

142
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,370
on roads to Dongxia.

143
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,810
However, she just vanished

144
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,050
without a trace.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,170
What about her own place?

146
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,010
She wasn't found in Zhen Tower or her mansion.

147
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,530
To prevent any suspicions from being raised,

148
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,420
the hostage's mansion even asked a servant to pretend to be the hostage.

149
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,250
Mingxiang Antu,

150
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,220
what are you doing?

151
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,890
Send a letter to Dongxia.

152
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,060
Tell them the Gui Seal has appeared

153
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,340
and the hostage is missing.

154
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,940
It has been so many years. It's time for them to contribute.

155
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,850
Yes.

156
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,940
[Zang Residence]

157
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,420
Hai.

158
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,610
Mr. Eight from Zhen Tower is here.

159
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,340
She means trouble.

160
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,680
What should we do?

161
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,460
Mr. Eight.

162
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,650
Sorry for making a sudden visit and disturbing you.

163
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,730
You're too polite, Mr. Eight.

164
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,010
Please take a seat inside.

165
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,820
No need.

166
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,650
I came here today

167
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,180
to ask you something.

168
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,100
Mr. Eight, go ahead.

169
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,890
Antu hasn't returned

170
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,300
since she left two nights ago. It has already been two days.

171
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,770
I'm worried

172
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,580
so I dropped by here.

173
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,530
Do you know where she is?

174
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,710
Miss Xiang is missing?

175
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,100
What's going on?

176
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,420
It was she who appeared that day

177
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,150
instead of Miss Xiang.

178
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,370
Mr. Zang wasn't the one who appeared that day as well.

179
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,980
I was attending a banquet at the Marquis's Mansion

180
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,300
so I couldn't meet Miss Xiang.

181
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,730
I could only send my physician to explain it to her.

182
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,460
I thought Miss Xiang was ill,

183
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,480
but she actually went out that night?

184
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,560
Where did she go?

185
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,620
You don't know where she went?

186
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,460
I don't know indeed.

187
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,440
Two days ago,

188
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,490
Mr. Cao and the Marquis of Pingjin had an argument and even fought

189
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,700
at the Marquis's Mansion.

190
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,060
This incident caused a stir.

191
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,730
I've not had the time to go to Zhen Tower

192
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,770
and apologize to Miss Xiang.

193
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,580
And now, you told me

194
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,460
that she was missing.

195
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,890
I'm worried too.

196
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,420
Mr. Eight, if you can think of any other possibilities,

197
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,180
I will help you look for her.

198
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,420
I won't trouble you.

199
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,010
I think Antu is probably throwing a tantrum.

200
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,300
She does that occasionally.

201
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,280
We will search for her ourselves.

202
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,890
We will be leaving then.

203
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,180
I hope so.

204
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,250
Mr. Eight, if you find her,

205
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,850
please inform me.

206
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:18,940
Shilei.

207
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,010
I've dressed

208
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,530
all her wounds.

209
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,820
However, the people I trust are all men.

210
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,300
It's inconvenient for me to take care of her.

211
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,250
I have no choice but to trouble you, Master.

212
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,700
The wound on her body is serious,

213
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,650
but the wound on her heart probably hurts more.

214
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,820
You are really cruel to a lady.

215
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,250
She is my enemy.

216
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,700
Let me ask you.

217
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,300
Are you going to kill her?

218
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,770
I must avenge my family.

219
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,610
Let me go.

220
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,060
Otherwise...

221
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,700
Otherwise...

222
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,460
She has taken Guanfeng's Tendon-weakening Powder.

223
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,730
She won't feel any strength in her limbs but it won't harm her health.

224
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,220
Zang Hai,

225
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,700
I'm not the one you are looking for.

226
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,100
This place

227
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,010
is so empty.

228
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,980
How can you let a lady live comfortably here?

229
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,370
I'm going to get a couple of robes.

230
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,610
Have a nice chat,

231
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,010
both of you.

232
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,730
Your thigh is bleeding again.

233
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,940
I'll ask Master to dress it for you.

234
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,370
Zang Hai.

235
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,530
I'll tell you again.

236
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,580
Your enemy isn't me.

237
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,340
I don't know

238
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,460
about your parents.

239
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,060
You colluded with Cao Jingxian

240
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,940
to steal the Gui Seal that night.

241
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,820
Your desire for the Gui Seal

242
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,700
caused my whole family to be annihilated ten years ago.

243
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,730
I returned to the capital

244
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,530
in hopes of killing my enemy one day.

245
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,530
I was meeting with Cao Jingxian,

246
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,250
but it was all for the Gui Seal.

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,850
You kept saying that I colluded with him.

248
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,890
But don't forget

249
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,250
that I helped you kill his foster son.

250
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,180
If I was working with him,

251
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,760
do you think you would still be alive now?

252
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,530
Aren't you keeping me alive

253
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,180
just to make a fool out of me?

254
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,460
Yes.

255
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,490
I am extremely foolish.

256
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,170
Before I find out the truth about this,

257
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,890
I have no choice but to keep you here.

258
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,490
I am a princess of Dongxia.

259
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,780
Aren't you afraid

260
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,890
that your emperor will punish you for treating me like this?

261
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,440
Forgive me, Your Highness.

262
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,980
Well,

263
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,820
let me out

264
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,500
and I will help you find your enemy.

265
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,500
How's that?

266
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,850
If you won't believe me

267
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,340
no matter what,

268
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,300
you can kill me now, Mr. Zang.

269
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,100
What do you want?

270
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,490
I know.

271
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,460
You are not the mastermind who took my family's lives.

272
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,420
However, Dongxia has something to do with it.

273
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,340
I will find the truth.

274
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,820
Sure.

275
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,890
Go and investigate.

276
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,180
Find out the truth

277
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,980
before you decide to kill or release me.

278
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,560
But if you ever wrong me,

279
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,500
I will never forgive you.

280
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,220
[Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion]

281
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,240
No.

282
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,860
Don't kill me.

283
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,330
Don't kill me.

284
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,330
Mother.

285
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,090
Zhifu is...

286
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,010
Zhifu.

287
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,770
Zhifu.

288
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,860
Zhifu.

289
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,860
I am here.

290
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,180
Don't be afraid.

291
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,250
- Mother. - It's all right.

292
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,010
Mother.

293
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,380
It's all right.

294
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,490
It hurts.

295
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,290
Don't be afraid.

296
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,660
It's all right now.

297
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,290
Don't just stand there.

298
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,570
Go and call a physician.

299
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,980
Physician!

300
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,330
Physician!

301
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,810
Hezhi!

302
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,460
Hezhi!

303
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,440
You are so slow!

304
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,770
Sorry, Young Madam.

305
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,620
Where's the physician?

306
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,810
Where are all the physicians?

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,660
Didn't I ask them to wait outside?

308
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,180
Young Master hasn't healed.

309
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,180
All the physicians are waiting over there.

310
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,900
Halt your tongue now.

311
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,290
Go and summon them.

312
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,180
Yes!

313
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,050
He is just an illegitimate child,

314
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,810
but everyone wants to get on his good side.

315
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,550
Mother.

316
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,660
Mother.

317
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,770
- Zhifu. - It hurts a lot.

318
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,380
It's so unfair.

319
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,050
It's so unfair.

320
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,420
I know.

321
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,860
Zhuang Zhixing wants to surpass you.

322
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,730
I won't let him do that.

323
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,380
Mother.

324
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,950
The Marquis is mighty!

325
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,870
The Great Yong is invincible!

326
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,220
The Marquis is mighty!

327
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,090
The Great Yong is invincible!

328
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,590
The Marquis is mighty!

329
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,370
The Great Yong is invincible!

330
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,810
The Marquis is mighty!

331
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,730
The Great Yong is invincible!

332
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,180
Father.

333
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,220
Are you looking for me?

334
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,250
The Marquis's Mansion has suffered a huge loss

335
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,250
after this mess.

336
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,460
I've lost my position

337
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,530
and your brother has become a cripple.

338
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,940
There's nothing left of the Zhuang family

339
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,730
without the title of Marquis of Pingjin.

340
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,220
Father,

341
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,530
what can I do for this family?

342
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,490
If you want to have a steady foothold in the imperial court,

343
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,700
you must hold real power,

344
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,010
especially military authority.

345
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,620
With my current condition,

346
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,980
it's impossible to start over again.

347
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,000
You are the only hope

348
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,460
of the Zhuang family.

349
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,530
I might just be a squad leader,

350
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,050
but there are still opportunities for me to achieve something.

351
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,810
I will make a request to the General of Wuyi

352
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,490
to go to the border.

353
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,250
There's no need to go to war.

354
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,460
I still have other methods.

355
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,860
Father, are you saying...

356
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,180
Zhixing,

357
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,530
I want you to participate in the imperial martial arts examination.

358
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,660
If you can become a martial arts scholar,

359
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,290
it is better than achieving anything on the battlefield.

360
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,050
Martial arts scholar?

361
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,810
Although I've returned to martial arts training,

362
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,900
I've only learned the basics.

363
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,460
I'm afraid I'm not good enough

364
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,180
to compete with other martial arts practitioners.

365
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,530
You are my son.

366
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,940
You just need to do your best.

367
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,090
Yes, Father.

368
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,770
The Marquis left early in the morning?

369
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,460
Yes.

370
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,010
He went to Lingyue Tower today.

371
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,010
He also invited a few officials from the Ministry of War.

372
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,930
Ministry of War?

373
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,140
They used to be the Marquis's retainers.

374
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,860
The page you sent

375
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,330
inquired about them.

376
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,860
All these officials are the imperial martial arts examination invigilators.

377
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,860
It seems like the Marquis is determined

378
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,860
to help Zhuang Zhixing become a martial arts scholar.

379
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,490
He no longer cares about me and my son!

380
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,330
My Lady, calm down.

381
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,140
Your health is more important.

382
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,220
The Marquis of Pingjin asked you to join the imperial martial arts examination?

383
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,980
Yes.

384
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,460
Do you think I can win?

385
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,810
You are cut out to practice martial arts,

386
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,330
but you started too late.

387
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,900
You've only stayed in the military camp for a few months.

388
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,860
Although you've improved quickly,

389
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,860
those who participate in the imperial martial arts examination

390
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,900
have had at least ten years of training.

391
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,770
It might be difficult for you to get first place.

392
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,490
However, I still want to give it a shot.

393
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,140
My father's trust

394
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,180
was once deemed unattainable.

395
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,490
But now that I have it,

396
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,490
I realize

397
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,620
it's not steady.

398
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,940
I must have a steady foothold in the imperial court.

399
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,010
The Zhuang family has suffered a great loss now.

400
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,940
If I can become the martial arts scholar,

401
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,570
I can make others see me

402
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,380
and the Marquis's Mansion in a new light.

403
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,220
It seems you're thinking further ahead

404
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,700
than I am these days.

405
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,530
Did the Marquis say anything else?

406
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,660
He only asked me to do my best

407
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,250
and didn't say anything else.

408
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,330
There's only half a month until the examination.

409
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,010
I will practice day and night.

410
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,730
The chance might be slim,

411
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,140
but I'll seize it.

412
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,570
Since you are determined to do this,

413
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,050
you should be prepared.

414
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,220
You can't change yourself completely

415
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,730
within half a month,

416
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,290
but the strategies and skills during a fight

417
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,050
can be improved quickly.

418
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,660
I will ask Shilei to train you well.

419
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,940
Thank you, Mr. Zang.

420
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,700
The first test of the examination,

421
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,660
stratagem.

422
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm done.

423
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,330
The second test of the examination,

424
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,460
sparring.

425
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,730
Han Cheng versus Shi Cang.

426
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,140
Zheng Minglang versus Zeng Wenxuan.

427
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,290
Ye Xingwang versus Kang Hao.

428
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,570
Long Feihu versus Zhuang Zhixing.

429
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,900
Great!

430
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,770
Great!

431
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,490
The final winner of the sparring test are

432
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,620
Zhuang Zhixing

433
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,490
and Fang Lei.

434
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,710
These two people will compete to become the martial arts scholar

435
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,940
in the final test tomorrow.

436
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,530
The final test is horseback archery.

437
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,730
The first person

438
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,290
who returns with the box on the tree in the forest

439
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,330
wins the competition.

440
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,530
Are you tailing me?

441
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,660
I'm just going to say this.

442
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,570
I found it first.

443
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,900
I'm giving this box to you.

444
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,330
I don't want it.

445
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,530
You're a coward.

446
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,560
A wise man picks his battle.

447
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,180
Compared to becoming the scholar,

448
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,980
my life is more important.

449
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,050
You are wrong.

450
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,940
Not only do I want your box,

451
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,380
but I also want your life.

452
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,220
Trying to become the martial arts scholar

453
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,940
when you're just a mere second young master?

454
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,130
The winner of the final test is

455
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,740
Zhuang Zhixing.

456
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,420
My Lord,

457
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,220
Mr. Zang is here.

458
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,900

Congratulations, My Lord.

460
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,600
Mr. Zhixing has become the martial arts scholar.

461
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,460
Two days later,

462
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,180
he will be appointed by His Majesty in the palace.

463
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,730
Tomorrow night,

464
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,460
I'll organize a banquet to treat my guests.

465
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,570
You should be here too.

466
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,980
I want to show everyone

467
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,380
that I have a successor.

468
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,570
Yes.

469
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,330
You may leave.

470

My Lord.

471
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,050
Is there anything else?

472
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,900
Now that Mr. Zhixing has become a scholar,

473
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,290
he will surely become an official.

474
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,810
In the imperial court,

475
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,860
a person's background is most important.

476
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,460
Are you saying...

477
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,570
Mr. Zhixing is an illegitimate child after all.

478
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,660
When it comes to promotion or a marriage,

479
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,460
he will still be at a disadvantage.

480
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,270
Make him my legitimate son

481
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,530
and my heir.

482
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,690
This is only reasonable

483
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,940
as there's a deep father-and-son bond.

484
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,740
You are considerate, My Lord.

563
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,380
I owe you a lot

564
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,570
for what I've achieved.

565
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,170
You should thank

566
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,820
yourself the most.

567
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,690
Ancestors of the Zhuang family,

568
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,900
I wish for your blessing.

569
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,940
Please bless Zhifu

570
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,170
in his recovery.

571
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,260
Please cure his mind.

572
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,490
Everything that happens today

573
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,420
is supposed to be Zhifu's.

574
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,530
Even if I did something wrong,

575
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,780
I should be the one

576
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,090
being punished.

577
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,170
Zhifu is innocent.

578
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,820
He is the legitimate son of the Zhuang family.

579
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,260
If he can recover soon,

580
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,780
he will regain the Marquis's favor.

581
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,980
Ancestors, please bless my son.

582
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,460
