1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:20,010



2
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,753
   

4
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,200
   

5
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,120
Excuse me.

6
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,640
Was that...

7
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,740
That was Eighth Young Master.

8
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,950
Master Zang, please don't keep our Mistress waiting.

9
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,160
Miss, Master Zang is here.

10
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,280
Miss Xiang.

11
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,460
How coincidental.

12
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,050
I just got back, just in time to catch you sending gifts.

13
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,710
What? Are you in need of my Zhen Tower's help so soon?

14
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,930
Please forgive me. I'm here to make amends.

15
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,300
I was too arrogant before and failed to appreciate your kindness.

16
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,020
I betrayed your good intentions.

17
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,800
Is it too late to change my mind now?

18
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,610
Didn't you say you weren't worthy of my friendship?

19
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,260
Why have you changed your mind now?

20
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,010
Did earning the Marquis's trust make you think

21
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,680
you've risen above?

22
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,300
I wouldn't mention trust.

23
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,510
I'd be lucky if the Marquis isn't suspicious of me.

24
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,390
I've been deeply harmed by the rumors from these past few days.

25
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,770
So, that's why you're here?

26
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,120
What rumors? How come I haven't heard anything?

27
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,260
Miss Xiang, please have mercy on me.

28
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,580
The rumors from Eighth Young Master...

29
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,480
Who said they came from him?

30
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,740
This has nothing to do with Zhen Tower.

31
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,740
Fine...

32
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,080
Then let's say it has nothing to do with Zhen Tower, and the rumors didn't start here.

33
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,280
I came today to ask for your help

34
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,410
in putting an end to those rumors.

35
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,850
Rumors blow over like the wind.

36
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,770
The wind fades, but the damage remains.

37
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,330
Rumors stick in people's minds.

38
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,330
As they spread, people forget where they heard them

39
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,480
and just assume they're true.

40
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,770
You care that much?

41
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,960
The Marquis said he'd get to the bottom of this.

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,700
Are you threatening me with his name?

43
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,530
I wouldn't dare.

44
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,500
But if you're truly blameless and unwilling to help,

45
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,270
I'll have to leave it to fate.

46
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,040
You overestimate me.

47
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,000
I doubt I have the power to convince Eighth Young Master.

48
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,540
I'm certain you can move him.

49
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,940
Zang Hai, if you want to chase power and success,

50
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,360
there are plenty of powerful men in the capital to rely on.

51
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,650
You don't go to them. Why are you so fixated on serving the Marquis of Pingjin?

52
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,970
Back then, because of the Empress Dowager's burial,

53
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,560
he was looking for feng shui masters and seized me.

54
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,520
I was just a commoner. To survive, I had no choice.

55
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,830
I was just like a drowning man

56
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,460
clutching a floating branch in the currents

57
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,850
and trying to make it out alive.

58
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,460
It just so happened that the branch turned out to be a towering tree.

59
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,510
If you ask me, he didn't choose you.

60
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,360
Rather, you chose him.

61
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,460
Sounds like you care quite a bit as well.

62
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,830
In the capital, relationships form a tight web.

63
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,020
Grudges and favors between people are like hidden rocks in the river.

64
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,680
You can't see or feel them

65
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,980
until your boat hits one.

66
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,630
Well said. I'll keep that in mind.

67
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,560
But rest assured. I won't become your enemy.

68
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,100
Our goals don't clash.

69
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,600
That's not for you to decide.

70
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Miss Xiang, just wait and see.

71
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,700
I'll be here in the capital, accepting the surveillance of you and everyone else.

72
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,140
Who'd want to watch you?

73
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,720
Whether you turn out to be good or bad has nothing to do with me.

74
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
 Chili peppers! 
   

75
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,140
That stall belongs to a Dongxia merchant.

76
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,460
Dongxia and the Great Yong trade regularly.

77
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,770
But it's tough doing business here now,

78
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,850
and the Imperial Surveillance Office is always watching.

79
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:31,250
He's just like you said. Without realizing it, he was under the watchful eyes of many.

80
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,730
Never mind. You just made yourself sound so pitiful.

81
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,240
If I don't let you go,

82
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,930
wouldn't I be as awful as the Imperial Surveillance Office?

83
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,970
Your gifts today cost you a great deal.

84
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,810
I'll talk to Eighth Young Master for you.

85
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,030
Thank you, Miss Xiang.

86
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,950
I'll take my leave.

87
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,850
Young Master, what would you like? Have a look around.

88
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,390
 Candied hawthorn! 

89
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,830
These are handmade, embroidered with Dongxia patterns.

90
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,470
Would you like one?

91
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,900
I'll take this one.

92
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,950
Thank you, Young Master. Thank you!

93
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,720
You're letting him off so easily?

94
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,790
Didn't you want to sabotage his career

95
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,600
and get him kicked out of the capital?

96
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,320
I can't figure him out.

97
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,380
From what he's saying, it seems the rumors helped him gain more trust from the Marquis of Pingjin.

98
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,400
He really is something.

99
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,380
Now you're admiring his talent?

100
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,030
He ignored my warning, so why should I bother?

101
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,480
We'll see how things go. The real show's still to come.

102
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,630
 Fresh cakes! 

103
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,080
 Hot and sweet! 

104
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,320
Master.

105
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,300
You didn't even discuss something as big as assassinating the Marquis of Pingjin with me?

106
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,920
Your wings have hardened. You've learned to act on your own volition.

107
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,200
Master, I was wrong.

108
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,450
I was going to ask for your advice,

109
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,100
but someone knocked me out and took me away.

110
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,290
When I awoke, I saw my senior brother, Guan Feng.

111
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,620
He was also working at the Marquis's mansion.

112
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,410
   

113
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,400
So much has happened.

114
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,790
Good thing the rumors are cleared,

115
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,100
and the Marquis has lowered his guard against you.

116
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,480
Zhen Tower really is powerful.

117
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,100
They nearly ruined you with just a rumor.

118
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,200
We can't kill the Marquis now.

119
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,290
I need to keep serving him to find out who the third person is.

120
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,170
Since it was three people plotting together,

121
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,260
my guess is they're of similar standing.

122
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,930
Not necessarily.

123
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,920
It's been years. Officials rise and fall.

124
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,140
Someone will slip through the net.

125
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:45,570
We cannot rule out a noble, a rich merchant, or even a commoner.

126
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,350
I didn't think of that.

127
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,950
If so, the investigation could take forever.

128
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,140
If only the Marquis would just tell us himself.

129
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,630
That'd make it easy.

130
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,950
Master, you're right.

131
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,920
I was joking. You took that seriously?

132
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,150
No, there is a way to make him say it himself.

133
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,380
But I can't ask him.

134
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,510
No matter how close we are,

135
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,570
if I bring it up, he'll get suspicious immediately.

136
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,050
So, I need someone else,

137
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:36,430
someone who can get information out of him for me and open up his mouth.

138
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,700
Then it has to be the people closest to him.

139
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,410
His principal wife, Jiang Xiang, was born into nobility and regards herself highly.

140
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,290
Even if you are of value to her, she'll still order you around like a dog.

141
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,050
The same goes for Zhuang Zhifu.

142
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,340
Besides, I've drawn too much attention.

143
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,690
Both Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao died because of me.

144
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,630
They won't trust me easily.

145
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,550
So, that leaves one person.

146
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,200
Too bad Zhuang Zhixing is too weak.

147
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,490
Otherwise, he'd really be a solid choice.

148
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,590
No. He is the best choice.

149
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,600
But everyone in the capital knows the Marquis looks down on him.

150
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,070
Are you sure you want him?

151
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,670
Yes. I'll help him earn the Marquis's favor and trust.

152
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,000
Then he can ask for me.

153
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,550
Why would he help you?

154
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,240
Because people move for one thing: Self-interest.

155
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,170
And what do you have to offer?

156
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,690
I'll help him become the Marquis residence's heir.

157
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,100
The heir?

158
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,050
Zhuang Zhifu is the legitimate son of the residence.

159
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,340
Zhuang Zhixing is just a lost cause.

160
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,630
How could he possibly compete?

161
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,550
The difficulty is precisely why he'll be tempted.

162
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,050
I help him rise,

163
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,170
and he helps me learn the Marquis's secret.

164
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,720
It's very fair.

165
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,550
Besides, I heard his birth mother

166
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,200
was once deeply favored by the Marquis.

167
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,170
But both mother and son gradually got cast aside.

168
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,600
That kind of fall from grace is hard to live with.

169
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,650
So, I believe he won't turn me down.

170
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,698
   

171
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:02,550
   

172
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:10,160
   

173
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,850
All of you, leave.

174
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:37,350
   

175
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,270
 Great Yong is invincible! 

176
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,670
 The Marquis is mighty! 

177
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,320
 Great Yong is invincible! 

178
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,750
 The Marquis is mighty! 

179
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,600
 Great Yong is invincible! 

180
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,910
 The Marquis is mighty! 

181
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,670
 Great Yong is invincible! 

182
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,000
 The Marquis is mighty! 

183
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Great Yong is invincible! 

184
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,280
 Summon the Princess of Dongxia! 

185
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,390
 Greetings, Your Majesty. 

186
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,040
 Quickly, kneel. 

187
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,240
 Hurry. Bow. 

188
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,010
 Bow to His Majesty. 

189
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,080
 The Dongxia girl is ill-mannered. 

190
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,740
 Please forgive her. 

191
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,140
 It's fine. 

192
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,030
 She will be educated by our Yong ways. 

193
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,180
 From now on, she is no longer Dongxia's princess. 

194
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,510
 I name her Princess Rou Yuan. 

195
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,120
 Luxury brings poverty. 

196
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,150
 As women, we must not be idle. 

197
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,050
 A life worth living is one of diligence. 

198
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,340
 A year's success begins in spring. 

199
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,740
 Tea and wine, well prepared, bring honor to the home. 

200
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,600
 As the sun sets behind the hills, 

201
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,720
 offer guests a place to stay. 

202
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,740
 Light the lamps, and prepare the beds. 

203
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,310
 Be polite and respectful... 

204
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,720
 Where did she go? Look carefully. 

205
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,490
 Unbelievable! 

206
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,030
 Madam Ge, a girl ran into the palace. 

207
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,980
 Did you see her? 

208
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,550
 I think... I think she went that way. 

209
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,960
 Your Highness, wait here. 

210
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,840
 Let's check over there. 

211
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,250
 Yes. 

212
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,700
 They're gone. 

213
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,390
 Why didn't you tell them? 

214
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,020
 You didn't do anything wrong. Why should I? 

215
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,270
 Isn't sneaking in a bad thing? 

216
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,130
 To me, sneaking out is worse. 

217
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,740
 I'm exhausted. 

218
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,960
 I finally got out on my own. 

219
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,030
 Do they watch you that closely? 

220
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,150
 Yeah. 

221
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,100
 Someone always follows me. 

222
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,350
 I'm not allowed to talk to others freely. 

223
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,640
 Aren't you free today? 

224
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,720
 If you want, I have lots of methods. 

225
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,660
 Then let's sneak out together more often. 

226
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:22,693
   

227
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,640
 I'll take this one. 

228
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,800
 Let me pin it for you. 

229
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,070
 Let me see. 

230
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,720
 How is it? 

231
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,400
 I think it's still not good enough. 

232
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,040
 Then let's try the next shop. 

233
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,000
 So? Did you finish your assignments today? 

234
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,510
 After all these years, the teachers are always going on about the same stuff, 

235
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,750
 like Great Yong's etiquette and its glorious history. 

236
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,790
 I'm so sick of hearing it. 

237
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,310
 Poor them. 

238
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,460
 Now, what story are you telling me today? 

239
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,410
 All right. Your Highness, what would you like to hear? 

240
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,880
 A tragic romance or a stirring tale of revenge? 

241
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,760
 I want to hear a story from Dongxia. 

242
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,730
 Sure. 

243
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,380
 I'll tell you a tale... 

244
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,610
 A tale of... 

245
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,100
 a Dongxia songstress who fell for a scholar from the Great Yong. 

246
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,510
 Liar. That's not even a real story. 

247
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,010
 I've never been to Dongxia. 

248
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,650
 You should be amazed I can even make up such a story. 

249
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,570
 Unless you can take me to Dongxia someday. 

250
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,620
 What's wrong? 

251
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,380
 Missing home again? 

252
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,520
 No. 

253
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,730
 Have you thought about the future? 

254
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,440
 I have. 

255
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,780
 Well, not too clearly. 

256
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,880
 But I do know I hate doing needlework. 

257
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,905
 And I hate the books my father makes me read. 

258
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:27,720
 They're so dull. 

259
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,210
 What I love is sitting around in alleys and tea houses, 

260
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,270
 listening to gossip, and turning it into stories. 

261
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,910
 If I can tell them with shadow puppets, that would be perfect! 

262
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,240
 If you perform stories with shadow puppets, 

263
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,680
 you'll definitely draw big crowds. 

264
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,380
 By the end of the day, 

265
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,750
 you'll have more tips than you can count. 

266
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,030
 I'll follow you with a sack to collect them! 

267
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,750
 You little money grubber! 

268
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,530
 Look at you. Where's your royal grace? 

269
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,290
 I hope... 

270
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,590
 I hope one day, 

271
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,480
 our Dongxia's children can eat candied hawthorn, too, 

272
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,120
 and that our people can live as well as those in the Great Yong. 

273
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,150
 I believe it. 

274
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,050
 With a princess like you, Dongxia will see that day. 

275
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,790
 But I'm stuck here in the capital. 

276
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,590
 There's nothing I can do. 

277
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,500
 As a princess, 

278
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,220
 what use am I then? 

279
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,500
 In Great Yong, we have a saying: "Take things as they come." 

280
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,350
 Since we can't change the past, 

281
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,070
 we should do our best with what we have now. 

282
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,550
 As for your people in Dongxia... 

283
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,160
 Though you're in Great Yong now, 

284
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,040
 I believe one day, you'll find a way to help them. 

285
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,310
   

286
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,950
 That's odd. This place is usually packed. 

287
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,480
 Why is it so quiet today? 

288
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,600
 Because it's not open yet. 

289
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,100
 Look. 

290
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,000
 When did Chen Tower become Zhen Tower? 
   

291
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,850
 Chen Tower was doing badly in business and lost a lot of money, 

292
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,550
 so I bought it for cheap. 

293
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,480
 Even the Emperor approved it. 

294
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,490
 From now on, Zhen Tower will be mine to run. 

295
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,480
 The Emperor? He agreed to let you run this place? 

296
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,060
 Don't ask so many questions. 

297
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,930
 This is my turf now. 

298
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,445
 Let's go inside. 

299
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:45,638
   

300
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,690
 Didn't you say you wanted a stage 

301
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,790
 to tell your stories to more people? 

302
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,720
 Now, this will be yours. 

303
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,960
 I'll make sure the entire capital knows you. 

304
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,030
 I'll have them all come here for your stories. 

305
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,240
 As for me, like I said, 

306
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,070
 I'll be behind you collecting the money. 

307
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,110
 Rest assured. 

308
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,880
 I'll make sure you make a fortune. 

309
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,480
 You were right. 

310
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,830
 "Take things as they come." 

311
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,920
 Since I can't leave Great Yong, 

312
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,830
 I might as well do as much as I can while I'm here. 

313
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,750
 I want to give the lost and homeless 

314
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,290
 a shelter from the wind and rain. 

315
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:39,848
   

316
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,200
 Have you heard? 

317
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,040
 The Marquis of Pingjin's second son ran up debts at Zhen Tower again. 

318
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,030
 How much this time? 

319
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:00,600
This month alone, 900 liang.

320
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,610
 What a spendthrift. 

321
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,980
I hear he feasts, drinks, gambles, and visits brothels.

322
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,450
 He'll ruin the family sooner or later. 

323
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,380
 - Exactly. 
 - Come on. Cheers. 

324
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,470
I don't visit brothels, all right?

325
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,640
 The Marquis is a great man. 

326
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,790
 His eldest son, Zhuang Zhifu, 

327
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,250
 is already Vice Minister of Works at such a young age. 

328
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,690
 How is it that the second son of the Marquis' residence is so useless? 

329
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,270
He has completely disgraced the family!

330
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,790
- A total disgrace. 
 - Cheers.

331
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:37,420
You've got some nerve talking like that in this place.

332
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,440
 Who are you? 

333
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,550
 What does this have to do with you? 

334
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,160
I think Second Young Master is just fine.

335
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,880
He actually reminds me of the Marquis in his youth.

336
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,790
He's not necessarily less than the Eldest Young Master.

337
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,930
 Eldest Young Master Zhuang is sharp and capable with a limitless future. 

338
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,310
 - What does Zhuang Zhixing have to compare? 
 - Exactly. 

339
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:59,340
Let me tell you. What Zhuang Zhixing carries is the Marquis's blood.

340
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,550
 He's the grandson of General Zhuang Mu. 

341
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,000
The family has produced generals for generations.

342
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,860
Second Young Master Zhuang is just keeping a low profile for now.

343
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,400
In time, he'll certainly make a name for himself.

344
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,210
- Him? 
 - Him?

345
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,830
You're killing me, man!

346
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,150
Cheers.

347
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,720
Second Young Master Zhuang.

348
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,000
Second Young Master Zhuang, what brings you here?

349
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,830
What? I can't be here?

350
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,400
Am I not allowed here?

351
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,750
Go on. Don't let me stop you.

352
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,760
Second Young Master Zhuang, we were just leaving.

353
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,780
- You enjoy. 
 - Yes, enjoy.

354
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,630
Let's go.

355
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,750
Should I have someone teach them a lesson?

356
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,350
The capital is full of people who look down on me.

357
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,010
It can't be stopped.

358
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,160
You turned me down when I asked you to join me here last time.

359
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,470
Why are you here on your own today?

360
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,160
I come from humble roots. Luxury like this is new to me.

361
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,510
After hearing your praise of these herbal baths,

362
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,860
I started yearning for them.

363
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,590
Work's worn me out lately, so I came to unwind.

364
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,550
I've made a fool of myself.

365
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,590
Well, you've picked the right day.

366
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,350
Today's bath has safflower, red sage, and dong quai.

367
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,550
It's great for circulation.

368
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,350
I must thank you for sticking up for me just now.

369
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,050
This bath's on me.

370
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,700
Thank you, Second Young Master.

371
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,910
Come on.

372
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,730
It feels great.

373
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,610
As you can see, everyone in the capital looks down on me.

374
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,140
Why do you think so highly of me?

375
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,510
A golden qilin doesn't belong in a pond.

376
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:49,370
From the moment I saw you, I knew you weren't ordinary.

377
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,720
You're so strange.

378
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,420
Shouldn't you be saying that to my brother?

379
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,270
Everyone flatters him,

380
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,630
but I believe your future will be much brighter than his.

381
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,310
Go on.

382
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,270
You've got grit, a good heart, and an eye for talent.

383
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,680
I'm certain you'll be the next head of the Marquis' residence.

384
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,510
Then you don't know me well enough.

385
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,310
When I'm idle, I try out the delicacies at Zhen Tower.

386
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,920
When I'm restless, I drink the wine at Lingyue Tower.

387
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,100
In a good mood, I take a boat on the lake and flirt with the girls.

388
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,650
In a bad mood, I gamble.

389
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,300
People envy my life.

390
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,140
Why would I need to run a household, worrying day and night?

391
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,230
Are those really your choices,

392
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,620
or has someone quietly shaped you into caring about nothing

393
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,440
but food, drink, and a good time?

394
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,270
So, this isn't a coincidental meeting.

395
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,910
You came prepared and were waiting for me, weren't you?

396
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:09,290
True, the encounter is staged, but this is real.

397
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,260
   

398
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,200
I reviewed the books of the household.

399
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,720
The principal wife, Jiang Xiang,

400
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,720
quietly paid off nearly 30,000 liang

401
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,030
for your tabs at restaurants, entertainment venues, and gambling houses.

402
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,670
She secretly helped you even things out.

403
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,000
Do you think you've encountered a rare, loving mother

404
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,720
or a deeply calculating woman determined to raise you into a failure

405
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,260
so her son would have no rival for favor?

406
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,030
See the words on there?

407
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,450
"Drawn by the master."

408
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,880
That usually means family members,

409
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,380
so on the surface, the note says you took the money.

410
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,790
But one of the characters includes the character for pig,

411
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:11,090
so what it really says is that a pig took all the money.

412
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,880
When your family gathered to honor the ancestors,

413
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,680
you were out drinking.

414
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,720
The Marquis was disappointed and angry.

415
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,890
Over time, you won't have a position in his heart.

416
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,030
Was it your own choice to not go,

417
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,660
or did someone make sure you wouldn't?

418
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:52,840
Second Young Master, how much longer are you going to put up with this humiliation?

419
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:59,070
Eldest Madam's kindness is easy to accept

420
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,840
but hard to reject.

421
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,850
Don't you want to fight?

422
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,190
What do you want me to fight for?

423
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,810
To prove you can surpass your brother.

424
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,120
Do you really think...

425
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,600
I can do it?

426
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,830
Of course.

427
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,650
Your brother's mediocre in every way.

428
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,450
He can't ease the Emperor's burdens.

429
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,840
Nor does he have the talent to win the hearts of the people.

430
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,020
Frankly, I think he's already peaked.

431
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,790
If someone like him becomes the next Marquis of Pingjin,

432
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:58,880
the Marquis's residence will only decline, growing weaker by the day.

433
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,400
But you're different.

434
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,440
You're bold and free-spirited, having the same energy as the Marquis in his youth.

435
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,390
One day, you'll lead armies and rise to the top.

436
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,860
Second Young Master?

437
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:23,190
Zang Hai, no one's ever said anything like that to me.

438
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,960
That makes me feel even better than winning at the tables.

439
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,550
We must have a drink together.

440
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,030
All right. As you wish.

441
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,270
Whatever you say, Second Young Master.

442
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,770
Good.

443
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,030
Here.

444
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,790
This is the Tusu wine I've been saving at Zhen Tower.

445
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,760
Have a taste.

446
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,980
- Here. 
 - Thank you very much, Second Young Master.

447
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,760
Come on.

448
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Zang Hai, you've been looking out for me,

449
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,720
but I doubt this is all for my sake.

450
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,140
There's something in it for you, right?

451
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:23,640
Your brother's current success owes everything to Jiang Xiang's support.

452
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,790
Even if I joined his camp,

453
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,920
at most I'd be just another forgettable aide.

454
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,590
He'd never see me as anything more.

455
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,400
But with you, it's different.

456
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,480
You've got nothing to lose.

457
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,960
So, why not take a chance?

458
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,440
You see things clearly.

459
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,310
My brother's already an official in court,

460
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,160
and he's my father's hope.

461
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,450
Even if you chose to help him, you couldn't do much.

462
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,650
So, you're betting on me instead.

463
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,310
If it pays off, you'll win big, all by yourself.

464
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,400
You know how to gamble.

465
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,450
I could never match you, Second Young Master.

466
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,000
Zang Hai, after talking to you today,

467
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,590
I realize there's actually someone in the residence who cares about me and thinks on my behalf.

468
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,680
Come on.

469
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,290
Here's to you.

470
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,200
- You... 
 - I don't hold my liquor well.

471
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,960
Do you think you're too good for my wine?

472
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,530
Of course not.

473
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,730
Here.

474
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,070
This is indeed excellent wine.

475
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,490
I'm good at drinking.

476
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,200
But when it comes to other things, I'm weak.

477
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,590
All I know is how to enjoy myself.

478
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,240
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

479
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,960
You underestimate yourself, Second Young Master.

480
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,560
You don't believe me?

481
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,350
Let me tell you something.

482
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,100
When I was a kid,

483
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,590
I was once locked in an underground tunnel by a bully.

484
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,780
It was just one night, but I nearly died in there.

485
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,240
So, no, I really can't handle the slightest hardship.

486
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,490
That just means you're blessed, Second Young Master.

487
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,180
Surviving disaster means there's fortune ahead.

488
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,600
To this day, I still remember that bully.

489
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,800
Back then, when trying to find his father,

490
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,310
he got whipped by the Princess of Dongxia.

491
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,200
He seized me just to ask about his father's whereabouts.

492
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,040
Do you know who his father was?

493
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,510
How would I know that?

494
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,900
His name was Kuai Duo.

495
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,800
He was the Imperial Astronomer back then.

496
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,700
But the very next day, his whole family was wiped out.

497
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,500
The kid died, too, of course.

498
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,300
I remember he had a deep wound on his back.

499
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,800
They said those two scars looked like a cross or even a sword,

500
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,590
just like yours.

501
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,230
You're not that bully, are you?

502
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,190
You sure enjoy telling jokes, Second Young Master.

503
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,670
The scars on my back?

504
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,100
I got them when I was taking lessons as a kid.

505
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,930
My master whipped me for slacking off.

506
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,210
Is that so?

507
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,200
I guess it's true.

508
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,100
After all, he's long dead.

509
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,170
If he'd lived, he'd be about your age now.

510
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,230
He'd definitely find a way to get close to my father,

511
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:39,560
and when the time is right, he'd kill him.

512
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,840
Second Young Master, you're scaring me.

513
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,700
A bully and a massacre?

514
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
I don't understand a word of it.

515
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,600
Like I said,

516
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,110
I came to the Marquis's mansion just to find a place to settle in.

517
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,700
If anything were to happen to the Marquis,

518
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,110
it wouldn't do me any good.

519
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,940
Wouldn't you agree?

520
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,300
Maybe you're just trying to secure a future.

521
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,080
Or maybe you realized you couldn't kill my father,

522
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,900
so you changed tactics and came after me.

523
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,790
Am I right...

524
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,570
Zhinu?

525
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,050
You're Zhinu.

526
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,900
You didn't die back then,

527
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,400
and now you're back for revenge.

528
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,260
Second Young Master, you've had too much to drink.

529
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,590
I'll say it again:

530
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,440
You've got the wrong man.

531
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,450
I'm not whatever Zhinu.

532
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,510
My name is Zang Hai.

533
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,610
If you don't believe me, you're welcome to investigate my identity.

534
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,360
I'm perfectly sober right now.

535
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll tell you something.

536
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I've remembered you ever since we first met in the treasury.

537
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,260
Later, when Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao died because of you,

538
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,700
I started to become suspicious of you.

539
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,800
This Tusu wine contains lovage rhizome and cinnamon.

540
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,590
Even old scars will come back after drinking it.

541
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,100
Second Young Master, no one's going to believe your wild guesses.

542
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,700
The scars on your back are the best proof.

543
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,600
We can go right now and show them to my father.

544
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,440
No matter who you are,

545
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,360
no matter how good you are with words,

546
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,980
we'll see if he spares you.

547
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,800
If you already figured it out, why are you telling me directly?

548
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Because my father's hands are already stained with your family's blood.

549
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,170
I don't want him to kill you, either.

550
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,100
That night ten years ago,

551
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,200
I couldn't sleep after what you did to me.

552
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,300
 - Father?  
 - So, I wanted my father to stand up for me.

553
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,200
 Father? 

554
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,400
But then I got tired, so I waited outside his room.

555
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,360
He came back very late.

556
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,550
I wanted to call out to him, but I saw his face was very grim.

557
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:20,770
 - Father...  
 - I knew something must've happened that night.

558
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,700
 Young Master, where are you going this early? 

559
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,560
 - To visit the Kuai family. 
 - The Kuai family? 

560
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,700
 Young Master, which Kuai family? 

561
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,100
 Which one do you think? 

562
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,100
 The Kuai family in the suburbs. The Imperial Astronomer's. 

563
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,300
 Their residence suddenly caught fire last night. 

564
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,780
 Everyone inside died. 

565
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,450
But then I remembered the look on my father's face

566
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:54,200
and the burn marks on Yang Zhen's robes that night.

567
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,400
That was when I started to suspect

568
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,440
my father was behind the massacre of the Kuai family.

569
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,550
But I didn't dare think that.

570
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,700
I was worried that by thinking about it, I'd make it true.

571
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,940
Zhinu,

572
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,360
I know you've had it rough these years.

573
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,890
I know you hate my father. But I can't let you take revenge.

574
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,400
Because he's the only family I have left.

575
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,300
If you try to kill him,

576
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,400
I will kill you first.

577
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,200
Leave the Marquis's mansion. Leave the capital.

578
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,300
And never come back.

579
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,720
And if I can't?

580
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,460
I'll only give you one day.

581
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,400
How did he find out?

582
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,900
He's smarter than I thought.

583
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,000
He remembered me when we first met in the treasury.

584
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,200
After I took out Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao, he began to suspect me.

585
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,840
Although he never saw the scars on my back,

586
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,320
but he remembered how my senior brothers described them.

587
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,110
The scars had faded, but today at Zhen Tower,

588
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,300
he made me drink some medicinal wine,

589
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,560
and then the two scars reappeared.

590
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,610
I planned to deny everything,

591
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,100
but he threatened to take me to the Marquis.

592
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,300
With how suspicious the Marquis is, I'd die for sure.

593
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,200
These problems never end. What do we do now?

594
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,670
Zhuang Zhixing didn't turn me in.

595
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,010
He pitied me and gave me one day

596
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,820
to leave the Marquis's mansion and the capital.

597
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,680
One day?

598
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,900
You're visiting the ancestral tombs with the Marquis tomorrow.

599
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,010
Zhuang Zhixing will surely be there, too.

600
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,340
While you're there, he'll definitely be alone at some point.

601
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,920
Let Guan Feng and Shi Lei find a chance to kill him.

602
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,000
He's not a bad man. He doesn't deserve to die.

603
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,980
Getting soft, are you?

604
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,760
I'm not.

605
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,480
You hesitate to kill the innocent,

606
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,550
but did the Marquis spare anyone in your family?

607
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,200
Zhuang Zhixing is just like a powder keg that can explode at any minute.

608
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,800
Let him live, and you risk your revenge and your life!

609
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
I know!

610
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,900
I'll take care of it well.

611
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,500
If he has to die, I'll kill him myself.

612
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,400
Mother. 
    

613
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,200
I've come to see you.

614
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,690
I don't know what the servants were doing.

615
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,200
They didn't pull the weeds well or refill the soil.

616
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,380
I'll scold them as soon as I get back.

617
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,400
Are you doing well down there?

618
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,590
I'm doing great. Don't worry about me.

619
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,190
Father's visiting the tombs tomorrow.

620
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,560
I'll ask him to stop by your grave, too.

621
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,400
Madam treats me well.

622
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,340
She's never harmed me,

623
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,200
but she's always on guard against me, trying to raise me into a useless man

624
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,500
so I can't compete with my brother.

625
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,800
But she worries too much.

626
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,000
I've never even thought of it.

627
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,250
And I ran into an old face.

628
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,730
I know he came back to kill Father and avenge his family.

629
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,260
I told him to leave the capital and never come back.

630
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:11,890



631
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,240
 "It's me" - Sun Nan

00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,220
♫  I’m the falling rain  ♫

648
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,800
♫  The compass of the human soul is unpredictable  ♫

649
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,980
♫  There will always be people who rise and fall  ♫

650
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,600
♫  I am life and death  ♫

651
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,320
♫  I grant and deprive  ♫

652
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,780
♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

653
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,480
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫

654
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,740
♫  I am the sowing season  ♫

655
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,460
♫  I am the autumn harvest  ♫

656
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,820
♫  I am the kingdom  ♫

657
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,580
♫  I’m the commoner  ♫

658
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,160
♫  You’re also me  ♫
