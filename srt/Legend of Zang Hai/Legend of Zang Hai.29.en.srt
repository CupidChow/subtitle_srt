00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,690
Sirs,

4
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,460
His Majesty is feeling a bit weak today,

5
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,180
so there will be no court session.

6
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,460
Is His Majesty all right?

7
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,690
The imperial physician has treated him.

8
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,460
A few days of rest will do.

9
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,100
But normally, when His Majesty

10
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,380
doesn't attend court,

11
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,740
Mr. Cao handles affairs in his place.

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,660
So,

13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,210
why isn't he here today either?

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,290
Sirs,

15
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,620
please, go back for now.

16
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,050
Zang Hai.

17
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,380
Mr. Lv.

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,980
Let's just submit our memorial

19
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,980
to the Cabinet for the Ministry of Works.

20
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,410
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,260
Mr. Zang!

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,450
No need for formalities.

24
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,450
Let's walk and talk.

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,290
I just came from Hanzhang Hall,

26
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,820
where I saw my royal brother.

27
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,730
How's His Majesty's health?

28
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,010
He's fine.

29
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,780
Just now he was in the side hall,

30
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,730
toying with

31
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,610
those wooden things.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,410
Would you like to know

33
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,100
why Cao Jingxian isn't here today?

34
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,610
I don't dare ask.

35
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,850
You don't dare?

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,100
Then I'll tell you anyway.

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,100
Didn't Cao Jingxian

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,410
give you a hard time before?

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,540
When you hear this,

40
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,220
you'll be thrilled.

41
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,060
I heard

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,570
something major happened last night.

43
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,940
Cao Jingxian was attacked in his manor.

44
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,450
He's critically injured.

45
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,170
The Emperor ordered

46
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,340
the best medicine to keep him alive,

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,820
but whether he'll live

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,010
to see the sunrise tomorrow,

49
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,410
no one knows.

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,690
Why don't you seem

51
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,130
the least bit surprised?

52
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,940
Could it be

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,500
you already knew?

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,730
I was just thinking,

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,170
Cao's Mansion is heavily guarded.

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,850
And Mr. Cao

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,450
is always surrounded by elite guards.

58
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,690
How did the assassin succeed?

59
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,260
Shouldn't you first ask

60
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,610
who would want

61
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,730
to kill Cao Jingxian?

62
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,450
Surely Your Highness doesn't believe

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,940
he has no enemies?

64
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,130
I heard the assassin was highly skilled

65
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,010
and even got away.

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,610
The Imperial Surveillance Office

67
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,690
will have their hands full now.

68
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,890
I just hope

69
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,450
they don't catch the wrong person.

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,540
That's the strange part.

71
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,220
The Surveillance Office shows

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,780
on sign

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,540
of making an arrest.

74
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,580
Why is that?

75
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,170
I'm not sure either.

76
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,170
But your reaction

77
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,900
is rather interesting.

78
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,050
Are you hoping he dies?

79
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,610
Your Highness, how can I...

80
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,460
It's fine.

81
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,930
I hope he dies too.

82
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,370

83
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,050
Father,

84
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,290
it's time for your medicine.

85
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,370
Father.

86
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,580
Father?

87
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,540
Have you found anything?

88
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,020
We dismantled the hidden weapon

89
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,900
and compared it to schematics

90
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,220
by past master craftsmen.

91
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,700
But we still don't know

92
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,700
where it came from.

93
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,850
However...

94
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,900
the hidden mechanism in the cellar

95
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,900
must have been installed

96
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,100
after the Marquis's estate was confiscated.

97
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,460
And we discovered

98
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,580
that after the property was sealed,

99
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,370
only Zang Hai ever entered the mansion.

100
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,460
That level of precision...

101
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,930
that kind of detail...

102
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,100
who else could it possibly be...

103
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,140
but Zang Hai?

104
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,290
I'm going to kill him right now!

105
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,410
Kill him?

106
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,290
It's only a matter of time...

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,540
Right now,

108
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,580
what matters most...

109
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,290
is the Gui Seal.

110
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,700
I have to find it...

111
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,580

112
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,580

Then just say it. Why all the buildup?

195
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,180
Come on, eat up!

196
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,220
Master,

197
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,250
I wish you a long life

198
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,490
and daily blessings.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,490
Good!

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,490
Good.

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,370
Come on,

202
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,180
eat up!

203
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,340
Have some more!

204
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,460
You all eat up!

205
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,010
This dish is really tasty.

206
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,770
Master,

207
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,650
in a few days,

208
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,700
maybe we should let Miss Xiang go.

209
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,180
You've made up your mind

210
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,420
and you must go to Dongxia?

211
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,460
Since the Queen of Dongxia won't show up,

212
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,220
I'll have to go myself.

213
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,770
But what about her?

214
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,250
What's the point

215
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,250
in forcing yourself like this?

216
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,610
You think emotions

217
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,180
are as simple as geomancy?

218
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,820
When love and hate are tangled together,

219
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,250
no matter how carefully you plan,

220
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,220
or what choice you make,

221
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,650
there may be no right or wrong.

222
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,250
But Hai...

223
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,370
some people,

224
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,770
once you miss them,

225
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,820
you never see them again.

226
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,890
Life shouldn't be like that.

227
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,850
I don't want you to have regrets.

228
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,490
You're awake?

229
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,610
Here,

230
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,300
try it while it's warm.

231
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,250
He made it.

232
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,420
He's still going to Dongxia?

233
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,770
He insists on it.

234
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,250
I couldn't talk him out of it.

235
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,130
But I know

236
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,300
his heart

237
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,250
isn't as hard as it used to be.

238
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,250
Quick, drink it while it's warm.

239

[Zhen Tower]

240
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,420
Here,

241
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,340
Hai.

242
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,100
Try the calming tea

243
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,820
I made just for you!

244
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,460
Perfect timing.

245
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,850
Help me take this

246
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,940
to the Cabinet, will you?

247
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,100
What is it?

248
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,980
My resignation memorial.

249
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,370
Resignation?

250
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,010
Don't panic.

251
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,490
I've already thought it through.

252
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,580
Mr... Mr. Zang!

253
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,770
What's the rush?

254
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,420
The court urgently summoned you

255
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,580
to the Ministry of Works.

256
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,010
Then that's settled.

257
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,940
You may go now.

258
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,460
Zang Hai,

259
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,220
you've come at last.

260
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,460
Sir, what's the matter?

261
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,220
A few days ago,

262
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,220
Dongxia reported

263
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,340
they had acquired

264
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,460
an extraordinary treasure.

265
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,100
They plan to present it to His Majesty

266
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,820
during the New Year tribute.

267
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,300
The Ministry must hurry and prepare

268
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,300
the guesthouse

269
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,100
for Dongxia's envoys.

270
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,650
So the Dongxia delegation is coming?

271
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,580
Indeed.

[Edict Text]
the Queen of Dongxia herself is coming.

275
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,370
In the past,

276
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,490
only their envoys came.

277
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,610
Who would've thought

278
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,130
[Diplomatic Roster]
she'd come in person this time?

279
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,630
[Queen of Dongxia]

280
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,730
[Mingyu Suti]
His Majesty has ordered

281
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,220
there must be no errors.

282
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,180
So should the guesthouse

283
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,580
be renovated

284
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,460
to royal standards?

285
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,010
No need for that.

286
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,610
The Queen said

287
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,820
she'll stay in the Hostage's Mansion.

288
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,060
She must be out of concern for her daughter.

289
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,220
But that's fine.

290
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,900
That saves us a lot of trouble.

292
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,050

pray for the Emperor of Great Yong

to enjoy good health and lasting fortune.

304
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,250
May Great Yong prosper in peace and harmony.

May Great Yong and Dongxia

be bound in friendship for all time.

thrive together in unity.

You may step forward.

The Queen has come from afar,

312
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,570
and should meet with Princess Rouyuan.

313
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,530
It's been some time

314
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,570
since I last saw her.

the Hostage's Mansion says

317
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,810
the Princess caught a chill a few days ago

318
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,290
and should not go out just yet.

319
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,940
She also fears spoiling Your Majesty's mood.

320
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,810
Once she's recovered

321
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,050
in a few days,

322
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,570

Yes, Your Majesty.

I appreciate Your Majesty's concern.

326
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,050
It's just a minor illness.

As part of this tribute visit,

100 sets of gilt bronze tack

337
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,420
with cloud patterns,

338
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,570
50 jade-inlaid belt guards

339
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,530
with dragon patterns,

50 pairs of white porcelain jugs

341
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,380
topped with emerald rooster crests,

343
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,180

00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,530
snow-white and soft,

346
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,530
and 150 jars

347
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,290
of aged fine wine.

348
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,660
So this is the rare treasure

349
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,460
you mentioned in your letter?

350
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,220
With Your Majesty's insight,

351
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,570
mere gold and horses

352
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,620
are not worth a mention.

353
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,730
The treasure I spoke of

354
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,810
is priceless beyond words.

355
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,140
It's waiting just outside the hall.

356
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,770
Then present it.

357
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,490
I never knew

358
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,730
Dongxia had such master artisans.

359
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,250
I heard Your Majesty loves woodwork,

360
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,620
so I ordered Dongxia's finest craftsmen

361
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,900
to craft this wooden palace.

362
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,570
It is one of a kind.

363
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,010
And the treasure I spoke of

364
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,090
lies within it.

365
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,900
Then,

366
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,860
open it

367
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,220
so I may see it for myself.

368
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,490
Please allow me to keep a little mystery.

369
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,290
The treasure is hidden inside,

370
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,660
but the wooden palace itself

371
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,530
is also a marvel.

372
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,290
If a Great Yong craftsman

373
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,490
can open this palace,

374
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,770
all will be revealed.

375
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,900
But if none can solve it,

376
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,530
I ask Your Majesty to grant Dongxia's artisans

377
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,050
the title of the finest under Heaven.

378
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,050
I'll open it myself.

379
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,380
What a fine wooden palace!

380
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,530
You really do know what pleases me.

381
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,490
Lv Yize.

382
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,330
Your Majesty.

383
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,460
Pick one craftsman

384
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,330
from the Ministry of Works.

385
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,330
Have him try opening it.

386
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,140
Your Majesty,

387
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,090
as Head of the Ministry,

388
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,530
I'd like to give it a try.

389
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,490
Granted.

390
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,980
Why's nothing happening?

391
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,660
Your Majesty,

392
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,220
the joinery technique used here

393
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,330
has long been lost.

394
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,140
It's a one-way craft, meant to lock, not unlock.

395
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,770
Not a single nail used.

396
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,900
Not a drop of sealing lacquer applied.

397
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,050
There's nowhere to begin.

398
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,140
Unless

399
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,530
we force it open.

400
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,330
I've failed.

401
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,860
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

402
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,700
Your Majesty,

403
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,700
just being able to recognize

404
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,180
the joinery structure

405
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,770
shows remarkable insight.

406
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,620
Insight's no good if it can't open.

407
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,140
No one in Great Yong

408
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,860
can solve this?

409
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,290
Your Majesty,

410
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,900
I'd like to recommend Vice Minister Zang Hai

411
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,180
of the Ministry of Works.

412
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,530
Zang Hai is also the Imperial Astronomer.

413
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,530
He knows joinery inside and out.

414
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,980
Maybe he will succeed.

415
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,660
Zang Hai.

416
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,140
Your Majesty.

417
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,530
You may proceed.

418
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,420
I will obey.

419
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,660
Zang Hai,

420
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,660
this one

421
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,490
is on you now.

422
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,810
Understood.

423
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,380
Azure Dragon.

424
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,180
Vermilion Bird.

425
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,220
White Tiger.

426
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,380
Black Tortoise.

427
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,090
The Four Sacred Beasts correspond

428
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,330
to the four directions, East, South, West, and North.

429
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,290
Plus the symbols on the top,

430
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,050
could it be...

431
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,490
Five and ten, Earth in the center,

432
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,420
this is the Hetu diagram.

433
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,090
Five in the center, it's also the Luoshu.

434
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,420
Nine above, one below; three left, seven right.

435
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,860
Two and four are shoulders, six and eight the feet.

436
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,730
The method to unlock this structure

437
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,860
lies in that arrangement.

438
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,140
Two and seven, Fire in the South,

439
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,660
that's Vermilion Bird.

440
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,250
There's reaction!

441
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,420
Three and eight, Wood in the East,

442
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,810
that's Azure Dragon.

443
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,940
One and six, Water in the North,

444
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,220
that's Black Tortoise.

445
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,570
Four and nine, Metal in the West,

446
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,220
that's White Tiger.

447
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,330
As the ancients said,

448
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,090
the mortise and tenon joint can last a thousand years.

449
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,250
This dovetail joint

450
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,570
is said to be invented by Lu Ban himself.

451
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,660
I combined

452
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,770
hidden dovetail joints

453
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,180
with shoulder joints

454
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,290
and made something new.

455
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,250
So there's more to it!

456
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,250
These joinery types have existed

457
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,530
since ancient times,

458
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,770
but the combinations

459
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,380
are infinite.

460
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,090
This is my method.

461
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,900
How does she know

462
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,180
my father's secret technique?

463
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,090
She's using this to test me.

464
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,140
Solving this isn't the hard part.

465
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,730
But if I do,

466
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,250
my identity will surely be exposed.

467
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,570
And if I don't...

468
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,660
Will this gentleman

469
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,050
be stumped too?

470
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,460
Your Majesty,

471
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,220
I've opened it.

472
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,620
Good!

473
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,660
Very good!

474
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,530
Guards!

475
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,180
Is this Dongxia's gift to me,

476
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,420
a jade fetus?

477
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,290
Your Majesty is wise indeed.

478
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,180
This jade fetus was unearthed on Mount Dansui.

479
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,250
It carries the spirit of Heaven and Earth,

480
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,380
and the essence of sun and moon.

481
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,940
The jade is shaped

482
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,090
like a sleeping child.

483
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,530
In Dongxia legend,

484
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,860
jade fetuses are believed to have souls.

485
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,530
I ask Your Majesty's permission

486
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,530
to enshrine it

487
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,770
at an auspicious site.

488
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,530
It will bless Great Yong with eternal rule.

489
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,900
You are thoughtful indeed.

490
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,140
This matter

491
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,860
will be handed to the Ministry of Rites.

492
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,730
Huang Shen...

493
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,460
Your Majesty,

494
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,570
let the expert take the lead.

495
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,140
I think Mr. Zang here

496
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,420
is the right choice.

497
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,010
Fair enough.

498
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,490
Since he solved the wooden palace,

499
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,460
perhaps...

500
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,770
he's fated with this jade as well.

501
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,180
I approve.

502
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,770
Let him choose the site for the jade fetus,

503
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,140
and show you the splendor

504
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,700
of Great Yong's land.

505
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,010
I will obey.

506
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,420
[Zang Residence]

507
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,380
Sir,

508
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,090
uh...

509
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,010
That fierce Miss Xiang

510
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,700
is asking for you.

511
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,490
What did she do to you?

512
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,250
I brought her pigeon soup,

513
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:48,810
and...

514
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,770
she knocked it over.

515
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,420
Then she yelled at me.

516
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,490
She said

517
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,860
I'm a rotten grape,

518
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,380
full of bad ideas.

519
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,860
If you wanted to curse someone,

520
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,090
why curse Shilei?

521
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,380
Just curse me.

522
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,330
You've kept me locked up for so long.

523
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,700
Can't I vent a little?

524
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,490
Besides,

525
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,050
if I didn't curse him,

526
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,900
would you have come?

527
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,290
That reminds me

528
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,290
you still owe me a favor.

529
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,420
If I say it,

530
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,980
you can't refuse.

531
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,620
Say it.

532
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,010
I want you to let me go.

533
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,730
Fine.

534
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,900
You'll be free soon enough.

535
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,620
You'll really let me go?

536
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,810
What do we do

537
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:53,860
with these two?

538
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,460
You know Hai best.

539
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,900
What do you think?

540
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,090
No way out.

541
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,860
I'd say

542
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,170
it's a light in the dark.

543
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,650
You didn't even finish training him.

544
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,460
How do you know

545
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,340
they will find a way out?

546
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,420
Hai, seriously,

547
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,170
let a young woman

548
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,340
twist his heart into knots.

549
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,610
You're responsible too.

550
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,650
What right do you have to scold him?

551
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,300
I...

552
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,210
I only taught him how to deceive.

553
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,420
I know nothing about love.

554
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,490
In this life,

555
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,300
you still need

556
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,300
something genuine.

557
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,650
It can't all be lies.

558
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,340
Your mother's here.

559
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,570
She's in the Capital?

560
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,170
You saw her?

561
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,420
Your mother

562
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,380
is ten times sharper

563
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,170
than the Marquis of Pingjin or Cao Jingxian.

564
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,980
She's already tested

565
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,690
my identity.

566
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,780
Now that you've seen

567
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,650
what she's capable of,

568
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,820
are you still not giving up?

569
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,980
I won't kill you.

570
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,650
You're not my enemy.

571
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,650
Your mother is.

572
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:25,860
I'm leaving.

573
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,690
Zang Hai!

574
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,780
Do you still remember

575
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,980
the stars on the night of the Ghost Festival?

576
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,210
So it was real.

577
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,050
Your tears reached all the way to your heart.

578
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,940
I waited, and waited

579
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,170
for so, so long.

580
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,740
I finally found my family,

581
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,780
found the mother

582
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,420
I'd longed for day and night.

583
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,170
But I've made up my mind.

584
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,530
I'll never see my mother again.

585
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,050
Take me away.

586
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,530
Let's forget all of this,

587
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,490
okay?

588
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,650
I'm sorry.

[Hostage's Mansion]

604
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,460
Mr. Zang, wait.

605
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,420
Her Majesty invites you to share her carriage

606
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,980
and tell her about the sights and wonders

607
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,980
of Great Yong.

608
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,740
The scenery of Great Yong is stunning.

609
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,170
No wonder people don't want to leave.

610
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,260
You've been here before?

611
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,610
So what if I have?

612
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,130
So what if I haven't?

613
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,130
Was it the ninth year of Zhenshun?

614
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,740
I don't remember.

615
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,490
I know everything

616
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,530
between you and my daughter.

617
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,610
Was there anything

618
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,170
that made her happy here?

619
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,460
Right now...

620
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,820
I can't think of a single thing.

621
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,460
That's not

622
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,860
what she wrote in her letter.

623
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,420
She said there was someone

624
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,650
brilliant beyond compare,

625
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,170
unmatched in wit,

626
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,090
someone she really connected with.

627
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,010
Seems she still

628
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,010
didn't know him that well after all.

629
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,460
I heard that once in Great Yong,

630
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,420
there was a famous geomancer.

631
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,210
If he is here to pick the site,

632
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,460
there will be no need for all this fuss.

633
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,340
Sadly...

634
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,530
he died too early.

635
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,650
Tell me,

636
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,340
who was Kuai Duo to you?

637
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,780
Your father?

638
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,490
Or your master?

639
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,260
Seems he was both.

640
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,980
He trained you well.

641
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,460
Do you know why Kuai Duo died?

642
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,420
Because he didn't know how to adapt.

643
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,260
When someone fails to adapt,

644
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,820
they'll meet their end.

645
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,300
And what does it mean to adapt?

646
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,090
What does it mean to not adapt?

647
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,380
Right now,

648
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,940
taking me to my daughter,

649
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,820
that's what it means to adapt.

650
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,490
Don't lie to me.

651
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,900
I can tell just by your eyes

652
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,380
she's in your hands.

653
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,690
So eyes

654
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,940
can reveal that much.

655
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,650
Your Majesty,

656
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,530
all of Great Yong's people are unconscious.

657
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,420
Only you are left.

658
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,610
Don't make me hurt you.

659
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,380
That won't be pretty.

660
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:48,490
Fine.

661
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:50,820
