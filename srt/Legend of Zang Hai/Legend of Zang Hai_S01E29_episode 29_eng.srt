1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:16,030



2
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,913
   

4
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,970
Lords, His Majesty is feeling a bit weak today.

5
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,380
He won't be attending the imperial court session.

6
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,950
Is His Majesty all right?

7
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,150
The imperial physician has treated him.

8
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,560
He will be fine after a few days of rest.

9
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,130
But when His Majesty doesn't attend the imperial court sessions,

10
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,120
Eunuch Cao will usually handle the matters on his behalf.

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,400
What's going on? Why isn't he here today as well?

12
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,620
Lords, please, go back.

13
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,050
Zang Hai.

14
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,080
Lord Lu.

15
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,570
Let's just submit our Ministry of Works' memorial to the cabinet.

16
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,610
Understood.

17
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,260
Lord Zang!

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,260
- Greetings, Your Highness. 
 - No need for formalities.

19
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,450
Let's walk and talk.

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,830
I just came from Hanzhang Palace, where I saw my royal brother.

21
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,530
How's His Majesty's health?

22
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,910
He's fine.

23
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,630
He was in the side hall playing with those wooden toys.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Do you want to know why Cao Jingxian isn't here today?

25
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,910
I dare not ask.

26
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,850
Dare not ask?

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,360
I insist on telling you.

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,180
Didn't Cao Jingxian give you a hard time?

29
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,120
You will be happy when you hear this news.

30
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,330
I heard something major happened last night.

31
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,470
Cao Jingxian was assassinated in his mansion.

32
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,280
He's critically injured.

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,360
His Majesty ordered the best medicine to keep him alive

34
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,420
but whether he'll live to see the sunrise tomorrow,

35
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,510
no one knows.

36
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,870
Why aren't you surprised by this?

37
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,400
Could it be you already knew?

38
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,800
I was just thinking, Cao Mansion is heavily guarded.

39
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,470
Eunuch Cao is always surrounded by elite bodyguards.

40
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,870
How did the assassin succeed?

41
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,640
Shouldn't you first ask who would want to kill Cao Jingxian?

42
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,740
Surely Your Highness doesn't think he doesn't have any enemies?

43
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,670
I heard the assassin was highly skilled and even got away.

44
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,490
The Imperial Surveillance Office will have its hands full now.

45
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,250
I just hope they don't catch the wrong person.

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,190
That's the strange part.

47
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,800
The Surveillance Office shows no sign of making an arrest.

48
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,040
Why is that?

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,850
I'm not sure either.

50
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,390
But your reaction is rather interesting.

51
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,850
Are you hoping he will die?

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,690
Your Highness, how can I...

53
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,430
It's fine.

54
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,930
I hope he will die as well.

55
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,470
The deer blood is here!

56
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,390
Foster Father, it's time for your medicine.

57
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,370
Foster Father.

58
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,480
Foster Father?

59
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,700
Have you found anything?

60
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,190
We dismantled the hidden weapon

61
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,830
and compared it with the master craftsmen's drawings from past dynasties.

62
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,500
But we still don't know where it came from.

63
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,260
However... the hidden mechanism in the cellar

64
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,630
should have been installed after the Marquis' estate was confiscated.

65
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,720
And we discovered that after the property was sealed,

66
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,370
Zang Hai was the only one who entered the mansion.

67
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,460
That level of precision...

68
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,030
That kind of detail...

69
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,000
Who else could it possibly be...

70
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,140
but Zang Hai?

71
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,190
I'm going to kill him right now!

72
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,310
Kill him?

73
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,790
It's only a matter of time...

74
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,550
Right now, what matters most...

75
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,290
is the Gui Seal.

76
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,600
I have to find it...

77
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,500
- Foster Father. 
 - If I can't get the Gui Seal...

78
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,950
- Foster Father! 
 - I...

79
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,720
Foster Father!

80
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,560
- Foster Father! 
 - Foster Father! Foster Father!

81
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,460
- Foster Father! 
 - Foster Father!

82
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,580
- Someone! 
 - Help!

83
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,580
Quick!

84
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,070
Hurry!

85
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,409
   

86
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,967
   

87
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,120
Be careful. Watch your step.

88
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,960
It's been a while since you came outside.

89
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,000
The sun's out today.

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,880
Let's enjoy the walk.

91
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,690
Let's go there and take a look.

92
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,960
I've spread the news

93
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,650
but there's no response from the Dongxia royal court.

94
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,870
It's really hard to figure out the Empress of Dongxia.

95
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,060
Her daughter's missing, and she's still very calm.

96
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,120
She has probably seen through our trap.

97
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,150
She won't come to Great Yong so easily.

98
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,750
If she won't come, there's only one solution.

99
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,370
 Come, take a look! 

100
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,220
 Hot meat buns! 

101
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,250
 Just a moment! 

102
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,760
 Just this? Not getting more? 

103
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,501
   

104
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
Great!

105
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,080
It's here.

106
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,150
- Quick! We've been waiting for it! 
 - It's still hot.

107
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,120
- Great! 
 - Hold it properly! Be careful!

108
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,650
Don't spill it!

109
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,500
All the dishes are here. Let's eat!

110
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,280
- Smells good. 
 - Tastes good!

111
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,180
I made it!

112
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,980
- Great job. 
 - Here.

113
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,930
Master. Be careful, it's hot.

114
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,750
All right.

115
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,770
Don't worry. I delivered the lamb soup to Master Liu,

116
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,200
and that fierce lady as well.

117
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Another year has passed.

118
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
Last year was a good year.

119
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,840
Let's hope this year is even better.

120
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,080
All right, let's have a drink. Cheers!

121
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,780
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

122
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,000
Guan Feng, I'm sending you and Shi Lei to the Astronomical Bureau.

123
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,080
Study under Sir Shi and learn some real skills.

124
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,150
I'm not going.

125
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,080
It's nice here, and there's meat to eat.

126
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,030
If Guan Feng won't go, neither will I.

127
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:14,110
Besides, I've mastered the "Horse-Front Divination" lesson that Sir taught me.

128
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,870
- What did you divine? 
 - I divined a smooth-sailing year for myself.

129
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,620
And I'll get a fine steed, too!

130
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,300
I'll ride it to a faraway place!

131
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,150
So, basically, you just want Xiao Hai to give you a horse?

132
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,750
Just get straight to the point. Why talk so much?

133
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,180
Come, let's eat.

134
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,000
Master, I wish you a long life and full of blessings every day.

135
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,390
All right.

136
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,390
Great.

137
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,180
Come, let's eat.

138
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,460
Have more! Let's eat.

139
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,110
This dish is really tasty.

140
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:23,500
Master, we should release Miss Xiang in a few days.

141
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,320
So, you've made up your mind to go to Dongxia?

142
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,120
Since the Empress of Dongxia won't show up,

143
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
I'll have to go there.

144
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,670
But what about her?

145
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,390
What's the point in forcing yourself like this?

146
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,910
You think emotions are as simple as geomancy?

147
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,750
When love and hatred are tangled together,

148
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,120
no matter how carefully you plan or what choice you make,

149
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,550
there may be no right or wrong.

150
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,480
But Xiao Hai...

151
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,600
Once you miss out on certain people,

152
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,720
you'll never see them again.

153
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,790
Life shouldn't be like that.

154
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,850
I don't want you to have regrets.

155
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,790
You're awake?

156
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,400
Here, try it while it's hot.

157
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,350
He cooked it.

158
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,420
He's still going to Dongxia?

159
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,240
He insisted on it.

160
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,390
I couldn't talk him out of it.

161
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,350
But I know his heart isn't as hard as it used to be.

162
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,250
Quick, drink it while it's hot.

163
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,485
   

164
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,750
Here, Xiao Hai.

165
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,870
Try the calming tea I brewed just for you.

166
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,980
Perfect timing.

167
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,380
Help me deliver this to the cabinet.

168
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,650
What is it?

169
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,650
My resignation memorial.

170
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,100
Resignation?

171
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,600
Don't panic.

172
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,750
I've thought it through.

173
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,170
 L-Lord Zang! 

174
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,360
What's the rush? Why are you so flustered?

175
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
The imperial court summoned you to go to the Ministry of Works immediately.

176
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,840
Settle this accordingly. You may leave now.

177
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,220
Zang Hai, you're here.

178
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,390
Sir, what's so urgent?

179
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,390
A few days ago,

180
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,360
Dongxia reported that they had acquired an extraordinary treasure.

181
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,870
They plan to present it to His Majesty during the New Year tribute.

182
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,290
The Ministry must quickly prepare

183
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,750
the guesthouse for Dongxia's envoys.

184
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,680
- The Dongxia delegation is coming? 
 - Indeed.

185
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,090
The Empress of Dongxia will come, too. 
    

186
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,790
In the past, only their envoys came.

187
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,590
Who would've thought she'd come in person this time? 
    

188
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,650
His Majesty has ordered that there must be no errors. 
    

189
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,120
So, should the guesthouse be renovated according to royal standards?

190
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,600
No need for that.

191
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,320
The Empress said she'll stay in the Hostage's Mansion.

192
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,630
She must be concerned about her daughter.

193
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,500
But that's fine. It saves us a lot of trouble.

194
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,150
Go ahead and make preparations. 
    

195
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,560
   
   

196
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,910
   

197
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:34,110
   

198
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,470
She's really here.

199
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,168
   

200
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,660
The Empress of Dongxia seeks an audience!

201
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,550
- Greetings, Your Majesty. 
 - Greetings, Your Majesty.

202
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,000
I, Mingyu Suti, Empress of Dongxia,

203
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,540
pray that the Emperor of Great Yong

204
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,270
will enjoy good health and lasting fortune.

205
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,270
May Great Yong prosper in peace and harmony.

206
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,250
May Great Yong and Dongxia be bound in friendship for all time.

207
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,490
May Heaven grant us peace,

208
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,500
may Great Yong and Dongxia thrive together.

209
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,430
You may step forward.

210
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,000
The Empress came from afar.

211
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,570
It should be to meet the Princess of Rouyan.

212
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,920
It's been some time since I last saw her.

213
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,480
Your Majesty, the Hostage's Mansion said

214
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,970
the Princess caught a cold a few days ago

215
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,790
and it's not convenient to go out.

216
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,070
She also fears spoiling Your Majesty's mood.

217
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,720
Once she has recovered in a few days,

218
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,350
she will come and greet Your Majesty.

219
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,590
Send someone to deliver the best medicine.

220
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

221
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,010
I appreciate Your Majesty's concern.

222
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,200
It's just a minor illness.

223
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,030
She'll be fine after resting for a few days.

224
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,970
For this tribute visit, I've brought some specialties from Dongxia.

225
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,840
Your Majesty, please have a look.

226
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,750
Tributes from Dongxia.

227
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:05,040
3,000 taels of gold; 2,000 roots of ginseng; 100 saddled horses;

228
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,550
100 sets of gilded bronze horse harnesses with cloud patterns,

229
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,720
50 jade-inlaid belt guards with dragon patterns,

230
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,640
50 pairs of white porcelain jugs topped with emerald rooster crests,

231
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,340
300 finely stringed amber necklaces,

232
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,670
300 snow-white and soft pelts,

233
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,090
and 150 jars of aged fine wine.

234
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,400
So, are these the rare treasures from Dongxia that

235
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,830
you mentioned in your letter?

236
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,550
With Your Majesty's insight,

237
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,480
mere gold and horses are not worth a mention.

238
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,510
The treasure I spoke of is priceless beyond words.

239
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,040
It's waiting outside the hall.

240
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,770
Bring it in.

241
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,720
I didn't know Dongxia had such master artisans.

242
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,790
I heard Your Majesty loves woodwork.

243
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,880
Hence, I ordered Dongxia's finest craftsmen

244
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
to create this wooden palace.

245
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,830
It is one of a kind.

246
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,750
And the treasure I spoke of lies within it.

247
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,000
If so, open it and let me take a look.

248
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,350
Please allow me to keep a little mystery.

249
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,880
The treasure is hidden inside,

250
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,430
but the wooden palace itself is also a marvel.

251
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,680
If a Great Yong craftsman can open this palace, all will be revealed.

252
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,580
But if none can solve it,

253
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,720
I ask Your Majesty to grant Dongxia's artisans

254
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,550
the title of the finest under Heaven.

255
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,050
I'll open it myself.

256
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,550
What a fine wooden palace!

257
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,430
You really do know what pleases me.

258
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,290
Lu Yize.

259
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,830
Your Majesty.

260
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,350
Pick one craftsman from the Ministry of Works.

261
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,510
Let him open it.

262
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,900
Your Majesty, as Head of the Ministry, I'd like to give it a try.

263
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,490
Granted.

264
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,370
 What's going on? 

265
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,650
Why isn't anything happening?

266
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,390
That's right.

267
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,880
Your Majesty,

268
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,680
the mortise and tendon joints of this craftsmanship were lost long ago.

269
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,550
It can only be locked and can't be unlocked.

270
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,070
Not a single nail was used.

271
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,200
Not a drop of sealing lacquer was applied.

272
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,450
There's nowhere to begin,

273
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,790
unless we force it open.

274
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,830
I've failed.

275
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,260
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

276
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,960
Your Majesty, being able to recognize the mortise and tendon joints

277
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,550
shows remarkable insight.

278
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,550
What's so great about insight if it can't be opened?

279
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,860
No one in Great Yong can solve this?

280
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,970
Your Majesty,

281
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,300
I'd like to recommend Vice Minister Zang Hai from the Ministry of Works.

282
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,110
Zang Hai is also the Imperial Astronomer.

283
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,270
He's very knowledgeable about mortise and tendon joints.

284
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,000
Maybe he will succeed.

285
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,560
Zang Hai.

286
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,030
Your Majesty.

287
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,530
You may proceed.

288
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,070
I will obey.

289
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,290
Zang Hai, you must solve this problem.

290
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,710
Understood.

291
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,480
 The Azure Dragon. 

292
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,080
 The Vermilion Bird. 

293
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,790
 The White Tiger. 

294
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,380
 The Black Tortoise. 

295
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,160
 The Four Sacred Beasts correspond 

296
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,130
 to the four directions of East, South, West, and North. 

297
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,190
 Plus the symbols on the top, 

298
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,400
 could it be... 

299
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,350
 Five corresponds to ten and Earth is in the center. This is the Hetu diagram. 

300
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,960
 Five is in the center. It's also the Luoshu diagram.  
  (These 2 diagrams are used in geomancy) 

301
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,620
 Nine above, one below. Three left, seven right. 

302
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,400
 Two and four are the shoulders, six and eight are the feet. 

303
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,260
 The method to unlock this structure lies in this arrangement. 

304
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,650
 Two and seven, Fire in the South, that's the Vermilion Bird. 

305
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,150
Something's happening!

306
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,810
 Three and eight, Wood is in the East, that's the Azure Dragon. 

307
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,240
 One and six, Water is in the North, 

308
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,220
 that's the Black Tortoise. 

309
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,750
What's going on?

310
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,120
 Four and nine, Metal is in the West, that's the White Tiger. 

311
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,350
 Ancient people said that strong mortise and tenon joints can last a thousand years. 

312
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,850
 This dovetail joint is said to have been invented by Lu Ban. 

313
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:28,350
 I combined hidden dovetail joints with the shoulder joints 

314
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,190
 and created something new. 

315
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,920
 So, there's more to it! 

316
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,750
 Although this type of mortise and tendon joints have existed since ancient times, 

317
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,180
 but there are thousands of variations. 

318
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,890
 This is my method. 

319
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,980
 How does she know my father's secret technique? 

320
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,090
 She's using this to test me. 

321
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,590
 Solving this isn't difficult 

322
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,350
 but if I do, my real identity will be exposed. 

323
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,570
 But if I don't solve this... 

324
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,050
Will this gentleman also be stumped?

325
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,420
Your Majesty, I've opened it.

326
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,720
Great.

327
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,460
Excellent!

328
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,530
Guards!

329
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,180
Is this Dongxia's gift to me?

330
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,350
A jade fetus?

331
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,000
Your Majesty is wise indeed.

332
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,880
This jade fetus was unearthed on Mount Dansui.

333
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,440
It carries the spirit of Heaven and Earth,

334
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,000
and the essence of the sun and moon.

335
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,350
The jade is shaped like a sleeping child.

336
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,390
In Dongxia's legend, jade fetuses are believed to have souls.

337
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,420
I ask Your Majesty's permission to enshrine it at an auspicious site.

338
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,330
It will bless Great Yong with eternal rule.

339
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,800
You are thoughtful indeed.

340
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,200
This matter will be handed to the Ministry of Rites.

341
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,410
- Huang Shen... 
 - Your Majesty.

342
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,030
Let the expert take the lead.

343
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,420
I think Lord Zang is the right choice.

344
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,680
That's right, too.

345
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,540
Since he solved the wooden palace,

346
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:52,070
perhaps... he's fated with this jade fetus as well.

347
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,490
I approve.

348
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,340
Let him choose the site for the jade fetus,

349
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,000
and also show you the splendor of Great Yong's land.

350
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,810
I will obey.

351
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,427
   

352
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,440
Sir, this...

353
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,500
That fierce Miss Xiang is asking for you.

354
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,690
What did she do to you?

355
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,170
I brought her pigeon soup,

356
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,040
and... she knocked it over.

357
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,580
Then she yelled at me.

358
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,540
She said...

359
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,280
I'm a rotten grape and full of bad ideas.

360
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,340
If you wanted to scold someone, why scold Shi Lei?

361
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,180
Just scold me instead.

362
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,490
You've kept me locked up for so long.

363
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,820
Can't I vent a little anger?

364
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,800
Besides, if I didn't scold him, would you have come?

365
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:34,210
I remember you still owe me a favor.

366
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,070
As long I make my request, you can't refuse.

367
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,820
Speak.

368
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,140
I want you to let me go.

369
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,450
Fine.

370
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,800
You'll be free soon.

371
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,720
You'll really let me go?

372
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,960
What do we do with these two?

373
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,070
You know Xiao Hai best.

374
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,550
What do you think?

375
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,890
It's a dead end and can't be resolved.

376
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,270
I think there's a solution to this desperate situation.

377
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,570
You didn't even finish training him.

378
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,450
How do you know they can find their way out of this?

379
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:20,390
Xiao Hai is also too extreme for tormenting this young woman.

380
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,360
You're responsible, too.

381
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,650
What right do you have to scold him?

382
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,200
I...

383
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,710
I only taught him how to deceive people.

384
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,320
I know nothing about love.

385
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,530
In this life, you still need something genuine.

386
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,750
It can't all be lies.

387
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,440
Your mother's here.

388
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,380
She's in the capital?

389
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,760
You saw her?

390
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,200
Your mother is ten times sharper than the Marquis of Pingjin or Cao Jingxian.

391
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,590
She knows my identity.

392
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Now that you've seen what she's capable of, you're still not giving up?

393
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,630
I won't kill you.

394
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,740
You're not my enemy.

395
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,650
Your mother is my enemy.

396
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,150
I'm leaving.

397
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,790
Zang Hai!

398
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,910
Do you still remember the stars on the night of the Ghost Festival?

399
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,070
So, it was real.

400
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,950
Your tears have reached all the way to your heart.

401
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,840
I waited and waited...

402
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,570
for so, so long.

403
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,740
I finally found my family,

404
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,420
found the mother I'd longed for day and night.

405
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,070
But I've made up my mind.

406
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,400
I'll never see my mother again.

407
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,150
Take me away.

408
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,390
Let's forget all this. All right?

409
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,750
I'm sorry.

410
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,940
♫  The building is lit up, the fog and clouds have dissipated  ♫

411
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,940
♫  I kissed the frost and also embraced the cold  ♫

412
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:13,410
♫  Hugging myself is like adding a thin layer of clothing  ♫

413
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,480
♫  In the crevice, I gathered some warmth  ♫

414
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,870
♫  Although the light boat has yet to pass the mountain  ♫

415
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:29,460
♫  The sky is dark, why not rest for the night?  ♫

416
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,420
♫  I want to rush before the long journey starts  ♫

417
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,790
♫  And bring along the fleeting moonlight from those years  ♫

418
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,390
♫  Every step from yesterday rang firm and clear  ♫

419
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:45,410
♫  Stirring up many dreams in my heart  ♫

420
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,310
♫  Let me hide in a safe harbor  ♫

421
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:54,260
♫  Tidal waves will not make me panic  ♫

422
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:01,410
♫  Let me sleep soundly before I set out again  ♫

423
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:07,040
♫  Until it's dawn  ♫

424
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,520
   

425
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,560
Lord Zang, please wait.

426
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,840
Her Majesty invites you to share her carriage

427
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,880
and tell her about the sights and wonders of Great Yong.

428
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,670
The scenery of Great Yong is stunning.

429
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,970
No wonder people don't want to leave.

430
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,260
You've been here before?

431
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,000
So what if I have?

432
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,030
So what if I haven't?

433
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,130
Was it the ninth year of Zhenshun?

434
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,640
I don't remember.

435
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,530
I know everything about you and my daughter.

436
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,170
Was there anything that made her happy here?

437
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,560
Right now...

438
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,720
I can't think of a single thing.

439
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,220
That's not what she wrote in her letter.

440
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,280
She said there was someone brilliant beyond compare,

441
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,090
and unrivalled. Someone who understands her well.

442
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,910
Seems like she still doesn't understand him that well.

443
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,260
I heard there was a brilliant geomancer in Great Yong.

444
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,280
If he were here to pick the site,

445
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,660
there wouldn't be any need for all this fuss.

446
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,630
Sadly...

447
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,530
he died too early.

448
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,450
Tell me.

449
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,240
Who was Kuai Duo to you?

450
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,590
Your father?

451
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,490
Or your master?

452
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,160
Seems he was both.

453
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,960
He trained you well.

454
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,360
Do you know why Kuai Duo died?

455
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,820
Because he didn't know how to adapt.

456
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,620
When someone fails to adapt, they'll meet their end.

457
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,260
What does it mean to adapt?

458
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,570
What does it mean to not adapt?

459
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,760
Taking me to meet my daughter now,

460
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,820
that's what it means to adapt.

461
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,300
Don't lie to me.

462
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,700
I can tell by your eyes.

463
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,180
She's in your hands.

464
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,840
So, eyes can reveal many things.

465
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,630
Your Majesty, all of Great Yong's people have been rendered unconscious.

466
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,420
You're the only one left.

467
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,410
Don't make me harm you.

468
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,280
That won't be pretty.

469
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,390
Fine.

470
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,820
I'll take you to her.

471
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:16,900



472
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:22,260

♫  I am life and death  ♫

492
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,220
♫  I grant and deprive  ♫

493
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,780
♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

494
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,380
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫

495
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,740
♫  I am the sowing season  ♫

496
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,260
♫  I am the autumn harvest  ♫

497
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,820
♫  I am the kingdom  ♫

498
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,580
♫  I’m the commoner  ♫

499
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,960
♫  You’re also me  ♫
