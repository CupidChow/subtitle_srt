Antu.

5
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,540
Don't be scared.

6
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,370
I'm here with you.

7
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,060
It's all over now.

00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,410
Mother...

00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,710
Mother...

10
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,250
What about Zang Hai?

11
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,460
Don't worry.

12
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,650
He's still alive.

13
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,250
And I'm not his enemy.

14
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,000
He's not dead?

15
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,220
And I'm not his enemy?

16
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,420
My dear...

17
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,450
These days

18
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,010
must've been so hard on you.

19
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,540
I don't think so anymore.

20
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,660
These days...

21
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,170
These days were hard, yes.

22
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,380
But now,

23
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,610
I feel like it was all just a bad dream.

24
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,220
It's over.

25
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,850
I really like him.

26
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,570
I want to be with him.

27
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,850
Will you say yes?

28
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,770
I can tell he really likes you too.

29
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,980
But...

30
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,380
he still has a deep grudge to avenge.

31
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,170
I'm afraid, in his heart,

32
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,050
you'll never come first.

33
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,450
Turns out

34
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,980
the Queen of Dongxia isn't the third enemy.

35
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,810
But the Marquis of Pingjin

36
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,430
told it to Zhuang Zhixing himself.

37
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,450
So did the Marquis lie?

38
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,050
Zhuang Zhixing is his heir,

39
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,050
his only hope.

40
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,450
Why would the Marquis deceive him?

41
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,890
True.

42
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,820
Zhuang Zhixing

43
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,090
is a monster I created.

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,570
My own hatred twisted him

45
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,010
into what he is.

46
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,500
He hates his father,

47
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,260
but he hates me even more.

48
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,380
I just never thought

49
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,570
he'd go this far.

50
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,300
Easy. It'll just sting a little.

51
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,620
Stay still.

52
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,650
Be gentle.

53
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,970
Almost done.

54
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,260
All right, done.

55
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,570
This ointment of mine

56
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,530
heals fast,

57
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,770
and it won't leave a scar.

58
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,450
Haven't seen you in a while,

59
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,150
you've lost weight.

60
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,630
I guess he didn't feed you anything decent.

61
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,490
Not really.

62
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,380
He didn't treat me that badly.

63
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,090
Then why the long face?

64
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,300
What's bothering you?

65
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,890
The misunderstanding has been cleared up,

66
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,210
and there's nothing standing between us anymore,

67
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,410
but my mother still doesn't want me with him.

68
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,890
She's afraid I'll suffer,

69
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,300
afraid I won't be happy.

70
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,180
In the past,

71
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,090
you never cared what others thought.

72
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,270
You never minded the gossip.

73
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,040
You never took it to heart.

74
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,060
I know very well

75
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,700
he has his revenge to seek,

76
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,260
and I have my own duties to bear.

77
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,090
The carefree Miss Xiang

78
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,940
isn't the real me.

79
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,940
You two are equally bad.

80
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,180
That makes you a good match.

81
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,210
If you ever have kids,

82
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,530
goodness,

83
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,570
they will turn the whole Capital upside down!

84
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,890
So, forget it.

85
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,860
You'd better not be together after all.

86
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,410
No wonder the Queen played you like that.

87
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,650
She's blaming the son

88
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,940
for the father's debts.

89
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,330
I didn't expect

90
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,770
that my father had that kind of past with her.

91
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,380
If the Queen isn't your enemy now,

92
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,330
then the trail to the third enemy is truly cold.

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,450
At least it didn't end in disaster.

94
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,530
So did that lift a weight off your chest?

95
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,060
Master...

96
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,770
I told you,

97
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,060
you're still too green when it comes to women.

98
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,890
When did you ever say that?

99
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,970
Fine,

100
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,650
Your Master Liuchu said it.

101
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,570
Mr. Zang,

102
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,060
Miss Xiang sent someone... with a message.

103
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,260
She asks you to visit Zhen Tower.

104
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:25,940
Doomed.

105
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,620
You're doomed...

106
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,500
I'll go see what's going on.

107
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,140
Hold up.

108
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,500
Wash your face first.

109
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,210
Don't mess it up again.

110
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,740
Your Master Liuchu isn't here.

111
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,890
And there's a lot I can't teach you.

112
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,410
Come on,

113
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,380
wash up...

114
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,970
Where is he?

115
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,100
He...

116
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,410
He's gone?

117
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,860
By the time you finish talking,

118
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,260
he'll be back already.

119
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,760
Mr. Zang, this way please.

120
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,570
Zhen Tower is closed today. Please follow me.

121
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,860
Our lady is waiting inside.

122
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,060
Please go on in.

123
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,220
Your Highness?

124
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,100
Your Highness?

125
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,810
Stop right there!

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,100
Tonight's shadow play

127
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,410
begins with a little carp.

128
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,650
One day,

129
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,980
the little carp got separated from his family

130
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,340
and never found his way back home.

131
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,980
Alone, he was wandering...

132
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,050
and wandering...

133
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,650
A little swan saw how pitiful he looked,

134
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,740
and stayed by his side.

135
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,620
They became the best of friends.

136
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,860
The little swan treated him so well,

137
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,260
always helping and caring for him.

138
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,690
Over time,

139
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,260
the little swan fell for him.

140
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,100
But little did she know,

141
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,220
the carp wasn't just foolish,

142
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,340
he had a mean heart too!

143
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,860
He thought he was clever,

144
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,860
and assumed the swan's mother

145
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,530
had eaten his own parents.

146
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,690
No matter how kind the swan was to him,

147
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,650
he was still set on killing her mother for revenge.

148
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,100
Of course the little swan tried to stop him,

149
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,140
because she knew,

150
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,380
for all his hardness,

151
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,140
the carp was no match for her mother.

152
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,170
The little swan was torn.

153
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,860
She couldn't bear to lose the carp,

154
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,580
nor her own mother.

155
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,220
So she offered up her own life

156
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,340
to dissolve the hatred in the carp's heart.

157
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,580
But it turned out

158
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,290
that the one who ate his parents

159
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,530
wasn't the swan's mother at all.

160
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,650
When the carp learned the truth,

161
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,050
he never cared about the swan again.

162
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,770
He just left her there,

163
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,890
cold and alone.

164
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,290
Tell me,

165
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,340
didn't the little carp deserve punishment?

166
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,890

you're too strong.

216
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,740
If you keep hugging me this tight,

217
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,930
I will lose an arm.

218
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,980
You still call me "Your Highness"?

219
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,800
Antu...

220
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,650
When you treated me

221
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,980
so coldly back then,

222
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,690
you should've seen this coming!

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,290
I...

224
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,930
I don't deserve this moment.

225
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,340
I won't let you say that.

226
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,260
From now on,

227
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,770
whenever I want you,

228
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,220
you must show up.

229
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,010
All right.

230
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,380
I promise.

231
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,010
Antu,

232
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,890
I hope that from this day forward,

233
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,100
you'll always be happier and freer with me around.

234
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,580
Of course I'm happy and free.

235
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,650
I'm the Princess of Dongxia,

236
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,170
and the owner of Zhen Tower.

237
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,140
I've got my family, my friends, and the one I love.

238
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,740
I have everything now.

239
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,770
What are you laughing at?

240
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,050
I'm laughing at someone for being too greedy.

241
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,980
Can't I be greedy?

242
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,580
Look at you,

243
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,650
crying till your eyes are swollen.

244
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,890
The little swan's turned into a little frog.

245
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,260
And all because of you!

246
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:55,810
Yes,

247
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,010
it was all my fault.

248
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,460
So please, Miss Xiang, don't hold it against me.

249
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,010
Invite me more often to your Zhen Tower.

250
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,340
I don't hold grudges.

251
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,860
I always get even

252
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,290
on the spot.

253
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,290
Zang Hai...

254
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,010
My mother's here now,

255
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,140
and so are you.

256
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,890
The misunderstanding is cleared.

257
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,140
I feel at peace.

258
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,980
Then tonight, you can finally sleep well.

259
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,020
I'm not sleepy.

260
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,690
Zhen Tower isn't open to guests today.

261
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,170
But if I want,

262
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,490
I can keep everyone out for days.

263
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,780
Tonight, I want you to tell me everything.

264
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,300
Tonight?

265
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,820
There's always time.

266
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,100
I'll tell you everything one day.

267
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,340
You're injured. You need rest.

268
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,340
Fine, I'll talk.

269
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,860
What do you want to hear?

270
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,380
Anything.

271
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,060
You start.

272
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,250
Then let's begin with the two lashings

273
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,140
I took ten years ago.

274
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,340
Hey, Zang Hai!

275
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,450
Well,

276
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,620
forget it.

277
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,410
You dummy,

278
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,930
just tell me

279
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,100
what did my mother say to you?

280
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,540
Honestly, even I didn't expect it.

281
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,450
My father and your mother

282
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,340
actually met ten years ago.

283
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,820
What?

284
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,580
Ten years ago,

285
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,250
my father was building the Fengshan Altar in Dongxia.

286
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,020
By sheer coincidence,

287
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,620
he ended up saving your mother...

288
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,580
So you see,

289
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,780
fate really works in strange ways.

290
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,380
I saw you ten years ago.

291
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,450
Then on the day I arrived in the Capital,

292
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,020
I saw you again.

293
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,020
And so much has happened since.

294
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,890
There's always been so much I wanted to tell you,

295
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,060
but I couldn't reveal who I was.

296
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,140
[Hostage's Mansion]

297
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,170
Antu.

298
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,300
This drawing here shows the Gui Seal.

299
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,580
Legend says

300
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,100
our ancestors were descendants

301
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,250
of the Lady of Kunlun.

302
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,490
The Gui Seal was one of her sacred relics.

303
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,410
Later, something happened,

304
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,780
and our ancestors left Kunlun.

305
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,020
They migrated eastward,

306
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,970
vowing to build a new kingdom there

307
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,690
and carve out a legacy.

308
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,860
Not long after, across the vast northern plains,

309
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,410
a female general rose up.

310
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,970
She was undefeated, unstoppable.

311
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,490
It's said

312
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,690
she carried the Gui Seal with her.

313
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,540
That seal could summon ghost soldiers,

314
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,580
attach them to the living, and command them in battle.

315
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,170
Eventually, she crowned herself king.

316
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,540
She became the first ruler of Dongxia,

317
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,340
Queen of Fuxian.

318
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,970
After she took the throne,

319
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,250
she conquered cities and lands with ease,

320
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,650
but her body began to change too.

321
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,410
In her final days,

322
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,100
no one ever saw her true face again.

323
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,650
The Queen of Fuxian knew

324
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,100
it was the backlash from using the Gui Seal.

325
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,780
So she ordered it sealed away forever,

326
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,100
buried beside her own body,

327
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,860
and warned her descendants never to open the tomb.

328
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,970
But three hundred years later,

329
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,250
her descendant, the Queen of Minglv Huda,

330
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,780
my mother,

331
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,930
defied the Queen of Fuxian's dying wish.

332
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,020
She had the Gui Seal taken from the tomb,

333
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,300
along with the key that opens it,

334
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,170
namely the three bronze fish.

335
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,540
As for everything after that,

336
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,820
you already know.

337
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,490
In the 35th year of Wude,

338
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,690
in the battle against Great Yong,

339
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,380
Dongxia used the Gui Seal to defeat them

340
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,820
but paid a terrible price for it.

341
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,690
Just before her death,

342
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,890
The Queen of Minglv Huda sealed the Gui Seal again,

343
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,580
hiding it somewhere no one could find.

344
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,300
In the 9th year of Zhenshun,

345
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,540
your father, Kuai Duo, discovered it anyway.

346
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,100
For centuries,

347
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,730
legends of the Gui Seal

348
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,140
have stirred the hearts of the ambitious.

349
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,970
Once they learned its power,

350
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,250
they would pay any price to obtain it.

351
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,620
All these years,

352
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,140
I've been collecting magnetic stones linked to the Gui Seal.

353
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,060
I finally forged this compass.

354
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,140
Once a bronze fish is fixed to the magnetic needle,

355
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,210
the fish's head will point to where the Gui Seal is.

356
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,530
I once worked with Cao Jingxian

357
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,860
just to get the bronze fish.

358
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,380
But now,

359
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,650
I don't need him anymore.

360
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,860
How can I help, Your Highness?

361
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,380
To this day,

362
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,890
your third enemy still lurks

363
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,380
in the shadows like a ghost.

364
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,450
Help me find the Gui Seal,

365
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,140
and I'll help you find your third enemy,

366
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,860
so you can avenge your family.

367
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,450
I'm ready to ally with Your Highness.

368
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,450
Don't rush.

369
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,300
Before we join forces,

370
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,860
there's something I must make clear.

371
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,650
Please speak, Your Highness.

372
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,380
The compass or my daughter, you can only choose one.

373
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,340
If you choose the compass, you choose revenge.

374
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,780
I don't want my daughter

375
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,490
to be with a man consumed by hatred.

376
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,450
But if you choose my daughter,

377
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,970
I want you to give up revenge

378
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,250
and give up chasing the Gui Seal.

379
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,060
Mother...

380
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,730
Don't you want to hear his answer?

381
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,820
Between the choices,

382
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,890
I can't choose.

383
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,750
But before my father died,

384
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,100
he left me with a word.

385
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,930
I could never figure it out.

386
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,620
But after hearing your story with my father,

387
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,890
I finally understand.

388
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,410
That word he left me

389
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,340
was for Your Highness.

390
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,930
So let me offer you a choice too.

391
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,140
Do you want to hear the word?

392
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,060
Or do you want me to make a choice?

393
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,490
You're threatening me?

394
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,340
If your feelings for my father

395
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,340
were genuine,

396
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,140
then why can't my feelings

397
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,780
for Antu be real too?

398
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,340
Mother,

399
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,620
I'm your daughter.

400
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,100
Finding the Gui Seal is also my duty and my wish.

401
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,890
Since I came to Great Yong,

402
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,620
danger has always followed me.

403
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,970
But I've never been afraid,

404
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,410
and I won't start now.

405
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,730
I see it now.

406
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,860
This "horse" of yours

407
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,020
might just outrun

408
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,490
your father.

409
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,780
Let's see what you're really made of.

410
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,100
Thanks for the honor.

411
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,890
From this day forward,

412
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,650
we are bound as life-and-death allies.

413
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,380
Turn right here.

414
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,210
Then left.

415
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,250
Turn right again.

416
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:23,930
Keep going.

417
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,210
Turn right.

418
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,780
My lord,

419
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,170
we can't go right.

420
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,450

Keep at it, everyone.

425
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,820
I'll check other areas

426
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,970
to see what else needs fixing.

427
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,730
Yes, sir.

429
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,170
Identify yourself!

430
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,540
I'm Zang Hai, Vice Minister of Works.

431
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,930
A strong wind is expected in a few days.

432
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,730
Hanzhang Hall's been standing a long time,

433
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,410
so I came to check

434
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,380
if it needs reinforcement.

435
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,730
Thanks for your concern, Mr. Zang.

436
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,060
But His Majesty has ordered

437
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,650
no unauthorized repairs are allowed in Hanzhang Hall.

438
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,970
No one may enter without permission.

439
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,100
You'll have to turn back.

440
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,140
You're back.

441
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,540
What's wrong?

442
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,450
Why are you sweating so much?

443
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,210
What happened?

444
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,730
Say something. What really happened?

445
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,540
I know where the Gui Seal is.

446
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:45,860
Where?

447
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,020
In the palace.

448
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,820
Inside the Emperor's Hanzhang Hall.

449
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,380
Hanzhang Hall?

450
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,250
Then that means

451
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,020
back then, your father...

452
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,730
On my way back, I figured out

453
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,100
there's no place in the world

454
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,300
more hidden than the palace.

455
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,100
Especially beside the Emperor's own bed.

456
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,410
So do you think

457
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,860
the Emperor knew all along?

458
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,450
If it had been hidden elsewhere in the palace,

459
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,820
I could've believed your father did it secretly.

460
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,650
But it's Hanzhang Hall!

461
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,930
The Emperor stays there every day!

462
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,220
So,

463
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,170
my father discovering the Gui Seal

464
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,930
wasn't a coincidence at all.

465
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,650
What if your father built the Fengshan Altar

466
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,690
under secret orders from the Emperor

467
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,690
to find the Gui Seal?

468
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,170
But then why didn't he hand over the bronze fish too?

469
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,140
According to the Queen,

470
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,690
the fish is the key to unlocking the Gui Seal.

471
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,490
I don't understand either.

472
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,340
Could it be the Emperor is...

473
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,340
No, he's not.

474
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,970
The Emperor isn't the third enemy.

475
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,820
Otherwise, he'd never allow

476
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,730
the Marquis of Pingjin and Cao Jingxian to hold the fish.

477
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,730
Besides,

478
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,780
if the Emperor wanted my father dead,

479
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,580
he could've done it

480
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,340
the moment he delivered the Gui Seal.

481
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,620
No need to wait until he returned home.

482
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,620
The Gui Seal is in the Emperor's hands,

483
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,060
but the bronze fish are with your enemy...

484
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,210
What really happened that day?

485
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,870
Aside from the Emperor and your father,

486
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,780
no one else may ever know.

Spit it out.

492
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,730
Zang Hai used a palace inspection as an excuse

493
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,140
to roam the whole palace.

494
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,890
Did he do anything suspicious?

495
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,930
His actions were strange, yes.

496
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,340
Like he was searching for something.

497
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,540
He lingered outside Hanzhang Hall for quite a while.

498
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,650
Hanzhang Hall?

499
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,450
That's right.

500
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,210
Then he left right after.

501
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,100
So that's it.

502
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,250

516
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,730
Of course.

517
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,370
It's my honor.

518
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,020
This way, Your Highness.

to construction and burial rites.

524
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,900
What about your father?

525
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,620
What was he best at?

526
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,420
As the Imperial Astronomer,

527
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,810
he had to master every skill in every office.

528
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,540
But he must've had a favorite.

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,650
If I had to say,

530
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,140
he loved woodworking the most.

531
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,690
This way, Your Highness.

532
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,170
Your Highness,

533
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,850

Twenty years.

536
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,420
If he hadn't gone to Dongxia,

537
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,370
he'd probably still be here now.

538
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,620
If he had stayed in Dongxia,

539
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,170

All the regrets come from "ifs."

541
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,170
But sadly,

542
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,020
there are no "ifs."

543
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,060
Your Highness, please.

544
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,750
We're only here for a few short decades.

never come back.

548
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,020
So remember,

549
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,580
what matters most

550
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,020
is cherishing those in front of you.

551
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,810
He was willing to die

552
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,580
just to protect a secret.

553
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,330
And you're willing to die

554
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,020
to avenge them.

555
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,170
Is that it?

556
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,420
We're all so small,

557
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,540
at the mercy of fate.

558
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,100
My father had no choice back then.

559
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,540
Neither do I.

560
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:03,980
Come on.

561
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,650
Let's talk somewhere else.

562
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,330
Just now you said

563
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,940
your father had no choice.

564
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,290
Sounds like...

565
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,940
you already know where the Gui Seal is.

566
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,580
The Gui Seal...

567
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,900
is inside the palace, in Hanzhang Hall.

568
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,540
Kuai Duo...

569
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,850
so this is the "righteous cause" you spoke of?

570
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,500
Fair enough.

571
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,460
Who else but the Emperor of Great Yong

572
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,210
could earn such loyalty from your father?

573
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,460
As a ruler,

574
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,170
once he holds a relic like that,

575
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,900
he'll secure a legacy for generations.

576
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,690
So your father risked it all

577
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,770
to deliver the Gui Seal to the Emperor.

578
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,140
It was the loyalty between ruler and subject that got him killed.

579
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,460
No.

580
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,170
My father gave everything

581
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,370
to hand over the Gui Seal,

582
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,540
but he didn't surrender the bronze fish.

583
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,290
That was his true righteous cause.

584
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,690
What a perfect balance of loyalty and righteousness.

585
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,810
So in your Great Yong,

586
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,140
what exactly is the Emperor?

587
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,370
He's heaven,

588
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,500
he's lord,

589
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,900
and his father.

590
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,170
Then what's next?

591
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,980
I want to bring out the Gui Seal

592
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,460
and use it to lure out the third enemy.

593
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,330
Right under the Emperor's nose?

594
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,140
You've got some nerve.

595
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,420
Even if you sneak into the palace,

596
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,370
can you break into the heavily guarded Hanzhang Hall?

597
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,500
That's where I need your help, Your Highness.

598
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,020
[Zang Residence]

599
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,900
Hanzhang Hall...

600
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,540
The Emperor...

601
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,650
So what do you plan

602
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,850
to do next?

603
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,730
Shut it.

604
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,250
Let me say it.

605
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,420
Just one word:

606
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,650
He's lost his mind.

607
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,900
He wants to break into Hanzhang Hall

608
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,810
and steal the Gui Seal.

609
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,450
Right now, it's the only way

610
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,500
I can find the third enemy.

611
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,620
I have no other option.

612
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,980
You're all insane.

613
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,220
That Queen of Dongxia is just as ruthless.

614
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,940
Instead of stopping you,

615
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,760
she's pushing you to your death!

616
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,850
You'd dare lay hands on the Emperor's treasure?

617
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,850
You're all crazy.

618
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,500
Master,

619
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,420
I truly have no better plan left.

620
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,850
This...

621
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,250
This is no small matter...

622
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,250
No small matter...

623
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,250
It can drag in a lot of innocent people,

624
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,380
even cost lives.

625
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:23,980
Zang Hai,

626
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,580
are you sure you want to do this?

627
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,850
I'm one step away

628
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,850
from finding the third enemy.

629
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:39,850
Sir,

630
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,540
if you face this,

631
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,370
will you choose to stop?

632
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,420
But the Gui Seal is in the Emperor's hands.

633
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,140
If it goes missing,

634
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,650
the wrath of the throne will be swift.

635
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,690
Throwing the world into chaos or avenging your family,

636
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,140
what will you choose?

637
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,650
Once I use the Gui Seal to draw the third enemy out

638
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,730
and take my revenge,

639
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,250
I'll explain everything to the Emperor myself.

640
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,980
If he blames me,

641
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,650
I'll take full responsibility.

642
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,810
I won't let anyone else be dragged in.

643
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,730
Ever since that night ten years ago

644
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,170
when I made my choice,

645
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,500
I've never thought I could walk away unscathed.

646
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,620
Zang Hai...

647
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,060
it seems your mind is already made up.

648
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,460
In that case,

649
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,940
