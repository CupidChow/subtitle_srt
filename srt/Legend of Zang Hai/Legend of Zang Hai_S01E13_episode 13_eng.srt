00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,780
   

4
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,510
What brings you to Zhen Tower, Sir Zang?

5
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm here to ask for a favor, Owner Xiang.

6
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,950
The capital is holding the annual field hockey contest.

7
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,480
The participants are sons from influential families.

8
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,510
The imperial court's goal is to strengthen their bodies and encourage aspirations.

9
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,020
The winner of each year will be rewarded by His Majesty.

10
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,460
So? You want to participate, too?

11
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,060
It's still not enough for you to impress the Marquis of Pingjin

12
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,250
and you even want to gain His Majesty's attention?

13
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,470
It's not me. I'm doing this for the

14
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,460
Second Young Master of the Zhuang family.

15
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,490
Him? Why?

16
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,740
I want him to use this opportunity to shine.

17
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,840
What happens after that?

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,930
He'll become the son that the Marquis thinks highly of.

19
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,210
Did I hear it wrong, Sir Zang?

20
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,630
Have you lost your mind? Are you blind?

21
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,940
I can find a physician to treat you.

22
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,350
Owner Xiang, please sit.

23
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,080
If one wants to survive and succeed in a powerful family,

24
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,740
how can we just rely on only one person?

25
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,260
Owner Xiang,

26
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,360
we are friends. Please do me this favor.

27
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,350
Don't ask anymore.

28
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,590
Speak. How can I help you?

29
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,630
I need Eighth Young Master to drum up publicity for Zhuang Zhixing before the field hockey contest.

30
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,370
I want everyone in the capital to know that

31
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,030
Zhuang Zhixing is the younger version of the Marquis.

32
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,900
Fine.

33
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,580
There's no reason for Zhen Tower to decline this transaction.

34
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,150
First, we need to change Zhuang Zhixing's image.

35
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,590
This image of a useless idler won't do.

36
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,620
He must be a stylish, energetic, and heroic son of an aristocrat.

37
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,030
Zhen Tower will send people everywhere to spread good news about him.

38
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,000
These people need money for expenses and legwork.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,750
It's at least three taels of silver per man per day.

40
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,300
It's a big city. Based on 20 men,

41
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,010
it's 60 taels of silver each day.

42
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,020
But with your meager salary, I believe you can't afford it.

43
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,830
You have to pawn something.

44
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,950
The quality of this jade is too ordinary.

45
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,630
At most, it's 20 taels of silver.

46
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,580
This is still a small sum of money.

47
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,730
If you want Eighth Young Master to personally do it,

48
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,140
you must pay him 80 taels of silver for each shadow play performance.

49
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,390
He needs to create a new shadow figure for Zhuang Zhixing.

50
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,040
The total amount is 150 taels of silver.

51
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,170
About the 150 taels of silver...

52
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,190
Taking into account that we are friends,

53
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,150
my offer is 120 taels of silver.

54
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,950
Nice robe.

55
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,580
A reward from the Marquis?

56
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,600
Floating Light Brocade, great material.

57
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,160
I will give you a further discount.

58
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,870
Owner Xiang, you must be joking.

59
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,530
If I pawn my robe, I have to leave naked.

60
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,870
None of my business

61
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,170
but it's not over yet.

62
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,520
Wait till the contest starts on that day, this money will double.

63
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,580
Sir Zang,

64
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,080
after the contest ends, you'll still owe me.

65
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,480
If you don't pay me, I'll collect the debt from your sons and grandsons.

66
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,920
This money will roll and there will be compound interest.

67
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,260
Your descendants will forever be in debt...

68
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,680
Stop.

69
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,100
Owner Xiang,

70
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,950
as what you said, I can't cough up this sum of money

71
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:24,570
but I've a way for you to profit from this sum of money.

72
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,120
I'll give you this opportunity.

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,980
Zhuang Zhixing has a bad reputation, but he's the second son of the Marquis.

74
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,800
The affairs of the nobles, secrets of the rich and powerful families,

75
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,390
if we let Eighth Young Second use them as gimmicks

76
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,240
and based his play on them,

77
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,090
people would swarm into the theater.

78
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,310
Your collection from the ticket sales

79
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,720
is at least 50 taels of silver each day.

80
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,160
It's a total of 350 taels of silver for seven days.

81
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,600
I heard Zhen Tower runs a betting pool for the annual field hockey contest.

82
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,850
Few people will bet on an inexperienced rookie like him.

83
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,800
However, if he turns out to be a dark horse,

84
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,660
Zhen Tower will hit the jackpot and make a fortune out of it.

85
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,000
You can make at least 400 taels of silver...

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,850
no...

87
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,020
500 taels of silver.

88
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,090
- Your accounts... 
 - Let me finish talking.

89
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,060
When the contest ends, Zhuang Zhixing will be famous.

90
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,920
All the food that he ate, songs that he listened to,

91
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,220
medicinal baths that he ordered in Zhen Tower will be famous, too.

92
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,240
If we calculate this, Owner Xiang, you won't suffer a loss.

93
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,770
You will make a big fortune.

94
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,000
I didn't expect you to be that good at accounts.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,730
You're better at it, Owner Xiang.

96
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,380
Why do you only talk about expenses and costs?

97
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,710
This is deliberately wanting me to slave for Zhen Tower.

98
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,120
Business is business.

99
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,190
Since it is profitable, I'm in.

100
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,870
However, are you accurate in what you said?

101
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,820
If Zhuang Zhixing keeps losing,

102
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,160
my Zhen Tower will suffer a great loss.

103
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,630
Owner Xiang, please rest assured.

104
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,040
I've hired an excellent and strict teacher to train him.

105
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,000
He'll become a new man very soon.

106
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,100
Feng Liu.

107
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,040
Did Second Young Master Zhuang come here to have fun recently?

108
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,300
Miss, he brought two people. They're drinking downstairs right now.

109
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,940
This is...

110
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,850
Come, Master.

111
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,880
Is this the Marquis's new elegant demeanor you were talking about?

112
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,140
See you later.

113
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,120
Zhuang Zhixing!

114
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,560
Let's leave now.

115
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,860
- Hurry! 
 - Come here!

116
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,950
Don't...

117
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,220
- Stop running away! 
 - You!

118
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,250
Let's leave now.

119
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,630
What are you doing?

120
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,030
Get me out of here now.

121
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,790
You didn't practice your martial arts

122
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,410
and even dared to take them out to drink.

123
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,020
Do you still remember your promise?

124
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,570
Martial arts training can't be achieved overnight.

125
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,530
What's wrong with taking a break? I only took them out for a meal.

126
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,470
Let's not talk first. It stinks. It really stinks here. Pull me up now.

127
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,270
Guan Feng. Shi Lei.

128
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,020
I treated you to a meal. You can't ignore me. Isn't that so?

129
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,750
Zhuang Zhixing!

130
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,720
You promised me to avenge your mother

131
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,230
but you can't even take this hardship?

132
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,270
Of course,

133
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:21,030
if you don't care, return to the Marquis Residence and continue to be a spoiled son.

134
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,170
Your mother in Heaven will definitely forgive you.

135
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,650
Don't ever talk about avenging your mother again.

136
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,150
Sir.

137
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,470
I'm wrong.

138
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,590
I'll go back to training diligently immediately.

139
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,200
Climb up here on your own then.

140
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,100
It's so high, how can I do that?

141
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,990
Fine. I'll climb up.

142
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,100
I promised you I'll go back and train diligently.

143
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,880
What's wrong with pulling me up?

144
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,000
If you can't come up,

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,710
you can crawl through the hole over there.

146
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,970
He really climbed up.

147
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,470
Remember what you said.

148
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,300
Continue!

149
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,950
Continue...

150
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,140
Focus!

151
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,530
Enough, stop hitting!

152
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,910
Come here.

153
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,220
Finish the medicine.

154
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,140
- What's this? 
 - This is a tonic.

155
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,790
It helps you to become stronger.

156
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,210
â™«  The light in the dark night  â™«

157
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,410
â™«  I want so much to collect it for you  â™«

158
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,290
â™«  Fate plays a trick on me  â™«

159
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,980
â™«  How absurd it is  â™«

160
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,830
â™«  I smile fearlessly  â™«

161
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,570
â™«  I sigh at the impermanence in life  â™«

162
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,400
â™«  A human's heart is deep like the sea  â™«

163
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,090
â™«  This life is full of storms  â™«

164
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,950
â™«  The violent northern wind howls  â™«

165
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,690
â™«  Piercing through the wolf  â™«

166
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,660
â™«  Who would risk his life  â™«

167
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,300
â™«  To be covered in wounds?  â™«

168
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,220
â™«  It's hard to let go of love  â™«

169
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,990
â™«  It's hard to hide love  â™«

170
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,860
â™«  It's raining outside the window  â™«

171
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,550
â™«  Another year of cold autumn  â™«

172
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,460
â™«  After settling worldly affairs  â™«

173
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,420
â™«  I'll turn around and face the vast horizon  â™«

174
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,333
   

175
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,050
Zhuang Zhixing is really something.

176
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,770
A loser like him is not enough.

177
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,140
He gathered all the famous losers in the capital here.

178
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,120
Light the incense stick!

179
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,160
The contest begins!

180
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,890
Excellent!

181
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,040
 Red team scored a flag! 

182
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,530
Zhuang'er, you are staggering.

183
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,670
Did you drink today?

184
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,100
Pass to me!

185
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,220
I knew he was a good-for-nothing

186
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,920
but I didn't expect him to be such a loser.

187
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,220
He doesn't have any signs of a general at all.

188
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,320
Is the Marquis of Pingjin his biological father?

189
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,670
Let's go.

190
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,450
Let's go.

191
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,220
The incense stick hasn't burned out yet.

192
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,300
Have you all already given up?

193
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:40,150
I've always thought I was most foppish person in the capital.

194
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,380
Looking at it now, you're worse than me.

195
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,220
At least I have not given up yet.

196
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,690
I will compete alone.

197
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,770
 Receive the ball! 

198
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,480
 - Green team scored a flag! 
 - Great! 

199
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,860
Follow me if you want to win.

200
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,820
Compete against them all the way!

201
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,270
What's going on?

202
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,030
Do you even know how to pass the ball?!

203
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,030
Who are you yelling at? Do you know how to play?!

204
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,880
Everyone, focus!

205
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,550
We can lose to anyone else, except Zhuang Zhixing!

206
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,060
This... I taught him this move.

207
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,310
My tonics speak for themselves.

208
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,240
Time is up.

209
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,970
The winner is... the Green team.

210
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,660
-  We won! 
 - Victory!

211
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,940
 We won! 

212
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,440
Everyone, the winner of the hockey contest is...

213
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,780
Green team! 
    

214
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,880
Green team won!

215
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,700
Green team won!

216
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,990
Green team won! They really won!

217
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:54,320
   

218
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,090
 Place your bets! 

219
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,790
 The dark horse turned the tide. 

220
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:26,160
 They survived in a desperate situation and won. 

221
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,960
They were only preparing to pounce and attack.

222
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,140
This dark horse now emerges and becomes invincible.

223
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:41,280
Let's watch it ride on its crest of success.

224
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,230
Excellent!

225
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,290
I heard that Zhixing won the field hockey match.

226
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:02,210
Zhixing hasn't come home for a long time.

227
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,920
He was actually training for the contest.

228
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,440
Quite a surprise!

229
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,960
Why didn't he tell us and keep us in the dark?

230
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,480
I didn't know Second Brother was that capable.

231
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,000
He's really Impressive.

232
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,270
But as always,

233
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:24,090
he loves this kind of entertainment and having fun.

234
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,800
Marquis, I've heard that Second Young Master

235
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,830
hired a master to teach him martial arts.

236
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,590
He doesn't go out to have fun anymore.

237
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,810
Apparently, Second Young Master is a fast learner.

238
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,880
The Zhuang family has a history of generals.

239
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,120
It's not surprising at all.

240
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,030
He was hopelessly useless in the past and beyond help.

241
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,900
Unexpectedly, he finally accomplished something.

242
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,510
I didn't teach him in vain.

243
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,550
The imperial court will reward the winner tomorrow.

244
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,010
I heard the Imperial Eunuch holding the seal from the Directorate of Ceremonial will be there.

245
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,620
Marquis, if you can't make it,

246
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,130
I'd like to take some people with me to congratulate him.

247
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,640
He's the winner.

248
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,860
As his father, I have to support him in person.

249
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,920
Also, officials from the imperial court will be present.

250
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,030
Go with me tomorrow.

251
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,960
You are my aide.

252
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,890
I'll introduce some officials to you.

253
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,610
Yes, Marquis.

254
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,400
You can leave.

255
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,550
I'm going to meet my father.

256
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,900
Greetings, Marquis.

257
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,760
Marquis.

258
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,330
Marquis.

259
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,830
Greetings, Father.

260
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,210
You often hate to compete with others.

261
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,590
Why do you suddenly like field hockey?

262
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,240
I've grown up

263
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,790
and want to share your burdens, just like my older brother.

264
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,860
But I know my literary talent is not as good as his.

265
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,400
I can only improve my martial arts

266
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,510
to assist you in the future.

267
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:20,000
I didn't expect you'd impress others if you kept quiet.

268
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
It's your first time joining a contest, and you won.

269
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,710
Well done.

270
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,830
I've trained for only two months.

271
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,160
I only wanted to play a few rounds for enjoyment.

272
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,440
Who knew that after overcoming obstacles,

273
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,750
it could be possible to win.

274
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
You're my son.

275
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,020
Generals run in the Zhuang family. It's in your blood.

276
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,820
I'll remember this, Father.

277
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,860
Fine. You can leave.

278
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,250
Marquis, your son is talented.

279
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,460
You're flattering me, Sir Lin.

280
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,520
Eunuch Cao is here! 
    

281
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,680
- Greetings, Eunuch Cao! 
 - Greetings, Eunuch Cao!

282
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,320
Eunuch Cao, you're radiant and full of energy.

283
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,750
Marquis, you are so blessed.

284
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,680
Your elder son serves in the imperial court

285
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,480
and your younger son made a name for himself.

286
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,580
There'll be another general in your family.

287
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,410
Zhixing lacks knowledge and skills.

288
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,760
Thank you for your praise, Eunuch Cao.

289
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,170
How is His Majesty lately?

290
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:25,870
Thank you for your concern. His Majesty is fine.

291
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,170
His Majesty mentioned you the day before yesterday.

292
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:34,680
You should go to the palace more often.

293
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,830
I will.

294
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,000
Please thank His Majesty for his grace on my behalf.

295
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,530
I'll wait for his summons to see me at any time.

296
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,250
This is my newly recruited aide.

297
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,780
Zang Hai, greet Eunuch Cao immediately.

298
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,570
Greetings, Eunuch Cao.

299
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:09,590
Are you the new geomancer hired by the Marquis

300
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,160
who helped to share His Majesty's worries?

301
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,160
Marquis and First Master Zhuang made the decision. I dare not take the credit.

302
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,160
Marquis, how did you recruit such a gem?

303
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,340
Why didn't you tell me about him?

304
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,480
Are you afraid I might poach him?

305
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,270
Eunuch Cao loves to joke.

306
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,510
The Imperial Surveillance Office recruits talented people in the kingdom.

307
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:38,190
My insignificant aide is no match for them.

308
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,650
Although it's the first time we've met, there's a sense of familiarity.

309
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,880
Sir, you assist His Majesty, who has many assistants

310
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,960
and have met millions of people.

311
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,680
I'm just an ordinary person.

312
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,940
It's my honor that I can catch your attention.

313
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,680
Well said.

314
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,550
You're born to be eloquent.

315
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,560
I like you.

316
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,780
I've been feeling very bored recently.

317
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,170
I lack someone

318
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,750
who is smart and humorous.

319
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,680
I wonder if the Marquis is willing to understand my loneliness

320
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,070
and bear to part with this gem?

321
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,000
Eunuch, don't say that.

322
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,670
Among the attendants, civil and military officials in the imperial court,

323
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,480
who can be more eloquent than you?

324
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,040
Does this mean you refused my offer?

325
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,570
Eunuch, everything's ready and waiting for you.

326
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,430
This is His Majesty's oral decree.

327
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,610
"I know that field hockey is loved by the people.

328
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,960
The winners:

329
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,270
Zhuang Zhixing, Mu Zhanqing, Jiang Yu, Sun Yongmin

330
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,450
turned the tide and won my heart.

331
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,250
I reward you with a magpie robe each."

332
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,440
Eunuch Cao is unpredictable.

333
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,030
He personally said he wanted you.

334
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,600
Once you enter the Imperial Surveillance Office, you can't leave.

335
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,410
Go to the treasury tomorrow to choose a few decent treasures

336
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,510
and get someone to deliver them to his residence.

337
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,240
Yes, Marquis.

338
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,000
Tell the kitchen to cook a few of Zhixing's favorite dishes for dinner.

339
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,280
He has worked hard for the past days.

340
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,630
Understood.

341
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,450
Zang Hai is a talented geomancer.

342
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,680
However, I feel unsettled when I see him.

343
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,160
Based on your friendship with the Marquis of Pingjin,

344
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,790
he was unwilling to accept your offer.

345
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,000
Does he want to retain Zang Hai to make good use of him?

346
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,920
Ten years have passed.

347
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,340
Zhuang Luyin is still alive.

348
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,760
Why do I feel nervous?

349
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,930
   

350
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:51,540
 â™ª Where did the green mountains go in ancient times? â™ª 

351
00:30:51,540 --> 00:31:00,700
 â™ª How many people were buried here? â™ª 

352
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:10,550
 â™ª Who will sweep the moss at the graves? â™ª 

353
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:32,790
 â™ª The nearby wind blew the paper money over here â™ª 

354
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,040
Greetings, Eunuch.

355
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,790
You have good taste.

356
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:55,140
You looked for me in the past

357
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,790
to request that I make decisions for you.

358
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,960
Tell me.

359
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,000
Who is Zang Hai?

360
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,270
He is from Qingquan Town, Jiangning Prefecture.

361
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,270
He came to the capital several months ago.

362
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,110
I wonder where he heard the news from. He went directly to the Imperial Mausoleum.

363
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:17,070
He used tricks to collapse the coffin of Imperial Noble Consort Li

364
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,350
and even spoke nonsense about the presence of spirits.

365
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,250
Anyway,

366
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,550
he helped the Marquis of Pingjin to solve the problem.

367
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,480
I didn't think he would go that far

368
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,920
to actually request that he serve the Marquis of Pingjin.

369
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,850
It's obvious he wants a meteoric rise and rapid promotion to become an official.

370
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,900
Not only this, the first month he entered the Marquis Residence,

371
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,920
he created troubles and confrontations.

372
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,880
Sir Yang and Qu Jiao, in front of the Marquis,

373
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,580
merely challenged him. He caused their death because of this.

374
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,550
Are you saying he has murderous intent?

375
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,340
I accidentally offended him.

376
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,160
I'm afraid I may be his next target.

377
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,960
Eunuch, please protect me.

378
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,160
I like the statue of Goddess of Mercy that you gifted me.

379
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,200
I'll help you with the decision on this.

380
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,250
Thank you, Eunuch.

381
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,970
I'll find a better gift for your enjoyment.

382
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,950
You are considerate.

383
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,040
Lu Jin.

384
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,270
Foster Father.

385
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,250
Go to Qingquan Town immediately to probe.

386
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,160
If there's a problem with his identity and, Zhuang Luyin wants to use him, he can't.

387
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,030
- Go now. 
 - Understood.

388
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,860
Lu Yan.

389
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,250
Send people to keep a close eye on Zang Hai.

390
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,550
Once Lu Jin finds out something suspicious about Zang Hai's identity,

391
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,070
kill him immediately.

392
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,600
Understood.

393
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,417
   

394
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,070
 Come, take a look. 

395
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,130
Sorry, sir.

396
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,490
I knocked your vegetables down.

397
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,010
It's fine.

398
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,220
How about this? I'll buy them all.

399
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,130
It doesn't cost that much.

400
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,360
Take it.

401
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,010
- This... 
 - It's fine.

402
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,840
I was about to ask you something.

403
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,110
Looking at you,

404
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,350
you don't seem to be from Qingquan Town.

405
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,880
I'm here to visit a relative.

406
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,190
Which relative?

407
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,800
I've lived here for decades.

408
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,920
I know almost everyone.

409
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,110
Perfect.

410
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,010
Do you know Zang Hai?

411
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,260
He is my cousin.

412
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,570
What a coincidence!

413
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,510
I watched this brat grow up.

414
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,550
However, he left here several months ago.

415
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,010
When did he come to this town?

416
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,670
Let me think.

417
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,000
It has been ten years since he came here.

418
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,810
He lost his parents and was adopted by a carpenter from this town.

419
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,130
Where is the carpenter?

420
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,970
He died.

421
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,840
There was a fire several months ago.

422
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,630
The carpenter was burned alive.

423
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,700
Xiao Hai was cutting wood in the mountains. He didn't go home

424
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,670
and escaped the calamity.

425
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,680
He must've been heartbroken

426
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,740
and left the town.

427
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,390
Thank you, sir.

428
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,670
What did you find?

429
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,230
Sir Lu, that old man didn't lie.

430
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,230
There's nothing suspicious about Zang Hai's background.

431
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,670
He's too clean.

432
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,180
Do we go back now and report what we've found?

433
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,490
How did I teach you to handle matters?

434
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,930
This man makes Eunuch Cao feel uneasy.

435
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,010
If we report that Zang Hai is clean,

436
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,380
it means Eunuch Cao is wrong.

437
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,580
If Eunuch Cao suspects someone, this man can't be innocent.

438
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,110
Send a carrier pigeon stating that Zang Hai's identity is suspicious.

439
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,320
We must kill him to get rid of future threats.

440
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,690
Understood.

441
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,110
- What's going on? 
 - Sir.

442
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,920
Why bother?

443
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,780
There's clearly no problem. You insisted on twisting the truth and seeking death.

444
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,880
Isn't the result here?

445
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,000
Zang Hai has many accomplices here.

446
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,970
There's indeed a problem with his identity.

447
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,540
Kill them all. Don't keep any survivors!

448
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,880
Sir, a bowl of dumplings.

449
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,200
All right.

450
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,380
-  Your dumplings. Enjoy. 
 - Thanks.

451
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,800
Sir.

452
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,320
- A bowl of dumplings. 
 - Please wait.

453
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,920
Don't turn back. Listen to me.

454
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,130
You're being watched by surveillance guards.

455
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,880
I know.

456
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,310
The dumplings are here.

457
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,260
All right.

458
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,380
Cao Jingxian sent his foster son, Lu Jin,

459
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,150
to investigate your identity in Qingquan Town.

460
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,320
Our men failed to stop him.

461
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,180
He left Qingquan Town two days ago and is heading back to the capital.

462
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,220
He should be in Jiangzhou now.

463
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,500
Cao Jingxian suspects my identity?

464
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,710
At this rate, he'll arrive in the capital in two days.

465
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,340
We should ambush Lu along the way.

466
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,450
No.

467
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,040
If he is dead, Cao Jingxian will suspect me even more.

468
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,190
Watch him closely. Let him go back without any hitches.

469
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,990
Xiao Hai, this man is too ruthless.

470
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,300
If he's back in the capital, it'll be hard to complete this task.

471
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,590
You must think of an immediate strategy.

472
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,240
We must not allow him to meet Cao Jingxian.

473
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,310
I fear there's only one person who can help me now.

474
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,270
I need some time to figure it out.

475
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,870
We're running out of time.

476
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,300
I'll take care of the surveillance guards.

477
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,380
Owner.

478
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,580
- You've finished eating? 
 - Yes.

479
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,170
Come again.

480
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,280
Sirs, are you all right?

481
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,630
- Move! 
 - I'm so sorry. I...

482
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,760
I told you to move aside!

483
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,190
Let's go.

484
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,860
Look at this.

485
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,480
It's not bad today.

486
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,280
Third Brother, let's leave now.

487
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,030
- It's late. 
 - All right. You can leave first.

488
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,670
- Fine.
