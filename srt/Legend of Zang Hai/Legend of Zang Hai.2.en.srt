00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,860
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,100
Mayflies live for but a day, from dawn to dusk.

4
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,980
Cicadas mistake a single season for eternity.

5
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,540
The ancient past recedes into mist.

6
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,740
How many times has the wheel of time turned to reach the present?

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,570
You're awake.

8
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,290
Have some water.

9
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,660
Who are you?

10
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,260
I was an old friend of your father's.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,060
Why should I trust you?

12
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,130
If I meant to kill you,

13
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,340
why would I have waited for you to wake up?

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,260
Misfortune befell your household last night.

15
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,010
You were the only one I managed to save.

16
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,060
The others

17
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,780
weren't so lucky.

18
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,940
Cry if you need to.

19
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,940
Once you've let it all out,

20
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,660
we'll talk.

21
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,570
We've arrived.

22
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,410
You've cried it out already.

23
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,100
You should be feeling a bit better now.

24
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,690
I'm sure you have many questions for me, right?

25
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,610
Before your father returned,

26
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,900
he and I exchanged letters and agreed

27
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,660
that I would help you leave the Capital.

28
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,410
But I arrived a step too late.

29
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,250
I will avenge them.

30
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,410
Do you know who your enemy is?

31
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,020
My father mentioned his name.

32
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,140
The one in charge

33
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,340
is Zhuang Luyin.

34
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,780
No wonder he's so capable.

35
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,580
It turns out he's the Marquis of Pingjin.

36
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,050
But your father had no feud with him.

37
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,610
Why would he do such a thing?

38
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,250
He came to my father

39
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,540
to ask for something.

40
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,700
What is it?

41
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,170
I don't know.

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,290
My father didn't say anything.

43
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,020
When your father returned to the Capital from Dongxia,

44
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,460
he brought something with him.

45
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,290
The Marquis of Pingjin

46
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,340
went so far as to annihilate your entire household over it.

47
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,340
Should he discover that you are still alive,

48
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,580
grave danger will follow.

49
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,410
What happened last night

50
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,780
can't be changed.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,610
Are you certain you wish to pursue vengeance?

52
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,020
If I can't take revenge,

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,780
I'd rather be dead.

54
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,370
If you're willing to do as I say,

55
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,340
I have a way to help you.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,810
Please tell me what to do.

57
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,140
The Marquis of Pingjin is a man of great status and authority.

58
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,900
If you want revenge,

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,730
it will take time.

60
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,730
You must lie low and hone your skills.

61
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,170
How long will it take?

62
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,100
At least ten years.

63
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,730
I'll send you to a place where you can hone your skills.

64
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,490
After that, it's all on you.

65
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,210
Hurry up!

66
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,160
Master is coming.

67
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,840
- Who is your master? - Hurry up.

68
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,100
The same person who will be teaching you.

69
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,610
The one who will be teaching me?

70
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,050
So, you're Kuai Duo's child?

71
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,370
Come down and let me take a look at you.

72
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,250
I'll say this upfront.

73
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,100
You'll get

74
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,250
no special treatment here.

75
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,780
If you can't handle the hardship,

76
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,410
you're free to leave.

77
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,810
I won't stop you.

78
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,290
I want to learn martial arts.

79
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,100
Your muscles and bones are weak,

80
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,290
and your talent is mediocre.

81
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,580
You're simply not cut out

82
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,660
for martial arts.

83
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,850
He has already devised

84
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,250
a revenge plan for you.

85
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,580
Just follow

86
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,290
that path,

87
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,810
and you will surely achieve your goal.

88
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,170
I want to kill my enemy with my own hands.

89
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,850
If it's not a powerful martial art,

90
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,250
I won't bother learning it.

91
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,810
Must revenge rely on violence?

92
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,340
What else could I rely on?

93
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,490
Conviction.

94
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,170
If you hold onto this belief,

95
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,660
any skill in the world

96
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,980
can be deadly.

97
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,100
Lucun.

98
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,370
Yes, sir.

99
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,930
His right sleeve is a cun shorter than the left.

100
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,100
Your work lacks precision.

101
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,850
No one in this room

102
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,610
is allowed to eat

103
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,610
for the next three days.

104
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,540
If it happens again,

105
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,290
your little finger will be snapped,

106
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,410
you'll be banished from the mansion,

107
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,540
and never allowed to return.

108
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,660
Please forgive us, Master.

109
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,460
Why are you so mean?

110
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,730
These are just trivial issues.

111
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,580
You're doubting things

112
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,780
before you've even learned them.

113
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,100
It seems your parents

114
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,780
didn't discipline you properly.

115
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,290
Don't you dare speak ill of my parents!

116
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:52,730
Lucun.

117
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,100
[Facial Structure Adjustment Plan]

118
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,500
[Cutleaf False Oxtongue]

119
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,990
What happened to my face?

120
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,130
Don't panic, kid.

121
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,080
I only made minor adjustments to your eyebrows, eyes,

122
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,700
and facial structure,

123
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,580
along with some skin repairs.

124
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,060
Now, you look

125
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,730
quite different from before.

126
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,010
In a few years, as you grow older,

127
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,340
you'll lose all resemblance

128
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,250
to your parents,

129
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,850
and your enemy won't be able to recognize you.

130
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,890
So, in a few years,

131
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,530
I won't look like

132
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,420
my parents at all?

133
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,770
Tell me.

134
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,730
When did you get that wound

135
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,850
on your back?

136
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,610
Just a few days ago.

137
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,890
Has your enemy seen it?

138
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,460
No.

139
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,980
That's good.

140
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,420
The wound on your back

141
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,770
is really deep.

142
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,060
All Xing Dou can do

143
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,370
is help it heal faster

144
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,580
and minimize the scarring.

145
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,980
Who is Xing Dou?

146
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,490
He

147
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,250
is the cranky fellow.

148
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,490
Who might you be, then?

149
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,010
My name is Gao Ming.

150
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,580
I'm your other master.

151
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,370
What could you possibly teach me?

152
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,100
You little brat,

153
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,700
don't underestimate me.

154
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,700
If you think you know everything,

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,700
try getting out of here first.

156
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,250
Your master Xing Dou is merciless.

157
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,850
If you can't get out,

158
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,770
you might starve to death.

159
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,770
Let me eat first.

160
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,340
Once I've regained my strength,

161
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,700
I'll come back to work on the joints.

162
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,420
You were born into a family of constructors.

163
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,340
If you can't even unlock

164
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,010
the simplest mortise and tenon joints,

165
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,010
I'd say your father Kuai Duo's reputation

166
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,180
is undeserved.

167
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,770
You're not allowed to speak ill of my father.

168
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,580
You promised my benefactor

169
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,770
you'd teach me the way of vengeance.

170
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:14,940
I don't think

171
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,460
you'd actually let me starve to death.

172
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,250
I did promise him

173
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,300
I'd teach you the way of vengeance.

174
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,180
But you look different now.

175
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,460
If necessary, I'll just find

176
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,270
another kid

177
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,180
to take your place.

178
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,820
You!

179
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,080
You want to test me?

180
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,010
My father has already taught me everything.

181
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,420
I'll get out and prove it to you right now.

182
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,370
The kid has just undergone facial transformation surgery

183
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,650
and is still very fragile.

184
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,250
If he actually dies,

185
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,060
how will you explain that to his benefactor?

186
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,130
If he can't even endure

187
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,250
hunger and pain,

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,300
maybe it's better if he doesn't seek revenge at all.

189
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
At such a young age,

190
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,340
his resilience is remarkable.

191
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,820
He's got great potential.

192
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,650
Let's leave.

193
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,130
If you don't come out today,

194
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,980
you'll starve to death.

195
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,250
You dislike me

196
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,580
because you resent my father.

197
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,610
My father is an expert in the study of the Yijing

198
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,650
and the finest geomancer in the world.

199
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,980
Your skills don't measure up,

200
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,180
and you're bitter about it.

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,530
You claim your father is an expert in the study of Yijing.

202
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,420
There was a great master of Yijing in the previous dynasty

203
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,220
named He Menggui.

204
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,130
Have you heard of him?

205
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,610
Of course, I have.

206
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,990
Then recite his poem

207
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,980
"To Yin Xunzhai on the Numerology of Yijing" to me.

208
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,940
Guan Lu was a master of winnowing divination,

209
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,250
while Yang Xiong's Taixuanjing remains peerless.

210
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,220
Guan Lu loved studying the stars from a young age.

211
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,890
Yang Xiong was a devoted learner in his youth

212
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,580
and wrote the classic Taixuanjing.

213
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,610
Yijing

214
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,130
holds profound insights into the universe.

215
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,610
Master it,

216
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,460
and you could become

217
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,010
just as extraordinary.

218
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,250
Now,

219
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,180
let us continue reciting.

220
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,730
Where does the rising wind come from?

221
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,340
The answer lies in the Xun hexagram.

222
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,340
The storm begins with the softest stir atop the green duckweed.

223
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:49,980
A man of wisdom

224
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,730
seizes the moment

225
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,250
and moves with the tide.

226
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,700
If you seek revenge,

227
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,060
first learn the wind's ways.

228
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,340
All things grow and flourish, hidden within primordial chaos.

229
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,420
Who was it that unlocked the secret gate and unveiled the mysteries of creation?

230
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,820
He's quite good.

231
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,130
Yijing preserves the wisdom of the great sages.

232
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,610
It embodies the three cosmic principles of transformation.

233
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,260
Guan Lu was a master of winnowing divination,

234
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,860
while Yang Xiong's Taixuanjing remains peerless.

235
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,940
Where does the rising wind come from?

236
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,060
The answer lies in the Xun hexagram.

237
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,580
Let's go.

238
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,700
Come.

239
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,650
Come here.

240
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,980
Half a month from now,

241
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,300
you will study geomancy and construction with me in the mornings,

242
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,610
and learn strategy and diplomacy from Gao Ming in the afternoons.

243
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,280
You are to rise at the hour of Mao

244
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,130
and rest at the hour of Hai.

245
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,220
No slacking off.

246
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,460
Kid,

247
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,580
you must be hungry.

248
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:21,580
Let's go

249
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,220
and eat.

250
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,980
Careful.

251
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,700
By day, they toil in the fields. By night, they spin the flax at home.

252
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,770
In the village, every man and woman tends to their own household work.

253
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,730
Though the young ones have yet to learn farming or weaving,

254
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,100
they still sit beneath the mulberry shade, learning to sow seeds.

255
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,090
Geomancy studies the way

256
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,140
of Heaven and Earth.

257
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,420
[Mount Longkou]
We observe the stars above

258
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,770
and examine the land below.

259
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,490
This is the essence of geomancy.

260
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,620
Mountains wind and coil

261
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,010
like dragons upon the earth.

262
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,700
To choose the right site,

263
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,530
you must know the direction of the wind,

264
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,490
the flow of water,

265
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,570
and the state of the soil.

266
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,250
Hold out your hand.

267
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,530
Master,

268
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,490
may I ask where I erred?

269
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,010
The dougong is off by one li.

270
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,730
It's merely one li.

271
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,290
A tiny slip can lead

272
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,660
to a massive mistake.

273
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,420
That little error could one day

274
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,330
cost you your life.

275
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,010
Master.

276
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,460
You have a beard now.

277
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,220
Today,

278
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,700
I'll show you what I'm truly capable of.

279
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,570
What are you all doing?

280
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,420
Clear the way. Move aside!

281
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,250
Are you blind?

282
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,770
How dare you block the county magistrate's path?

283
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,570
Write it down.

284
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,490
You can't even manage

285
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,250
a small county properly.

286
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,050
Look at the mess

287
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,010
you've made at this place.

288
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,420
Officials like you only know how to grease palms

289
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,330
and line pockets.

290
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,010
Sooner or later, you'll be smothered by the very silver you took.

291
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,330
Yes, sir.

292
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,050
If I hadn't arrived

293
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,770
before the Imperial Censor,

294
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,940
and your misdeeds had been reported,

295
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,290
you'd have lost your head

296
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,090
several times over by now.

297
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,980
- Yes, sir. - Come here.

298
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,490
I'll give you a chance

299
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,570
to make things right.

300
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,290
Return everything you've embezzled.

301
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,090
As for those beyond saving,

302
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,050
whether they're to be arrested or executed,

303
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,900
you know exactly what to do.

304
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,730
Don't be afraid.

305
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,380
You've got support.

306
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:56,770
Yes, sir.

307
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,700
You weren't wearing an official's robe,

308
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,700
nor did you arrive in a carriage.

309
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,420
Why would he believe you?

310
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,430
Didn't you also address me

311
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,630
as an official just now?

312
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,770
What you must do

313
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,760
is make others believe

314
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,360
what you want them to believe.

315
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,180
What matters most

316
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,770
is not how well you act,

317
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,050
nor how convincing your costume is,

318
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,010
but knowing

319
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,460
what the other party fears most, and what they most desire.

320
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,980
The art of strategy and diplomacy

321
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,490
encompasses the knowledge of the world.

322
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,810
You must be well-versed

323
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,570
in every field.

324
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,330
With but a silver tongue,

325
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,010
one may prove stronger than an army of a million.

326
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,290
Master.

327
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,220
This kid's got the construction skills

328
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,660
to work

329
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,570
independently now.

330
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,010
Your apprentice

331
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,660
is about to outshine you.

332
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,730
Doesn't that bother you?

333
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,330
Master.

334
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,330
Master.

335
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,770
This is the pigeon post

336
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,380
I just received.

337
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,770
Good job.

338
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,380
We'll have a celebration for you tonight.

339
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,220
[Liuchu is coming]
Heat up a pot of fine liquor.

340
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,860
Master, what does this note say?

341
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,620
Your new master

342
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,660
is about to arrive.

343
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,810
There's a new master for me?

344
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,530
Now that you're twenty,

345
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,180
it's time for her to come.

346
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,250
There's something strange about you two today.

347
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,050
Is this new master

348
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,050
that impressive?

349
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,660
You'll know once you two meet.

350
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,620
Tonight,

351
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,900
the two of us will enter seclusion

352
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,620
and won't return until tomorrow.

353
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,460
You should stay at the mansion.

354
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,180
Yes, Master.

355
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,330
You

356
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,140
should go to town and buy a jar of fine liquor

357
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,250
for your new master.

358
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,620
Preferably, osmanthus liquor.

359
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,660
All right, got it.

360
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,290
Well, I'm still worried.

361
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,570
Maybe I should stay with you?

362
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,080
Gao Ming.

363
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,490
I...

364
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,460
All right.

365
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,330
I'm leaving.

366
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,050
Don't worry.

367
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,330
No need to worry.

368
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,330
A new master.

369
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,010
Close the door.

370
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,530
So, you

371
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,530
are my third master?

372
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,220
Why?

373
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,080
You didn't expect

374
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,140
your new master to be a woman?

375
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,220
I'm Liuchu.

376
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,250
Greetings, Master Liuchu.

377
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,770
By the way,

378
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,660
Master Gao Ming asked me

379
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,660
to bring this to you.

380
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,050
Set it aside for now.

381
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,380
What are you going to teach me?

382
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,900
Oh?

383
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,380
They didn't tell you?

384
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,460
They seemed a bit strange when speaking of you.

385
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,730
I thought

386
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,330
maybe you were really scary.

387
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,980
So, do I seem

388
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,050
scary to you now?

389
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,660
I'm here to teach you

390
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,570
about the matters between men and women.

391
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,650
Today,

392
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,570
there's only one thing you need to learn:

393
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,330
how to resist

394
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,490
a woman's sweet affection

395
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,220
and tender allure.

396
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,140
I'm talking to you.

397
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,700
But

398
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,980
if you fail to learn it today,

399
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,490
that's all right.

400
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,980
After all,

401
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,220
few are granted

402
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,180
a glimpse of me like this.

403
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,330
I'm sorry.

404
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,420
What's the matter?

405
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,570
I thought

406
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,900
you were here to teach me how to take revenge.

407
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,180
You know how to use pain to suppress desire.

408
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,700
Not bad.

409
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,700
Though you resisted

410
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,250
temptation this time

411
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,940
by staying true to yourself,

412
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,180
next time,

413
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,660
if you truly fall

414
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,180
for a woman,

415
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,090
it may not

416
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,290
be so easy.

417
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,380
In the future,

418
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,900
you'll meet many people:

419
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,460
men,

420
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,620
women,

421
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,010
enemies,

422
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,250
and friends.

423
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,570
Men are like stone,

424
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,050
strong and unyielding,

425
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,180
bound by duty.

426
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,730
Women are like water,

427
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,180
gentle yet resilient,

428
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,660
with love as deep as the sea.

429
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,330
There's much to learn

430
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,810
in the words "duty" and "love."

431
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,810
But

432
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,050
the hardest thing to guard against in this world

433
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,620
is genuine sincerity.

434
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,490
Genuine sincerity?

435
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,940
Even genuine sincerity needs to be guarded against?

436
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,940
The last time you saw your parents

437
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,730
was ten years ago, right?

438
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,900
Do you still remember

439
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,490
what they looked like?

440
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,660
Actually,

441
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,700
I'm the same as you.

442
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,770
I was an orphan

443
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,900
from a very young age.

444
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,290
Though I remember the day they passed vividly,

445
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,700
I just can't seem

446
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,010
to recall

447
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,530
their faces clearly.

448
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,290
Tell me.

449
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,490
Does that make me unfilial?

450
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,810
No, not at all.

451
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,460
You...

452
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,770
You just can't bear to remember.

453
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,010
I remember

454
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,330
as a child, I loved pomegranates.

455
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,010
So my father

456
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,490
planted

457
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,980
a pomegranate tree in the yard.

458
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,530
He'd pick the fruit,

459
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,900
my mother would peel it,

460
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,770
and I'd eat it.

461
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,620
Those

462
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,460
were such happy times.

463
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,530
I'm the same.

464
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,660
I loved eating roast duck.

465
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,140
Whenever my father received his salary,

466
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,490
he would go into town to buy some for me.

467
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,140
Yet little did I expect

468
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,380
that those would be

469
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,220
my final moments of happiness.

470
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,460
If I had the chance,

471
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,620
I would truly want to see my parents once more,

472
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,810
so I could remember their faces

473
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,090
more clearly.

474
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,490
I guess

475
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,900
you feel the same way,

476
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,380
don't you?

477
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,220
If I were your enemy,

478
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,530
you would be dead by now.

479
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,570
Resisting the temptation of desire is not hard.

480
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,620
What's truly difficult

481
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,380
is resisting the temptation of emotions.

482
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,530
This...

483
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,050
This isn't fair.

484
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,460
This world

485
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,700
is hardly fair,

486
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,810
and second chances

487
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,940
are few and far between.

488
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,330
I understand now.

489
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,530
I have to lock my heart up tight,

490
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,530
letting nothing in,

491
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,380
and never reveal true feelings to anyone.

492
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,220
But that's not enough.

493
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,940
You have to not only

494
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,980
mask yourself

495
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,380
but also control your emotions

496
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,770
so well

497
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,680
that people believe

498
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,380
your tears are real

499
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,730
and your smiles genuine.

500
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,380
That way,

501
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,010
no one will notice

502
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,140
that I'm hiding my true feelings,

503
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,460
and there won't be any slip-ups to give me away.

504
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,570
That's the theory.

505
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,900
But can you actually do it?

506
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,250
I'm certain I can do it.

507
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,560
You're still young.

508
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,420
Though smart,

509
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,860
you're a person

510
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,380
ruled by your emotions at heart.

511
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,290
This might become

512
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,810
your biggest obstacle

513
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,940
on the path of revenge,

514
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,290
but it could also be the key

515
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,730
to your victory.

516
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,140
I'll leave now.

517
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,770
Master Liuchu,

518
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,090
have I passed

519
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,700
today's test?

520
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,730
What I teach

521
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,620
is different from that of your other two masters.

522
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,620
When it comes to feelings,

523
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,570
some are born knowing them,

524
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,900
while others

525
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,460
just can't figure them out even in a lifetime.

526
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,900
Remember,

527
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,530
you've only passed

528
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,700
half the test today.

529
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,420
Be vigilant in the future

530
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,330
and don't fall for someone easily.

531
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,620
Master, you tricked me again.

532
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,980
Master Liuchu didn't drink it at all.

533
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,220
I bet it's you craving the drink.

534
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,730
Your Master Liuchu

535
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,420
has seen a lot in the Capital.

536
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,090
It's no surprise she's not impressed

537
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,860
by our local liquor.

538
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,460
Shouldn't you be worried about me?

539
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,290
I only passed half

540
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,460
of Master Liuchu's test.

541
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,810
It takes talent to master one's emotions.

542
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,140
You've passed half

543
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,460
of Liuchu's test,

544
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,460
which makes you second only to me.

545
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,810
Look at your Master Xing Dou.

546
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,490
His heart

547
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,860
is like a stone.

548
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,300
Otherwise, why would he hide away

549
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,440
in these remote mountains?

550
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,010
I wonder if he ever gets bored.

551
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,090
No one can fool

552
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,290
a man like him.

553
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,330
But you, on the other hand,

554
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,220
value your bond with others,

555
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,180
which makes you easy to deceive.

556
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,620
When will I be able

557
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,490
to complete my training?

558
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,330
You silly kid,

559
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,090
in our line of work,

560
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,770
you never

561
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,760
stop learning.

562
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,940
It seems that I'll never

563
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,810
catch up to you

564
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,330
since you're older than me.

565
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,460
You little brat,

566
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,380
who are you calling old?

567
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,050
Stop right there!

568
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:21,980
I wouldn't dare, Master.

569

I just want to learn your skills

570
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,460
as soon as possible.

571
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,420
Please, Master.

572
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,010
You know what they say:

573
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,380
"Haste makes waste."

574
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,900
One day, you'll understand

575
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,330
that the most powerful skill in this world

576
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,460
is to deceive others with truth and honesty.

577
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,140
When I was your age,

578
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,940
I also found this principle very deep.

579
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,980
It was only after suffering many losses

580
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,420
that I came to comprehend it.

581
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,600
What you mean

582
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,330
is that I still need more training?

583
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,560
What I mean is,

584
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,490
you got fooled again.

585
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,730
I am exceptionally gifted

586
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,700
and innately skilled in deception.

587
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,010
How could anyone

588
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,420
ever make me suffer losses?

589
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,180
You're still too naive.

590
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,980
Come here.

591
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,900
This is for you.

592
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,180
Sir.

593
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,490
Sir.

594
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,220
It's been years since I last came to see you.

595
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,220
You've grown so much.

596
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,090
See if you can unlock it.

597
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,530
General's Lock?

598
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,900
I see that you've been doing pretty well

599
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,140
these past years.

600
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,180
My masters have treated me well.

601
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,730
They say

602
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,460
you've learned a lot.

603
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,660
I rise at the hour of Mao

604
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,690
and rest at the hour of Hai each day,

605
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,260
always maintaining my discipline.

606
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,090
Don't you find it

607
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,490
suffocating and boring?

608
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,530
When I'm bored,

609
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,050
I just count the bricks and tiles in the pavilion.

610
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,650
So,

611
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,820
how many bricks are laid on the ground?

612
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,740
Three thousand three hundred and eighty-one bricks.

613
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,340
How many tiles are on the roof?

614
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,050
Forty-eight thousand three hundred tiles.

615
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,300
How many people in your household

616
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,420
died that night?

617
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,530
My household had ten disciples,

618
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,010
all killed by those men in black.

619
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,300
I saw my senior Gousheng's neck

620
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,340
being snapped.

621
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,690
My sister and mother

622
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,610
were both slain by the sword.

623
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,460
That night,

624
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,940
fourteen lives were lost in total.

625
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,820
It's been

626
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,570
3,325 days since then.

627
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,210
I didn't expect that after all these years,

628
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,300
your resolve would stay unshaken.

629
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,380
Your hatred hasn't faded one bit.

630
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,050
Since you lead a carefree life here,

631
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,650
I thought

632
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,130
that one day you'd eventually let it go.

633
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,420
My master taught me

634
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,380
there's no need to show hatred on your face.

635
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,610
Keep it in your heart

636
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,170
as your heart is yours alone,

637
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,460
unseen by others.

638
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,820
But your face is out in the open,

639
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,130
and everyone can see it.

640
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,050
This is your birthday gift this year.

641
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,260
See if you like it.

642
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:48,940
This...

643
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,210
He is your enemy,

646
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:56,690
That's right.

647
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,980
It's him.

648
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,160
[Zhuang Luyin]
I'll remember him

649
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,740
even if he turns to ashes.

650
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,420
The Marquis of Pingjin has fought in countless battles,

652
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,980
Not only is he a formidable warrior,

653
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,860
but he is also naturally cautious and suspicious.

654
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,530
He always wears

655
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,260
[Gather knowledge and cultivate wisdom]
a piece of golden-threaded soft armor,

656
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,460
and his guards are impenetrable.

657
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,860
Killing him is nearly impossible.

658
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,010
You'll have to rely on your wits.

659
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,170
Then how can I get close to him?

660
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,860
You must find a chance

661
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,010
to serve as his aide.

662
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,300
That's why Master has been teaching me

663
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,130
the art of strategy and diplomacy.

664
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,010
There are three individuals by the Marquis of Pingjin's side

665
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,940
who stand between you and him.

666
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,820
If you truly wish

667
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,010
to approach the Marquis of Pingjin,

668
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,130
you must first overcome

669
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,820
these three challenges.

670

[Qu Jiao]
This person is named Qu Jiao.

671
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,170
He is the personal bodyguard of the Marquis of Pingjin

672
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,740
and also the commander of his household troops.

673
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,340
He is the Marquis's executioner,

674
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,570
known for his savage cruelty.

675
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,340
He's the one

676
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,690
who killed my family.

677

Chu Huaiming?

679
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,940
He used to work under your father.

680
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,900
Because of his mediocre abilities,

681
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,010
he had little chance of being promoted in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

682
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,740
So he betrayed your father

683
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,300
and joined the Marquis of Pingjin.

684
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,980
After your father died,

the Marquis of Pingjin

686

This man is two-faced

688
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,690
and despicable.

689
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,130
Given your knowledge of geomancy,

690
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,210
he will inevitably

691
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,010
see you as a thorn in his side.

He is the chief aide to the Marquis of Pingjin.

695
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,570
Back then, he was the one

696
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,490
who made the massacre look like a random bandit attack,

697
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,570
a clever cover-up for the Marquis.

698
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,490
He is quite cunning

Master,

755
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,740
will you go to the Capital with me?

756
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,570
Certainly.

757
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,260
Really?

758
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,260
Just the thought of having to be with you

759
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,090
all the time

760
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,380
really annoys me.

761
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,740
I'm not annoyed.

762
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,170
Master,

763
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,380
have some ribs.

764
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,340
That's more like it.

765
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,460
Now, you are showing some real respect.

766
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:01,650
Master.

767
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,260
Have you finished packing?

768
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,380
We need to leave now.

769
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,780
Master Xing Dou,

770
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,090
where is Master Gao Ming?

771
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,010
He's already left with your benefactor.

772
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,690
He asked me to tell you

773
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,340
not to trust others

774
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,260
just because of your feelings.

775
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,490
Otherwise, you'll only end up disappointed.

776
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,340
Zhinu.

777
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,210
Master,

778
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,460
who are you calling?

779
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,780
My name is Zang Hai.

780
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,650
From this moment on,

781
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,300
