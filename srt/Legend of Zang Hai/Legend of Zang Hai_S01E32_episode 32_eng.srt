1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:16,200



2
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:30,030
   

3
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:32,786
   

4
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,200
   

5
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,770
Official Zang.

6
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,100
 At the beginning of every New Year, 

7
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,020
 the Emperor opens the Hall of Histories in the Palace, 

8
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,510
 and the Cabinet recruits historians from the six departments 

9
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,600
 to compile the history of the country, which lasts for a few days. 

10
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,660
As Vice Minister of Works and Imperial Astronomer,

11
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,610
I will be one of the historians this time.

12
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,280
   

13
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,150
Are you going back?

14
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,630
The parts I was responsible for have all been compiled.

15
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,030
I've informed the cabinet that I'd be leaving tonight.

16
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,430
Today is the Lantern Festival,

17
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,530
so the Historian ordered the maids to make some glutinous rice balls

18
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,740
and prepare some snacks.

19
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,370
I'd better keep my appetite until I reach home.

20
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,420
- Taste these glutinous rice balls for me. 
 - Thank you, sir.

21
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,210
Tonight, there will be fireworks outside the palace.

22
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,600
You're just in time to see them.

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,210
 Even if you could sneak into the palace, 

24
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,400
 could you get into the heavily guarded Hanzhang Hall? 

25
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,140
 At the Lantern Festival every year, 

26
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,560
 a feast is held in the palace. 

27
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,910
 That night, the Emperor will not be in Hanzhang Hall, 

28
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,190
 and fireworks will be set off all over the capital. 

29
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,880
 I need you to set off the greatest fireworks at the right time 

30
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,050
 so that the people of the capital will always remember this night. 

31
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,310
 When you stare at bright lights for too long, 

32
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,520
 you can't see the darkness. 

33
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,790
 The brighter the fireworks, the safer my path will be. 

34
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,841
   

35
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,414
   

36
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,850
   

37
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,142
   

38
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,669
   

39
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,850
Deer and Goose.

40
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,876
   

41
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,940
The ninth year of the Zhenshun era.

42
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,451
   

43
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,520
This is my father's Stargazing Pavilion.

44
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,600
Zhen Tower.

45
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,080
Hanzhang Hall.

46
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,630
Cloud-lifting Tower.

47
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,750
The buildings here are all modeled

48
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,780
after what's in the capital today.

49
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,200
But my house was burned down ten years ago,

50
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,320
so why is it here?

51
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,110
No. There's something wrong with the layout.

52
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,940
   

53
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,080
   

54
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,510
Goose.

55
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,670
 Father. 

56
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,590
 Why do you treasure this deer so much? 

57
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,740
 In the jungle, you never know exactly 

58
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,000
 what beast is spying on you from behind the leaves. 

59
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,100
 I hope it'll be a deer you meet 

60
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,240
 in your most treacherous moments in the future. 

61
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,770
 A deer? 

62
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,940
So, the Emperor is the deer,

63
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,960
and my dad is the goose.

64
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,440
There's a piece missing from the bracket set.

65
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,995
   

66
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,460
Official Zang.

67
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,720
Shi Quan?

68
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,150
The bureau is on vacation today in case of an epidemic,

69
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,550
so why are you here?

70
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,030
We can't be careless about this.

71
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,140
I was worried that the bureau wouldn't be able to handle it, so I came to check it out.

72
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,620
Official Zang, why are you here, too?

73
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,870
The leader ordered me to make a batch of stone seals as soon as possible today.

74
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,800
It's urgent, so I'm afraid I'll have to stay here tonight.

75
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,760
I see.

76
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,880
Sir, let me help you.

77
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,320
No need.

78
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,750
Just go home.

79
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,030
Okay.

80
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,810
Don't wear yourself out.

81
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,790
Sir,

82
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,980
is that the Gui Seal on the table?

83
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,090
Looks like...

84
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,620
it is.

85
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,440
Don't move.

86
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,160
The knife is fast.

87
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,070
Shi Quan, you...

88
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,090
After all these years,

89
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,630
this day finally comes.

90
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,260
Move.

91
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,010
Who are you?

92
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,000
Official, you have a ghastly look.

93
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,830
I forgot to tell you I have another name,

94
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,810
Lu Fen.

95
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,310
Are one of Cao Jingxian's men?

96
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,960
That's right.

97
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,960
You must be terribly confused, right?

98
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,590
Let's sit down and talk.

99
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,520
For the sake of our work together, ask me anything you want.

100
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,380
I'll tell you everything.

101
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,280
Please go ahead.

102
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,270
If you're Cao Jingxian's man,

103
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,000
why are you at the Imperial Astronomical Bureau?

104
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,640
I've investigated you.

105
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,050
You came to the bureau a long time ago.

106
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,650
Astronomical Scholar of the First Rank in the tenth year of the Zhenshun era.

107
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,060
It's clearly documented.

108
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,160
No need to worry.

109
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Even if the Three Judicial Offices come to investigate me,

110
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,320
there'll be no mistake.

111
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,350
You told me that you and Chu Huaiming were classmates,

112
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,030
but that was all a lie, too. Right?

113
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,970
Did Cao Jingxian send you to hide here for the Gui Seal?

114
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,710
I came to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau to spy on Chu Huaiming on Father's orders.

115
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,180
He was just like you, helping Zhuang Luyin look for the Gui Seal,

116
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,990
but Chu Huaiming had found nothing in ten years,

117
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,720
so Father ordered me to wait patiently for an opportunity here

118
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,880
and said that those who were looking for the Gui Seal

119
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,680
would not miss the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

120
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,470
because this was the place where Kuai Duo had been an official for many years.

121
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,070
Father was right.

122
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,060
You not only found it but also got it back.

123
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,900
How did you know I'd make a move tonight?

124
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,510
You're meticulous, and your methods are flawless,

125
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,590
but people always say nothing is impossible to a willing heart.

126
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,160
On the night of the Lantern Festival,

127
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,480
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau ordered everyone to stay away

128
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,110
in case of an epidemic.

129
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,250
Even the notice on the door was written by your hand.

130
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,990
Isn't that something to think about?

131
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,420
Lu Fen.

132
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,520
You've hidden it so well.

133
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,550
You've already met my siblings, haven't you?

134
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,070
My second brother, Lu Ran, has the gift of gab

135
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,960
but doesn't hide secrets.

136
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,480
My third brother, Lu Jin, was a great fighter

137
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,110
but died because of you and Zhuang Luyin.

138
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,210
My younger sister, Lu Yan, is loyal

139
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,510
but has a somewhat erratic personality.

140
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,260
I am indeed different from all of them.

141
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,240
I'm valued by Father because I'm patient.

142
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,770
Isn't patience the specialty of people like us?

143
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,250
Zang Hai,

144
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,530
I'm better than you after all.

145
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,440
At first,

146
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,260
I thought you were looking for the Gui Seal for the Marquis of Pingjin,

147
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,790
but the death of the Marquis of Pingjin did not disrupt your process at all.

148
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:13,110
From that moment on, I knew it wasn't for anyone else.

149
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,250
You were doing all this just for yourself.

150
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,520
I'm curious.

151
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,010
Who are you really?

152
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,160
 Lu Fen! 

153
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,350
Lu Fen.

154
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,110
I'm here.

155
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,540
Just in time.

156
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,510
Father.

157
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,320
I've got it.

158
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,680
Gui Seal.

159
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,010
This is the Gui Seal.

160
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,480
I've never seen it before,

161
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,160
but as soon as I held it in my hand,

162
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,030
I knew it was the Gui Seal.

163
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,030
That's it.

164
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,420
That's it!

165
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,830
Lu Fen.

166
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,510
I was right not to send you back

167
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,680
from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

168
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,580
You did a great job.

169
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,350
Thank you for the compliment, Father.

170
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,920
Zang Hai,

171
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,890
you're really smart,

172
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,000
but you made a wrong move.

173
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,110
Eunuch Cao,

174
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,750
you are lucky.

175
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,110
It's not that easy

176
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,310
to take my life.

177
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,000
Tell me.

178
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,290
Who are you?

179
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,530
Do you remember...

180
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,180
Kuai Duo?

181
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,240
Kuai Duo is my father.

182
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,240
I finally understand...

183
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,290
why I've been so haunted by you.

184
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,160
You are Kuai Duo's son.

185
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,790
Your face

186
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,590
is very different from Kuai Duo's,

187
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:03,710
but your eyes always show me something

188
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,620
I know very well.

189
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,580
Modest but aloof.

190
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,460
Pedantic.

191
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,600
Zhuang Luyin.

192
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,830
You're such a fool that you trusted your enemy's son.

193
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,730
No wonder you ended up being killed by your son.

194
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,210
Didn't Zhuang Luyin...

195
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,540
die because of you?

196
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,210
He ignored the covenant and betrayed me, so he deserved to die.

197
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:46,520
I'm afraid your fate will be no better.

198
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,920
Your Majesty,

199
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,720
I didn't realize you'd kept this from me for so long.

200
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,060
So, back then, Kuai Duo found it and gave it to you.

201
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,490
And then you hid it in the palace.

202
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,410
Since you never used it,

203
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:22,440
let me keep it.

204
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,540
Zang Hai,

205
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,330
you've got a lot of guts.

206
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,980
You're even bold enough to take the Emperor's things.

207
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:38,620
You're Kuai Duo's son, but you're doing the opposite of Kuai Duo.

208
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,340
Why are you doing this?

209
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,970
I understand, you wanted to make a fake Gui Seal

210
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,490
and put it back in order to make it look real.

211
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,910
And then, you wanted to use that real one against your enemy, didn't you?

212
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,590
Am I right?

213
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,740
Father, be careful.

214
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,080
Don't worry.

215
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:23,450
But who would have expected I'd get this great gift as soon as I arrived

216
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:27,000
at the Imperial Astronomical Bureau today?

217
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,110
The Gui Seal...

218
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,720
has landed in my hands after all.

219
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,000
And you, Zang Hai,

220
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,820
can take the blame for me.

221
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,320
Eunuch Cao,

222
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,000
it took the Emperor ten years,

223
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,890
but he failed to open the Gui Seal,

224
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,150
so do you think you can?

225
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,670
Are you trying to blackmail me with opening the Gui Seal?

226
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,640
You don't have to worry about the Gui Seal.

227
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,510
I'll mull it over carefully.

228
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,110
Today is the Lantern Festival,

229
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,960
so let's help Zang Hai reunite with his loved ones.

230
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,270
Yes, sir.

231
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,870
Let's go.

232
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,240
I'll take care of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

233
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,590
This place will always be as you wanted it to be.

234
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,520
Don't worry.

235
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,520
Your Highness, what brings you here?

236
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,850
Eunuch Cao, long time no see.

237
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,620
I hope you've been well.

238
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,140
Don't worry, Your Highness.

239
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,240
I won't die.

240
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,980
Zang Hai's scheme was too risky, wasn't it?

241
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,810
How can you let such an ignorant boy hold the Gui Seal alone?

242
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,310
Did you really think he would give you the Gui Seal?

243
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,060
In my opinion,

244
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,060
he would make a fake one for you.

245
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:55,190
Eunuch Cao, cut the crap.

246
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,920
Give me the Gui Seal.

247
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:02,680
Your Highness, we have a covenant.

248
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,160
We can sit down and talk about the Gui Seal.

249
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,400
All right.

250
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,900
I'll talk to you now.

251
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,590
- Father. 
 - You wretch.

252
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,340
How dare you sneak attack!

253
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,150
Kill them!

254
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,450
- Kill them! 
 - Kill them!

255
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,690
Kill them!

256
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,000
Let's go!

257
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,970
Now.

258
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,700
Let's go.

259
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,750
You can't escape.

260
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,210
Leave the Gui Seal here!

261
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,000
If I give you the Gui Seal,

262
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,930
will you...

263
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,070
let me go?

264
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,110
You caused Kuai Duo's death,

265
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,440
so I'll never let you go.

266
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,160
Give me the Gui Seal, and I will keep your body intact.

267
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:08,380
You've met Kuai Duo?

268
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,640
Now that it's over, I have a favor to ask.

269
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,360
I don't want the Emperor to know about what happened tonight.

270
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:07,160
I want the Emperor to remember my loyalty to him.

271
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,410
Okay.

272
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,350
The Gui Seal...

273
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,310
is yours.

274
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,210
Mother!

275
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,330
Mother!

276
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,220
- Father! / - Father! 
 - Now.

277
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,370
- Father. 
 - Help me.

278
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,210
Let's go.

279
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:38,740
Mother, hold on. I'll take you home.

280
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,390
 Guards! 

281
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,230
Zang Hai.

282
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,960
Mother.

283
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,440
Protect her and...

284
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,780
get the Gui Seal back.

285
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,970
Your father didn't really

286
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,860
say anything to me before he died,

287
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,580
did he?

288
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,640
It doesn't matter.

289
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,080
I'll ask him myself.

290
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,420
Mother! Mother! Mother!

291
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,350
Mother!

292
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,540
In this life, I have lived...

293
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,980
and died for Dongxia.

294
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,390
It's not perfect, but I have no regrets.

295
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,300
Mother. Mother. Mother.

296
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,350
Mother.

297
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,390
Mother.

298
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,660
Mother.

299
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,120
Antu.

300
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,790
I need you to take your mother back to the Hostage's Mansion immediately.

301
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,500
Antu.

302
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,690
My mother is gone,

303
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,460
and the Gui Seal has been taken from me.

304
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,880
I know you're sad right now,

305
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,480
but I need you to listen to me carefully.

306
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,300
It's almost dawn. We don't have much time.

307
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,940
You must take your mother back to the Hostage's Mansion right now

308
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,680
and fake her death as an accident.

309
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,250
What happens to us then?

310
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:14,260
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

311
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:19,740
Whatever happens afterward, we'll face it together.

312
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,920
Remember. No one came here tonight.

313
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,040
I will avenge my mother's death.

314
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:58,006
   

315
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,770
- Long live the Emperor. 
 - Long live the Emperor.

316
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,380
Get up.

317
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,040
- Thank you, Your Majesty. 
 - Thank you, Your Majesty.

318
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:56,420
Last night, the Queen of Dongxia...

319
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,280
died in the Hostage's Mansion.

320
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,660
Tell me.

321
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,810
What happened last night?

322
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,930
Last night's fireworks were so good

323
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,230
that they even blinded my Imperial Guards.

324
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,760
Since they were blinded yesterday,

325
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,580
I will let them be blinded forever.

326
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,840
So, now who can tell me

327
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:59,760
where the fireworks came from?

328
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,840
Who set it off?

329
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,100
What? Are you all mute?

330
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,500
The Queen of Dongxia's death...

331
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,080
is very suspicious.

332
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,390
Your Majesty.

333
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:33,080
The Queen of Dongxia's death in our palace was so sudden

334
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,490
that I don't think it should be investigated.

335
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,130
Appeasing the people in Dongxia is the priority.

336
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,660
We owe Dongxia...

337
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,590
an explanation.

338
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,550
Now draw up an edict and pass on my will.

339
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,950
"The Queen of Dongxia died suddenly of illness

340
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,230
and I am deeply sorrowful.

341
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:01,510
She will have an imperial funeral, and her casket will be returned to Dongxia."

342
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,300
I will waive the annual tribute for Dongxia for five years.

343
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,390
I accept the order.

344
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,470
Xie Houguang.

345
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,860
The Ministry of War is at your disposal.

346
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:28,200
Increase troops to Liaofu, Pingtong, and Dingxuan,

347
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,890
which are all neighboring Dongxia, by 5,000 men

348
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:34,700
to prevent border disturbances caused by the Queen's death.

349
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

350
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:55,270
   

351
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:11,060



352
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:22,160
 "It's Me" - Sun Nan 

353
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,840
♫  I conceal the ambition in my eyes  ♫

354
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:36,460
♫  In my palm, I hold a dangerous desire  ♫

355
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,820
♫  Turbulent waves hide in my sleeves  ♫

356
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,520
♫  Silent like the clap of thunder  ♫

357
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,060
♫  The depth of shrewdness  ♫

358
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,240
♫  Can't escape  ♫

359
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,580
♫  My sharp eyes  ♫

360
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:04,740
♫  Conspiracies are my amor  ♫

361
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:11,780
♫  Overt plans are my sword and spear  ♫

362
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,140
♫  With stoic madness  ♫

363
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,920
♫  I cleanse the filth of the world  ♫

364
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,640
♫  The night is not dark  ♫

365
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,640
♫  Because  ♫

366
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,420
♫  My heart is burning bright  ♫

367
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,500
♫  I'm the turning clouds  ♫

368
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,120
♫  I'm the falling rain  ♫

369
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,700
♫  The compass of the human soul is unpredictable  ♫

370
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:45,980
♫  There will always be people who rise and fall  ♫

371
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,600
♫  I am life and death  ♫

372
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,220
♫  I grant and I deprive  ♫

373
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,780
♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

374
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,280
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫

375
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,740
♫  I am the sowing season  ♫

376
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,460
♫  I am the autumn harvest  ♫

377
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,820
♫  I am the kingdom  ♫

378
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,580
♫  I am the commoner  ♫

379
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,060
♫  You are also me  ♫
