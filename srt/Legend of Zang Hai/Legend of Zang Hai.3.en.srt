Have you memorized everything?

00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,410
Yes, I have.

00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,740
Once you arrive in the Capital,

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,900
go to Zhen Tower.

8
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,410
Someone will meet you there.

9
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,130
Don't worry. They won't uncover

10
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,290
your identity so easily.

11
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,220

14
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,100
there's something

15
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,980
I've always wanted to ask you.

16
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,170

19
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,060
Why didn't you ask then?

20

I...

21
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,010
I didn't dare.

22

All these years,

23
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,170
you must've been curious

But none of that matters.

28
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,540
Just remember:

29
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,130
Ever since the night

00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,010

If you still wish to know,

34
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,170
ask Gao Ming

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,380

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,450
Do as I instructed.

Once it's done,

42
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,810
you should all leave.

What's this?

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,020
A trap mechanism.

45
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,020
And this?

May I ask,

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,460
what's special about this lamp?

106

114

116
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,130

tea and drinks for everyone.

118
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,890
Basically, lighting this lamp costs 1,000 liang.

The last person to light it

120
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,850
was Prince Yongrong.

121
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,180
Then I won't light it.

122
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,460
And I'll give up the seat.

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,580
Once you sit in the Vermilion Bird Head,

126
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,180
you can't just walk away.

127
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,180
And once the lamp is lit,

128
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,100
you can't simply put it out.

129
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,610
To be honest,

130
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,650
I don't have that kind of money.

131

132
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,530
is all I have.

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,700
Seven liang of silver.

134
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,100
I really can't afford the seat.

135
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,850

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:34,820
Yes.

139
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,850
Here at Zhen Tower,

140
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,580
even standing to watch costs money.

141
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,980
The spot you're standing on

142
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,700
is five liang.

143
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,700
You gave me seven.

144
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,180
So now,

145
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,300
should I return the rest

146
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,300
or explain tonight's play

147
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,180
to you

148
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,220
for just two liang

149
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,610
as a welcome gesture?

150
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,060
All right.

151
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,580
Please,

152
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,820

The phoenix has passed on.

156
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,340
That phoenix

157
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,850
must be the Empress Dowager.

158
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,530
You're quite clever.

159
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,340
That phoenix is

160
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,980
the Empress Dowager who passed away eight days ago.

161
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,940
The dragon represents the late Emperor.

162
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,940
And the koi beside it

163
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,610
is Dowager Noble Consort Li,

164
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,580
his most beloved consort.

165
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,300
The dragon finds the koi

166
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,820
and ignores the phoenix's plea.

167
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,250
By rite, the Empress Dowager

168
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,130
should be buried

169
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,890
with the late Emperor.

170
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,700
But he's already interred

171
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,180
with Dowager Noble Consort Li.

172
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,980
That leaves

173
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,370
the current Emperor with a dilemma.

174
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,980
Then that golden dragon

175
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,650
must be the current Emperor.

176
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,820
What about those toads?

177
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,700
Who do they represent?

178
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,100
Obviously, the chattering officials.

179
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,770
Look. Doesn't it match perfectly?

180
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,570
The Emperor has no son.

181
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,860
For years, the ministers

182
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,700
have pressured him to name a successor.

183
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,490
Since the Empress Dowager's death,

184
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,810
they've grown ever more insistent,

185
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,380
writing memorials,

186
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,530
kneeling in protest,

187
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,140
and pleading with him to follow tradition and remove

188
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,980
Dowager Noble Consort Li from the imperial mausoleum.

189
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,050
Now the court is split in two:

190
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,420
One faction, led by the Prince of Linzi,

191
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,010
demands the Empress Dowager's will be honored,

192
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,730
while the other refuses to yield.

193
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,140
So the rooster

194
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,290
surrounded by the toads

195
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,940
is the Prince of Linzi?

196
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,090
He's the Empress Dowager's son.

197
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,860
The burial dispute

198
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,490
was brought up by him.

199
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,490
He even asked

200
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,530
to return to the Capital

201
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,730
and mourn her for a full year.

202
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,180
The golden dragon flares in anger

203
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,700
and vanishes into the clouds,

204
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,290
gone without a trace.

205
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,380
And what's the Emperor's stance?

206
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,250
Didn't you see the dragon

207
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,010
fly away?

208
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,490
He's washed his hands of it.

209
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,220
The white tiger steps in

210
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,770
and moves to quell the unrest.

211
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,220
The croaking toads raise a clamor.

212
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,330
Now only three days remain.

213
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,250
The white tiger

214
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,460
is the lead of the play, isn't it?

215
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,330
Exactly.

216
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,660
The white tiger

217
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,490
represents the Grand Master for Glorious Happiness,

218
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,180
the Marquis of Pingjin.

219
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,250
At first, the Emperor

220
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,290
assigned the funeral affairs

221
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,570
to the Ministry of Works

222
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,140
and the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

223
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,290
But the Vice Minister of Works,

224
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:47,980
Zhuang Zhifu,

225
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,290
is the Marquis's son.

226
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,900
To protect his son,

227
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,420
the Marquis had no choice but to step in.

228
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,810
Where are you going?

229
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,090
The play's not over yet.

230
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,810
Something serious

231
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,250
is about to happen here.

232
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,730
Miss, you'd better leave too.

233
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,490
What is it?

234
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,330
What did you see?

235
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,700
Come.

236
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,620
Do you see

237
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,940
that man to my right?

238
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,700
There's a steel blade

239
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,090
hidden in his folding fan.

240
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,860
And the man on my left

241
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,570
has been writing non-stop.

242
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,460
I think he's recording evidence.

243
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,250
That one?

244
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,220
Don't point.

245
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,860
Look how upright

246
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,860
he's sitting.

247
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,380
He's definitely armed.

248
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,770
And look up.

249
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,380
Several men are keeping watch upstairs.

250
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,770
I think they're here for Mr. Eight.

251
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,290
Them?

252
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,330
Those men?

253
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,250
They're guards from the Imperial Surveillance Office.

254
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,140
They answer to Mr. Cao.

255
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,860
Mr. Cao?

256
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,250
The Seal-Holding Eunuch Director

257
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,900
of the Directorate of Ceremonial.

258
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,010
He commands the Office

259
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,010
and is the head of all eunuchs.

260
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,620
From government offices

261
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,090
to inns and taverns,

262
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,220
his men

263
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,810
are everywhere in the Capital.

264
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,290
- Bravo! - Bravo!

265
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,250
And Mr. Eight dares

266
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,700
to tell such a story with the guards

267
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,330
right here?

268
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,660
Did you notice

269
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,860
the plaque in the main hall

270
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,940
when you came in?

271
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,810
"By Imperial Grace and Honor."

272
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,090
That's a jade plaque

273
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,570
personally bestowed by the Emperor.

274
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,900
With it here in Zhen Tower,

275
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,940
it's like having an imperial decree guarding the place.

276
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,980
The guards

277
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,420
have kept watch for years,

278
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,860
but they've never once made a move.

279
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,980
They may have held back before,

280
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,050
but today might be different.

281
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,530
Why?

282
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,980
Though Mr. Eight

283
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,660
only alludes to the powerful with code names,

284
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,530
he's surely offended quite a few of them.

285
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,010
And today,

286
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,180
he's spoken of the Emperor himself,

287
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,220
revealing too many secrets from within the palace.

288
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,330
With Mr. Cao

289
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,730
deeply trusted by the Emperor,

290
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,660
the guards have

291
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,570
perfect reasons to strike.

292
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,490
Even that jade plaque

293
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,810
may not be enough

294
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,620
to protect him.

295
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,140
Then by your logic,

296
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,420
Mr. Eight

297
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,770
may not live to see tomorrow.

298
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,900
Miss,

299
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,700
if you know Mr. Eight,

300
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,380
you'd best tell him to leave, now.

301
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,980
This place is full of agents.

302
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,250
With their skill and methods,

303
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,570
he wouldn't escape even with wings.

304
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,810
You're a clever man.

305
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,140
Think of something for him.

306
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,730
Me?

307
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,490
What can I possibly do?

308
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,770
This has nothing to do with me.

309
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,620
Nonsense.

310
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,330
You could do him a great favor.

311
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,810
Huh?

312
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,010
So you are Mr. Eight!

313
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,180
What an honor.

314
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,460
Miss,

315
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,140
what are you doing?

316
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,940
I'd never seen

317
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,900
Mr. Eight's face before.

318
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,050
Turns out it's someone

319
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,980
so striking.

320
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,860
The man on stage

321
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,140
is just a stand-in, then?

322
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,530
How gracious of you

323
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,810
to enjoy the play among us.

324
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,860
Mr. Eight?

325
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:10,860
Mr. Eight!

326
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,250
Mr. Eight!

327
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,570
Please, accept my humble salute.

328
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,980
What are you trying to do?

329
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,010
No one's ever seen Mr. Eight.

330
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,460
You're him now.

331
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,380
So run.

332
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,090
I...

333
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,570
Why don't you write a book, sir?

334
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,220
We'd love that!

335
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,330
Exactly!

336
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,240
Mr. Eight.

337
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,460
Mr. Eight,

338
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,900
where are you going?

339
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,900
Don't leave.

340
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,870
Don't go.

341
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,160
Where are you headed?

342
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,730
Mr. Eight!

343
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,380
Why are you running off?

344
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,980
Tell us more.

345
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,140
Over there! Go!

346
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:09,860
Stop!

347
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,010
- Get him! - Go!

348
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,420
Fool.

349
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,460
- Get him! - This way!

350
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,140
Where did he go?

351
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,180
Over here!

352
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,810
Get over here.

353
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,700
Don't move. Just follow my lead.

354
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,250
Mr. Wang,

355
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,620
you're drunk.

356
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,050
You can't hold your liquor at all.

357
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,660
You barely had a drop!

358
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,490
Mr. Wang,

359
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,250
you're drunk already?

360
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,010
Come on now.

361
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,940
The Earl of Dingyuan's son is still

362
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,250
waiting for you at Zhen Tower.

363
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,380
Come on. Let's go.

364
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,420
Come with me.

365
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,620
We'll keep drinking.

366
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,250
Anything?

367
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,010
We lost him.

368
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,530
No sign of him.

369
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,620
All right.

370
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,860
Let's go.

371
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,860
Mr. Wang,

372
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,220
watch your step.

373
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,250
Master,

374
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,220
I didn't expect

375
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,490
you'd be the one to pick me up.

376
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,530
You were headed for the Capital.

377
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,330
Of course

378
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,490
I came ahead to make arrangements.

379
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,860
If I hadn't been here,

380
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,530
you might've

381
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,620
died today.

382
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,460
I really let my guard down today.

383
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,530
Didn't expect

384
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,570
to be taught a lesson at Zhen Tower.

385
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,730
Who was that girl who tricked you?

386
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,700
No idea.

387
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,180
I only know she works for the tower.

388
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,010
Master,

389
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,050
are those guards

390
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,980
really that dangerous?

391
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,330
Don't worry.

392
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,090
They're just

393
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,770
a bunch of men carrying out orders.

394
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,180
They've probably realized by now

395
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,460
that you weren't their target.

396
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:29,900
Kid,

397
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,490
now you've seen

398
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,050
how much danger and hidden power

399
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,180
lie in the Capital.

400
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,770
You're right.

401
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,530
I'll have to be more careful.

402
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,980
Still,

403
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,050
I did learn something.

404
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,290
At least I now know

405
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,730
what the Marquis of Pingjin is working on.

406
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,900
Let's hear it.

407
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,050
It's about the Empress Dowager's burial.

408
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,940
The court is split in two.

409
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,090
One side insists on maintaining the current plan,

410
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,660
keeping the late Emperor buried with Dowager Noble Consort Li.

411
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,140
The other demands

412
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,700
her coffin be removed

413
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,140
so the late Emperor and Empress can be buried together.

414
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,460
The Emperor,

415
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,460
caught in the middle, handed the problem

416
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,010
to the Marquis of Pingjin's son,

417
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,810
Vice Minister of Works, Zhuang Zhifu.

418
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,250
Now, with only three days left,

419
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,730
the Marquis of Pingjin has stepped up

420
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,730
to take charge.

421
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,700
He's been

422
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,090
searching the Capital

423
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,940
for feng shui masters.

424
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,490
Tell me.

425
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,490
Who was the Empress Dowager?

426
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,980
The late Emperor's wife.

427
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,940
The current Emperor's imperial mother.

428
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,330
And who was Dowager Noble Consort Li?

429
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,420
The Emperor's birth mother

430
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,940
and the late Emperor's favorite consort.

431
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,530
Then who's really caught in this conflict?

432
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,460
The Emperor?

433
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,330
So while this

434
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:41,940
may look

435
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,530
like a ritual dispute between old and new courtiers,

436
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,010
at its heart,

437
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,420
it's a power struggle

438
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,380
between the Emperor and the court.

439
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,180
If he doesn't move the noble consort's coffin,

440
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,220
he'll lose the ministers' support.

441
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,530
But if he does,

442
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,570
he angers the people.

443
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,490
Whatever he chooses, he loses something.

444
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,220
So,

445
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,290
do you still think

446
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,460
this can be solved by hiring

447
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,460
a feng shui master?

448
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,380
Then surely the Marquis of Pingjin

449
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,330
understands this too.

450
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,050
Why is he going along with it?

451
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,380
Because

452
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,050
it's about showing that he's tried.

453
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,220
Take them all!

454
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,090
Come.

455
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,380
Let go of me!

456
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,940
[Coffin Shop]
Sirs, you've got the wrong man!

457
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,090
I don't know a thing about feng shui!

458
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,810
You've got the wrong man!

459
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,730
I just make coffins!

460
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,530
Honey...

461
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,620
They're rounding up

462
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,980
every feng shui master they can find,

463
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,180
anyone even loosely connected

464
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,220
to funerals.

465
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,920
Please, don't!

466
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,530
A few days ago,

467
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,730
they even took a man who sold incense.

468
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,810
Move!

469
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,860
This is the Marquis of Pingjin

470
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,010
sending a message to the court:

471
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,660
he's doing his best.

472
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,010
Master,

473
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:49,980
allow me.

474
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,420
Master,

475
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,570
do I look like a feng shui master to you?

476
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,980
What, are you ready to enter the game?

477
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,620
- Son... - Father!

478
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,250
Father!

479
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,010
- Sir... - Father!

480
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,380
Move!

481
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,380
Father!

482
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,490
- Son. - Father!

483
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,660
Sir...

484
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,810
Sir...

485
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,570
Please spare me, sir!

486
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,290
I'm not a feng shui master.

487
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,180
I just sell joss paper,

488
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,050
paper dolls, and paper horses.

489
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,380
I swear I know nothing of feng shui!

490
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,090
Father!

491
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,900
Is that so?

492
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,050
I'm telling the truth!

493
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,180
Father.

494
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,050
Father.

495
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,420
Son...

496
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,090
Father!

497
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,380
Son...

498
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:46,940
Father.

499
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,010
Do you know it now?

500
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,490
I do...

501
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,860
Please, sir,

502
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,380
don't kill my son!

503
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:56,940
Take him.

504
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,180
Sir...

505
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,050
- Father. - Son.

506
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,980
Father.

507
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,010
- Son! - Father!

508
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,290
Sir, we're still short one man.

509
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,330
Wait.

510
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:03,980
Father.

511
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,460
If you know it,

512
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,730
then your son must know it too.

513
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,860
Let him help you.

514
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,140
Sir,

515
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,900
you just promised not to kill him!

516
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,980
He's just a child!

517
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,290
Please, let him go.

518
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,140
I'm not killing him.

519
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,570
But I never said I wouldn't take him.

520
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,140
Take them both.

521
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,620
Son...

522
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,530
Oh, my boy.

523
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,810
Sir, please wait!

524
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,860
Who is this?

525
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,570
I heard you were

526
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,010
searching for feng shui masters.

527
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,490
I'm no expert,

528
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,700
but I know a thing or two about the art.

529
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,730
I'm willing to help.

530
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,140
Would you consider

531
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,290
letting the child go?

532
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,050
Interesting.

533
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,420
You walked right into this yourself.

534
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,620
Very well. Come along too.

535
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,420
Move!

536
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,180
Sir, wait.

537
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,860
Feng shui is delicate work.

538
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,980
Kids are clumsy by nature.

539
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,050
We wouldn't want the child

540
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,180
to mess up your plans, right, sir?

541
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,570
Oh, son.

542
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:21,940
Now move.

543
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,380
Up!

544
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:32,940
Father!

545
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,730
I'm fine, son. I'll be fine!

546
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,180
I'm just a butcher.

547
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,620
I've helped a Taoist priest

548
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,700
gut a piglet. That's it.

549
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,090
What would I know

550
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,980
about feng shui?

551
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,490
Marquis of Pingjin,

552
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,180
even a pig's better than you!

553
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,860
If I can

554
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,250
trade my life

555
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,490
for my son's safety,

556
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,570
I'll die content.

557
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,570
Sir...

558
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,330
Kind sir,

559
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,330
thank you

560
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,330
for saving my boy.

561
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,090
Please,

562
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,940
get up.

563
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,900
Your kindness

564
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,620
is beyond measure.

565
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,860
I may never

566
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,700
have the chance to repay it in this life.

567
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,490
But in the next, I, Fan Liu, would gladly serve you,

568
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,490
even as a beast of burden.

569
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,660
No need for that.

570
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,380
With luck,

571
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,460
we might just make it out alive.

572
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,700
What were you thinking?

573
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,180
We all tried to run,

574
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,490
and you volunteered?

575
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,090
Do you really know this stuff,

576
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,050
or are you just faking it?

577
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,010
Come on, everyone.

578
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,660
We're just going to see the Marquis of Pingjin,

579
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,770
not King Yan.
[*god of death]

580
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,900
Are you saying

581
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,490
you can fix this?

582
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,180
Let fate decide.

583
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,220
I'm tired.

584
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,860
Mr. Fan,

585
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,940
please wake me when we arrive.

586
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,290
Thanks.

587
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,250
All right.

588
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,140
We're about to die,

589
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,010
and he wants a nap?

590
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:24,770
Out!

591
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,810
What are you staring at? Move!

592
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,770
Hurry!

593
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,530
- Hurry, now! - Let's go!

594
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,290
- Move it. - Hurry up!

595
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,810
Hurry!

596
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,570
What are you looking at?

597
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,250
Keep moving!

598
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,620
- Move it. - Go!

599
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,620
- Go. - Move.

600
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,140
- Move it! - Hurry!

601
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:41,940
Move.

602
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,420
Move it.

603
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,320
- Get in. - Move it.

604
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,620
Inside. Go!

605
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,100
Get in.

606
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,250
Get in!

607
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,010
Move!

608
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,250
Shut the gate!

609
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,090
Open up!

610
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,290
- Let me out! - Open the gate!

611
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,180
- Let me out! - Let us out!

612
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,070
Stay close to the wall.

613
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,880
If you want to live, don't move!

614
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,000
What is this place?

615
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,000
We have no other choice

616
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,440
but to move forward now.

617
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,440
This tomb is full of traps.

618
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,040
You must

619
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:33,960
step exactly where I tell you.

620
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,800
And don't touch anything.

621
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:36,710
Is that clear?

622
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,150
This is the Wing-Chariot Turtle,

623
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,960
facing south with its back to the north.

624
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,190
"Among the Five Elements, Water and Earth always remain.

625
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,630
Among the Nine Stars,

626
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,270
Fuxing and Bixing stay close."

627
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,590
This place

628
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,960
must've been built following the Nine-Star Layout.

629
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,400
That way

630
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,800
is west.

631
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,920
You mean

632
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,360
you can get us out?

633
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,920
I'll try.

634
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,110
Everyone, listen carefully.

635
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,840
When I count to three,

636
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:14,960
we'll move together.

637
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,190
Fan Liu, come here.

638
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,960
You'll step

639
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,670
on the second tile to the west.

640
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:22,840
Butcher,

641
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,880
you'll step

642
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,440
on the third tile to the west.

643
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:26,920
Got it?

644
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:28,800
One,

645
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,480
two,

646
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,480
three!

647
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,440
The traps here

648
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,270
are all linked.

649
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,630
As long as you're in the right spot,

650
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,750
you'll be safe.

651
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,150
Sir,

652
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,000
on my count, step back

653
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,130
onto the first tile

654
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,210
to your east.

655
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,250
And you, sir,

656
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,480
step

657
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,840
onto the first tile to the west.

658
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,090
Are you sure this is the one?

659
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,360
Trust me.

660
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,530
All right.

661
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,280
I... I'll do it.

662
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,130
Ready?

663
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:18,840
One,

664
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:21,760
two,

665
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,640
three!

666
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,800
"The Bumu and Jiaoji Stars bring ill omens.

667
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,320
When the Renzhuan Star presides, all remains calm and smooth.

668
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,840
Lizao, Demon, and Confusion Stars are of one kind,

669
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,680
and joined by Hedao, the four spell disaster."

670
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,200
You may have left the battlefield, My Lord,

671
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,010
but your strength is undiminished.

672
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,360
Every arrow hits the mark.

673
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,130
Your grace hasn't faded one bit.

674
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,240
- Indeed. - Exactly.

675
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,610
Since he doesn't know when to shut up,

676
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,490
cut his tongue out.

677
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,410
Have mercy, My Lord!

678
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,800
Please spare me, My Lord!

679
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,410
My Lord...

680
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,160
Let's go.

681
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,050
My Lord...

682
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,530
Sir,

683
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,450
they're all inside the tomb passage now.

684
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:13,890
My Lord,

685
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,840
another batch

686
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,130
of feng shui masters has arrived.

687
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,160
What about the previous ones?

688
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,970
They've been dealt with,

689
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,930
as you ordered.

690
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,680
Over 80 men,

691
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,240
and not one

692
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,890
with a working solution?

693
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,610
True masters of feng shui

694
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,970
tend to live in seclusion.

695
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,320
I've sent more men

696
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,760
across the land to seek them out.

697
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,090
We'll find one, My Lord,

698
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,090
and solve this crisis.

699
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:37,930
Mr. Chu,

700
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,530
if I rely on you to "put out the fire",

701
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,090
then my own residence

702
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,320
may soon go up in flames.

703
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,570
Forgive me, My Lord.

704
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,360
I'll do everything I can.

705
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,160
Switch bows.

706
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:02,680
Here, father.

707
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,800
May I ask you something?

708
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,720
Isn't the Empress Dowager's burial

709
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,610
a matter between the Emperor and the court?

710
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,840
Why turn to feng shui for a solution?

711
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,530
Everyone has their own opinion

712
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,680
on the matter,

713
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,360
but only

714
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,890
the Emperor's view truly matters.

715
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,010
However,

716
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,840
while his intentions are easy to guess,

717
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,490
finding a solution

718
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,130
that satisfies both sides

719
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,320
is a real challenge.

720
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,490
What if we never find

721
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,160
a qualified master?

722
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,930
Then I'll find another way.

723
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,360
But first,

724
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,760
you must play your part well.

725
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,320
Don't give them

726
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:42,680
anything to use against you.

727
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,930
No matter what,

728
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,970
I will protect you.

729
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,160
I understand.

730
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,280
Thank you, Father.

731
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,360
"When Earth's essence aligns with virtue, destiny flows without hindrance.

732
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,970
Whether the Five Energies are imbalanced or whole decides fortune or ruin.

733
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,890
Heaven above, Earth below, it is Man who holds the highest worth.

734
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,890
Follow the way, and you find fortune; resist it, and ruin follows."

735
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,840
I think I stepped on the wrong tile.

736
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,840
Get down!

737
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,930
What was that?

738
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,360
Don't move!

739
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,590
Those are Bone-Cutting Wires,

740
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,220
a tomb trap passed down

741
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,390
from the previous dynasty.

742
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,620
Didn't expect to see them here.

743
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,340
How are we supposed to get through?

744
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,260
These wires

745
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,530
can slice through iron,

746
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,780
but they're very rare.

747
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:30,980
No tomb builder

748
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,740
would lay them without a plan.

749
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,900
There must be a pattern

750
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,490
to follow.

751
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:39,900
Butcher,

752
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,900
step on the fourth tile to the west.

753
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,860
Fan Liu,

754
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,740
step on the fourth tile to the southwest.

755
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,170
Got it.

756
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,820
We'll move together

757
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,940
toward the edge

758
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,010
of the trap.

759
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,980
On my count:

760
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:57,900
One,

761
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,460
two,

762
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:00,820
three!

763
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,740
"Study the Stems and Branches,

764
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,490
and fate shall reveal its blessings and misfortunes.

765
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,490
To awaken the unaware,

766
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,090
one must grasp the laws of harmony and opposition."

767
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,010
One,

768
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,780
two,

769
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,740
three!

770
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,980
I've reached the end.

771
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,490
Then open the gate already!

772
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,860
I can't leave yet.

773
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,460
This is the passage to the imperial tomb.

774
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,010
Its defenses are far tighter

775
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,380
than any ordinary burial chamber.

776
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,010
If I leave

777
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,610
this tile,

778
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,380
yours

779
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,610
will shift,

780
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,010
and the trap will be triggered.

781
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:53,780
What do we do?

782
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,460
Don't panic.

783
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,860
Just keep following my lead.

784
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,170
We're standing in a Nine-Star Layout.

785
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,980
Next,

786
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,530
we need to reverse the path from the Yellow Star in the Center Palace.

787
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,050
The Yellow Star in the Center Palace...

788
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,570
Butcher,

789
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,340
step

790
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,010
on the second tile to the northwest.

791
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,210
Fan Liu,

792
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,130
step

793
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,900
on the fourth tile to the southwest.

794
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,610
Okay...

795
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,860
Get ready.

796
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,340
One,

797
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,570
two...

798
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,530
Sir...

799
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,050
Trust me.

800
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,940
All right. Let's go.

801
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,380

802
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,090
