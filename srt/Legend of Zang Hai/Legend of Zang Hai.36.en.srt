[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,100
Everything is here, Miss Xiang.

4
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,540
Where is Master Gao Ming?

5
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,740
He went to buy horses.

6
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,500
We have a lot of people and luggage.

7
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,990
Not even three horse carriages can fit.

8
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,120
I've dismissed the indentured

9
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,980
maids and servants.

10
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,380
I also gave them some extra money.

11
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,050
I'm sure you don't mind, Mr. Zang.

12
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,540
No one in the capital

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,020
makes more money than you, Miss Xiang.

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,820
In the future,

15
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,410
we have to rely on you.

16
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,340
Hai.

17
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,290
Hai.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,780
Look who's here.

19
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,890
Mr. Zhao.

20
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:19,980
Sir.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,980
Zang Hai.

22
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,380
Are you going to resign and leave the capital?

23
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,730
I've submitted my resignation to the Cabinet.

24
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,830
I plan to tell you

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,730
after His Majesty approves.

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,660
Are you free

27
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,890
to talk with me now?

28
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,220
A horse carriage

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,980
can go left

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,340
or right.

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,690
Yet,

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,060
the rein is in the coachman's hands.

33
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,660
Sometimes, I think

34
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,890
people are like these horses.

35
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,290
They seem like they have a choice

36
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,170
but in truth,

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,940
it's out of their control.

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,890
I rescued you back then

39
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,690
and asked you to make your own decision.

40
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,570
You chose revenge.

41
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,850
However, I've been thinking all these years.

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,210
Was I right

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,510
to let a child

44
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,340
make such a cruel choice?

45
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,660
I owed you a debt of gratitude for saving me.

46
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,290
You also asked my masters to take care of me, raise me,

47
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,130
and let me get my revenge.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,170
I will never blame you.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,690
Yes.

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,060
You've grown up gradually

51
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,820
and have matured.

52
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,380
Right now,

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,100
your third enemy is dead.

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,520
You can begin a new life now.

55
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,870
I want you to make another decision.

56
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,780
Sir, spare me some food.

57
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,050
Sir, spare me some food.

58
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,540
Sir.

59
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,060
- Show some mercy. - Sir.

60
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,100
- Have a heart. - Spare me some food.

61
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,540
Sir.

62
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,020
Sir, show some mercy.

63
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,850
Have a heart, sir.

64
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,030
Have a heart, sir.

65
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,540
Sir.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,730
Spare me some food.

67
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,610
Spare me some food.

68
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,200
Spare some food, sir.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,050
Thank you, sir.

70
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,490
Spare me some food.

71
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,470
Be kind, sir.

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,850
Thank you, sir.

73
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,050
Thank you, sir.

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,410
Thank you.

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,540
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

76
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,050
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

77

- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

78
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,490
Thank you, sir.

79
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:34,340
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,850
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

81
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,810
Thank you, sir.

82
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,930
Thank you, sir.

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,810
Take it for him.

84
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,290
Thank you, sir.

85
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,980
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,050
We have food now.

87
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,100
Quick. We have food now.

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,220
After so many years,

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,660
corrupt officials bled the Great Yong dry.

90
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,610
The nine rivers flood every year.

91
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,900
Imperial exams are mostly rigged.

92
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,370
There are still people who starve to death

93
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,100
under the Emperor's rule.

94
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,780
What decision

95
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,020
are you talking about?

96
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,340
Do you still remember when you first entered the Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion

97
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,580
and exchanged all the gifts you received

98
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,410
into food for the starving people?

99
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,100
Your father

100
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,930
used to do the same as well.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,900
He would ask those who starved to work

102
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,050
in exchange for food.

103
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,100
Many of your seniors

104
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,780
are orphans of refugees.

105
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,930
They had no one to rely on since young

106
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,780
and were raised by your father at his mansion.

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,340
However,

108
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,780
that was all he did.

109
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,610
Do you still remember

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,610
what I said to you

111
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,900
when you came to my place

112
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,290
to probe me back then?

113
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,780
Before you can

114
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,730
achieve what you set out to achieve,

115
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,610
assume that you have achieved it.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,220
You mean...

117
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,170
Your father could only save them for a while.

118
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,290
Why not go further

119
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,290
and save the people forever?

120
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,930
From tomorrow onward,

121
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,220
I will be the interim Chief Cabinet Secretary.

122
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,250
You have the talent to be a great leader.

123
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,290
If you want to do it,

124
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,370
[Imperial Edict]
accept this edict to join the Cabinet

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,730
and become an official in the imperial court.

126
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,340
If you want to be free from now on,

127
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,780
just reject it.

128
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,050
Go and live the life that you want

129
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,730
yet can't possess until now.

130
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:27,380
[Imperial Edict]

131
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:32,890
Let's go.

132
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,490
Antu.

133
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,730
I have a way.

134
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,650
What is it?

135
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,130
Resign.

136
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,580
Let everyone know that we are leaving the capital

137
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,490
and will not come back again.

138
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,250
If the third enemy truly exists,

139
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,490
he knows who I am

140
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,180
and knows I have knowledge of the Gui Seal and bronze fish.

141
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,370
Do you think he will let me go

142
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,250
and allow me to leave freely?

143
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,490
He will surely keep you by his side where he can see you

144
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,650
and do everything to see

145
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,010
whether you give the Gui Seal and bronze fish to the Emperor or not.

146
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,340
He will make sure that you won't ruin the next step in his plan.

147
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,940
He will even kill you

148
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,490
when it's necessary.

149
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,490
That's right.

150
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,370
The person who doesn't want us to leave the most

151
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,820
might be the third enemy.

152
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,100
He asked me to stay in the capital

153
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,010
and aid him in the Cabinet.

154
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,370
Right now,

155
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,770
he is the only one

156
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,250
who has asked me to stay.

157
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,770
What if he only appreciates you as a talent

158
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,100
and it is all a coincidence?

159
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,490
No matter what, I must give it a try.

160
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,770
Not only will I see him every day

161
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,250
after joining the Cabinet,

162
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,010
but I will also have access to many confidential files.

163
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,890
Whether it is him or not,

164
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,890
I will find out the truth.

165
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,420
Help me keep an eye

166
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,100
on Master.

167
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,730
If Zhao Bingwen is the third enemy,

168
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,580
are we going to suspect

169
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,100
Master Gao Ming as well?

170
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,010
If my benefactor is truly the third enemy,

171
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,130
Master

172
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,850
might have been deceived as well.

173
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,770
However, they share a genuine

174
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,130
relationship.

175
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,370
Whether it's my benefactor or Master,

176
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,700
I can't show them my true self

177
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,370
before the truth comes to light.

178
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,980
Don't worry.

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,100
I know what to do.

180
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,340
Why is it always so hard

181
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,940
to write the words Balance and Harmony?

182
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,180
You taught me

183
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,060
it must be without excess and deficiency.

184
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,220
[Balance and Harmony]
Precision is hard to attain.

185
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,490
The same goes for calligraphy as well.

186
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,370
A gentleman

187
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,100
is only a person of balance and harmony

188
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,490
if they have the virtues of a gentry.

189
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,770
To interpret it narrowly, it's the virtue of preserving life.

190
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,100
To interpret it broadly, it's to deliver the people from suffering.

191
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,310
That is why you asked Zang Hai to join the Cabinet

192
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,180
and help you govern the empire and help the people.

193
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,250
However...

194
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,060
Zang Hai is still young.

195
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,370
This is not where he excels.

196
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,580
[One...]

197
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,340
Is this your opinion

198
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,010
or Zang Hai's opinion?

199
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,100
Zang Hai admires and respects you a lot.

200
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,890
This is merely my opinion.

201
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,530
Are you hiding anything from me?

202
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,100
I dare not.

203
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,940
You should

204
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,300
do your job well as a master.

205
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,770
Don't let the past incident repeat itself.

206
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,650
Have you found the bronze fish?

207
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,890
Zang Hai is very cautious.

208
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,180
I still can't take action.

209
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,770
[One Must First Give Something Away]
It'll be too late if you don't act soon.

210
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,370
I'm doing this for his own good.

211
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,610
Getting him to stay in the capital and join the Cabinet

212
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,770
is the only way to protect him.

213
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,370
I will act as soon as possible.

214
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,490
Mr. Zhao.

215
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,700
Thanks to His Majesty's grace,

216
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,820
I will take over as interim Chief Cabinet Secretary.

217
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,180
I still need everyone's help

218
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,940
regarding the Cabinet's matters.

219
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,650
Please order us as you see fit, Mr. Zhao.

220
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,490
Everyone is sad about what happened to the Shi family.

221
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,490
Mr. Shi did his best to serve the Emperor.

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,820
I hope all of you can follow his ambition

223
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,220
and do your duty in the Cabinet

224
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,770
to share His Majesty's burdens.

225
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,650
Yes.

226
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,090
His Majesty has approved Zang Hai's appointment to the Cabinet.

227
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,730
In the future, he can participate in important matters of the imperial court.

228
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,580
Zang Hai, you can enter the Cabinet's archive

229
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,820
as you wish.

230
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,610
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

231
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,730
All right.

232
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,610
Get ready for today's meeting.

233
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,730
Zang Hai.

234
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,580
If you need any help,

235
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,530
come and ask me any time.

236
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,340
There's no need to be so formal between us.

237
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,610
Yes.

238
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,650
Mr. Zhao,

239
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,700
I have something to ask you.

240
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,900
[Request Granted]

241
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,340
[Deputy Chief Grand Secretary, Zhao Bingwen]

242
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,700
[Deputy Chief Grand Secretary, Zhao Bingwen]

243
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,650
I've gone through the draft opinions in the last few years.

244
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,980
I realized most of them were drafted by Mr. Zhao.

245
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,420
From what he wrote,

246
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,220
his integrity and loyalty are infallible.

247
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,250
In that case,

248
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,090
not only does he not have any flaws,

249
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,100
but the more you investigate,

250
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,620
the more he seems like an official who cares about the empire and the people.

251
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,010
Have we misunderstood him?

252
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,250
I'm not sure

253
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,770
if he wants to nurture me

254
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,290
or learn about the whereabouts of my bronze fish.

255
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,870
There must be a larger objective

256
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,440
for him to put up an act for so long.

257
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,330
Before you achieve

258
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,660
what you set out to achieve,

259
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,700
assume that you have achieved it.

260
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,180
I must keep investigating.

261
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,980
What comes next is a test of patience.

262
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,380
[Landscape of Mount Yuren]

263
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,530
Darn you, Xiang Antu.

264
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,420
You've been ignoring me recently.

265
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,810
What brought you here today?

266
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,250
I'm here to see you today.

267
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,620
Look.

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,860
I brewed some premium flower tea for you.

269
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,810
Try it.

270
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,290
I even bought you some fragrance powder.

271
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,770
Not bad.

272
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,570
They are for you if you like them.

273
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,490
That's more like it.

274
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,620
How are you doing with Zang Hai recently?

275
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,250
He just joined the Cabinet

276
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,090
and is busy with court matters with your father every day.

277
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,490
I can't even see him.

278
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,620
I knew it.

279
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,710
You only remember me

280
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,900
when you can't hang out with him.

281
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,700
This painting...

282
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,730
Do you recognize this drawing?

283
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,980
It belongs to my father.

284
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,380
I've seen it since young.

285
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,220
Of course, I recognize it.

286
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,810
This is it.

287
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,530
Why do you have this painting?

288
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,730
This painting was in Shi Yiping's residence.

289
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,420
Zang Hai requested it from the Emperor after his death.

290
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,250
Why would Shi Yiping

291
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,380
possess my father's painting?

292
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,810
Whatever.

293
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,050
Zang Hai is such a sweet person.

294
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,690
He requested

295
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,330
a painting of Dongxia from the Emperor for you

296
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,940
so you won't feel homesick.

297
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,420
That's right.

298
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,770
He has no time to accompany me.

299
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,010
He owes me this painting.

300
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,620
All right.

301
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,220
You shouldn't stay in your house all the time.

302
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,460
Come and have fun with me outside.

303
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,700
Mr. Zhao,

304
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,140
I have something I don't understand. Please guide me.

305
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,050
The documents submitted by the Ministry of Works recently

306
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,090
were all rejected by the Cabinet.

307
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,180
It's spring

308
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,810
and many places suffer from floods.

309
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,700
The Ministry of Works knows the damage it will cause

310
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,220
and wants to improve the flood control system

311
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,610
but for some reason...

312
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,600
Zang Hai.

313
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,010
In recent years,

314
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,570
Yong's treasury has been drained.

315
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,810
Even the Ministry of Rites

316
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,660
struggled to organize the Spring Exam, let alone the Ministry of Works.

317
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:47,330
If we keep allocating money to every ministry's needs,

318
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,050
we're going to create a bigger problem.

319
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,700
This problem must be dealt with from its roots.

320
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,490
Are you talking about getting rid of corruption?

321
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,010
That's right.

322
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,980
The treasury's money

323
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,290
has gone to the corrupt officials.

324
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,620
It's no use no matter how much money you allocate.

325
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,490
In the end, it's the problem of the law.

326
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,290
A heavy punishment is needed

327
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,140
to get rid of corruption.

328
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,660
But doing this

329
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,810
will bring the opposite effect.

330
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,220
Zang Hai.

331
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,010
If you can think of that,

332
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,090
it's very good.

333
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,940
This is also what I'm most worried about.

334
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,380
The corruption culture in the imperial court

335
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,810
happens mostly due to officials

336
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,860
who can't feed their families with their meager salaries.

337
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,810
If you don't want them to harm the common people,

338
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,530
killing a few of them won't solve the problem.

339
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,660
I've petitioned the Emperor

340
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,900
to increase the salaries of all fifth-rank officials and above

341
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,570
by 30%.

342
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,140
This is the money

343
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,530
that the imperial court must spend.

344
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,090
One must have a roof above their head

345
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,530
and a full tummy.

346
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,900
Officials must be able to feed their families

347
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,530
so they don't prey on the people.

348
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,490
This is a good method indeed.

349
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:30,940
However...

350
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,140
shouldn't we start

351
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,730
from those working closely with the people?

352
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,770
If the treasury has a lot of money,

353
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,810
I will surely do that.

354
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,380
However, prioritizing the small officials

355
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,090
over the powerful officials

356
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,810
is not something even the Emperor can do.

357
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,220
As the saying goes, "If one intends to take something,

358
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,770
one must first give something away."

359
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,380
You are involved in the imperial court now.

360
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,330
You must remember this in the future.

361
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,980
Yes.

362
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,490
I will remember it.

363
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,420
Tong'er came today

364
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,660
and recognized the painting to be Mr. Zhao's.

365
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,380
She even asked why the painting ended up in our place.

366
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,530
It's his indeed.

367
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,660
This is very suspicious indeed.

368
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,420
I've never lied to Tong'er before.

369
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,330
I didn't tell her the truth today

370
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,380
and I feel a little guilty.

371
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,090
She is my best friend.

372
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,010
I really hope Mr. Zhao is just your benefactor

373
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,530
and not your enemy.

374
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,980
Tong'er.

375
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,290
Father.

376
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,490
What are you looking for?

377
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,380
Father.

378
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,490
Did you give Shi Yiping this painting?

379
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,490
Which painting?

380
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,860
The "Landscape of Mount Yuren" painting

381
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,810
that was kept here previously.

382
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,370
That painting?

383
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,420
Previously,

384
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,460
I went to visit the Shi residence

385
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,050
with my colleagues

386
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,810
for a so-called painting and calligraphy appreciation session.

387
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,420
I brought this painting with me without much thought.

388
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,490
To my surprise, he loved it.

389
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,010
He forced me to give it to him

390
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,330
so I did.

391
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,860
I went to hang out with Antu today

392
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,140
and saw this painting at her place.

393
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,090
I thought I was mistaken

394
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,980
but when I came back and looked for it,

395
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,330
the painting was indeed yours.

396
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,220
This painting should belong to the imperial court

397
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,090
now that Shi Residence was seized

398
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,490
following Shi Yiping's death.

399
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,250
How come she possesses the painting?

400
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,700
She said

401
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,660
Zang Hai purposely asked the Emperor for it

402
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,530
to be given to her as a gift

403
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,900
because it was a painting of Dongxia.

404
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,140
I see.

405
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,770
Tong'er.

406
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,490
Sit with me for a while.

407
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,380
Since your mother passed away,

408
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,140
both of us have been relying on each other

409
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,050
so I allowed you

410
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,980
to go to Zhen Tower as a man

411
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,250
to tell stories.

412
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,290
Right now,

413
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,730
you are no longer a child.

414
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,810
It's time to act your age.

415
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,250
But I enjoy

416
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,980
reading and telling stories.

417
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,860
You've been rebellious

418
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,860
since your childhood

419
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,660
because I've always doted on you.

420
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,050
You do things without caring about the consequences.

421
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,010
You will regret it one day.

422
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,420
Father.

423
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,940
Zhen Tower is gone now.

424
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,420
You should cease thinking about telling and reading stories anymore.

425
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,770
From now on,

426
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,980
you should stay home and accompany me more.

427
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,090
Master.

428
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,090
I'm going to work.

429
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,570
Go back and rest.

430
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,570
Zhao Geng.

431
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,140
Yes, Master.

432
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,290
Tong'er is a lady now.

433
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,730
When she goes out in the future,

434
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,570
assign a few men to follow her

435
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,940
in case anything happens to her.

436
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:28,810
Yes.

437
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,140
Mr. Zang, it's late.

438
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,420
Our work is endless.

439
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,620
Continue tomorrow.

440
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,250
I still have work to do from the Ministry of Works

441
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,180
and Imperial Astronomical Bureau tomorrow.

442
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,140
Mr. Shi used to reprimand me in the past

443
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,180
for being lazy and carefree.

444
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,250
If he sees you now,

445
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,250
he will surely appreciate you.

446
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,050
I'll be going back.

447
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,290
What a pity.

448
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,050
I joined the Cabinet too late.

449
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,770
Otherwise, I could learn from Mr. Shi.

450
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,620
Having a superior

451
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,010
who keeps giving me reminders

452
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,090
in political affairs

453
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,330
is a lucky thing.

454
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,900
You are different

455
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,490
from what I imagined.

456
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,770
What do you mean?

457
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,490
Mr. Zang,

458
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,380
you served Zhuang Luyin in the past.

459
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,980
You became an official through recommendation.

460
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,090
However, you caused a mess in the imperial court.

461
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,140
In Mr. Shi's opinion,

462
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,460
you broke

463
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,940
the balance he spent his whole life maintaining.

464
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,010
Balance?

465
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,620
But didn't Mr. Shi

466
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,330
turn a blind eye

467
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,900
on what Cao Jingxian did?

468
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,420
Cao Jingxian and Zhuang Luyin

469
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,900
were two authoritative figures no one would dare offend.

470
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,730
Mr. Shi has been going against them

471
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,330
by leading the Cabinet.

472
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,180
Both of them are dead now.

473
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,980
Unfortunately, Mr. Shi passed away as well.

474
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,810
However, rumors in the capital are saying

475
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,050
that Mr. Shi was close to Cao Jingxian.

476
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,180
However, he was killed

477
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,900
by Cao Jingxian's surveillance officers.

478
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,290
They say both of them had a falling out

479
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,570
and turned against each other.

480
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,290
Impossible.

481
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,330
I don't believe it.

482
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,660
Mr. Shi was my superior for many years.

483
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,860
I know him

484
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,730
very well.

485
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,980
Mr. Zang,

486
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,330
let me show you something.

487
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,620
This is the name list of Yong's officials.

488
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,220
Mr. Shi gave it to me back then.

489
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,230
He started writing this name list

490
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,770
when he was the Vice Minister of Personnel.

491
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,290
Everyone said Mr. Shi

492
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,050
remembered every official of Yong

493
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,220
when he was the Vice Minister of Personnel.

494
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,570
I suppose good memory still has to make way

495
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,700
for note-taking.

496
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,460
Before the New Year,

497
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,140
Mr. Shi saw I was busy working

498
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,070
[Zhuang Luyin, the 19th Year of Zhenshun era, Dead]

499
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,570
and gave me this name list.

500
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,620
The name list has always been kept at the Cabinet

501
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,010
with no one to retrieve it.

502
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,100
[Cao Jingxian, Lu Min]

503
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,290
Lu Min?

504
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,060
[Cao Jingxian, Lu Min]

505
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,330
Lu Min...

506
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,090
I noticed this before.

507
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,250
This should be Cao Jingxian's name before he entered the palace.

508
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,940
All his foster sons have the Lu surname.

509
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,860
He just couldn't give up on passing his lineage.

510
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,140
Sir.

511
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,140
I didn't know you were coming.

512
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,570
Sorry for the poor reception.

513
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,250
Sit.

514
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,620
Thank you, sir.

515
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,010
You may leave.

516
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,530
Are you the eunuch, Mr. Liu?

517
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,660
Yes.

518
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,980
You were the one who taught the new eunuchs

519
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,090
the rules in the past.

520
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,420
I want to ask you about someone.

521
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,940
If I know something,

522
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,620
I will tell you honestly.

523
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,620
Lu Min.

524
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,490
Lu Min?

525
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,660
Lu Min...

526
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,490
I remember.

527
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,220
Do you still remember?

528
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,180
I do.

529
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,880
He wasn't castrated

530
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,140
when he entered the palace.

531
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,460
He never had manhood

532
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,530
to begin with.

533
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,380
He castrated himself.

534
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,290
There are many rules and forms of etiquette in the palace.

535
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,220
Those who graduated here

536
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,380
can have a chance of becoming a eunuch at the inner palace.

537
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,530
Lu Min was hardworking

538
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,120
and liked to study.

539
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,940
It didn't take long for him

540
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,460
to learn most of the skills

541
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,770
from veterans like us.

542
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,530
When it was time for him

543
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,490
to change his name and enter the palace,

544
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,730
he was

545
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,530
more capable than the eunuch,

546
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,620
several years his senior.

547
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,220
What did he change his name into later?

548
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,010
I don't remember.

549
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,770
I remember

550
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:14,010
he went to work at the Imperial Stables Directorate.

551
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,730
Lu Min was educated

552
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,180
and he could read.

553
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,140
He spoke in a formal and elegant way.

554
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,770
He used to say

555
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,940
that he shouldn't become a eunuch.

556
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,140
He said if he participated in an exam,

557
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,140
he would surely become a highly-ranked official.

558
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,980
He told me

559
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,620
he used to study in the best academy in the capital.

560
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,250
He studied at the Academy of Yong.

561
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,490

Are you calling me useless now?

634
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,260

was the tuition fee I received from your benefactor.

Yet,

642
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,740

You are good at pretending to be an official.

644
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,650
Did you learn it from my benefactor?

645
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,690
Why don't you become an official?

646
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,980
That won't do.

648
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,340
I'll be exposed if I become an official.

649
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,260
I don't think so.

659
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,050
I'll just serve you

660

that no matter how capable I was,

665

671
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,980
I won't need to wake you up.

672
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,170

673
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,530

680
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,780
compelled me to keep investigating

681
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,780
until the truth came out.

682
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,340
Have you thought about what you are going to do?

683
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,340
Should you tell the Emperor directly?

684
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,420
No.

685
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,570
I've hidden the bronze fish as well.

686

We can't go through the Emperor anymore.
