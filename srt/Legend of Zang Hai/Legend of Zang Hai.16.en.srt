00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,940
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,980
Look at your furrowed brows, My Lord.

4
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,410
Are you still concerned over the celestial omens?

5
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,850
I went for groceries earlier today

6
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,260
and heard people discussing it everywhere.

7
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,490
They even mentioned you, My Lord.

8
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,660
What did they say?

9
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,170
They said that Zang Hai

10
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,500
was bold enough to speculate on celestial omens and misled the public.

11
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,890
They also said that you indulged your aide

12
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,450
and failed to discipline him.

13
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,890
I usually

14
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,060
don't take the gossip to heart.

15
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,130
But the celestial omens

16
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,130
are of grave importance.

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,850
I'm worried that if the gossip passes on

18
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,570
and reaches His Majesty one day,

19
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,100
someone will use it against you, My Lord.

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,450
In my humble opinion,

21
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,010
it doesn't matter whether Zang Hai was right.

22
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,380
He went over your head to report the celestial omens.

23
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,220
Who knows

24
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,170
what he's capable of in the future?

25
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,450
We can't keep someone like him around.

26
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,060
You're saying...?

27
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,980
If you can't bear to do it,

28
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,500
I can do it for you, My Lord.

29
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,450
It's easy to kill him.

30
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,690
But what if the celestial omens

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,780
prove to be true?

32
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,690
In that case, it shows how well you recognize talents.

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,290
Though talents are rare,

34
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,500
the disobedient must be eliminated.

35
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,570
Do you think

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,730
that the general about to fall

37
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,690
could be me?

38
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,500
My Lord.

39
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,610
You really believe what he said?

40
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,290
Heavy rain in Zhongzhou. A blessed shower!

41
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,310
Good news!

42
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,280
Heavy rain in Zhongzhou. A blessed shower!

43
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,290
Heavy rain in Zhongzhou. A blessed shower!

44
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,550
Good news!

45
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,860
Heavy rain in Zhongzhou. A blessed shower!

46
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,780
[Imperial Astronomical Bureau]
Here comes His Majesty's Decree.

47
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,020
Zhongzhou has suffered from drought for months,

48
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,290
with rivers running dry, which is a matter of grave concern to me.

49
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,850
Now, auspicious rain falls by Heaven's mercy, reviving the land,

50
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,290
and relieving the people's plight, bringing universal rejoicing.

51
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,850
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau foretold this blessing

52
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,220
and shall be rewarded with 1000 liang of silver. By Imperial Decree.

53
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,900
I, Chu Huaiming, humbly thank His Majesty.

54
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,340
Gentlemen,

55
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,180
we must keep working hard

56
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,100
and live up to His Majesty's expectations.

57
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,020
Yes, sir.

58
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,980
Go back to work.

59
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,100
How is Zang Hai doing?

60
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,100
It's said that he's been eating and sleeping well

61
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,140
and sitting around leisurely during the day

62
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,770
as if nothing bothers him.

63
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,980
Get back to work.

64
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,540
Understood.

65
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,460
Mr. Chu.

66
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,810
Mr. Zang.

67
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,050
You're still able to sleep?

68
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,460
You'll fall into an eternal sleep in a few days.

69
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,340
Cultivate yourself while you are awake

70
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,050
and strive to be reincarnated into a good family.

71
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,250
News says it rained in Zhongzhou,

72
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,930
which is an auspicious sign.

73
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,100
I won. You lost.

74
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,540
Mr. Chu, what's the hurry?

75
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,660
Our Lord gave me seven days.

76
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,930
What's the use of even ten days?

77
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,780
Don't tell me

78
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,660
you still believe you can survive this.

79
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,100
The Winnowing Basket Mansion heralds wind and the Net Mansion presages rain.

80
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,700
You remember

81
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,220
this sentence by heart.

82
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,170
But I bet you haven't

83
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,490
heard of this sentence.

84
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,460
The moon is separated from the Net Mansion. Rain is coming.

85
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,580
As the Imperial Astronomer,

86
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,900
you lack expertise

87
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,290
and only report good news for rewards, ignoring the facts.

88
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,020
You can't even read the signs.

89
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,100
Enough with your alarmist rhetoric.

90
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,460
I've foretold so many auspicious omens at the bureau.

91
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,000
If you don't believe me, please go back.

92
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,370
No matter how eager you are,

93
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,100
wait for another five days

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,340
and see if I end up executed

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,730
or you end up losing everything

96
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,980
you have worked so hard for.

97
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,810
You just won't accept your defeat, huh?

98
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,020
I'm done wasting my time here.

99
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,100
Just wait for the execution.

100
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,460
How is the Marquis?

101
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,850
Last night, my father told the household to tighten security

102
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,530
and turn away all outside visitors.

103
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,820
It seems that he will stay in these days.

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,530
He looks worried.

105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm afraid it's because of the falling star you mentioned.

106
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,490
Why would you say something like that?

107
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,010
To save my life, of course.

108
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,010
It was a critical moment.

109
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,700
If I hadn't made up something dramatic,

110
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,980
your father would have killed me on the spot.

111
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,940
So I came up with that statement

112
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,180
to get myself out of trouble.

113
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,610
Generals and ministers die every year.

114
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,770
Strange weather occurs every year.

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,010
I only mentioned a falling star

116
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,220
without specifying the rank of that person.

117
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,460
It was just to fool your father.

118
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,460
If he knew he had been restless

119
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,130
because of your lie,

120
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,460
he'd kill you.

121
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,580
I only need a few more days

122
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,460
to prove

123
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,850
that I'm right.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,460
Young Master.

125
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,250
Do me a favor.

126
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,010
Get your father's former subordinates

127
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,820
to give warnings to Zhongzhou.

128
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,100
Alright.

129
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,940
I need another favor

130
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,250
from you.

131
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,820
Stay alert these days.

132
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,890
No one shall enter with weapons.

133
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:02,940
My Lord.

134
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,650
It's been raining in Zhongzhou for three days.

135
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,410
The drought has eased.

136
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,630
Everything is in order.

137
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,010
It's been three days.

138
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,980
How big is the rain?

139
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,130
It shows no sign of letting up.

140
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,820
Go to the Ministry of Works every day

141
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,370
to inquire about it from the Hydrological Bureau.

142
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,190
My Lord.

143
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,370
It's been raining for four days,

144
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,130
with the largest rainfall in a decade.

145
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,340
Water is starting

146
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,060
to gather at the terrain.

147
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,060
Go back to work.

148
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,100
It's been raining heavily for five days,

149
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,730
with rivers flooding

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,060
and rocks falling from mountains,

151
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,530
destroying a dozen houses and injuring nearly 100 people.

152
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,450
Keep me updated.

153
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,530
It's been raining for six days.

154
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,130
The water levels of nine rivers are rising.

155
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,580
We've sent someone to strengthen the dam.

156
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,940
If it keeps raining for two or three days,

157
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,340
I'm afraid the dam will break.

158
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,700
No way.

159
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,460
No way.

160
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,250
Mr. Chu.

161
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,370
Mr. Zhuang, please tell the Marquis

162
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,770
that I need to see him.

163
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,980
My Lord has been ill these days

164
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,820
and has stopped receiving visitors.

165
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,300
Mr. Chu, please go back.

166
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,340
Why?

167
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,580
On what ground?

168
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,490
Zang Hai.

169
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,220
I wish you die!

170
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,730
What did

171
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,100
Mr. Cao say?

172
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,340
He said

173
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,460
that you should apologize to His Majesty as soon as possible.

174
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,180
Mr. Cao is not going to save me?

175
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,850
He can't just abandon me.

176
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,730
Master said

177
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,650
that with the relentless rainfall in Zhongzhou,

178
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,370
His Majesty hasn't slept well lately

179
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,530
and has barely eaten for days.

180
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,530
Mr. Chu.

181
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,490
You read the omens wrong and endangered the people.

182
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,940
You are on your own.

183
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,700
Father, he left.

184
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,710
Zang Hai...

185
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,340
It's him again.

186
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,650
He even went after the Imperial Astronomer.

187
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,180
Imperial Astronomer...

188
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,380
[Confinement Chamber]

189
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,580
Greetings, Mr. Chu.

190
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,460
Zang Hai,

191
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,220
don't you look great?

192
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,530
How can you be so confident?

193
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,530
Judging from your look,

194
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,460
I bet it has been raining in Zhongzhou for days,

195
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,130
which caused floods.

196
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,890
Zang Hai.

197
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,220
You are the Marquis's aide.

198
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,250
I also work for the Marquis.

199
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,850
We are in the same boat.

200
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,180
We shouldn't fight each other.

201
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,340
If you want to be an official,

202
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,980
I can put in a good word

203
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,890
with our Lord.

204
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,940
If you want money,

205
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,460
I can help you.

206
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,820
How much do you want? Name a price.

207
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,650
Zang Hai.

208
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,370
Zang Hai.

209
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,250
You only have to tell our Lord

210
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,980
that the celestial omens

211
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,580
carry mixed messages.

212
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,580
I read the auspicious part

213
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,980
and you the ominous part.

214
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,940
We were both correct.

215
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,490
We just didn't foresee it all.

216
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,890
In that case,

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,300
I'll just be punished for negligence

218
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,490
and you will get to live.

219
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,980
It's a win-win.

220
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,060
What do you think?

221
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,460
Mr. Chu.

222
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,100
Are you begging me?

223
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,610
I lack expertise

224
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,650
and read the celestial omens wrong.

225
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,940
Mr. Zang.

226
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,940
I recommended you

227
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,490
to the Marquis.

228
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,650
Since we are both serving our Lord,

229
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,580
help me out.

230
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,460
In return, I'll go through

231
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,850
any hardship for you whenever you need me.

232
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,940
Honestly, Mr. Chu.

233
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,460
All those offers

234
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,420
sound highly tempting.

235
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,100
Right?

236
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,700
Then let's...

237
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,130
But what's wrong is wrong.

238
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,100
If all the right and wrong, true and false,

239
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,010
and good and evil can be altered in this world,

240
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,940
it would be against my parents' teachings

241
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,650
and the court's discipline and laws.

242
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,770
Mr. Chu.

243
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,100
This play has started.

244
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,610
How can we stop halfway?

245
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,530
Zang Hai.

246
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,700
You're determined to destroy me?

247
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,770
There's no bad blood between us.

248
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,370
Why do you want me dead so badly?

249
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,060
So you know that there's no bad blood between us.

250
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,890
Then why did you try to kill me

251
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,530
again and again at the Late Emperor's Mausoleum?

252
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,460
You caught those folk people

253
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,490
and made them "feng shui masters".

254
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,700
Those craftsmen died tragically in the mausoleum.

255
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,580
You shoved the burning charcoal down that girl's throat.

256
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,220
You stepped on the innocent

257
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,490
to get ahead.

258
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,940
What have they done to you?

259
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,850
Mr. Chu.

260
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,530
You are the Imperial Astronomer.

261
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,220
You know all about reincarnation

262
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,290
and karma, don't you?

263
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,250
You came to show off your power last time.

264
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,770
But this time,

265
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,460
did you come to ask for help

266
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,220
or say goodbye to me?

267
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,570
You have

268
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,810
foreseen everything.

269
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,460
But have you foreseen the fact

270
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,810
that you'll die today?

271
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,010
Chu Huaiming.

272
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,010
You misread the celestial omens.

273
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,660
In the worst case, you'll be demoted and imprisoned.

274
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,250
You'll be able to start anew in a few years.

275
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,460
But if you kill me,

276
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,570
you have to pay with your life.

277
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,700
Pay with my life?

278
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,380
You killed Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao.

279
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,180
You should pay with your life, too.

280
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,620
I will run away after I kill you.

281
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,860
The court officials won't be able to find me.

282
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,900
You may be able to read fortune

283
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,460
but you can't escape death.

284
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,380
I entered the Imperial Astronomical Bureau when I was 15.

285
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,290
I have worked diligently

286
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,900
for so many years.

287
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,810
With so much planning and scheming,

288
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,660
I managed to get acquainted with the Marquis of Pingjin

289
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,810
and become the Imperial Astronomer.

290
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,700
Do you have any idea

291
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,090
what I've been through...

292
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,570
what I've been through

293
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,220
and how much I've suffered to come this far?

294
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,700
You.

295
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,490
It's all your fault.

296
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,180
Zang Hai.

297
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,490
You took everything from me

298
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,220
overnight.

299
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,290
You made it as the Imperial Astronomer

300
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,460
but you lost your conscience.

301
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,290
I didn't do this to you. You did.

302
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,770
How is it wrong to seek

303
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,220
upward mobility?

304
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,250
None of this would happen without you.

305
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,490
Even if I end up utterly ruined,

306
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,090
I'll drag you down...

307
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,220
Chu Huaiming, you...

308
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,900
With me.

309
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,220
You shall perish!

310
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,620
Mr. Chu.

311
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,180
Guards.

312
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,140
What's that smell?

313
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,940
Come on.

314
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,250
Guards.

315
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,980
Fire.

316
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,900
Fire.

317
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,860
Get help!

318
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,380
- Alright. - Hurry.

319
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,050
I'm here!

320
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,290
Put out the fire. Hurry!

321
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,460
Hurry!

322
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,860
Help!

323
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,290
Fire!

324
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,180
Fire!

325
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,420
Hurry!

326
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,870
- Hurry! - Put out the fire!

327
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,770
I need another favor

328
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,180
from you.

329
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,570
I'm driving Chu Huaiming into the corner.

330
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,770
I'm afraid he can only set fire to kill me.

331
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,250
You must stick to the plan.

332
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,770
Don't try to save me.

333
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,290
My Lord.

334
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,940
The rain in Zhongzhou is getting worse.

335
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,730
It just won't stop.

336
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,860
There may be floods.

337
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,330
How many days has it been?

338
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,660
It's been seven days.

339
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,490
My Lord, bad news.

340
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,380
My Lord.

341
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,090
My Lord.

342
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,360
My Lord, bad news.

343
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,150
What happened?

344
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,380
The confinement chamber caught fire.

345
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,860
Where is Zang Hai?

346
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,310
He's still in there.

347
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,730
We are trying to rescue him.

348
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,940
Mr. Zhuang.

349
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,490
Mr. Chu.

350
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,180
What's the rush?

351
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,250
I just spoke with your father.

352
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,750
I'll take my leave now.

353
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,330
You set fire here and think you can escape?

354
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,160
You...

355
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,270
Come to see my father.

356
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,330
No.

357
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,100
Zang Hai!

358
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,530
My Lord.

359
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,250
My Lord.

360
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,980
M-My Lord.

361
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,810
Be careful, My Lord.

362
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,060
My Lord.

363
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,490
Guards.

364
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,140
My Lord.

365
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,980
Guards.

366
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,980
My Lord, are you alright?

367
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,530
Put out the fire!

368
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,050
Alright.

369
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,250
Hurry!

370
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,570
Throw water!

371
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,290
Faster!

372
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,130
Step aside!

373
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,680
Go.

374
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,570
My Lord.

375
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,570
My Lord.

376
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,400
My Lord.

377
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,490
Are you alright?

378
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,090
I'm fine.

379
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,730
My Lord.

380
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,220
- My Lord. - You're burned.

381
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,860
Why did you...

382
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,010
Consider yourself lucky.

383
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,330
Why did the cell suddenly catch fire?

384
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,730
The guards said

385
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,770
that Mr. Chu came before the fire.

386
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,250
Chu Huaiming?

387
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,430
Where is he?

388
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,050
Father!

389
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,050
Look.

390
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:26,900
Father.

391
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,330
Chu Huaiming.

392
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,290
Did you set the fire?

393
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,380
No.

394
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,660
My Lord.

395
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,860
It wasn't me.

396
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,220
I saw it with my own eyes.

397
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,530
Chu Huaiming tried to escape.

398
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,660
It was him.

399
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,290
He wanted to kill me.

400
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,200
He killed Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao...

401
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,940
My Lord.

402
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,460
He's targeting you.

403
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,090
My Lord.

404
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,980
My Lord.

405
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,830
My Lord.

406
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,770
Urgent report from Zhongzhou.

407
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,180
The pouring rain destroyed many parts of the dam.

408
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,180
River water flooded

409
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,330
tens of thousands of mu of fertile land downstream.

410
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,420
How are the people of Zhongzhou?

411
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,460
People along the coast received warnings in advance.

412
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,770
Many have been evacuated.

413
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,770
But there are still thousands of casualties.

414
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,420
One more thing.

415
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,220
General Fu Zhisong, the Commander of the Central Army

416
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,220
led the troops to combat floods.

417
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,900
When the dam was washed away,

418
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,460
General Fu was swept by the huge waves.

419
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,250
His body has been found downstream.

420
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,730
Take Chu Huaiming to the Court of Judicial Review.

421
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,380
Get up.

422
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,090
My Lord.

423
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,490
Zang Hai.

424
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,490
I hope you die!

425
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,700
I hope you die!

426
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,460
Go get water.

427
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,090
Hurry.

428
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,660
Hurry.

429
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,380
Faster.

430
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,460
You mean

431
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,940
our Lord dashed into the fire

432
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,140
to save Zang Hai?

433
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,730
Fortunately, the arsonist was caught.

434
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,700
Who was it?

435
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,940
Chu Huaiming.

436
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,620
The second young master caught him

437
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,010
and he's escorting him to the Court of Judicial Review now.

438
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,660
Zhifu, hurry up.

439
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,010
Let's check on him.

440
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,460
Alright.

441
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,770
Don't worry, My Lady.

442
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,900
Mr. Zang has sent our Lord back to his chamber for treatment.

443
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,220
Our Lord said that you and Young Master were not needed there.

444
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,490
Zhifu.

445
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,420
Someone beat us to it.

446
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,900
You are supposed to be the one

447
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,380
staying by your father's side now.

448
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,010
My Lord.

449
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,620
The physicians will be here soon.

450
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,860
No need to make a fuss over some minor injuries.

451
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,770
We'll be done before they arrive.

452
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,530
Go on.

453
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,530
Please bear with it, My Lord.

454
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,460
As you said,

455
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,570
General Fu died.

456
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,380
The Great Yong lost an outstanding general.

457
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,420
To be honest,

458
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,860
I am somewhat relieved.

459
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,490
I've been wondering

460
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,770
whether the falling star would be me.

461
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,330
You are over-concerned.

462
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,490
I have told you

463
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,770
that you

464
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,530
are blessed by heaven.

465
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,980
I have fought countless battles for decades,

466
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,660
fearless of death.

467
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,900
But life in the capital

468
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,050
has changed me over time.

469
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,730
Fortunately, I have you

470
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,980
to take precautions for me.

471
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,770
My Lord.

472
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,420
I am just a folk person.

473
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,980
It's my honor

474
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,730
to work for you and be appreciated.

475
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,330
If you hadn't rescued me today,

476
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,420
I would have died in the fire.

477
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:11,810
Zang Hai.

478
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,250
I used to think of you as an aide.

479
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,050
You were my subordinate, nothing more.

480
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,570
But after I rescued you from the fire, I realized

481
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,490
that I have long regarded you as my family.

482
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,180
I locked you up out of concern.

483
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,010
Don't blame me.

484
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,380
I dare not.

485
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,700
I overstepped my authority...

486
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,530
Enough.

487
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,700
I know you meant well.

488
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,220
I understand

489
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,140
what you said.

490
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,660
It's hard for me to trust someone.

491
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,330
Don't let me down.

492
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,250
I swear

493
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,420
I will never let you down.

494
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,400
[The Great Prison]

495
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,660
By the Mandate of Heaven, His Majesty decrees:

496
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,980
Chu Huaiming, Imperial Astronomer of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

497
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,010
misread celestial omens and delayed warnings,

498
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,730
which led to great floods in Zhongzhou that ruined people's livelihood.

499
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,010
Then he hid the truth from his superiors and plotted to kill the innocent.

500
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,860
He is hereby stripped of rank, reduced to common status,

501
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,050
and exiled to a distance of 3000 li

502
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,660
with 50 strokes of the rod to be carried out right now.

503
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,090
My Lady,

504
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,530
did I hurt you?

505
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,460
It's not your fault.

506
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,810
I have a headache.

507
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,380
What is on your mind?

508
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,010
Are you still worried about our Lord's injury?

509
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,050
Mr. Zhuang said

510
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,860
that our Lord is going to be alright.

511
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,900
I was thinking

512
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,660
about Zang Hai and Zhuang Zhixing.

513
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,620
Why would you think about them?

514
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,530
Don't let them bother you.

515
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,330
Zhixing did well in the ground polo match,

516
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,860
which pleased his father.

517
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,010
While Zhifu chose scholarship, he turned to martial arts.

518
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,940
He knew very well that our Lord craved

519
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,810
a martial heir to carry on the legacy

520
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,770
and bring the Zhuang family back to glory.

521
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,940
And he just happened

522
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,620
to catch Chu Huaiming who set fire.

523
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,180
He earned merit, and meanwhile,

524
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,220
helped Zang Hai.

525
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:07,140
What an accurate plan refined down

526
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,140
to the last detail.

527
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,980
Did the second young master suddenly get enlightened?

528
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,090
I'm worried

529
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,530
that he has allied with Zang Hai to...

530
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,570
Although

531
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,050
I don't know what Zang Hai is after,

532
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,620
I'm sure

533
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,250
that Zhixing is trying to compete with Zhifu.

534
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,530
There's nothing to be afraid of.

535
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,330
That good-for-nothing

536
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,860
is no match for our young master.

537
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,980
I made

538
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,090
this ginseng soup for you by myself.

539
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,570
It has cinnamon and licorice

540
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,340
that drain pus.

541
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,740
Have some and your wounds will heal faster.

542
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,610
How are you feeling?

543
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,380
Does it still hurt?

544
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,380
You didn't let me take care of you.

545
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,490
I've been worried all night.

546
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,210
It's just a minor injury. No big deal.

547
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,830
Your safety

548
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,570
concerns the livelihoods of hundreds of people in this household.

549
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,650
How can I not be concerned?

550
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,690
Please don't put yourself

551
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,980
in danger again.

552
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,650
It is great that you are always

553
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,210
so kind to your subordinates.

554
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,820
But for some reason,

555
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,740
I've been quite uneasy.

556
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,980
What are you worried about?

557
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,010
Ever since Zang Hai came,

558
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,980
you've been losing competent aides.

559
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,210
Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao died.

560
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,860
Now, even Chu Huaiming is in jail.

561
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,940
Think about it, My Lord.

562
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,610
Who benefits the most from it?

563
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,340
Isn't it Zang Hai?

564
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,490
You treat him so well.

565
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,420
How come he keeps eliminating dissidents?

566
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,460
Eliminating dissidents?

567
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,980
My love.

568
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,650
Is that what you think?

569
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,170
Zang Hai came

570
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,300
and instantly bonded with Zhixing.

571
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,130
I'm afraid it was because Zhixing was simple

572
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,690
and liked to make friends.

573
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,420
Yesterday,

574
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,900
Zhixing happened to catch Chu Huaiming.

575
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,820
What a coincidence.

576
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,980
Are you saying

577
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,300
that Zhixing knew Chu Huaiming would set fire

578
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,010
and lay in ambush?

579
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,490
I'm afraid

580
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,820
that someone has been guiding him.

581
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,180
Otherwise, how did he win the ground polo game

582
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,530
just like that?

583
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,780
My love.

584
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,340
I know you want Zhifu to do well.

585
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,570
But as the female head of the household,

586
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,260
how come you won't accept Zhixing's success?

587
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,420
You got me wrong, My Lord.

588
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,690
I'm just worried

589
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,380
that your trusted and well-respected aide

590
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,980
is actually

591
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,050
harboring other intentions.

592
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,980
I heard

593
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,650
what you said.

594
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,210
You may leave.

595
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,090
My Lady.

596
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,300
My Lord.

597
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,820
You heard everything?

598
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,380
My Lord.

599
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,570
Yes, I heard everything.

600
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,690
Have anything to say?

601
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,130
My Lady is only partly right.

602
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,940
I did train the second young master

603
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,650
to win the game.

604
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,420
But how could I have known

605
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,860
that Chu Huaiming would come to set fire?

606
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,300
Everyone rushed

607
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,740
to the confinement chamber to put out the fire.

608
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,820
Chu Huaiming must have looked suspicious

609
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,210
as he fled in panic.

610
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,380
Young Master spotted him.

611
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,780
The arrest was only natural.

612
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,690
But I admit

613
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,130
that I have been close to the second young master.

614
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,090
My Lord.

615
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,570
If I may be so bold,

616
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,420
the second young master can be a great general.

617
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,460
He can't fully unleash his potential

618
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,300
by playing ground polo.

619
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,090
Are you saying

620
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,530
that I should put him in the army?

621
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,690
That's right.

622
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,530
Your outstanding elder son

623
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,980
has established himself in the imperial court.

624
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,980
But your family boasts generations of generals

625
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,300
and you have made great achievements yourself.

626
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,050
It would be a pity

627
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,460
if the legacy finds no bearer.

628
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,980
Zhifu is not made for the army for sure.

629
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:04,980
But I'm afraid

630
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,210
that you are wrong about Zhixing.

631
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,130
He may have been a bit wayward in the past

632
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,740
but he's been

633
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,340
practicing hard without slacking off these days.

634
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,940
The reason he could stand out so fast,

635
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,740
apart from his diligence,

636
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,010
lay in the blood of the Zhuang family

637
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,900
flowing through his veins.

638
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,340
Isn't it a bit too early to make plans

639
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,340
for Zhixing?

640
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,980
As your aide,

641
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,650
of course, I have to make plans for your family.

642
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,130
Once we have a scholar

643
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,820
and a general supporting each other in court,

644
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,090
we can lay a solid foundation for further development.

645
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,860
You perceive

646
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,460
and contemplate things

647
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,780
far beyond my capacity.

648
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,940
My Lord, you said

649
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,780
you'd treat me as family.

650
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,650
Then I shall share everything on my mind

651
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,420
without holding back.

652
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,860
Back then, aides like you around me

653
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,570
couldn't even fit in one tent.

654
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,940
But they are all dead.

655
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,740
They died for me.

656
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,090
Are you afraid of death?

657
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,490
My Lord.

658
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,010
I once said that I was afraid of death.

659
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,380
But it's worse to live a wasted life.

660
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,050
I believe those who worked for you

661
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,380
died for a great cause.

662
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,690
I called you here to talk business.

663
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,050
The Imperial Astronomer post is vacant.

664
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:52,740
Tell me.

665
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,300
Do you want to take that job?

666
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,090
I...

667
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,900
Don't hesitate.

668
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,940
If you're interested, I will pull some strings for you.

669
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,650
I will do whatever you say.

670
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,580
[Sangu Bookshop]

671
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,940
Hai, you were really lucky this time.

672
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,050
How much of his trust

673
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,210
do you think you've earned by now?

674
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,570
About 70 or 80 percent.

675
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,090
You disagree, Master?

676
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,380
If the person caught in the fire was not you but Jiang Xiang,

677
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,690
he wouldn't have saved her.

678
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,980
Jiang Xiang's father Jiang Jin

679
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,980
is no longer the Minister of Rites

680
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,860
and has no value to the Marquis.

681
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,130
But you are his most precious aide now.

682
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,340
Your talents and abilities

683
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,130
can help him stand firm in the court.

684
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,490
He saved you

685
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,820
to protect his private property.

686
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,300
He said what he said

687
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,780
just to win your heart.

688
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,460
At least, it is good

689
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:03,900
that the Marquis of Pingjin is trying to bond with you.

690
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,340
But you must be extra careful.

691
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,090
Never cross the line

692
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,740
or fail to show due respect.

693
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,780
This is quite tricky.

694
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,260
I hope you can be the person

695
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,740
he trusts and depends on the most.

696
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,210
Then he will share everything on his mind with you.

697
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,820
We are not bound by blood.

698
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,610
I can earn his trust,

699
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,690
but how can I make him rely on me

700
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,210
without working for him

701
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,340
a decade?

702
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,820
Not even Yang Zhen made it.

703
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,690
Everyone experiences pain and confusion.

704
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,980
It's hard to take action.

705
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,650
The Marquis is no exception.

706
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,490
To make him rely on you,

707
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,010
you must share his burden.

708
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,210
What pains and confuses him?

709
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,340
