3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,806
   

4
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:35,844
   

5
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,870
Antu.

6
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,590
Don't be scared.

7
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,360
I'm here with you.

8
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,260
It's all over now.

9
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,610
Mother...

10
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,810
Mother...

11
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,750
What about Zang Hai?

12
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,920
Don't worry.

13
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,950
He's not dead.

14
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,450
And I'm not his enemy.

15
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,970
He's not dead?

16
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,420
And I'm not his enemy?

17
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,620
Daughter,

18
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,110
these days have been hard on you.

19
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,770
I don't think so anymore.

20
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,860
These days...

21
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,370
I did feel so much pain these days, yes.

22
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,380
But now,

23
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,310
I feel like it was all just a bad dream.

24
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,320
It's over.

25
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,950
I really like him.

26
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,770
I want to be with him.

27
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,030
Can you accept that?

28
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,680
I can tell he really likes you, too.

29
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,790
But... he still has a deep grudge to avenge.

30
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,150
I'm afraid, in his heart, you'll never come first.

31
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,030
I'm shocked the Queen of Dongxia isn't the third enemy.

32
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,630
But the Marquis of Pingjin told Zhuang Zhixing himself.

33
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,450
Did the Marquis lie?

34
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,080
Zhuang Zhixing is his heir, his only hope.

35
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,550
Why would the Marquis deceive him?

36
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,990
True.

37
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,180
Zhuang Zhixing is a monster I personally created.

38
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,190
My own hatred twisted him into what he is.

39
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,470
He hates his father, but he hates me even more.

40
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,870
I just never thought he'd go this far.

41
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,720
Be prepared.

42
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,160
- Stay still. 
 - Be gentle.

43
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,990
Almost done.

44
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,290
All right, done.

45
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,450
This ointment of mine heals fast,

46
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,230
and it won't leave a scar.

47
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,040
It's been so long since we've met. I see you've grown thinner.

48
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,530
I guess you didn't get any good food when you were with him.

49
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,960
Not really.

50
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,540
He didn't treat me that badly.

51
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,640
Then why the long face?

52
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,400
What's bothering you?

53
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,160
Although his misunderstanding with my mother has been settled,

54
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,990
and theoretically, there's nothing standing between us anymore,

55
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,670
my mother still doesn't want me with him.

56
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,410
She's afraid I'll suffer, afraid I won't be happy.

57
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,740
In the past, you never cared what others thought.

58
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,420
Others' criticism,

59
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,240
you never took it to heart.

60
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,350
I know very well he has his revenge to seek,

61
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,450
and I have my own responsibilities.

62
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,240
The carefree Madam Xiang isn't the real me.

63
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,030
You two are both very bad.

64
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,670
That makes you a good match.

65
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,860
If you ever have kids, goodness,

66
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,030
they will turn the whole capital upside down!

67
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,370
So, forget it.

68
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,860
You'd better not be together after all.

69
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,220
No wonder the Queen played you like that.

70
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,430
She's making the son pay for the father's debts.

71
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,730
I didn't expect that my father would have such a past with her.

72
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,570
If the Queen isn't your enemy now,

73
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,300
then the clues to the third enemy are a true dead end.

74
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,850
At least it didn't end in disaster.

75
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,470
So, did that lift a huge weight off your chest?

76
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,880
Master...

77
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,740
I told you, you're still too inexperienced when it comes to women.

78
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,090
When did you ever say that?

79
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,030
Fine, your master Liu Chu said it.

80
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,260
Sir, Miss Xiang sent someone... with a message.

81
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,460
She asks you to visit Zhen Tower.

82
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,720
It's over.

83
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,880
It's so over.

84
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,470
- I'll go see what's going on. 
 - Hold up.

85
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,110
Wash your face first.

86
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,410
Don't mess it up again.

87
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,160
Your Master Liu Chu isn't here.

88
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,910
And there's a lot I can't teach you.

89
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,510
Come on.

90
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,430
Wash up...

91
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,760
Where is he?

92
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,010
- He... 
 - He's gone?

93
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,660
By the time you finished talking, he'd be back.

94
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,060
Official Zang, please.

95
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,870
Zhen Tower is closed today. Please follow me.

96
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,930
Our lady is waiting inside.

97
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,360
Please go on in.

98
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,320
Your Highness?

99
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,200
Your Highness?

100
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,010
Stop right there!

101
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,710
Tonight's shadow play begins with a little carp.

102
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,930
One day, the little carp got separated from his family

103
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,310
and never found his way back home.

104
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:35,260
Alone, he was wandering... and wandering...

105
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,480
A little swan saw how pitiful he looked,

106
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,710
and stayed by his side.

107
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,690
They became the best of friends.

108
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,880
The little swan treated him so well,

109
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,790
always helping and caring for him.

110
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:56,480
Over time, the little swan fell for this little carp.

111
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,810
But little did she know, the carp wasn't just foolish,

112
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,830
he had a mean heart, too!

113
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,480
He thought he was clever,

114
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,760
and assumed the little swan's mother had eaten his own parents and relatives.

115
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,160
No matter how kind the swan was to him,

116
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,280
he was still set on killing her mother for revenge.

117
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,140
Of course, the little swan tried to stop him,

118
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,430
because she knew, for all his hardness,

119
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,380
the carp was no match for her mother.

120
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,400
The little swan was so torn.

121
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,820
She couldn't bear to lose the carp, nor her own mother.

122
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,970
So, she offered up her own life

123
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,640
to dissolve the hatred in the carp's heart.

124
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,710
But it turned out that the one who ate his parents

125
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,000
wasn't the little swan's mother at all.

126
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,850
The little carp, who found out the truth,

127
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,150
never cared about the little swan again.

128
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,290
He just left her aside, cold and alone.

129
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,640
Tell me. Doesn't the little carp deserve punishment?

130
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,090
He does.

131
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,420
â™«  Past memories brew like snow in a pot  â™«

132
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,920
â™«  Brewing into a swirl of tangled emotions  â™«

133
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,160
Good thing the little swan survived.

134
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,840
Otherwise, the little carp wouldn't have made it either.

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,940
Her heart had already died.

136
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,700
She couldn't come back to life.

137
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,300
â™«  Love is a destined melting of snow  â™«

138
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,940
â™«  It's a point of falling,   â™«

139
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,020
â™«  where the wind meets the moon  â™«

140
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,430
The little carp did the little swan wrong.

141
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,440
He doesn't dare ask for forgiveness.

142
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,280
â™«  Shattered jade litters the road ahead like graves  â™«

143
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,860
But would the little swan still want to see him again?

144
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,020
â™«  Looking back brings complicated feelings  â™«

145
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,800
â™«  and hurriedness  â™«

146
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,160
â™«  Past memories brew like snow in a pot  â™«

147
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,740
The truth is, she's been waiting for him all along.

148
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,240
â™«  Drink it down to bring good dreams tonight  â™«

149
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,200
Why aren't you saying anything?

150
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,740
â™«   Though old memories still rise with the wind  â™«

151
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,670
â™«  Time shapes us like pine  â™«

152
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,000
 Your Highness... 

153
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,800
â™«  Standing still from far away, too afraid to touch  â™«

154
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,280
â™«  Love is a destined melting of snow  â™«

155
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,040
â™«  It's a point of falling  â™«

156
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,940
â™«  Where the wind meets the moon  â™«

157
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,180
â™«  Rather than scheming  â™«

158
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,340
â™«  Let's embrace in the mortal world  â™«

159
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,670
â™«  Shattered jade litters the road ahead like graves  â™«

160
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,370
Has your wound... gotten better?

161
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,200
â™«  Looking back brings complicated feelings  â™«

162
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,320
â™«  And hurriedness  â™«

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,820
â™«  Love is a destined spring breeze  â™«

164
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,460
â™«  A skipping of beats  â™«

165
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,560
â™«  Where the snow meets the blossoms  â™«

166
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,680
â™«  Breaking through perils  â™«

167
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,840
â™«  The world praises it  â™«

168
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,480
â™«  Willows fade in the passing winter  â™«

169
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,240
â™«  As peach blossoms bloom  â™«

170
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,260
â™«  Ignoring the prints of the past  â™«

171
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,640
â™«  Looking back brings complicated feelings  â™«

172
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,020
â™«  And peace  â™«

173
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,070
Your Highness, you're too strong.

174
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:35,190
If you keep hugging me this tightly, I will lose an arm.

175
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,160
You still call me "Your Highness"?

176
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,100
Antu...

177
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,190
See, when you treated me so coldly back then,

178
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,090
you should've seen this coming!

179
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,050
I... I don't deserve this moment.

180
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,710
I won't let you say that.

181
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,520
From now on, whenever I want you, you must show up.

182
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,600
All right.

183
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,480
I promise.

184
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,640
Antu, I hope that from this day forward,

185
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,300
you'll always be happier and freer with me around.

186
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,360
Of course I'm happy and free.

187
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,910
I'm the Princess of Dongxia,

188
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,360
and the owner of Zhen Tower.

189
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,480
My family, my friends, and the one I love,

190
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,040
I have them all now.

191
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,640
What are you laughing at?

192
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,790
I'm laughing at someone for being too greedy.

193
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,280
Can't I be greedy?

194
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,400
Look at you, crying so much that your eyes are swollen.

195
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,190
The little swan has turned into a little frog.

196
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,660
And all because of you!

197
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,360
Yes, it was all my fault.

198
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,670
So, please, Miss Xiang, don't hold it against me.

199
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,110
Invite me more often to your Zhen Tower.

200
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,070
I don't hold grudges.

201
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,490
I always get even on the spot.

202
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,670
Zang Hai...

203
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,680
My mother's here now, and so are you.

204
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,070
The misunderstanding is cleared.

205
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,540
I feel at peace.

206
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,900
Then tonight, you can finally sleep well.

207
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,220
I'm not sleepy.

208
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,190
Zhen Tower isn't open to guests today.

209
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,670
But if I want, I can keep everyone out for as many days as I feel like.

210
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,670
Tonight, I want you to tell me everything.

211
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,500
Tonight?

212
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,320
There's always time.

213
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,470
I'll tell you everything gradually someday.

214
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,640
You're injured. You need rest.

215
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,950
Fine, I'll talk.

216
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,510
What do you want to hear?

217
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,560
Anything.

218
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,670
You start.

219
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,640
Then let's begin with the two lashings I took ten years ago.

220
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,740
Hey, Zang Hai!

221
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,920
I won't talk about it. I won't.

222
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,230
You dummy, just tell me what my mother said to you.

223
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,120
Honestly, even I didn't expect it.

224
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,190
My father and your mother actually knew each other ten years ago.

225
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,090
What?

226
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,040
Ten years ago,

227
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,910
my father was building the Fengshan Altar in Dongxia.

228
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,220
By sheer coincidence, he ended up saving your mother...

229
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,190
So, you see, there really are such coincidences in life.

230
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,270
I met you ten years ago.

231
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,190
Then ten years later, on the very first day I arrived in the capital,

232
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,240
I saw you again.

233
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,220
And so much has happened since.

234
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,190
There's always been so much I wanted to tell you,

235
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,260
but I couldn't reveal who I was.

236
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,113
   

237
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,370
Antu.

238
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,320
This drawing here is the Gui Seal.

239
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,020
Legend says our ancestors were descendants of the Lady of Kunlun.

240
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,990
The Gui Seal was one of her sacred relics.

241
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,310
Later, something happened, and our ancestors left Kunlun.

242
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,360
They migrated eastward.

243
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,300
They vowed to build a new kingdom there and carve out a legacy.

244
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,040
Not long after, across the vast northern plains,

245
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,600
a female general rose up.

246
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,670
She was undefeated, unstoppable.

247
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,950
Legend has it she carried the Gui Seal with her.

248
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,320
That seal could summon ghost soldiers,

249
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,910
attach them to the living, and command them in battle.

250
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,840
Eventually, she crowned herself the ruler.

251
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,540
She became the first ruler of Dongxia, Queen of Fuxian.

252
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,890
After she took the throne, she conquered cities and lands with ease,

253
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,850
but her body gradually began to change, too.

254
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,000
In her final days, no one ever saw her true face again.

255
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,520
The Queen of Fuxian knew it was the backlash from using the Gui Seal.

256
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,600
So, she ordered it sealed away forever,

257
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,710
buried beside her own body,

258
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,160
and warned her descendants never to open the tomb.

259
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,670
But 300 years later,

260
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:22,160
her descendant, the Queen of Minglv Huda, my mother,

261
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,710
defied the Queen of Fuxian's dying wish.

262
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,560
She had the Gui Seal taken from the tomb,

263
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,410
along with the key that opens it, namely the three bronze fish.

264
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,080
As for everything after that, you already know.

265
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,040
In the 35th year of Wuhe,

266
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,270
in the battle against Great Yong,

267
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,880
Dongxia used the Gui Seal to defeat them

268
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,910
but paid a terrible price for it.

269
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,800
Just before her death,

270
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,120
The Queen of Minglv Huda sealed the Gui Seal again,

271
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,040
hiding it somewhere no one knew.

272
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
In the ninth year of Zhenshun,

273
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,640
your father, Kuai Duo, discovered it anyway.

274
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,230
For centuries, legends of the Gui Seal

275
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,270
have stirred the hearts of the ambitious.

276
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,880
Once they learned of the power behind it,

277
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,450
they would pay any price to obtain it.

278
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,270
All these years,

279
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,640
I've been collecting magnetic stones linked to the Gui Seal.

280
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,560
I finally forged this compass.

281
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,850
Once a bronze fish is fixed to the magnetic needle,

282
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,080
the fish's head will point to where the Gui Seal is.

283
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,580
I once worked with Cao Jingxian just to get the bronze fish.

284
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,550
But now, I don't need him anymore.

285
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,360
What do you want me to do, Your Highness?

286
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,750
To this day, your third enemy still lurks in the shadows like a ghost.

287
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,230
As long as you're willing to help me find the Gui Seal,

288
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,670
I'll help you find your third enemy,

289
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,060
so you can avenge the Kuai family.

290
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,650
I'm ready to ally with Your Highness.

291
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,360
Don't rush.

292
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,870
Before we join forces, there's something I must make clear.

293
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,800
Please speak, Your Highness.

294
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,340
The compass or my daughter, you can only choose one.

295
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,670
If you choose the compass, you choose to continue your revenge.

296
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,910
I don't want my daughter to be with a man consumed by deep hatred.

297
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,750
But if you choose my daughter,

298
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,540
I want you to give up revenge and to lose any interest in the Gui Seal.

299
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,230
- Mother... 
 - Don't you want to hear how Zang Hai answers?

300
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,090
You're asking me to choose, but I can't.

301
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,230
Before my father died, he left me with some words.

302
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,400
I could never figure it out before.

303
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,750
But after hearing your story with my father,

304
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,320
I finally understand.

305
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,880
Those words he left me before his death were for Your Highness.

306
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,510
So, let me offer you a choice, too.

307
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,400
Do you want to hear the words?

308
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,260
Or do you want me to make a choice?

309
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,040
You're threatening me?

310
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,800
If your feelings for my father were genuine,

311
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,080
then why can't my feelings for Antu be real, too?

312
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,640
Mother.

313
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,080
I'm your daughter.

314
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,910
Finding the Gui Seal is also my duty and my wish.

315
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,920
Since I came to Great Yong, danger has always followed me.

316
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,710
But I've never been afraid, and I won't start now.

317
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,950
I see it now.

318
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:38,690
This "horse" of yours might just outrun your father.

319
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,980
Let's see what you're really made of.

320
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,840
Thanks for the honor.

321
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,900
From this day forward, we are bound as allies in life and death.

322
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,680
Turn right here.

323
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,410
Then left.

324
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,650
Turn right again.

325
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,230
Keep going.

326
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,230
Turn right.

327
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,370
My Lord, we can't go right anymore.

328
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,650
Halt!

329
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,063
   

330
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,800
   

331
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,580
Sir, please.

332
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,220
   

333
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,560
Keep at it, everyone.

334
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,950
I'll check other areas to see what else needs fixing.

335
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,930
Yes, sir.

336
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,430
   

337
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,420
Identify yourself!

338
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,800
I'm Zang Hai, Vice Minister of Works.

339
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,470
A strong wind is expected in a few days.

340
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,160
Hanzhang Hall has been standing for a long time,

341
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,560
so I came to check if it needs reinforcement.

342
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,040
Thanks for your concern, Official Zang.

343
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,270
But His Majesty has ordered

344
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,800
no unauthorized repairs are allowed in Hanzhang Hall.

345
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,400
No one may enter without permission.

346
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,300
You'll have to turn back.

347
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,860
   

348
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,440
You're back.

349
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,270
What's wrong?

350
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,470
Why are you sweating so much?

351
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,410
What happened?

352
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,930
Say something. What really happened?

353
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,570
I know where the Gui Seal is.

354
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,190
Where?

355
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,400
In the palace.

356
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,020
Inside the Emperor's Hanzhang Hall.

357
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,680
Hanzhang Hall?

358
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,710
Then that means back then, your father...

359
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:12,290
On my way back, I kept thinking. There's no place in the world

360
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,400
more hidden than the palace.

361
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,300
Especially beside the Emperor's own bed.

362
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,160
So, do you think the Emperor knew all along?

363
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,640
If it had been hidden elsewhere in the palace,

364
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,670
I could've believed your father hid it secretly.

365
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,270
But it's Hanzhang Hall!

366
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,130
The place the Emperor stays every day!

367
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,420
You're saying...

368
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,660
My father discovering the Gui Seal back then wasn't a coincidence at all.

369
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,710
What if your father built the Fengshan Altar

370
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,970
under secret orders from the Emperor to find the Gui Seal?

371
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,370
But then why didn't he hand over the bronze fish, too?

372
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,620
According to the Queen, the fish is the key to unlocking the Gui Seal.

373
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,690
I don't understand either.

374
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,640
Could it be the Emperor is...

375
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,750
No, he's not.

376
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,320
The Emperor isn't the third enemy.

377
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,360
Otherwise, he'd never allow

378
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,060
the Marquis of Pingjin and Cao Jingxian to hold the fish.

379
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,320
Besides, if the Emperor wanted my father dead,

380
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,510
he could've done it the moment he delivered the Gui Seal.

381
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,820
No need to wait until he returned home to make a move.

382
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,990
The Gui Seal is in the Emperor's hands,

383
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:44,230
but the bronze fish are with your enemies...

384
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,160
What really happened that day?

385
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,840
Aside from the Emperor and your father,

386
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,980
no one else may ever know.

387
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:11,080
â™«   Where does sorrow begin?  â™«

388
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:18,020
â™«   With autumn on a parted heart   â™«

389
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,750
â™«   Even without rain, the wind through plantains chills  â™«

390
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,500
Father.

391
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,710
Spit it out.

392
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:32,520
Zang Hai used a palace inspection as an excuse to roam the whole palace.

393
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,880
Did he do anything suspicious?

394
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,190
His actions were strange indeed.

395
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,670
Like he was searching for something.

396
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:41,940
In the end, he lingered outside Hanzhang Hall for quite a while.

397
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,880
Hanzhang Hall?

398
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,320
That's right.

399
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,510
Then he left right after.

400
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,290
So, that's it.

401
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,020
So, that's how it is...

402
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,220
Ridiculous!

403
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,270
After all these years,

404
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:20,660
how many times have I gone in and out of Hanzhang Hall?

405
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,790
   

406
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,080
We've located an auspicious site in Mount Dongling.

407
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,360
We'll select a lucky day to deliver the jade fetus there for worship.

408
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,440
I'll oversee everything personally.

409
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,000
Rest assured, Your Highness.

410
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,010
I trust you won't let anything go wrong.

411
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,190
Official Zang, can you give me a tour of the Bureau?

412
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,190
Of course.

413
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,570
It's my honor.

414
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,050
This way, Your Highness.

415
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,790
The Bureau includes the Astronomy, Timekeeping,

416
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:10,560
Forestry, Geomancy, and Mortuary divisions.

417
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,600
Each handles different responsibilities,

418
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,710
from star-gazing and timekeeping,

419
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,920
to construction and burial rites.

420
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,640
What about your father?

421
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,230
What was he best at?

422
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,870
As the Imperial Astronomer,

423
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:29,010
he had to master every skill in every office.

424
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,740
But he must've had a favorite.

425
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,240
If I had to say, he loved woodworking the most.

426
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,890
This way, Your Highness.

427
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,790
Your Highness,

428
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:54,150
he used to handle official duties right here.

429
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
How many years was he stationed here?

430
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,350
20 years.

431
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,570
If he hadn't gone to Dongxia,

432
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,570
he'd probably still be here now.

433
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,980
If he had stayed in Dongxia,

434
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,370
maybe your whole family would still be alive.

435
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,420
All the regrets in life come from "ifs".

436
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,120
But sadly, there are no "ifs".

437
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,460
Your Highness, please.

438
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,520
We're only in this world for a few short decades.

439
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,480
You gain many things, and you lose many.

440
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,620
The ones who leave, you'll never find again.

441
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,640
So, remember, what matters most

442
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,220
is cherishing those in front of you.

443
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,920
He was willing to die just to protect a secret.

444
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,480
And you're willing to die to avenge them.

445
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,370
Is that it?

446
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,660
We're all so small, with no choice but to be at the mercy of fate.

447
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,710
My father had no choice back then.

448
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,350
Neither do I.

449
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,390
Let's go.

450
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,850
Let's talk somewhere else.

451
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,560
Just now you said your father had no choice.

452
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,040
Sounds like... you already know where the Gui Seal is.

453
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:32,100
The Gui Seal... is inside the palace, in Hanzhang Hall.

454
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,230
Kuai Duo...

455
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,050
So, this is the "righteous cause" you spoke of?

456
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,040
Fair enough.

457
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,090
Other than the Emperor of Great Yong,

458
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:51,520
who else could earn such loyalty from your father?

459
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,060
As a ruler of a country, if he were to hold a relic like that,

460
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,160
he'd secure a legacy for generations.

461
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,920
So, your father risked it all to deliver the Gui Seal to the Emperor.

462
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,040
It was the loyalty between ruler and subject that got him killed.

463
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,710
No.

464
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,560
My father gave everything to hand over the Gui Seal,

465
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,600
but he didn't surrender the bronze fish.

466
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,390
That was his true righteous cause.

467
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,210
What a perfect balance of loyalty and righteousness.

468
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,440
So, in the eyes of you Great Yong people, what exactly is the Emperor?

469
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:44,300
He's heaven, lord, and father.

470
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,470
Then what's next?

471
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,440
I want to bring out the Gui Seal

472
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,760
and use it to lure out the third enemy.

473
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,920
Right under the Emperor's nose?

474
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,100
You've got some nerve.

475
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,040
Even if you could sneak into the palace,

476
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,570
can you break into the heavily guarded Hanzhang Hall?

477
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,800
That's where I need your help, Your Highness.

478
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,540
   

479
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,500
Hanzhang Hall...

480
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,840
The Emperor...

481
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,190
So, what do you plan to do next?

482
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,670
Shut it.

483
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,640
Let me say it.

484
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,080
Just one sentence:

485
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,560
He's lost his mind.

486
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,000
He says he wants to break into Hanzhang Hall and steal the Gui Seal.

487
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,830
Right now, it's the only way I can find the third enemy.

488
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,080
I have no other option.

489
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,170
You're all insane.

490
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,830
That Queen of Dongxia is just as ruthless.

491
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,160
Instead of stopping you, she's pushing you to your death!

492
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,870
You dare to take even the Emperor's things?

493
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,960
You're all crazy.

494
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,620
Master, I truly have no better plan left.

495
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,440
This...

496
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,730
This is no small matter...

497
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,160
No small matter...

498
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,340
It can drag in a lot of innocent people and even cost lives.

499
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,680
Zang Hai, are you sure you want to do this?

500
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,050
I'm only one step away from finding the third enemy.

501
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:44,670
Sir, if it were you, would you choose to stop?

502
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:01,080
But the Gui Seal is in the Emperor's hands.

503
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,850
If it goes missing, the wrath of the throne will be swift.

504
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:09,710
Throwing the world into chaos or avenging your family's personal grudge,

505
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,950
what will you choose?

506
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,230
Once I use the Gui Seal to draw the third enemy out

507
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,390
and take my revenge,

508
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:22,600
I'll explain everything to the Emperor myself.

509
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,120
If he blames me, I'll take full responsibility.

510
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,110
I won't let anyone else be dragged in.

511
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,100
Ever since that night ten years ago when I made my choice,

512
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,000
I've never thought I could walk away unscathed.

513
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,920
Zang Hai...

514
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,460
it seems your mind is already made up.

515
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,470
In that case,

516
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,140
do your best.

517
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:17,020
