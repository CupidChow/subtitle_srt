1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000



2
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,793
   

4
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,233
   

5
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,710
Greetings, Mr. Zhuang.

6
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,480
I'm here to see your Official Zang.

7
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,870
He went out last night and hasn't returned yet.

8
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,690
Do you know where he went?

9
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,820
I'm afraid I don't.

10
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,210
He must have had some official business.

11
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,628
   

12
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,510
All right. Got it.

13
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,580
When your master returns,

14
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,280
tell him I'm setting out as he instructed.

15
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,570
Are you going to stare out that window all day?

16
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,080
I'm not waiting for him.

17
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,310
I'm just feeling a little bored,

18
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,390
and I want to see outside. 
    

19
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,240
You've been "bored" since last night.

20
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,310
You're wearing yourself out.

21
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,100
Come drink your medicine.

22
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,000
I think he's not coming.

23
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,890
Miss, Official Zang is here.

24
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,790
- Where is he? 
 - He's downstairs.

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,900
What's wrong? Feeling uncertain now that he's close? You're afraid now?

26
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,770
After making me wait this long,

27
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,580
I have to go to him the moment he arrives?

28
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,180
What kind of logic is that?

29
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,020
Today, let him also wait.

30
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,190
Since Official Zang has such patience,

31
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,360
Feng Liu, take him to the Liutao Pavilion.

32
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,880
Yes, ma'am.

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,380
What are you up to now?

34
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,820
Please wait here, Official Zang. Our Miss will be here shortly.

35
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,530
Shen Xiaoxing, you'll live in this tent.

36
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,370
Get in.

37
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,630
It's packed in here. Where am I supposed to sleep?

38
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,750
What? You want me to find you a spot?

39
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,390
This is a military camp, not an inn.

40
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,070
- Find one yourself! 
 - Don't tell me he wants a private room!

41
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,580
The outhouse is private. You want that?

42
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,270
What's so funny?

43
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,940
All of you, cut it out!

44
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,970
From today on, he's one of your own.

45
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,290
Shen Xiaoxing, start getting settled in.

46
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,610
What are you waiting for? Go on!

47
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,060
He's irked that we're a bunch of scruffy men hogging up too much space.

48
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,330
Look at that soft skin of his.

49
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,560
Let's call him Young Master Shen from now on.

50
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,390
Sounds good to me.

51
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,480
- Young Master, you okay? 
 - Come on, get up.

52
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,150
You all right?

53
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,780
Don't tell me you're about to cry.

54
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,560
Young Master's going to cry.

55
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,830
Young Master's going to cry!

56
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,000
Enough!

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,510
Do you have any idea who I am?

58
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,720
You?

59
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,970
Who are you?

60
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,000
General Shen?

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,260
General Shen has joined our camp.

62
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,340
He's been mistreated!

63
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,580
So, it's General Shen.

64
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,050
You scared the life out of me!

65
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,000
This spot's already taken.

66
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,140
What now, Young Master?

67
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,800
That spot by the gate's not bad.

68
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,360
You'll block the wind for us.

69
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,620
That keeps you fit, too.

70
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,320
See how good we are to you?

71
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,630
Did Zang Hai complain at all?

72
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,160
He didn't show a trace of impatience.

73
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,900
He just sat there without even furrowing a brow.

74
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,750
Come on.

75
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,580
That Zang Hai just sat there, obediently sipping tea.

76
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,870
He didn't even take a bathroom break.

77
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,700
Impressive.

78
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,810
Didn't you say a man's patience shows how much he cares?

79
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,380
So, I made him wait a couple of hours.

80
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,160
That's not too much, is it?

81
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,060
I'm just not sure if you're messing with him or yourself.

82
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,580
How is it? Do I look nice?

83
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,460
I've never seen such a beautiful woman.

84
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,580
Zang Hai probably won't be able to take his eyes off you.

85
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,070
Then, invite him up.

86
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,510
Yes, ma'am.

87
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,430
Never mind.

88
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,460
I'll go to him myself.

89
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,840
Feng Liu, is Miss Xiang still not ready?

90
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,390
Sir, please wait a moment and take some more tea.

91
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,020
Our Miss will be down soon.

92
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,070
This is already my sixth pot.

93
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,700
One more and my lips will blister.

94
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,870
Please tell Miss Xiang

95
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,430
I have other duties today and I'll come another time.

96
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,020
Sir, you're not going to wait a bit longer?

97
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,450
I believe I've understood Miss Xiang's message.

98
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,680
Sir, what do you mean?

99
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,160
Please wait, I'll go check.

100
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,780
No need.

101
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,750
Thank her for me.

102
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,440
Farewell.

103
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,790
Please visit us again soon, sir.

104
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,020
I will.

105
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,470
Miss.

106
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,550
Did he get tired of waiting?

107
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,630
Was he rushing you?

108
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,530
Official Zang said he had official business and left.

109
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,110
Miss!

110
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,810
He just left like that?

111
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,930
Miss, he must've misunderstood

112
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,910
and thought you changed your mind.

113
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,200
What did he say before he left?

114
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,840
He said he understood your message and thanked you.

115
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,200
What message?

116
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,630
If I can wait for him, why can't he wait for me?

117
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,860
I was never someone he could see whenever he pleased!

118
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,200
Miss, if you go now, you might still catch him.

119
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,050
Why should I?

120
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,720
Fine.

121
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,150
If he has that much pride,

122
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,390
then I won't bother anymore.

123
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,080
If he shows up again, just say I'm not here!

124
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,800
And tell him to leave!

125
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:06,645
   

126
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,530
Master.

127
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,550
Why are you here?

128
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,330
How did it go?

129
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,510
She wouldn't see me.

130
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,720
I know she's being moody.

131
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,270
While I waited for her, I kept thinking,

132
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,460
if I really did see her, how would I even begin to speak?

133
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,510
But then I realized...

134
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:38,390
rather than meeting her and becoming heartbroken, it is better to merely be disappointed.

135
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,950
So be it.

136
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,600
Maybe not seeing her is the best outcome.

137
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,510
I don't want to drag her into this mess of revenge.

138
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,920
Being close to me will put her in danger.

139
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,620
I've delayed long enough.

140
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,360
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau is cleared.

141
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,610
It's time to find the third enemy.

142
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,870
I came to tell you something.

143
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,670
Zhuang Zhixing has already gone to the military camp.

144
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,480
He came to say goodbye to you early this morning.

145
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,240
You weren't there.

146
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,270
This kid moves fast enough.

147
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,200
Xiao Hai, do you really think he can get through it?

148
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,000
Who's there?

149
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,390
Aren't you the new military recruit, Shen Xiaoxing?

150
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,460
What are you doing here?

151
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
You must've gotten bullied by those brats, right?

152
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
Come on. You'll stay with me tonight.

153
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,740
If you curl up here all night, you'll freeze.

154
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,100
My name's Xiang Hong.

155
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,580
I'm the captain of the third squad.

156
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,910
Those who retreat before battle, death!

157
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,150
Those who flee their unit, death!

158
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,150
Those who stray from the ranks, death!

159
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,000
Those who disobey orders, death!

160
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,510
Those who run wild in camp, death!

161
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,270
Those who disobey their commander's command, death!

162
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,870
Those who break formation in drills...

163
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,240
a hundred lashes!

164
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,550
You. Yes, you!

165
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,530
What do you think you're doing?

166
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,130
Stand still! Quit moving!

167
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,170
Reporting to Squad Leader. There's something on me.

168
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,790
Still talking back?

169
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,640
Step out of line!

170
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,460
What's your name?

171
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,670
Shen Xiaoxing!

172
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,010
Improper appearance, ten lashes!

173
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,050
He nearly burst into tears.

174
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,250
Taking ten hard lashes left him limping.

175
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,690
Such a softie. That serves him right.

176
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,150
Well, look who it is.

177
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,770
Isn't it Young Master Shen?

178
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,510
You put that bug on me, right?

179
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,000
It was just a prank.

180
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,430
Hey!

181
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,500
Zhan Hao, that's enough!

182
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,960
Fighting's strictly forbidden in camp.

183
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,450
Aren't you afraid the squad leader will find out?

184
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,240
What're you staring at? Eat your food!

185
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,220
Let's go.

186
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,770
Hang in there.

187
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,870
The medicine stings, but it works very well.

188
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,000
You'll be fully healed within a week.

189
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,290
I never did anything to them.

190
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,160
Why are they targeting me like this?

191
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,110
Come on, sit up.

192
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,860
Slowly.

193
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,080
In camp, might makes right.

194
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,000
The weaker you are, the less respect you get.

195
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,430
Out on the battlefield, your life's on the line at any moment.

196
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,380
No one wants dead weight.

197
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,020
But once you get stronger, they won't treat you this way anymore.

198
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,150
Then, why don't you pick on me?

199
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,270
Why help me instead?

200
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,650
Aren't you afraid I'll drag you down?

201
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,840
You may look weak, but you've got backbone.

202
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,000
Zhan Hao's so tough, but you still dared to fight him.

203
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,150
Just for that, you're worth being friends with.

204
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,440
Besides, you won't drag me down.

205
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,570
You're going to be very strong someday.

206
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,030
You believe in me so much?

207
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,320
You took a punch from Zhan Hao for me.

208
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,260
No big deal. For a brother, that's nothing.

209
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,790
I have something cool.

210
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,480
Top-quality Bamboo Leaf Green wine.

211
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
I usually find it too precious to drink.

212
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,640
Don't we have cups?

213
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,510
What use are those? Drink big gulps.

214
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,110
Go on, try it!

215
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,200
Drinking like this is satisfying indeed.

216
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,440
From now on, we feast and drink heartily!

217
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,010
That's living!

218
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,440
Rest up.

219
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,470
I'll go check out the other tents.

220
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,800
Xiang Hong, thanks.

221
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,370
Before I came, I figured camp life would be rough.

222
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,290
I never thought I'd make a friend like you.

223
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,660
Get some rest.

224
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,000
You guys have a lot of nerve.

225
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,550
How dare you pick on him?

226
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,880
Do you even know who he is?

227
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't care who he is.

228
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,700
I beat pretty boys like that on sight.

229
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,160
Great.

230
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,400
Let me spell it out for you.

231
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,720
He's the Marquis of Pingjin's second son, Zhuang Zhixing.

232
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,480
No way.

233
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,110
How do you know?

234
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,240
I was on duty during this year's ground polo contest.

235
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,550
I saw him there.

236
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,960
Same face. No mistake.

237
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,750
I don't know why he came here under a fake name,

238
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,750
but I do know none of us can afford to mess with him!

239
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,360
Your death is upon you, yet you're still laughing?

240
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,790
We're doomed...

241
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,100
We're so doomed...

242
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,310
No wonder you kept sucking up to him.

243
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,150
You knew who he was all along!

244
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,310
Then, why didn't you say something sooner?

245
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,240
I beat him to a pulp today.

246
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,180
If he goes home and tattles to his father, my life is over!

247
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,580
Enough.

248
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,590
You're lucky.

249
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,640
I already smoothed things over.

250
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,310
He's a noble's son, naive and easy to please.

251
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,110
Just speak nicely to him from now on.

252
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,440
Go along with whatever he wants.

253
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,460
Keep him happy, and he won't report you.

254
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,830
Xiaoxing, how come you came out?

255
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,080
You knew who I was all along,

256
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,950
and that's why you kept helping me?

257
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,760
I thought...

258
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,000
your kindness was unselfish.

259
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,680
Xiaoxing, you grew up in the Marquis's residence.

260
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,040
You don't understand how the world really works...

261
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,900
If I weren't the Marquis of Pingjin's son,

262
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,120
would you not have stepped in when Zhan Hao hit me today?

263
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,000
When you said you believed I'd become strong,

264
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,920
was it also because of that?

265
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,600
You're from a military family. You wouldn't be weak.

266
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,190
So, it's still about my father!

267
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,480
I really thought you wanted to be my friend,

268
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,730
that you approached me because you saw me as myself.

269
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,860
You're the Marquis's son.

270
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,630
That's an identity you can't shake no matter where you go.

271
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,650
Besides, with no personal gain,

272
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,700
why would anyone go out of their way for you?

273
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,620
Xiaoxing...

274
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,420
Stop!

275
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,290
Where are you going?

276
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,580
What are you doing here?

277
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,170
You know desertion brings the death penalty.

278
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,060
Come with me.

279
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,160
Good thing you encountered me today.

280
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,620
Otherwise, you'd be in serious trouble.

281
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,110
What happened for you to look this awful?

282
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,550
Eat up. I'll take you back after.

283
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,670
What if I say...

284
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,730
I'm not going back?

285
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:12,430
Does selflessness between people really not exist?

286
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,340
Everyone's chasing something in this world.

287
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,580
Almost no one gives without expecting return.

288
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,400
Then, what about you?

289
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,440
If I weren't a young master of the Marquis's residence,

290
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,770
would you still have gotten close to me?

291
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,030
If I had no grudge against my father

292
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,150
and would never betray him,

293
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,230
would you still ally with me?

294
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,990
If I never uncover the secrets of the past,

295
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,760
would you still stand by me?

296
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,680
Now I understand,

297
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,970
in this whole world,

298
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,120
only one person's kindness to me was unconditional.

299
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,000
And that was my mother's.

300
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,730
But she's gone now.

301
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,220
I hope you'll never forget how she died.

302
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,820
No need to walk me back.

303
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,380
I'll go alone.

304
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,036
   

305
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,240
Sir, reporting in.

306
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,070
No need for formality, Shi Quan.

307
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,720
Sir, why'd you move here?

308
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,720
It's more open than inside, easier to come and go.

309
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,400
It makes a great place for writing.

310
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,750
You sure know how to settle in.

311
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,830
Shi Quan, last time,

312
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,550
thank you for speaking up about the Imperial Astronomical Bureau's problems.

313
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,250
You were willing to hear me out that night.

314
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,160
I should be the one thanking you.

315
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,680
Even though now only you three officials remain,

316
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,160
it was you three doing the real work anyway.

317
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,330
The bureau will be stable for now.

318
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:58,110
I'll take extra care choosing new appointments.

319
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,200
Compared to your decisive style,

320
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,220
my letter must've seemed clumsy.

321
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,930
No one listened to your suggestions before because of Chu Huaiming.

322
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,400
But there is no purpose in an official if they are not serving the people.

323
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,800
That kind of thing won't happen again.

324
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,100
Sir, Chu Huaiming's belongings have been in storage for a while.

325
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,830
Should we dispose of them directly, or do you want to see them first?

326
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,570
Bring them to me.

327
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,860
   

328
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,640
   

329
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,020
Chu Huaiming had such a liking?

330
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,310
Not him, but someone higher up in the capital.

331
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:18,400
The Emperor's younger brother, the Prince of Yongrong.

332
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,440
Prince of Yongrong?

333
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,960
Not many people know this.

334
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,350
Chu Huaiming once had Shi Quan help him search for rare coins.

335
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,790
Shi Quan told me about it.

336
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,640
After Chu Huaiming became the Imperial Astronomer,

337
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,830
his career hit a ceiling.

338
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,600
But he never gave up on trying to befriend the elite in the capital.

339
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,110
- The Princ of Yongrong... 
 - Be careful.

340
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,070
is the smartest choice, naturally.

341
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,680
But ordinary coins won't catch his eye.

342
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,240
Only a full Zhenyou Tongbao set could interest him.

343
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,030
But Chu Huaiming never completed it.

344
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,050
He was missing one, the Zhesan coin.

345
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,720
I have a theory.

346
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,960
Chu Huaiming tried to befriend Yongrong because he knew

347
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,570
Yongrong was the one backing the Marquis and Cao Jingxian.

348
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,430
It's not impossible.

349
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,810
Still, just a box of old coins isn't enough to prove that...

350
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,350
Yongrong's the third man.

351
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,090
But... it's the only lead we've got so far.

352
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,280
That third man has stayed hidden for years.

353
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,230
The Marquis and Cao Jingxian are covering for him willingly.

354
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,050
I still think his rank or power might not be lower than theirs.

355
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,880
He could even be above them.

356
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,720
There aren't many people like that.

357
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,660
Yongrong certainly is among them.

358
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,770
Yongrong...

359
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,240
I've got it.

360
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,760
What do you mean?

361
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,480
It's almost time for regional officials

362
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,590
to report to the capital.

363
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,930
The court allows them one day of leisure after their reports.

364
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,960
And?

365
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,720
The Prince of Yongrong loves lively settings.

366
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,240
He always throws banquets for the visiting officials.

367
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,310
Plenty of big names in the capital also accept invitations to appear for them.

368
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,720
So, if I can somehow get into the Prince of Yongrong's banquet,

369
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,110
not only can I investigate him,

370
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,920
I can also investigate all these other big names while I'm at it.

371
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,800
That's right!

372
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,750
But, Master, I'm just a low-ranking astronomer.

373
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,250
I've never even met the Prince of Yongrong.

374
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,430
How could I possibly get him to invite me?

375
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,440
You brat, you know all you need is one Zhesan coin.

376
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,200
In a city this size, you think I can't track one down?

377
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,670
Leave it to me!

378
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,480
Your Highness.

379
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,710
Gentlemen, this is a report from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

380
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,240
It's a thorough investigation

381
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,860
into reburials, ghost marriages, and land seizures

382
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,960
carried out under false pretenses.

383
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,240
This new Imperial Astronomer laid down strict reforms the moment he took office,

384
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,600
exposing so many corrupt high-ranking officials.

385
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,350
Zang Hai is just a fifth-rank officer.

386
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,160
If he keeps going down this list,

387
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,760
he'll offend much of the court.

388
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,980
How will the bureau even survive like this?

389
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,680
That's just a new official trying to make a splash.

390
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,010
What splash?

391
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

392
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,860
I'm simply bored today,

393
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,450
so I wanted to come to the cabinet to join in on the fun.

394
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,590
I hope I didn't interrupt your discussions.

395
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,600
Not at all.

396
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,750
Your Highness.

397
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,110
Grand Secretary Shi, who were you just talking about?

398
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:23,000
The new Imperial Astronomer, Zang Hai.

399
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,890
Zang Hai?

400
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,460
The one who challenged Chu Huaiming in astronomy?

401
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,220
Interesting.

402
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,500
I didn't expect this Official Zang to stir up such a firestorm.

403
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,570
So, then what do you all make of this?

404
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,680
If you ask me, let's start with the list.

405
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,680
See if these people really did all of the awful things

406
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,570
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau claims.

407
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,550
Since the late emperor set the rules for the Capital Review,

408
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:22,510
every six years when it is held, all of the officials

409
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,760
will be investigated thoroughly from top to bottom.

410
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:33,970
Since we have this list now, let's begin this year's review with them.

411
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:37,150
Let's see how far this firestorm will burn. 
    

412
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,830
Sounds good.

413
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:44,570
I'm curious to see what surprises this Official Zang might bring.

414
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,598
   

415
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,890
Hold on.

416
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,390
Take your time.

417
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,630
How did it go, Master?

418
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,790
I searched every market in the capital.

419
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,060
I even hit the black market.

420
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,820
I asked till my lips went dry.

421
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,280
The weird thing is, every Zhesan coin has already been bought up.

422
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,190
I finally caught wind of a super rare Zhenyou Tongbao at an auction.

423
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,170
It was exactly the Zhesan coin,

424
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,900
well-kept, perfect condition.

425
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,880
I rushed right over but still got there one step too late.

426
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,630
Someone bought it at a high price.

427
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,820
Absolutely maddening!

428
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,340
Guess who bought it.

429
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,720
Xiang Antu?

430
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,230
We underestimated her.

431
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,170
How did the coin end up in her hands?

432
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,820
She's clearly targeting you.

433
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,190
It's too much of a coincidence otherwise!

434
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,220
When's the next Capital Review?

435
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,810
Three more years.

436
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,300
Here. Let me think of something.

437
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,450
Maybe there's another way to find that Zhesan coin.

438
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,010
I'll go look.

439
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,740
Go, then.

440
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,260
Hurry up.

441
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,840
You're right.

442
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,400
If even you can't find it, I've got no chance.

443
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,510
Xiao Hai, instead of running in circles,

444
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,860
why not think about how to get it from Miss Xiang?

445
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,740
No matter if it's an ordinary Zhesan coin

446
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,150
or the treasured ancient one, it's at Zhen Tower.

447
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,760
This is an open scheme you can't avoid.

448
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,550
How much did she pay for the coin?

449
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,770
Five hundred taels.

450
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,910
She was so willing to spend.

451
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,480
All right, we'll prepare a thousand.

452
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,800
Where are we supposed to get a thousand taels?

453
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,840
You can't be serious.

454
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,570
Where's the deed to our house?

455
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,510
Hey, kid!

456
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,630
You're going to trade your house for it?

457
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,800
Where would I live?

458
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,110
No time to worry about that.

459
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,890
We need to show our sincerity.

460
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,180
Here's the plan. We'll stay at an inn for now.

461
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,140
As for living expenses later, we'll just cut back.

462
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,520
Cut back?

463
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,960
Xiao Hai, let me think of a better way.

464
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,190
Master, there's no other way!

465
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,800
Let's do this. Tomorrow, go to Zhen Tower,

466
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,150
give her the house and land deeds.

467
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,230
You want me to go?

468
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,440
What good would that do?

469
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,440
She's pushing you!

470
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,190
If I go, she'll raise it to 2,000 taels!

471
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,940
Then, what will you do?

472
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,480
There's no other choice.

473
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,190
You're better off just pleading with Miss Xiang.

474
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,900
Swallow your pride and admit fault.

475
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,720
As long as you can cheer her up, she won't make it hard for you.

476
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,230
It's not about pride anymore.

477
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,190
Rather, I've already made up my mind to focus on revenge.

478
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,230
Whatever her motives are, I've made my choice.

479
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,300
I'll figure out the future when we get there.

480
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,330
The home's fallen apart. It's all fallen apart.

481
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,110
Maybe think it over one more time.

482
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,800
♫  The memories never stop  ♫

483
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,630
♫  They keep recurrring  ♫

484
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:46,280
♫  Fate is like a strong wine, burning through the intestines  ♫

485
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,680
♫  The light in the dark night  ♫

486
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,850
♫  I want so much to collect it for you  ♫

487
00:36:53,850 --> 00:37:00,620
♫  Fate plays a trick on me, how absurd it is  ♫

488
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,210
♫  I smile fearlessly  ♫

489
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,980
♫  Sighing at the impermanence in life  ♫

490
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,780
♫  A human's heart is deep like the sea  ♫

491
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,570
♫  This life is full of storms  ♫

492
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,070
One!

493
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,710
Two!

494
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,510
Three

495
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,030
Four!

496
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,670
Five!

497
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,360
If you don't work hard now,

498
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,430
once you hit the battlefield, the only option is death!

499
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,860
Faster!

500
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,360
Move it!

501
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:50,040
♫  Stepping into this endless time, how can I not forget?  ♫

502
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:57,640
♫  It's hard to let go of love, it's hard to hide love  ♫

503
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:05,180
♫  It's raining outside the window, another year of cold autumn  ♫

504
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:12,980
♫  After settling worldly affairs, I turn around and face the vast horizon  ♫

505
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,286
   

506
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,070
You're usually teasing me, but now you're just silent.

507
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,320
I can't adjust.

508
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,380
With how you are right now, who dares joke with you?

509
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,540
Didn't you say you'd never interact with him again?

510
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,630
He's patient enough.

511
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,530
He hasn't shown up since he left last time,

512
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,320
but keeps sending people to look for coins.

513
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,930
Didn't you say you wouldn't see him even if he came and that you'd kick him out?

514
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,380
Well, he has to show up first!

515
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,220
Miss, Official Zang is here.

516
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,760
Speak of the devil.

517
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,360
Invite him to Liutao Pavilion.

518
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,900
Yes, ma'am.

519
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,990
Looks like Official Zang's in for a treat.

520
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,150
Now that you're here, my humble place suddenly feels grand.

521
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,280
I left in such a rush last time and didn't wait long enough to see you.

522
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,950
I apologize.

523
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,710
When?

524
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,060
When did you ever come looking for me? I don't recall.

525
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,840
That's my fault.

526
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,050
But since you forced me to come today, you must know why I'm here.

527
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,960
Don't flatter yourself.

528
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,330
I didn't force you. This was your idea.

529
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:53,030
Well, now that I'm here, Miss Xiang, let's not dance around it.

530
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,070
Official Zang, you're here for this, aren't you?

531
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,550
I've searched high and low for this Zhesan coin.

532
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,630
I'm glad it's in your hands.

533
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,360
I'm willing to offer double. Please consider it.

534
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,780
Double? Can you afford that?

535
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,760
I brought the house and land deeds.

536
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,880
Please accept them.

537
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,670
This Zhesan coin is incredibly rare.

538
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,110
To a true collector, it's priceless.

539
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:42,380
Official Zang, I want to know, what do you want it for?

540
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,920
To be honest,

541
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,070
I'm new in office and need to build connections.

542
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,440
I especially want to meet the Prince of Yongrong.

543
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,670
I heard he loves collecting ancient coins.

544
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,640
So, I'm playing to his taste.

545
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,230
Looks like your career still matters a lot to you.

546
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,190
This coin is indeed one of my favorites.

547
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,280
After hearing you out, I feel even more strongly that it's valuable.

548
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,240
I've decided to keep it for myself.

549
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,190
Everything I have is right here.

550
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:24,060
If you won't part with it, I won't push.

551
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,010
Thank you for granting me this meeting today.

552
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,170
Goodbye.

553
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,420
Wait.

554
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,840
I just remembered something.

555
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,000
I never finished reading your palm last time.

556
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,980
Let me finish it now.

557
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,030
That wound healed fast.

558
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,960
I can't even see the scar anymore.

559
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,800
Your career line looks a bit deeper now.

560
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,990
But the others...

561
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,670
have gotten lighter.

562
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,400
I wouldn't dare accept the house the Marquis gave you.

563
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,760
And I'm not short on money.

564
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,030
Take the coin.

565
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:27,050
But now you owe my Zhen Tower another favor.

566
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:47,480
Miss, you're letting him go that easily?

567
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,880
I can tell he's hiding a lot in his heart.

568
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,220
But pressing now won't get us anywhere.

569
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,910
Let me see what he does next.

570
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:16,940



571
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,160
