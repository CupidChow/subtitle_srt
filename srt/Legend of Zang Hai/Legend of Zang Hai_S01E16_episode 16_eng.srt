1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:16,100



2
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,573
   

4
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,400
Look at your furrowed brows, My Lord.

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,710
Are you still concerned over the celestial omens?

6
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,580
I went out shopping earlier today

7
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,560
and heard people discussing it everywhere.

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,790
They even mentioned you, My Lord.

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,060
What did they say?

10
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,400
They said that Zang Hai was bold enough to speculate

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,180
on celestial omens and has misled the public.

12
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,680
They also said that you indulge your aide

13
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,850
and have failed to discipline him.

14
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,710
I usually don't take the gossip to heart.

15
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,800
But the celestial omens are of grave importance.

16
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,350
I'm worried that if the gossip spreads

17
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,420
and reaches His Majesty one day,

18
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,300
someone will use it against you, My Lord.

19
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,050
In my humble opinion,

20
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,590
it doesn't matter whether Zang Hai was right.

21
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,470
He went over your head to report the celestial omens.

22
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,630
Who knows what he's capable of in the future?

23
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,750
We can't keep someone like him around.

24
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,360
You're saying...

25
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,030
If you can't bear to do it,

26
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,800
I can do it for you, My Lord.

27
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,650
It's easy to kill him.

28
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,080
But what if the celestial omens prove to be true?

29
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,890
In that case, it shows how well you recognize talents.

30
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,560
Though talents are rare,

31
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,890
the disobedient must be eliminated.

32
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,870
Do you think...

33
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,030
that the general about to fall...

34
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,990
could be me?

35
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,940
My Lord, you really believe what he said?

36
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,490
Heavy rain in Zhongzhou. A blessed shower!

37
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,550
Good news! Heavy rain in Zhongzhou. A blessed shower!

38
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,310
Heavy rain in Zhongzhou. A blessed shower!

39
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,930
Good news! Heavy rain in Zhongzhou. A blessed shower!

40
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,720
Here comes His Majesty's Decree. 
    

41
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,380
"Zhongzhou has suffered from drought for months,

42
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,940
with rivers running dry, which is a matter of grave concern to me.

43
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,110
Now, auspicious rain falls by Heaven's mercy,

44
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,400
reviving the land, relieving the people's plight,

45
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,750
and bringing universal rejoicing.

46
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,310
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau foretold this blessing

47
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,770
and shall be rewarded with 1,000 liang of silver. By Imperial Decree."

48
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,300
I, Chu Huaiming, humbly thank His Majesty.

49
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,950
Gentlemen, we must keep working hard

50
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,600
and live up to His Majesty's expectations.

51
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,180
Go back to work.

53
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,630
How is Zang Hai doing?

54
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,830
It's said that he's been eating and sleeping well,

55
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,030
and sitting around leisurely during the day as if nothing bothers him.

56
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,840
- Get back to work. 
 - Understood.

57
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,010
   

58
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,760
Official Chu.

59
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,800
Sir Zang, you're still able to sleep?

60
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,920
You'll fall into an eternal sleep soon.

61
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,630
Cultivate yourself while you are awake

62
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,070
and strive to be reincarnated into a good family.

63
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,380
News says it rained in Zhongzhou, which is an auspicious sign.

64
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,800
I won. You lost.

65
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,620
Official Chu, what's the hurry?

66
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,220
The Marquis gave me seven days.

67
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,950
Even if you had ten days, what's the use?

68
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,960
Don't tell me you still believe you can survive this?

69
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,920
"The Winnowing Basket Mansion heralds wind and the Net Mansion presages rain." 
  (Book of Documents) 

70
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,240
You remember this sentence by heart.

71
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,790
But I bet you haven't heard of this sentence.

72
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,120
"When the moon is far from Net Mansion, rain falls in torrents like a river." 
  (Classic of Poetry) 

73
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,320
As the Imperial Astronomer, you lack expertise

74
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,040
and only report good news for rewards, ignoring the facts.

75
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,680
You can't even read the signs.

76
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,480
Enough with your alarmist rhetoric.

77
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,950
I've foretold so many auspicious omens at the bureau.

78
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,970
If you don't believe me, please go back.

79
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,830
No matter how eager you are,

80
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,900
wait for another five days and see if I end up executed,

81
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,630
or you end up losing everything you have worked so hard for.

82
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,310
You just won't accept your defeat, huh?

83
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,950
I won't waste my time here.

84
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,500
Just wait for the execution.

85
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,640
   

86
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,760
How is the Marquis?

87
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,120
Last night, my father told the household to tighten security

88
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,200
and turn away all outside visitors.

89
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,000
It seems that he will stay in these next few days.

90
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He looks worried.

91
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,840
I'm afraid it's because of the "falling general" you mentioned.

92
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,720
Why would you say something like that?

93
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,260
To save my life, of course.  It was a critical moment.

94
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,060
If I hadn't made up something dramatic,

95
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,680
your father would have killed me on the spot.

96
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,710
So, I came up with that statement to get myself out of trouble.

97
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,200
Generals and ministers die every year.

98
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,480
Strange weather occurs every year.

99
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,280
I only mentioned a falling general without specifying the rank of that person.

100
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,860
It was just to fool your father.

101
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:24,250
If he knew he had been restless because of your lie, he'll kill you.

102
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:30,070
I only need a few more days to prove that I'm right.

103
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,750
Second Young Master, do me a favor.

104
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,970
Get your father's former subordinates to give warnings to Zhongzhou.

105
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,300
All right.

106
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,450
I need another favor from you.

107
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,070
Stay alert these days. No one shall enter with weapons.

108
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,980
My Lord, it's been raining in Zhongzhou for three days.

109
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,840
The drought has eased. Everything is in order.

110
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,030
It's been three days.

111
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,010
How big is the rain?

112
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,530
It shows no sign of letting up.

113
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,240
Go to the Ministry of Works every day

114
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,570
to inquire about it from the Hydrological Bureau.

115
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,620
Official Chu, it's been raining for four days,

116
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,390
with the largest rainfall in a decade.

117
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,810
Water is starting to gather on the terrain.

118
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,360
Go back to work.

119
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,200
It's been raining heavily for five days,

120
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
with rivers flooding and rocks falling from mountains,

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,630
destroying a dozen houses and injuring nearly 100 people.

122
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,790
Keep me updated.

123
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,720
It's been raining for six days. The water levels of the nine rivers are rising.

124
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,080
We've sent someone to strengthen the dams.

125
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,170
If it keeps raining for two or three days,

126
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,540
I'm afraid the dam will break.

127
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,810
Impossible.

128
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,700
It's impossible.

129
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,450
Official Chu.

130
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,150
Butler Zhuang, please tell the Marquis that I need to see him.

131
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,500
My Lord has been ill these days and has stopped receiving visitors.

132
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,700
Official Chu, please go back.

133
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,540
Why?

134
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,580
On what grounds?

135
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,400
Zang Hai... I wish you death!

136
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,930
What did...

137
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,260
Eunuch Cao say?

138
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,300
He said that you should apologize to His Majesty as soon as possible.

139
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,680
Eunuch Cao is not going to save me?

140
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,770
He can't just abandon me.

141
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,140
Master said that with the relentless rainfall in Zhongzhou,

142
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,570
His Majesty hasn't slept well lately and has barely eaten for days.

143
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,860
Official Chu, you read the omens wrong and endangered the people.

144
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,240
You are on your own.

145
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,700
Father, he left.

146
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,220
Zang Hai... It's him again.

147
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,650
He even went after the Imperial Astronomer.

148
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,480
Imperial Astronomer...

149
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,442
   

150
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,880
Greetings, Official Chu.

151
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,060
Young Brother Zang Hai.

152
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,320
Don't you look great?

153
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,730
How can you be so confident?

154
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,030
Judging from your look,

155
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,120
I bet it has been raining in Zhongzhou for days,

156
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,430
which has caused floods.

157
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,630
Young Brother Zang Hai, you are the Marquis's aide.

158
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,810
I also work for the Marquis.

159
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,500
We are in the same boat.

160
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,180
We shouldn't fight each other.

161
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,080
If you want to be an official,

162
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,670
I can put in a good word with the Marquis.

163
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,780
If you want money, I can help you.

164
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,800
How much do you want? Name a price.

165
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,750
Young Brother Zang Hai.

166
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,470
Young Brother Zang Hai.

167
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,840
You only have to tell the Marquis

168
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,200
that the celestial omens carry mixed messages.

169
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,470
I read the auspicious part and you the ominous part.

170
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,980
We were both correct.

171
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,200
We just didn't foresee it all.

172
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,320
In that case, I'll just be punished for negligence

173
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,910
and you will get to live.

174
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,480
It's a win-win.

175
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,360
What do you think?

176
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,450
Official Chu.

177
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,300
Are you begging me?

178
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,180
I lack expertise and read the celestial omens wrong.

179
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,990
Brother Zang, I recommended you to the Marquis.

180
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,980
Since we are both serving the Marquis, help me out.

181
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,650
In return, I'll go through

182
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,050
any hardship for you whenever you need me.

183
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,910
Honestly, Official Chu.

184
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,480
All those offers sound highly tempting.

185
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,000
Right?

186
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,900
- Then let's... 
 - But what's wrong is wrong.

187
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,340
If all the right and wrong, true and false,

188
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,840
and good and evil can be altered in this world,

189
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,600
it would be against my parents' teachings

190
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,950
and the court's discipline and laws.

191
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,670
Official Chu, this play has started.

192
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,900
How can we stop halfway?

193
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,350
Zang Hai, you're determined to destroy me?

194
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,550
There's no bad blood between us.

195
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,790
Why do you want me dead so badly?

196
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,240
So, you know that there's no bad blood between us.

197
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,080
Then why have you tried to kill me again and again

198
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,930
at the late emperor's mausoleum?

199
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,220
You caught those folk people and made them "feng shui masters."

200
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,480
Those craftsmen died tragically in the mausoleum.

201
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,900
You shoved burning charcoal down that girl's throat.

202
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,510
You stepped on the innocent to get ahead.

203
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,140
What have they done to you?

204
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,330
Official Chu, you are the Imperial Astronomer.

205
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:13,420
You know all about reincarnation and karma, don't you?

206
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,920
You came to show off your power last time.

207
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,780
But this time,

208
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,830
did you come to ask for help

209
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,320
or say goodbye to me?

210
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,700
You have foreseen everything.

211
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:40,790
But have you foreseen the fact that you'll die today?

212
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,330
Chu Huaiming, you misread the celestial omens.

213
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,780
In the worst case, you'll be demoted and imprisoned.

214
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,270
You'll be able to start anew in a few years.

215
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,760
But if you kill me,

216
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,770
you have to pay with your life.

217
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,900
Pay with my life?

218
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,540
You killed Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao.

219
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,780
You should pay with your life, too.

220
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,830
I will leave the capital after I kill you.

221
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,510
The court officials won't be able to find me.

222
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,500
You may be able to read fortunes,

223
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,660
but you can't escape death.

224
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,100
I entered the Imperial Astronomical Bureau when I was 15.

225
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,270
I have worked diligently for so many years.

226
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,320
With so much planning and scheming,

227
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,000
I managed to get acquainted with the Marquis of Pingjin

228
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,720
and become the Imperial Astronomer.

229
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,250
Do you have any idea what I've been through...

230
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,380
what I've been through

231
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,320
and how much I've suffered to come this far?

232
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,270
You.

233
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,350
It's all your fault.

234
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,280
Zang Hai.

235
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,690
You took everything from me overnight.

236
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,650
You made it as the Imperial Astronomer

237
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,030
but you lost your conscience.

238
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,690
I didn't do this to you. You did.

239
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,580
How is it wrong to seek upward mobility?

240
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,030
None of this would have happened without you.

241
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,690
Even if I end up utterly ruined,

242
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,290
I'll drag you down...

243
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,100
- Chu Huaiming, you... 
 - Die with me.

244
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,320
You shall perish!

245
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,720
Official Chu.

246
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,280
Guards.

247
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,940
- What's that smell? 
 - Come on.

248
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,450
Guards.

249
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,240
Fire.

250
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,020
- Fire. Get help!  
 - All right.

251
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,580
Hurry.

252
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,090
I'm here! Put out the fire! Hurry!

253
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,960
Hurry!

254
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,110
Help!

255
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,920
Fire!

256
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,900
 Fire! 

257
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,420
Hurry!

258
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,620
- Hurry! 
 - Put out the fire!

259
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,030
   

260
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,750
 I need another favor from you. 

261
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,350
 I'm driving Chu Huaiming into a corner. 

262
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,640
 I'm afraid he can only set fire to kill me. 

263
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,920
 You must stick to the plan. 

264
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,770
 Don't try to save me. 

265
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,780
My Lord, the rain in Zhongzhou is getting worse.

266
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,300
It just won't stop.

267
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,860
There may be floods.

268
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,030
How many days has it been?

269
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,960
It's been seven days.

270
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,700
 My Lord, bad news. 

271
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,310
 My Lord! 

272
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,400
My Lord, bad news.

273
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,460
What happened?

274
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,240
The confinement chamber caught fire.

275
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,480
- Where is Zang Hai? 
 - He's still in there.

276
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,830
We are trying to rescue him.

277
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,790
Second Young Master.

278
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,030
Official Chu, what's the rush?

279
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,350
I just spoke with your father.

280
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,950
I'll take my leave now.

281
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,900
You set fire here and think you can escape?

282
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,350
You...

283
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,790
Come to see my father.

284
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,530
No.

285
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,200
Zang Hai!

286
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,830
- My Lord. 
 - My Lord.

287
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,880
M-My Lord.

288
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,310
Be careful, My Lord.

289
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,620
My Lord. Guards!

290
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,340
My Lord.

291
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,180
Guards.

292
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,070
My Lord, are you all right?

293
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,730
- Put out the fire! 
 - All right.

294
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:45,650
Hurry! Throw water! Faster!

295
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,390
Step aside!

296
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,000
Go.

297
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,530
My Lord. My Lord! Are you all right?

298
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,390
I'm fine.

299
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,240
My Lord.

300
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,170
- My Lord, why did you... 
 - You're burned.

301
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,310
Consider yourself lucky.

302
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,880
Why did the cell suddenly catch fire?

303
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,300
The guards said that Official Chu came before the fire.

304
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,850
Chu Huaiming?

305
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,350
Where is he?

306
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,450
Father!

307
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,280
- Look. 
 - Father.

308
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,130
Chu Huaiming,

309
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,790
did you set the fire?

310
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,270
No. My Lord, it wasn't me.

311
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,760
I saw it with my own eyes. Chu Huaiming tried to escape.

312
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,160
It was him.

313
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,010
He wanted to kill me.

314
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,180
He killed Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao...

315
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:02,190
My Lord. He's targeting you, My Lord.

316
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,270
My Lord.

317
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,080
My Lord! Urgent report from Zhongzhou.

318
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,380
The pouring rain destroyed many parts of the dam.

319
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,650
River water flooded tens of thousands acres of fertile land downstream.

320
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,070
How are the people of Zhongzhou?

321
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,540
People along the coast received warnings in advance.

322
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,600
Many have been evacuated. But there are still thousands of casualties.

323
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,300
One more thing. General Fu Zhisong, the Commander of the Central Army

324
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,540
led the troops to combat the floods.

325
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,440
When the dam was washed away,

326
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,100
General Fu was swept away by the huge waves.

327
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,550
His body was found downstream.

328
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,070
Take Chu Huaiming to the Court of Judicial Review.

329
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,850
- Get up. 
 - My Lord!

330
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,300
Zang Hai. I hope you die!

331
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,920
 I hope you die! 

332
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,360
Go and get water. Hurry.

333
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,950
Hurry!

334
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,680
Faster!

335
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:24,490
You mean the Marquis dashed into the fire to save Zang Hai?

336
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:28,000
Fortunately, the arsonist was caught.

337
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,270
Who was it?

338
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,240
Chu Huaiming.

339
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,340
The second young master caught him

340
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,150
and he's escorting him to the Court of Judicial Review now.

341
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,240
- Fu'er, hurry up. Let's check on your father. 
 - All right.

342
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,010
Don't worry, My Lady.

343
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,510
Sir Zang has sent the Marquis back to his chamber for treatment.

344
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,520
The Marquis said that you and Eldest Young Master are not needed there.

345
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,790
Fu'er.

346
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,820
Someone beat us to it.

347
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,240
You are supposed to be the one

348
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,780
staying by your father's side now.

349
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,740
My Lord, the physicians will be here soon.

350
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,160
No need to make a fuss over some minor injuries.

351
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,070
We'll be done before they arrive.

352
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,730
Go on.

353
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,830
Please bear with it, My Lord.

354
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,250
As you said, General Fu died.

355
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,680
The Great Yong lost an outstanding general.

356
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:03,220
To be honest, I am somewhat relieved.

357
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:11,090
I'd been wondering whether the falling general would be me.

358
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,160
You are over-concerned.

359
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,670
I have told you that you are blessed by heaven.

360
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:24,520
I have fought countless battles for decades, fearless of death.

361
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:30,400
But life in the capital has changed me over time.

362
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:40,230
Fortunately, I have you to take precautions for me.

363
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,970
My Lord, I am just a folk person.

364
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,530
It's my honor to work for you and be appreciated.

365
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:11,330
If you hadn't rescued me today, I would have died in the fire.

366
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:16,800
Zang Hai. I used to think of you as an aide.

367
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,950
You were my subordinate, nothing more.

368
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,490
But after I rescued you from the fire,

369
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,690
I realized that I have long regarded you as my family.

370
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,310
I locked you up out of concern. Don't blame me.

371
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,760
I dare not. I overstepped my authority...

372
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,510
Enough. I know you meant well.

373
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,440
I understand what you said.

374
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,460
It's hard for me to trust someone.

375
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,630
Don't let me down.

376
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,670
I will not let you down.

377
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,400
   

378
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,000
By the Mandate of Heaven, His Majesty decrees:

379
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,200
"Chu Huaiming, Imperial Astronomer of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

380
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,550
misread celestial omens and delayed warnings,

381
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,110
which led to great floods in Zhongzhou that ruined people's livelihood.

382
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,590
Then he hid the truth from his superiors and plotted to kill the innocent.

383
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,170
He is hereby stripped of rank, reduced to commoner status,

384
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,910
and exiled to a distance of 3,000 li with 50 strokes of the rod

385
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,860
to be carried out right now."

386
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,330
My Lady, did I hurt you?

387
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,760
It's not your fault.

388
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,010
I have a headache.

389
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,880
What is on your mind?

390
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,070
Are you still worried about the Marquis' injury?

391
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,210
The butler said that the Marquis is going to be all right.

392
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:21,700
I was thinking about Zang Hai and Zhuang Zhixing.

393
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,110
Why would you think about them?

394
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,830
Don't let them bother you.

395
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,480
Zhixing stood out during the ground polo match,

396
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,160
which pleased the Marquis.

397
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,780
While Zhifu chose scholarship, he turned to martial arts.

398
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,640
He knew very well that the Marquis longed for

399
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,440
a martial heir to carry on the legacy

400
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,830
and bring the Zhuang family back to glory.

401
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,440
And he just happened

402
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,830
to catch Chu Huaiming who set fire.

403
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:01,510
He earned merit, and meanwhile, helped Zang Hai.

404
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:08,840
What an accurate plan refined down

405
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,480
to the last detail.

406
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,110
Did the second young master suddenly get enlightened?

407
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,210
I'm worried...

408
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,830
that he has allied with Zang Hai to...

409
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:36,380
Although... I don't know what Zang Hai is after,

410
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:42,920
I'm sure that Zhixing is trying to compete with my Zhifu.

411
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,350
There's nothing to be afraid of.

412
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:51,050
That good-for-nothing is no match for our eldest young master.

413
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,570
I made this ginseng soup for you by myself.

414
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:14,030
It has cinnamon and licorice that drains pus.

415
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:18,040
Have some, and your wounds will heal faster.

416
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,580
How are you feeling? Does it still hurt?

417
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,960
You didn't let me take care of you.

418
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,670
I've been worried all night.

419
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,900
It's just a minor injury. No big deal.

420
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,300
Your safety concerns the livelihoods of hundreds of people

421
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,280
in this household.

422
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,380
How can I not be concerned?

423
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:43,180
Please don't put yourself in danger again.

424
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:55,150
It is great that you are always

425
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,310
so kind to your subordinates.

426
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,780
But for some reason,

427
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,740
I've been feeling uneasy.

428
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,380
What are you worried about?

429
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,630
Ever since Zang Hai arrived,

430
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,590
you've been losing competent aides.

431
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,360
Yang Zhen and Qu Jiao died.

432
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,550
Now, even Chu Huaiming is in jail.

433
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,000
Think about it, My Lord.

434
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,810
Who benefits the most from it?

435
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,140
Isn't it Zang Hai?

436
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,070
You treat him so well.

437
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:38,550
How come he keeps eliminating dissidents?

438
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,560
Eliminating dissidents?

439
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,030
Wife, is that what you think?

440
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,890
Zang Hai came and instantly bonded with Zhixing.

441
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,360
I'm afraid it was because Zhixing is simple

442
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,410
and likes to make friends.

443
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:58,230
Yesterday, Zhixing happened to catch Chu Huaiming.

444
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,820
How could it be so coincidental?

445
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:13,000
Are you saying that Zhixing knew Chu Huaiming would set fire

446
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,560
and lay in ambush?

447
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,260
I'm afraid that someone has been guiding him.

448
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,350
Otherwise, how did he win the ground polo game just like that?

449
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:26,110
Wife, you are the female head of the household.

450
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,230
Why are you able to accept Zhifu's successes,

451
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,160
but not Zhixing's?

452
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,720
You got me wrong, My Lord.

453
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,110
I'm just worried that your trusted and well-respected aide

454
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:52,150
is actually harboring other intentions.

455
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,440
I heard what you said.

456
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,410
You may leave.

457
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,190
My Lady.

458
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,900
My Lord.

459
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,760
You heard everything?

460
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,710
My Lord. Yes, I heard everything.

461
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,890
Do you have anything to say?

462
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,030
My Lady is only partly right.

463
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,110
I did train the second young master to win the game.

464
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:56,720
But how could I have known that Chu Huaiming would try to kill me by setting a fire?

465
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,630
Everyone rushed to the confinement chamber to put out the fire.

466
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,170
Chu Huaiming must have looked suspicious

467
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,080
as he fled in panic.

468
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,710
Second Young Master spotted him.

469
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,080
The arrest was only natural.

470
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:16,560
But I admit that I have been close to the second young master.

471
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,400
My Lord, if I may be so bold,

472
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,550
the second young master has the makings of a great general.

473
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:28,700
He can't fully unleash his potential by playing ground polo.

474
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:35,230
Are you saying that I should put him in the army?

475
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,030
That's right.

476
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:41,570
Eldest Young Master has established himself in the imperial court.

477
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,260
But your family boasts generations of generals

478
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,030
and you have made great achievements yourself.

479
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:52,560
It would be a pity if the legacy finds no bearer.

480
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:02,880
Zhifu is indeed not made for the army.

481
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:09,010
But I'm afraid that you are wrong about Zhixing.

482
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,760
He may have been a bit wayward in the past

483
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,360
but he's been practicing hard without slacking off these days.

484
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,590
The reason he could stand out so fast,

485
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,440
apart from his diligence,

486
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,190
lay in the blood of the Zhuang family

487
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,480
flowing through his veins.

488
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,170
Isn't it a bit too early to make plans for Zhixing?

489
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:40,590
As your aide, of course, I have to make plans for your family.

490
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,340
Once we have a scholar

491
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,510
and a general supporting each other in court,

492
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,790
we can lay a solid foundation for further development.

493
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:55,770
You perceive and contemplate things far beyond my capacity.

494
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,450
My Lord, you said you'd treat me as family.

495
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:05,320
Then I shall share everything on my mind without holding back.

496
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,660
Back then, aides like you around me

497
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,810
couldn't even fit in one tent.

498
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,640
But they are all dead.

499
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,840
They died for me.

500
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,090
Are you afraid of death?

501
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:30,860
My Lord, I once said that I was afraid of death.

502
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,340
But it's worse to live a wasted life.

503
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,470
I believe those who worked for you died for a great cause.

504
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,690
I called you here to talk business.

505
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:52,130
The Imperial Astronomer post is vacant.

506
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,030
Tell me.

507
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:57,300
Do you want to take that job?

508
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,590
- I... 
 - Don't hesitate.

509
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,740
If you're interested, I will pull some strings for you.

510
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,750
I will do whatever you say.

511
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,970
   

512
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:17,950
Disciple, you were really lucky this time.

513
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:22,210
How much of his trust do you think you've earned by now?

514
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,770
About 70 or 80 percent.

515
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,710
You disagree, Master?

516
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:33,150
If the person caught in the fire was not you but Jiang Xiang,

517
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,880
he wouldn't have saved her.

518
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,500
Jiang Xiang's father, Jiang Jin, is no longer the Minister of Rites

519
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,070
and has no value to the Marquis.

520
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:46,110
But you are his most precious aide now.

521
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:50,730
Your talents and abilities can help him stand firm in the court.

522
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,360
He saved you to protect his private property.

523
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,250
He said what he said just to win your heart.

524
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,630
At least, it is good

525
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,710
that the Marquis of Pingjin is trying to bond with you.

526
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:07,110
But you must be extra careful.

527
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,160
Never cross the line or fail to show due respect.

528
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,080
This is quite tricky.

529
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,480
I hope you can be the person he trusts and depends on the most.

530
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,220
Then he will share everything on his mind with you.

531
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,000
We are not bound by blood.

532
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,130
I can earn his trust,

533
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,410
but how can I make him rely on me

534
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:31,670
without working for him for a decade?

535
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,820
Not even Yang Zhen made it.

536
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,930
Everyone experiences pain and confusion.

537
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,530
It's hard to take action.

538
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,250
The Marquis is no exception.

539
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,110
To make him rely on you,

540
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,030
you must share his burden.

541
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,310
What pains and confuses him?

542
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,140
It concerns the person who disappeared from the Zhuang family.

543
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:16,980



544
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,260
 "It's Me" - Sun Nan 

545
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,740
♫  I conceal the ambition in my eyes  ♫

546
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:36,460

♫  With stoic madness  ♫

555
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,820
♫  I cleanse the filth of the world  ♫

556
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,540
♫  The night is not dark  ♫

557

♫  I'm the falling rain  ♫

561
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,800
♫  The compass of the human soul is unpredictable  ♫

562
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,980
♫  There will always be people who rise and fall  ♫

563
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,600
♫  I am life and death  ♫

564
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,220
♫  I grant and I deprive  ♫

565
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,780
♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

566
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,380
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫

567
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,740
♫  I am the sowing season  ♫

568
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,460
♫  I am the autumn harvest  ♫

569
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,820
♫  I am the kingdom  ♫

570
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,580
♫  I am the commoner  ♫

571
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,960
♫  You are also me  ♫
