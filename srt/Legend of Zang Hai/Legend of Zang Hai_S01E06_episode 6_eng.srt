1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:20,100


2
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,723
   

4
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,300
First, we were haunted by Dowager Noble Consort Li.

5
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,820
Now again? The late emperor?

6
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,330
I didn't see it coming.

7
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,680
You didn't see it coming?

8
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,120
Chu Huaiming, are you really competent as an Imperial Astronomer?

9
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,100
My apologies, My Lord.

10
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,580
The coffin of the late emperor moved for no reason. I have a theory for this.

11
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,480
Perhaps we should not have relocated the coffin of Dowager Noble Consort Li.

12
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,160
Are you suggesting that I request the Emperor

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,050
to move back the Empress Dowager?

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,430
My Lord, maybe the feng shui was wrong

15
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,240
when they were building the royal tomb.

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
It caused the hidden danger.

17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,810
But the top priority right now is to find an excuse to fix the problem.

18
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,960
It won't take long before the Empress Dowager is buried in the royal tomb.

19
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,900
All we need to say is...

20
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,460
We can secretly restore the coffin of the late emperor

21
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,270
under the pretext that the royal tomb is in disrepair.

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,400
However, it's a big deal to repair the royal tomb.

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,800
I need approval from you, My Lord.

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
As we discussed earlier, I still need to bother the Emperor, don't I?

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,980
My Lord, you just perfectly solved

26
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,900
the problem of burying the Empress Dowager.

27
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,840
If you propose to repair the royal tomb at this very moment,

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,470
the Emperor would appreciate your loyalty and grant the request.

29
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,680
If we don't do this,

30
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,880
once the rumor goes around that we are haunted by the late emperor, I'm afraid...

31
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,490
Finish the job. No mistake is allowed.

32
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,140
Yes, My Lord.

33
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,990
It may raise suspicions if I handle this task in person.

34
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,520
We have to find someone else.

35
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,960
This man should be equipped with feng shui and geomancy.

36
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,120
Moreover, to avoid the leak of the secret,

37
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,640
he must not have any connections to the court.

38
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,040
My Lord,

39
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,980
- I have a perfect candidate for this job. 
 - Speak.

40
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,150
Zang Hai, the newly recruited aide.

41
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,600
He helped us solve the problem of relocating Dowager Noble Consort Li.

42
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,060
He is familiar with the layout of the royal tomb

43
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,920
and he knows feng shui and geomancy.

44
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,840
Most importantly, he is working for us and we know his background.

45
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,800
He is the man for this job.

46
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,290
Zang Hai?

47
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,160
Is he suitable for this job?

48
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,060
My Lord, you're blessed to have such a rare talent working for you.

49
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,410
It's a great opportunity for him.

50
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,200
He deserves a reward once he completes the task.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,030
Chu Huaiming, offer him a role in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

52
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,900
and authorize him to supervise the repair work.

53
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,750
Remember, don't mention it to anyone that he is working for us.

54
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,760
Yes, My Lord.

55
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,260
The Emperor hereby appoints Zang Hai

56
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,600
as Assistant Supervisor of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

57
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,760
to supervise the repair work of the royal tomb. Please note.

58
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,640
I accept this imperial edict appointment.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,830
Congratulations!

60
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,400
Zang Hai, your birth date is compatible with the late emperor.

61
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,750
You know feng shui and geomancy well.

62
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,330
As a newly recruited aide,

63
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,890
you're trusted with such an important job.

64
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,160
There is a bright future ahead of you.

65
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,700
Thanks, sir.

66
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,170
Chu Huaiming said your birth date is compatible with the late emperor?

67
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,300
They cannot wait to see me buried together with the late emperor.

68
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,630
Sinister plan!

69
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,040
I don't think this idea was proposed by a loser like Chu Huaiming.

70
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,560
Zang Hai, you offended Yang Zhen. Now they are coming for you.

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,310
You have to accept the challenge. But they are craving your blood!

72
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,140
No way. I should dress myself up and come with you.

73
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,230
Master, they won't kill me even if you come along with me?

74
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,310
I'm waiting for their move.

75
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,130
Once they make their move, there will be opportunities for me.

76
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,440
Only then can I turn the tide and win.

77
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,160
And find a way out of an impasse.

78
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,970
This is too dangerous. You need a backup plan.

79
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,480
Master, come on. Sit.

80
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,190
The royal tomb repair takes three months.

81
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,430
I'm safe during this period.

82
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,740
They may try to bury me once the project is completed.

83
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,730
Master, I need two favors from you.

84
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,356
   

85
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,063
   

86
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,600
The plan is actionable

87
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,300
but there is no guarantee that it will be successful.

88
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,140
I've been thinking about this. This is the only way to survive.

89
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,930
It's risky. But I'd like to take the chance.

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,150
What about the second favor?

91
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,430
Master, it's been a while since you demonstrated your talent.

92
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,790
Aren't you itching for a try?

93
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,100
 Tie it tigher. 

94
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,940
 This is the one. 

95
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,690
 Well... 

96
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,820
 Is it this one? 

97
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,760
Official Chu.

98
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,120
- Official Chu. 
 - Since you are here,

99
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,670
fix the problem for the imperial court.

100
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,720
Zang Hai, what are you doing?

101
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,850
Official Chu, I'm trying to fix the haunting problem.

102
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,020
Official Chu, please take a look.

103
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,900
Watch closely.

104
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,320
Why is there so much water here?

105
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,170
The displacement of the late emperor's coffin was caused by underground water.

106
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,090
The underground water, just like a tide, rises at night and declines during the day.

107
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,580
The coffin is made of Chinese giant redwood, which is rare and soft.

108
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,030
It can float in water.

109
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,970
If the water rises high enough, the coffin will escape from Dragon Stone

110
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,600
and float around the chamber.

111
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,990
Pushed by water, the coffin may knock against the rock door.

112
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,580
The guard mistook the knocking sound for the appearance of the late emperor.

113
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,890
Rain stops during the day and the underground water recedes.

114
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:22,480
Water will decline and escape from the gap in the wooden doors.

115
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,540
As a result, the coffin was relocated here.

116
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,290
Official, if you need evidence, please check the water stains on the wall.

117
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,050
Of course, I know the rule of underground water movement.

118
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,490
How can I not know about it?

119
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,670
It happens every day. Why wasn't the chamber breached before?

120
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,670
As you know, You River was diverted five years ago

121
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,620
and passes around the royal tomb.

122
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,510
It's normal during the day. But the You river will rise at night.

123
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,360
As the chamber is located very deep within the royal tomb,

124
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,620
it will no longer be safe from water when the heavy rain lasts for days.

125
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,650
However, the royal tomb is an important place.

126
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,360
There is no reason that the chamber is flooded with so much water, even if the underground water rises.

127
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,320
Not to mention floating the coffin.

128
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,080
Is it possible that we missed the waterproofing process

129
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,170
in the royal tomb after the diversion of the You River?

130
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,400
What do you mean?

131
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,970
Official Chu,

132
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,010
since I was appointed as Assistant Supervisor of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

133
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,910
it's my duty to figure out how to repair the royal tomb.

134
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,200
Do you have any plans?

135
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,750
The diversion of the You River has caused the flooding issue.

136
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,600
We can do nothing about it.

137
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,950
There is only one solution to this.

138
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,100
Redo the waterproofing process in the chamber.

139
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,940
Fine. Advice approved.

140
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,640
Do what you have to do.

141
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,830
Listen, everyone! Follow the instructions of Official Zang.

142
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,010
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

143
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,840
Zang Hai, work hard.

144
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,920
Once the repair is done, you will be rewarded with a good place.

145
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,780
Thanks, Official Chu.

146
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,200
It turns out the royal tomb is not haunted.

147
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,580
Dust to dust.

148
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,020
Ghost stories are invented only to comfort us.

149
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,720
But I don't understand one thing.

150
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,920
What, Official?

151
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,600
There should be water stains on the floor when the underground water declines.

152
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,790
It's supposed to occur frequently.

153
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,720
But has no one ever thought that it was caused by groundwater?

154
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,390
Yes. Someone mentioned this.

155
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,350
But Official Chu didn't believe that guy and punished him hard instead.

156
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,270
That guy.

157
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,190
Ji Qun.

158
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,270
Ji Qun.

159
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,500
This is Official Zang.

160
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,170
 Uncle Ji. 

161
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,340
 - Little Zhinu.  
  - Uncle Ji. 

162
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,870
 Little Zhinu. How about your learning of the Mountain Viewing Skill? 

163
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,960
 Very well. 

164
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,080
 Come. I have a gift for you. 

165
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,480
 This is called a telescope. 

166
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,080
 You can use it to watch mountains clearly dozens of li from us. 

167
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,120
 Ji Qun, you're back. 

168
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,100
 - Official. 
 - Father, it's a gift from Uncle Ji. 

169
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,110
 Good. 

170
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,690
 He is bothering me all day long, saying he wants 

171
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,560
 to learn from you the technique of Mountain Viewing. 

172
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,170
 It seems that you will become a Calendrical Official in the Five Offices 

173
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,680
 just like me. 

174
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,550
I saw your name in the roster of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

175
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,080
You were the Calendrical Official in the Five Offices

176
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,980
of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

177
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,750
The workers told me that you advised Official Chu

178
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,910
about the royal tomb being breached by underground water.

179
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,240
Do you know that the displacement of the late emperor's coffin was caused by the water

180
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,030
and there was no such thing as a haunting?

181
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,860
If you say so, Official.

182
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,580
My opinion doesn't matter at all.

183
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,580
Official, Ji has an odd temper. No need to get mad at him.

184
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:23,740
 Burned in fire, lime will never deteriorate even when soaked in water. 

185
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,030
 To build the royal tomb, we need one portion of lime 

186
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,020
 and three portions of sand and earth. 

187
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,860
 Then add glutinous rice to mix everything well. 

188
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,000
 The wall will remain strong without repeated ramming. 

189
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,840
 This is Sanhe Earth. 

190
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,940
 For making sure a boat or wall is waterproof, 

191
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,840
 we need to mix lime, repeatedly pounded thick silk, 

192
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,240
 fine fabric, tung oil, and fish oil, 

193
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,960
 then add clarified lime water 

194
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,700
 to the paper fibers and apply the mixture. 

195
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,160
 It will be watertight for ages. 

196
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,820
Do you mean Zang Hai knows

197
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,700
that we cut corners when building the royal tomb?

198
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,480
We would never need extra waterproofing work

199
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,200
were it not for the diversion of the You River.

200
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,190
The court has allocated a large amount of money to build the royal tomb.

201
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,680
If they keep digging,

202
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,900
they will know that you embezzled public funds for other purposes.

203
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,680
How about getting rid of him before it is too late?

204
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,510
But my father appreciates his talent.

205
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,270
Your father is a decisive man.

206
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,850
He will not hesitate to remove anyone who threatens you

207
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,070
no matter how he appreciates the man's capability.

208
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,960
Sir, please rest assured. Let me take care of it.

209
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,330
We can get what we want if you and Mr. Yang

210
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,040
can influence your father.

211
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,010
Not just ants. Many bugs hate the juice of Goat Peach Vine.

212
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,000
So, if we add tung oil and fish oil into the mixture

213
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,240
and apply it to the connections between the tile and coffin,

214
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,010
we can make sure the coffin is waterproof and bug-proof.

215
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,790
You know this method, too?

216
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,200
A senior taught me this.

217
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,340
This is a method once used by a friend

218
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,440
in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

219
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,000
The approach was abandoned and used no more.

220
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,870
Why?

221
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,930
Maybe they consider it old and out of fashion.

222
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,200
An effective method never gets old.

223
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,180
It is only updated with different ingredients.

224
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,970
You sound like my old friend.

225
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,960
Could you tell me more about your friend?

226
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,900
He is the former Imperial Astronomer Kuai Duo.

227
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,450
Forgive my ignorance. I've never heard about him.

228
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,690
Where is he now?

229
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,670
Dead.

230
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,110
Like wind or dust,

231
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,390
he's already vanished from the earth.

232
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,040
Such a shame!

233
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,480
What about you?

234
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,680
Why were you demoted to a tomb laborer

235
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,720
from a Calendrical Official in the Five Offices?

236
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,310
It is all because of the degeneration

237
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,120
of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

238
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,680
They only serve the rich and powerful

239
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,660
and bully the weak these days.

240
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,110
What about you?

241
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,130
As a remarkable feng shui master,

242
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,280
why do you work for someone like Chu Huaiming?

243
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,820
I don't work for him.

244
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,800
I work for myself.

245
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,040
   

246
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,260
Sun rises and sets.

247
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,920
Lunar eclipses occur.

248
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,820
The fullness and emptiness of Heaven and Earth, changes with the times.

249
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,730
   

250
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,590
My dear horses. The tiger pee is so hard to get.

251
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,890
You'd better recognize it when you smell it.

252
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,440
What's happened? What's happened?

253
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,160
Sir, the horses are scared of something. They won't move.

254
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,800
What a stunning horse!

255
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,400
It knows how to communicate with humans.

256
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,860
It's all destiny.

257
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,690
Beautiful horse!

258
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,730
- Beautiful horse! 
 - Who are you?

259
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,430
How dare you disturb our master! Are you blind?

260
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,920
I'm blind, indeed.

261
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,110
Stunning horse. Its owner might be extraordinary.

262
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,690
I don't dare to offend you.

263
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,750
I wander around the world.

264
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,550
It's my pleasure to meet a powerful man

265
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,880
on the first day in the capital city.

266
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,590
I can feel the dignified energy near the carriage.

267
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,280
Unstoppable energy is rushing in through the air.

268
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,030
However, I've also noticed a dark force

269
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,240
hovering over the head of this powerful man.

270
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,980
 I'm afraid something bad might happen to you, sir. 

271
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,160
Sir!

272
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,590
- You... 
 - Stop.

273
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,790
What are you talking about?

274
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,640
I don't dare to speak nonsense.

275
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,400
There is a plan for everything in the world.

276
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,690
It's destiny.

277
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,960
The higher you climb, the deeper you fall.

278
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,000
Nonsense!

279
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,730
I can cut your throat right now.

280
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,330
Qu Jiao, let him be.

281
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,660
Let's go.

282
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,290
Let's g.

283
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,960
If you don't do something about it,

284
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,200
I am afraid it will do you harm.

285
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,070
 In mild cases, your official position would be threatened; 

286
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,260
 in severe cases, your life could be at stake. 

287
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,850
   

288
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,350
Sir, don't let his nonsense get into your head.

289
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,620
I will make him disappear right now.

290
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,720
Bring him to me.

291
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,010
Yes, sir.

292
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,830
Since you are a fortune teller,

293
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,900
can you tell me what will happen to you later?

294
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,400
Sir, the rule goes that fortune tellers

295
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,510
cannot predict the future for themselves.

296
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:36,920
Do you know that what you said before gives me enough reason to kill you?

297
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,440
I just speak from my heart and tell you the truth.

298
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,750
I want to help you avert the risk.

299
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,700
Why would you kill me?

300
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,590
What did you say before?

301
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,440
There is a dark force over my head?

302
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,210
Something bad may happen to me?

303
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,400
You are a fraud full of lies.

304
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,000
I have wandered around the world for years

305
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,720
and make a living by fortune telling.

306
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,640
I can earn enough to feed myself.

307
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,160
In addition, I've never met you before.

308
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,000
Why do I make up something ominous to offend you

309
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,590
and get myself killed?

310
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:23,000
Fine. I will give you a chance today.

311
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,510
Yes.

312
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,350
Speak.

313
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,530
If your words make sense, I will let you go.

314
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,710
If you try to fool me,

315
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,270
I can guarantee that you will not leave here alive.

316
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,960
Understood.

317
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,810
Understood.

318
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,550
If you need to see the future,

319
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,110
you have to draw a fortune stick.

320
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,360
I can interpret the result for you.

321
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,070
Sir, which one is it?

322
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,470
The 24th Stick.

323
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,980
The worst one.

324
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,270
As predicted.

325
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,610
Please hear me with patience.

326
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:32,200
We're just a mountain away from each other.

327
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,270
Why do I feel our distances are like life and death?

328
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,440
You climb up high but have no secure habitation.

329
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,330
No peace is found in the mountains, and bad luck comes in threes.

330
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,990
Sir.

331
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,510
The Fortune Stick shows that there is a ghost standing in your way.

332
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,490
As a result, the feng shui in your ancestral tombs have been destroyed.

333
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,170
Make it clearer.

334
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,350
Could you tell me if you were involved

335
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,040
in something that has anything to do with your ancestral tombs?

336
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:10,240
This is the bad thing I am talking about.

337
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,160
If the dead are disturbed and trying to go against you,

338
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
you have to take actions about it.

339
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,720
Otherwise, your political career will be endangered.

340
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,030
Your son may be harmed.

341
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:27,100
You said you can help me avert the risk.

342
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,550
How can you do that?

343
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,260
Please fetch me some burning coals.

344
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,850
Please give me the Fortune Stick you drew earlier.

345
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,660
Thanks, sir.

346
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:47,290
I hereby summon the Queen of the Nine Heavens,

347
00:28:48,920 --> 00:29:00,310
Heaven Master, and the Saint of the North Star come here on auspicious clouds.

348
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:05,660
Appear!

349
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:15,640
Sir, I've summoned the holy spirits to help you turn misfortune into a blessing.

350
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,900
Burn the stick and see what may happen next.

351
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,400
What happened?

352
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,750
Why did the stick jump out of the fire?

353
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,640
Jump out of the fire?

354
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,010
Are you the fate of fire?

355
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,960
When fire encounters fire, change occurs.

356
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,350
Please check the stick.

357
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,220
Is there something different?

358
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,740
The Stick... 
    

359
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,410
Sir.

360
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,790
Marvelous!

361
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,790
Marvelous!

362
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:19,020
The 24th Stick turned into the 46th Stick?

363
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,680
There's a turnaround.

364
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,880
The 46th Stick is "Average".

365
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,070
The fortune note says

366
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,440
"I've been thinking about how to defuse danger.

367
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,200
Don't come close to a sudden disaster.

368
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,790
I'm about to die, but I'm not yet dead.

369
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:36,350
A lucky star falls from the sky and comes to your aid..."

370
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,030
Congratulations, sir!

371
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,030
Why?

372
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:49,510
The stick indicates that there is a lucky star coming to your aid.

373
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:53,030
He will reveal himself on the verge of death.

374
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,220
You will know when the time comes.

375
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,200
Lucky star?

376
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,510
It seems that I am no longer needed here.

377
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,960
Someone will help you defuse the crisis.

378
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,420
It's your destiny.

379
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,440
Wonderful!

380
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,700
Task completed.

381
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,880
Sir, you are fortunate.

382
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,720
It's more difficult for me to make a living out of fortune telling than others.

383
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,590
If you are generous enough to pay me,

384
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,270
- I could use the money to buy some wine... 
 - Pay him.

385
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,580
Thanks, sir.

386
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:38,690
I wish you good luck in your career.

387
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,630
Sir. 
    

388
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,720
Thank you, sir.

389
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:31,627
   

390
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:48,670
The road is treacherous.

391
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:54,410
The bird flies alone from the south to the northern nest.

392
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:00,400
I've seen you before.

393
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,610
We will meet again at the crossroads of life and death.

394
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,610
 Sir, please give me the Fortune Stick. 
   

395
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,840
 Thanks. 

396
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,000
 Sir. 
   

397
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,130
 Burn the stick and see what may happen next. 

398
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,120
   

399
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,016
   

400
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,460
   

401
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,086
   

402
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,760
Come. Bring me a tile.

403
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,090
Stop.

404
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,840
Here.

405
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,860
You're doing it all wrong.

406
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,710
Strain the Goat Peach Vine juice through a sieve.

407
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,960
Like this.

408
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,020
This is how we can use it.

409
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,880
 The Dragon Stone is powered by the water from a river. 

410
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,740
 Once water rises, the door will shut down permanently. 

411
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,480
The project has gone smoothly.

412
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,510
If everything goes right, the royal tomb will be completed on time.

413
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:37,340
Zang Hai is quite capable.

414
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,840
That's true.

415
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,890
Just a few days ago, however, the story of the late emperor's

416
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,210
haunting has reached the ears of the Imperial Inspector.

417
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,550
People are beginning to talk and find someone to blame.

418
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,440
Idiots.

419
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,070
Trouble makers.

420
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,010
Let them talk.

421
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,000
Yes, sir.

422
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,820
But the problem is that your son will be implicated in the incident.

423
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,400
Zang Hai has noticed that the coffin displacement

424
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,000
was caused by the failure of waterproofing work.

425
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,150
Someone is cutting corners.

426
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,630
I knew it was you.

427
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,920
You are so reckless these days.

428
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,000
A new guy can see through your dirty trick.

429
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,030
It's not like this, Father.

430
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:31,900
The funds used to build the royal tomb were embezzled by Eunuch Cao

431
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,590
in the name of building the royal garden.

432
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,510
You knew this.

433
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,940
Has Zang Hai discovered something else?

434
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,480
That's all he knows.

435
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,460
He is a smart guy.

436
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,460
He's supposed to know the Ministry of Works is behind this.

437
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,230
If he is smart, he should know what to say and what not to say.

438
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,110
The key is that it is related to the Eldest Master's safety.

439
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,150
What's your suggestion?

440
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,170
Once the royal tomb is completed,

441
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,670
we need to reward Zang Hai for his hard work.

442
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,510
It's a supreme honor for him

443
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,460
to get buried with the late emperor.

444
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,610
Mr. Chu checked his birth date.

445
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:27,700
He is the perfect candidate for sacrifice, given his birth date.

446
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,490
You've discussed this, right?

447
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,650
Yes, sir.

448
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,100
Do it as you discussed.

449
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,110
No more mistakes are allowed, understand?

450
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,740
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, Father.

451
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,890
Everyone, the royal tomb has been completed.

452
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,840
 - Yeah! 
 - Yeah! 

453
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,230
 We did it! 

454
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,590
 We did it! 

455
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,130
 - Yeah! 
 - Yeah! 

456
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,740
 Nice. 

457
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,440
 - Come on. 
 - It was so close. 

458
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,670
 - Official. 
 - It's been a while... 

459
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,620
Tell us why you know so much at such a young age...

460
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,480
 We can finally go home... 

461
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,280
Are you from a family in the feng shui business?

462
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,150
No.

463
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,510
Since my parents died, I worked with a craftsman for a few years,

464
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:06,460
who is good at designing feng shui layouts for buildings.

465
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,230
Impressive!

466
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,180
It takes at least 10 or 20 years to learn such skills.

467
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,430
Everyone. To Official Zang.

468
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,150
Fill your cups.

469
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,260
Another toast.

470
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,000
Let's get drunk tonight.

471
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,360
- Okay. 
 - Come on.

472
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,550
Everyone. Listen.

473
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,920
Tomorrow, we have to bury the Empress Dowager.

474
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,710
Drink responsibly tonight.

475
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,380
If you want to get drunk, let's do it another day.

476
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,110
No way.

477
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,110
Let's do it tonight.

478
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,490
There is no such day like today.

479
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,880
Come on.

480
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,760
Let's all drink until we drop.

481
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,420
- Let's all drink until we drop. 
 - Let's all drink until we drop.

482
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,880
 - Let's all drink until we drop. 
 - Drink. Drink. 

483
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,100
 - Come on! 
 - Come on! 

484
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,230
- Drink. 
 - Drink.

485
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,590
 Drink. 

486
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,490
Official Chu arrives!

487
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,090
- Official Chu. 
 - Official Chu.

488
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,840
- Official Chu. 
 - Official Chu.

489
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,280
What a lively party!

490
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,710
Come on.

491
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,490
Fill me a cup.

492
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,880
You guys have been working so hard for months.

493
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,840
The lords are satisfied with your efforts.

494
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,150
I will report to the lords and apply rewards for you.

495
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,730
Everyone will be rewarded.

496
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,690
 - Yeah! 
 - Yeah! 

497
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,250
 - Thanks, Official. 
 - Thanks, Official Chu! 

498
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,510

Eight craftsmen in total.

508
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,860
I've reported to the Emperor that your birth dates are compatible

509
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,660
with the late emperor and Empress Dowager.

510
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,720
You're willing to get buried with the dead, right?

511
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,590
Yes. We're willing to sacrifice ourselves.

512
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,230
According to the rules, I have to ask again.

513
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,480
Is there anyone who has changed their mind?

514
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,840
Speak now, and you'll be pardoned for deceiving the emperor.

515
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,650
Once I submit the report, there is no room for regret.

516
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,960
Official,

517
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,920
can you keep your promise?

518
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,070
Of course.

519
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,820
You have my word.

520
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,760
Official Chu, please keep your promise.

521
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,110
Help me cure my daughter.

522
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,960
Don't forget to take care of my family.

523
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,280
Since you're willing to sacrifice yourselves for the late emperor and Empress Dowager,

524
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,230
the court will grant a large amount of money to your families.

525
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,030
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau will remember you.

526
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,590
The court will remember you.

527
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:58,220
I, Chu Huaiming, will remember you even more.

528
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,920
Official,

529
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,670
we're going to die soon.

530
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,920
We may get drunk and make fools of ourselves later.

531
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,590
Please leave.

532
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:18,000
You can count on us.

533
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,320
No hurry.

534
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,360
I came here for one more thing.

535
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,420
Zang Hai, the Emperor has spoken.

536
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,960
Zang Hai, Assistant Supervisor of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

537
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,550
is hereby honored for reinforcing the royal tomb, delivering hard work and high achievement.

538
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:45,030
As he is a man of great talent and a compatible birth date by astrology,

539
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,550
he is authorized to send the Empress Dowager's coffin for burial

540
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,110
and reside in the royal tomb permanently.

00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,280
