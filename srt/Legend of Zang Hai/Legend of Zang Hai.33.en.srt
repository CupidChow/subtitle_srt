00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,860
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,930
His Majesty flew into a rage in court today.

4
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,380
I fear he has already learned of the stolen Gui Seal.

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,690
And the Queen of Dongxia suddenly died last night.

6
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,050
In this world,

7
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,100
such coincidences do not exist.

8
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,410
The Hostage's Mansion is heavily guarded by the Imperial Guards.

9
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,100
It seems His Majesty not only knows about the theft

10
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,770
but also suspects the people of Dongxia.

11
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,490
And Cao Jingxian has had the seal.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,100
Now we're in trouble.

13
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,290
Cao Jingxian did not show up today.

14
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,210
His injuries are quite serious.

15
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,660
He won't make a move anytime soon.

16
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,820
What matters most now

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,690
is to find a way to clear Antu of suspicion.

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,410
If you are right about His Majesty's stance,

19
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,380
I fear we are powerless.

20
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,810
Your Highness,

21
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,980
please don't dwell

22
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,170
and go inside.

23
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,170
You're still recovering.

24
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,900
I've lived here for ten years.

25
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,930
I used to despise this place.

26
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,290
But now, I won't be able to see it much longer.

27
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,340
[Hostage's Mansion]

28
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,410
You're here.

29
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,220
I...

30
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,540
have obtained it.

31
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,980
But I...

32
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,980
am no longer going to make it.

33
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,100
We've planned this for so long.

34
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,220
Yet I didn't expect

35
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,460
that the one to have the last laugh

36
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,290
would be you.

37
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,140
In that case,

38
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,410
from here on,

39
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,410
I'll leave everything to you.

40
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,580
You may go now.

41
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,540
Zang Hai,

42
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,660
what do we do now?

43
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,660
The Imperial Guards have surrounded the mansion for days.

44
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,730
Have you seen Antu at all?

45
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,660
How is she doing?

46
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,850
News from the mansion has been sealed off.

47
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,410
Not to mention seeing her,

48
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,580
we can't even find out how she is.

49
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,590
Don't panic just yet.

50
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,460
Nothing has been concluded now.

51
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,460
But I fear this situation

52
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,730
won't last for long.

53
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,010
I'll go beg my father

54
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,130
to find a way for me to see Antu.

55
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,700
Don't.

56
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,650
The mansion is heavily guarded.

57
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,220
There's no chance of sneaking in.

58
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,180
Even if your father is willing to help,

59
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,820
matters will only become

60
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,820
more complicated and backfire.

61
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,130
By that time,

62
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,490
not only will we fail to help her,

63
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,890
but your entire family might get implicated.

64
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,300
How will she endure it all alone?

65
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,180
Don't worry.

66
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,070
I'll do everything I can

67
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,650
to get her out of danger.

68
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,360
Sir.

69
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,530
What is it?

70
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,010
The Surveillance Office sent this letter to us.

71
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,420
The Surveillance Office?

72
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,730
Was it Mr. Cao's order?

73
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,340
Indeed.

74
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,370
These appear to be secret letters from Dongxia's hostage.

75
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,940
Ready my horse.

76
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,460
I must go and see His Majesty.

77
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,130
Yes, sir.

78
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,890
Sir.

79
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,370
Sir.

80
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,820
Something happened.

81
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,610
What is it?

82
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,650
We went into town and found Zhen Tower surrounded by the Imperial Guards.

83
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,370
They said that the owner of Zhen Tower was the hostage princess

84
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,180
and had worked to sow discord

85
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,610
between Dongxia and the Great Yong.

86
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,700
Another squad of guards is heading for the Hostage's Mansion.

87
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,850
This is bad.

88
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,420
It's the Princess of Dongxia.

89
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,250
What happened to her?

90
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,850
Haven't you heard?

91
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,850
The Queen of Dongxia just died.

92
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,460
Rumor has it the princess killed her.

93
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,060
Killed her mother?

94
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,580
How utterly ruthless.

95
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,850
- Look! - They're out!

96
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,220
Halt!

97
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,980
Who are you?

98
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,700
Step back!

99
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,180
Move.

100
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,850
I've received word.

101
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,180
After the Queen's death,

102
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,410
a new Queen has ascended the throne.

103
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,340
It's Miss Xiang's elder sister,

104
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,460
Mingxiang Yinzhu.

105
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,940
Somehow,

106
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,700
The Surveillance Officers found evidence

107
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,220
of Miss Xiang's attempts over the past decade

108
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,770
to incite conflict between Dongxia and the Great Yong

109
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,180
and submitted it to His Majesty.

110
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,850
They claimed she resented being made a hostage

111
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,980
and bore hatred in her heart.

112
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,250
These are all false accusations.

113
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,250
Cao Jingxian knew His Majesty was going to investigate the Gui Seal

114
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,770
and set this trap.

115
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,730
And the newly crowned Queen

116
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,820
has outright revoked Miss Xiang's royal status.

117
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,250
She formally requested His Majesty

118
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,940
to handle this in the Great Yong,

119
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,700
saying Dongxia wouldn't intervene.

120
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,100
In other words,

121
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,530
Dongxia abandoned her.

122
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,010
In essence, yes.

123
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,010
Though gravely wounded,

124
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,340
Cao Jingxian still has such power.

125
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,580
The Queen is dead.

126
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,420
He has the Gui Seal.

127
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,300
Antu and I are the first ones he'll eliminate.

128
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,980
What do we do?

129
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,100
Should we go and rescue Miss Xiang?

130
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,100
Do not act recklessly.

131
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,730
If we make any move,

132
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,250
it may bring her certain death.

133
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,770
Is there no way out of this?

134
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,580
Master,

135
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,340
please forge a writ from the Office of Scrutiny for Justice for me.

136
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,980
You're entering the Imperial Prison?

137
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,130
No...

138
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,580
Absolutely not.

139
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,580
Hai,

140
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,220
you have a sensitive identity.

141
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,530
This is dangerous.

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,820
I won't act recklessly. I've yet to avenge.

143
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,100
Please help me this time.

144
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,650
But the seal

145
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,890
is not so easily forged.

146
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,100
But you are certainly capable of it.

147
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,730
It doesn't need to be perfect.

148
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,100
It only needs to fool the prison guards.

149
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,980
But if there's even a minor misstep,

150
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,010
neither of you will make it out.

151
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,650
Hai,

152
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,980
what exactly are you planning to do?

153
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,220
What I'll say next is very important.

154
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,010
Don't ask why.

155
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,820
Just do as I say.

156
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,180
And make sure nothing goes wrong.

157
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,610
Today,

158
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,980
I'll take this forged writ

159
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,980
to see Xiang Antu.

160
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,980
I know nothing

161
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,060
about her situation.

162
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,340
So I must see her as soon as possible.

163
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,980
What you must do

164
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,890
is wait for me at home.

165
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,610
No matter how late it gets.

166
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,300
Once I return,

167
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,460
we must immediately devise a plan

168
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,770
to rescue her.

169
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,850
Time is of the essence.

170
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,580
She may face danger as early as tomorrow.

171
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,980
We might only have a few hours left

172
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,730
to save her.

173
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,460
Master,

174
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,060
please trust me.

175
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,890
We will rescue Antu.

176
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,340
You may leave.

177
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,250
Yes, sir.

178
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:31,980
Zang Hai.

179
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,580
I'm sorry that you suffer.

180
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,340
Why are you here?

181
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,180
Don't do anything foolish for me.

182
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,220
Don't worry.

183
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,130
I came here fair and square.

184
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,220
Did the Emperor allow you to participate in the case?

185
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,730
No.

186
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,220
This is fake.

187
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,580
You are insane.

188
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,370
Forging official documents is tantamount to deceiving the Emperor.

189
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,700
They'll find out when verifying it in the morning.

190
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,130
You must leave the Capital now.

191
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,300
Don't worry about me.

192
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,940
I've taken this step.

193
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,610
There's no turning back.

194
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,010
To Dongxia,

195
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,220
I am already a discarded figure.

196
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,730
Death is all but certain for me now.

197
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,610
I won't let you die.

198
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,580
You will leave here safely.

199
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,820
The Emperor detained me

200
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,010
because he suspected Dongxia had taken the Gui Seal.

201
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,180
If the seal isn't recovered,

202
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,850
he will not rest.

203
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,650
If I leave,

204
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,770
he'll simply take it out on Dongxia.

205
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,010
My sister has only just ascended the throne.

206
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,460
Her foundation is still weak.

207
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,180
If war breaks out between the nations,

208
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,530
Dongxia will face utter destruction.

209
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,180
Don't worry.

210
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,140
I've had a plan.

211
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,570
Don't do anything more for me.

212
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,620
While you can still escape,

213
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,570
leave quickly.

214
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,250
I've lost too many loved ones.

215
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,700
Now,

216
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,460
I cannot lose you too.

217
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,810
Wait for me.

218
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,980
Mr. Sun.

219
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,620
Mr. Zang,

220
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,620
it's so late.

221
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,700
His Majesty has retired for the night.

222
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,980
If there's anything,

223
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,090
please speak of it during court tomorrow.

224
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,050
Mr. Sun,

225
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,770
I have a matter of utmost urgency

226
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,490
and must see His Majesty at once.

227
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,140
I ask that you announce me.

228
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,250
Mr. Gao,

229
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,620
Mr. Zang left you a letter.

230
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,530
When?

231
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,860
He gave it to me before he left.

232
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,180
He specifically instructed me to deliver it to you at this time.

233
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,730
What is Hai trying to do?

234
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,490
Master,

235
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,010
what I told you

236
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,090
was both truth and falsehood.

237
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,330
I will do everything I can to save her.

238
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,530
But I must go alone.

239
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,570
I will confess everything to His Majesty.

240
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,250
You know what that means.

241
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,050
Tonight, you must flee the mansion and hide.

242
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,730
If I fail,

243
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,380
please take Guanfeng and Shilei and flee far away.

244
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,420
If she and I return together tomorrow,

245
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,380
then we shall meet again.

246
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,290
What did Hai say?

247
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,380
He fooled us all.

248
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,620
He went alone to save Miss Xiang.

249
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,380
That's so dangerous.

250
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,730
We must go help him.

251
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,900
We may no longer be able to.

252
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,290
Hai is making a perilous move,

253
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,660
risking death to save a life.

254
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,290
He wanted us to stay out of it

255
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,620
so that he could proceed without worry.

256
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,020
[Hanzhang Hall]

257
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,460
Mr. Zang, we've arrived.

258
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,980
Mr. Zang,

259
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,220
please.

260
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,940
Your Majesty,

261
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,250
Mr. Zang has arrived.

262
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,800
I hereby come to confess my crime, Your Majesty.

263
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,250
Zang Hai, Vice Minister of Works,

264
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,330
what crime have you committed?

265
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,730
Speak.

266
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,090
The item Your Majesty lost...

267
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,660
Silence!

268
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,090
Guards!

269
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,660
Tie him up.

270
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,660
Yes.

271
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,530
Now leave.

272
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,520
Yes.

273
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,940
Now you may speak.

274
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,420
A few days ago,

275
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,660
I, without permission,

276
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,810
entered Your Majesty's Hanzhang Hall

277
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,530
and unlocked the mechanism

278
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,050
in the side hall

279
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,730
to take the Gui Seal.

280
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,530
Zang Hai,

281
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,870
how dare you!

282
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,250
Where is the seal?

283
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,460
Your Majesty,

284
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,810
the seal is now with Cao Jingxian.

285
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,490
That night,

286
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,760
I brought the seal back to the Astronomical Bureau,

287
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,930
but Cao Jingxian took it.

288
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,460
Deceiving the Emperor is punishable by death.

289
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,770
Your Majesty,

290
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,420
it is a capital crime,

291
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,290
and stealing the Gui Seal even more so.

292
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,620
I have confessed everything.

293
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,470
I could not possibly be deceiving Your Majesty further.

294
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,140
Why should I believe you?

295
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,810
There is one more reason.

296
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,290
That day in the hall,

297
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,010
I saw a wooden carving

298
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,860
signed with Deer

299
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,860
and Goose.

300
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,940
Only then did I realize

301
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,180
my father and Your Majesty

302
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,220
once shared a deep bond.

303
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,940
So I have come today,

304
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,380
daring to ask Your Majesty to honor that past bond.

305
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,810
Your father?

306
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,940
Who are you?

307
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,380
I was once called...

308
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,010
Zhinu.

309
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,330
I am the son of Kuai Duo,

310
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,290
the former Imperial Astronomer.

311
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,770
Ten years ago,

312
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,860
all fourteen members of my family

313
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,490
were slaughtered.

314
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,660
I alone survived.

315
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,770
I returned to the Capital

316
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,140
for revenge.

317
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,380
Raise your head.

318
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,700
How can you prove you are Zhinu?

319
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,980
When I was a child,

320
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,620
my father often fiddled

321
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,900
with a wooden deer sculpture.

322
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,940
I asked him about it.

323
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,620
He only said,

324
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,530
"In the jungle,

325
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,700
you never know exactly

326
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,420
what beast is spying on you from behind the leaves."

327
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,290
But he told me,

328
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,050
"I hope it'll be a deer you meet in your most treacherous moments

329
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,140
in the future."

330
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,250
Where is that deer sculpture now?

331
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,010
It burned with the mansion

332
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,980
the night my family was slaughtered.

333
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,700
Your father bought you this life.

334
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,010
Rise.

335
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,360
- Thank you, Your Majesty. - Sun Defang!

336
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,290
Your Majesty.

337
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,570
Send people to Cao's Mansion at once.

338
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,700
Do not let anyone leave the premises.

339
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,220
Search every corner of it.

340
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,860
Who are your enemies?

342
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,400
Zhuang Luyin,

343
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,250
Cao Jingxian.

344
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,360
There is one more, whom I have yet to identify.

345
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,420
So,

346
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,980
Zhuang Luyin and Cao Jingxian

347
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,490
had recent downfalls

348
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
all because of you?

349
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,420
So to find this unknown person,

350
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,700
you stole my Gui Seal.

351
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,010
Your Majesty,

352
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,620
the three of them killed my entire family

353
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,220
all because of the seal.

354
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,140
Thus, only through it

355
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,490
can I uncover the third one.

356
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:46,620
But…

357
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,010
But you neither found the third one

358
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,620
nor kept the Gui Seal.

359
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,940
So all these years,

360
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,700
they've been searching for the Gui Seal.

361
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,330
Zhuang Luyin,

362
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,460
after massacring my family,

363
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,290
was not content to leave empty-handed.

364
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,480
He even flayed my parents

365
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,660
and hung their skins in the mansion's cellar.

366
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,220
He then had Chu Huaiming use his position

367
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,660
to search for the seal everywhere.

368
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,220
As for Cao Jingxian, he used the Surveillance Office

369
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,090
to track any trace of it.

370
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,570
Years ago,

371
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,220
he even placed his adopted son in the Astronomical Bureau as a spy

372
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,460
until I eventually brought the seal out.

373
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,320
Had they known from the start

374
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,140
that the seal was in Your Majesty's hands,

375
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,770
perhaps all this could have been avoided.

376
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,810
Are you blaming me

377
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,300
for not announcing to the world

378
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,380
that I possessed the Gui Seal,

379
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,180
which led to your family's slaughter

380
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,420
and many more deaths?

381
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,700
I dare not.

382
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,220
Zang Hai,

383
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,660
you are too naive.

384
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,290
Even if I had made it public,

385
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,660
they would not have stopped.

386
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,940
Would Your Majesty be willing to enlighten me?

387
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,090
You wish to know

388
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,900
what truly happened?

389
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,250
I've relentlessly pursued

390
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,380
the third enemy.

391
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,250
If Your Majesty would reveal the truth to me,

392
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,620
perhaps I may finally identify the third one.

393
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,700
Can you craft birdcages?

394
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,520
I met your father

395
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,290
when I was still a prince.

396
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,940
I was fond of woodworking and carpentry.

397
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,330
The late emperor doted on me

398
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,290
and allowed Kuai Duo...

399
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,940
- Your Highness. - to be my study companion.

400
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,900
Your Highness.

401
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,050
Kuai Duo inherited his family's craftsmanship

402
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,940
and became

403
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,090
my dearest friend in childhood.

404
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,810
Those were

405
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,530
my most unforgettable days.

406
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,380
With Kuai Duo by my side,

407
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,060
[Deer, Wild Goose, the 15th year of Wuhe]
I tasted

408
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,570
the joys of a commoner's life.

409
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,180
In the 20th year of Wuhe,

410
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,460
the long battle for the crown prince's seat

411
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,460
finally came to an end.

412
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,220
The one chosen by the late emperor

413
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,220
was not Prince Yan, the legitimate eldest son,

414
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,640
nor Prince Qi, who was virtuous and capable,

415
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,660
but me, a prince born of a concubine and motherless.

416
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,290
In reverent accordance with the initial decree,

417
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,220
following the rites and respecting the will of the people,

418
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,980
I solemnly informed Heaven and Earth and bestowed the golden book

419
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,010
to establish the crown prince, continuing the legacy of generations.

420
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:56,860
From then on,

421
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,900
I could no longer pursue carpentry.

422
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,730
Instead, I was taught the arts of rulership by the Crown Prince's tutor.

423
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,380
[Deer, Wild Goose, the 20th year of Wuhe]
Kuai Duo entered the Astronomical Bureau

424
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,570
to learn from his father.

425
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,940
Being born into an imperial family

426
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,420
brings no peace.

427
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,050
At the time,

428
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,980
I had yet to understand

429
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,250
what fate lay ahead.

430
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,220
In the 35th year of Wuhe,

431
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,730
Dongxia stirred trouble at the borders, posing a threat of invasion to us.

432
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,010
The late emperor resolved to personally lead a campaign against Dongxia.

433
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,660
As Crown Prince,

434
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,490
I remained in the Capital to oversee state affairs.

435
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,860
The army sent back frequent reports of victory.

436
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,810
The entire capital rejoiced in triumph.

437
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,420
Yet within the palace,

438
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,460
a silent conspiracy targeting me was brewing.

439
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,620
Your Highness.

440
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,700
Your Highness!

441
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,960
What's the matter, Your Highness?

442
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,770
Your Highness, Your...

443
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,010
Someone! Summon the imperial physician!

444
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,330
Summon the imperial physician!

445
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,250
Sir,

446
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,980
bad news!

447
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,250
The Imperial Academy of Medicine reports

448
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,770
that the Empress suffers from another migraine

449
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,350
and has all physicians summoned to Her Majesty.

450
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,090
What?

451
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,700
Your Highness.

452
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,050
Your Highness.

453
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,940
Please hold there.

454
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,730
I shall seek a physician from outside the palace now.

455
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,250
Your Highness?

456
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,140
Help me

457
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,420
find a person...

458
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,570
Kuai Duo...

459
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,810
Kuai Duo...

460
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,010
Go.

461
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,530
Yes, Your Highness.

462
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,330
Your Highness, please hold there.

463
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,170
The poisoning was recent.

464
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,340
There was still time for treatment.

465
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,570
But I fear

466
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,090
the enemy may have more schemes in motion.

467
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,010
Mr. Sun,

468
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,460
ask the Imperial Guards

469
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,690
to send more troops over.

470
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,610
But the guards have all been dispatched

471
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,010
to Shenwu Gate for night duty tonight.

472
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,650
Sun Defang.

473
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,690
Yes.

474
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,610
Go to the Five Armies Camp

475
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,300
and find Xue Zhao.

476
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,650
Have him bring men to protect the throne.

477
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,610
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,380
Being born into an imperial family

479
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,210
brings no peace.

480
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,380
You are right.

481
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,300
They failed to poison me,

482
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,740
and they will come again to kill me.

483
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,300
Very likely tonight.

484
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,380
Go home.

485
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,860
Leave.

486
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,650
Don't stay here and die for nothing.

487
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,820
Go.

488
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,860
Rest assured, Your Highness.

489
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,050
I will not let them harm you again.

490
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,260
Soldiers, heed my command!

491
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,880
[Hanzhang Hall]

492
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,900
His Highness is in danger.

493
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,900
Hurry to the front gate and defend it!

494
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,010
Yes!

495
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,860
[Hanzhang Hall]

496
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,130
Where is His Highness?

497
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,570
I request an audience!

498
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,090
Who are you?

499
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,940
What is your purpose?

500
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,420
I'm under orders to deliver His Majesty's final edict to His Highness.

501
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,170
Your Highness,

502
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,260
His Majesty has passed.

503
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,780
By the late Emperor's edict,

504
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,820
the Crown Prince shall ascend the throne!

505
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,940
[Final Imperial Edict]

506
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,740
Your father saved my life.

507
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,260
Your father

508
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,050
was the one I trusted most.

509
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,420
The Great Yong army collapsed overnight.

510
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,300
The late Emperor fell ill from grief and died at the border.

511
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,900
All of this stemmed from the Gui Seal.

512
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,260
The last command

513
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,010
the late Emperor gave me before his death

514
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,010
was to seize the seal.

515
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,690
[Final Edict: Seize the Gui Seal]
I first ascended the throne,

516
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,010
and my rule was unstable.

517
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,050
Thus, I had to plant my own man in the Directorate of Ceremonial.

518
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,820
And that man was Cao Jingxian.

519
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,900
The second thing I had to do

520
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,300
was win a great battle,

521
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,860
to wash away the shame of the Great Yong.

522
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,690
Dongxia defeated us with the Gui Seal,

523
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,490
but their queen died soon after,

524
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,820
and the seal vanished.

525
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,530
Following Cao Jingxian's advice,

526
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,050
I appointed Zhuang Luyin, who was guarding the frontier.

527
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,130
Our army sharpened its blades

528
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,940
and marched again on Dongxia.

529
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,210
This time,

530
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,650
Dongxia, without the Gui Seal,

531
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,900
finally bowed to us.

532
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,420
The third thing I did

533
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,420
was secretly send your father

534
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,900
to Mount Dansui in Dongxia to search for the seal,

535
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,820
under the guise of overseeing the Fengshan Altar's construction.

536
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,170
I knew

537
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,980
your father would never disappoint me.

538
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,610
And I waited for three long years.

539
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,460
One night in the ninth year of Zhenshun,

540
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,300
your father returned.

541
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,300
Your Majesty,

542
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,130
Mr. Kuai has returned.

543
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,940
I, Kuai Duo,

544
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,210
greet Your Majesty.

545
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,420
Rise, please.

546
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,570
Your Majesty,

547
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,900
I retrieved it.

548
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,460
Is this the Gui Seal?

549
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,420
Indeed.

550
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,740
How can such a small thing

551
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,530
control the ghost soldiers?

552
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,570
I haven't seen it in action.

553
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,460
I've only heard of its immense power.

554
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,820
Dongxia once possessed it,

555
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,610
but they are now subject to us.

556
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,940
As the ancients said,

557
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,490
fortune and misfortune go hand in hand.

558
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,090
I do not know

559
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,980
which one it will bring.

560
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,940
How is this thing used?

561
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,260
Your Majesty,

562
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,900
I...

563
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,260
do not know either.

564
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,720
Do you know

565
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,480
what it feels like

566
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,490
to hold this in your hand?

567
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,050
I no longer fear anyone.

568
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,010
The world is now within my grasp!

569
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,380
Your Majesty,

570
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,490
you are Heaven's chosen.

571
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,010
Even without it,

572
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,170
the entire world

573
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,090
would still belong to you.

574
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,170
You don't understand.

575
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,170
Without this

576
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,610
in a few years,

577
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,420
you might be calling someone else

578
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:35,530
Heaven's chosen.

579
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,010
Your Majesty...

580
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,980
I was merely making a joke.

581
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,300
Rise.

582
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,050
In the end,

583
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,010
you still don't wish me

584
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,740
to possess this item, do you?

585
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,570
I dare not.

586
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,740
You are not unaware

587
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,170
of the tragedies from years past.

588
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,090
If Dongxia uses this again

589
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,420
to wage war against us,

590
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,300
you

591
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,210
will regret it,

592
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,860
and so will I.

593
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,090
A state's deadly weapon

594
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,050
must not be revealed.

595
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,010
A ruler's weakness

596
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,050
must not be exposed.

597
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,650
But Mr. Kuai,

598
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,130
you truly know

599
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,740
