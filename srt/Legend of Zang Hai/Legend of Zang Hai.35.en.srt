00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,620
Mr. Zhao.

4
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,460
You...

5
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,660
Do you remember this?

6
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,450
I took it from you

7
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,730
the night I rescued you.

8
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,410
I always intended

9
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,570
to return it to you

10
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,130
when we could finally meet face-to-face.

11
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,260
Back then, the situation was too uncertain,

12
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,890
so I didn't dare reveal myself to you.

13
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,940
I kept

14
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,610
my identity from you all these years

15
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,500
because I feared our connection

16
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,940
would be exposed

17
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,450
and put your entire revenge plan at risk.

18
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,980
But

19
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,010
now that you've come this far,

20
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,100
I should no longer remain hidden.

21
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,820
This time, it's only right I stand by your side.

22
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,220
Sir,

23
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,660
please accept my deepest gratitude.

24
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,040
Finally, we meet openly.

25
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,020
In the first year of the Zhenshun era,

26
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,540
I was promoted to Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

27
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,490
and your father was already serving as the Imperial Astronomer.

28
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,850
That year, a major construction corruption case broke out.

29
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,220
I petitioned the Emperor to launch a full investigation.

30
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,220
But the case involved many high-ranking officials.

31
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,580
I was framed,

32
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,140
and your father was the only one

33
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,810
who spoke up in court to defend me.

34
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,730
Because he risked his own position to help me,

35
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,140
I got off

36
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,780
with nothing more than a demotion.

37
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,410
That day, I swore

38
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,540
to repay his kindness, whatever the cost.

39
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,460
Ever since then,

40
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,020
we'd kept in touch through letters.

41
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,930
Far away from the Capital,

42
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,780
I relied

43
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,410
on your father's letters to keep up with court affairs.

44
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,730
Thanks to him, I made notable achievements even while demoted.

45
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,410
In the fifth year of Zhenshun,

46
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,540
I returned to the Capital and resumed my former post.

47
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,610
In the sixth year,

48
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,020
your father was sent to Dongxia to oversee Fengshan Altar's construction.

49
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,020
From then on,

50
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,250
we never saw each other again,

51
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,580
but our correspondence continued.

52
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,540
Three years later,

53
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,730
while I was in Yuezhou handling disaster relief,

54
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,370
I received a secret letter from him.

55
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,370
He wanted to flee the Capital with his family

56
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,370
and asked for my help.

57
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,660
I had assumed the altar collapse

58
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,660
had taken his life,

59
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,140
but, to my surprise,

60
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,780
he was still alive.

61
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,610
Though he didn't tell me exactly what happened,

62
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,980
his words revealed his anxiety and fear.

63
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,900
I rushed to his residence through the night,

64
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,020
but I was still too late.

65
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,780
By the time I arrived, his residence had already become a sea of flames.

66
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,140
All I could do

67
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,140
was rescue his son

68
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,930
and make plans for the future.

69
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,370
I took you to Qingquan Town

70
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,580
laid out a plan for your revenge,

71
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,540
and left you in Xing Dou and Gao Ming's care.

72
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,490
Thank you, Master.

73
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,930
That was the last thing I could do

74
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,930
for your father.

75
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,220
Sir,

76
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,460
thank you.

77
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,170
It's been ten years. You're finally ready.

78
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,290
There's much work ahead.

79
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,810
First, we need to find out

80
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,410
whether Shi Yiping is truly involved.

81
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,220
I'll have someone send a visiting card,

82
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,850
and I'll accompany you to the Shi residence to investigate.

83
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,100
[Zang Residence]

84
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,700
Mr. Zhao finally told you the truth.

85
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,980
I'd been dying to tell you myself.

86
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,770
When you went to visit him,

87
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,250
I already wanted to tell you

88
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,490
you shouldn't bother, and that he was your benefactor.

89
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,610
But he insisted

90
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,890
it was too soon.

91
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,340
And he said he just wanted

92
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,100
to give you a bit of guidance.

93
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,940
So, Master,

94
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,940
can you tell me

95
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,370
how you all came to know him now?

96
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,700
Sure.

97
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,850
Mr. Zhao and Xing Dou met

98
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,300
back when he was demoted.

99
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,420
Xing Dou was wealthy

100
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,730
but uptight and eccentric.

101
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,890
He offended an official,

102
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,770
got framed, and ended up with a death sentence.

103
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,340
Mr. Zhao stepped in and saved him.

104
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,060
My story's different.

105
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,460
I was an orphan

106
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,220
raised on scraps from kind strangers.

107
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,730
Mr. Zhao took me in

108
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,060
and gave me

109
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,370
the chance to make something of myself.

110
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,420
What about Master Liuchu?

111
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,250
Her story's not mine to tell.

112
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,650
But let's just say

113
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,250
she, too, owes Mr. Zhao.

114
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,580
If you're upset

115
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,490
I kept this from you, I don't blame you.

116
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,700
But sometimes,

117
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,700
a lie told with good intentions

118
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,980
isn't always a bad thing.

119
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,940
Master,

120
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,700
you're the person I trust the most.

121
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,610
As you know,

122
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,130
there are

123
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,530
very few people in this world

124
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,530
I'd trust unconditionally.

125
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,940
Like I always say,

126
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,340
nothing matters more than staying alive.

127
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,370
I never would've guessed

128
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,610
Tong'er's father is your benefactor.

129
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,700
Maybe the whole Mr. Eight persona

130
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,010
was inspired by her father.

131
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,250
You may be right about that.

132
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,340
Now that you have the Emperor's backing

133
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,770
and Mr. Zhao on your side,

134
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,770
I doubt it'll be long before you get your revenge.

135
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,420
Things are still far from clear.

136
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,130
We mustn't let our guard down.

137
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,010
Be careful when you visit the Shi Residence.

138
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,580
Even if you uncover something,

139
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,180
don't act rashly.

140
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,850
Don't worry.

141
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,610
I'll be careful.

142
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,700
[Shi Residence]

143
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:54,890
Greetings, Mr. Zhao.

144
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,980
Sirs, please have a seat.

145
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,940
I'll go inform my master.

146
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,940
Mr. Shi.

147
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,250
Mr. Shi.

148
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,850
We're all colleagues in court,

149
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,980
and Mr. Zhao and I both serve in the Cabinet.

150
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,530
There's no need for formalities.

151
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,770
Mr. Zang,

152
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,940
this is your first time

153
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,100
visiting me since taking office, isn't it?

154
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,700
I never thought someone as upright as Mr. Zhao

155
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,130
would take you under his wing.

156
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,980
Since my appointment,

157
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,010
I've yet to pay my respects to you.

158
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,420
That's my oversight.

159
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,420
Zang Hai was just appointed Vice Minister of Works.

160
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,770
I brought him here today to introduce him

161
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,770
and ask that you offer him some guidance moving forward.

162
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,490
You're being too modest, Mr. Zhao.

163
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,340
When it comes to spotting talent,

164
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,890
no one in the Capital does it better than you.

165
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,980
I'm

166
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,490
getting old.

167
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,370
In a few more years,

168
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,580
I'll likely retire to my hometown.

169
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,370
The Ministry of Revenue controls the purse strings.

170
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,100
If I left, the court wouldn't miss me.

171
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,250
But if you stepped down, that'd be a real loss.

172
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,820
You flatter me.

173
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,700
Mr. Shi, please don't say that.

174
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,740
The Great Yong can't afford to lose someone like you.

175
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,530
Aside from His Majesty,

176
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,010
no one is indispensable.

177
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,530
Zhuang Luyin won countless battles

178
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,940
but still died by his own son's sword.

179
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,650
Cao Jingxian once had great sway in court,

180
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,850
but he too met a sudden end.

181
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,940
When water overflows, it spills. When the moon is full, it wanes.

182
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,850
A man in office must never forget that.

183
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,730
Wise words, sir.

184
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,770
Zang Hai,

185
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,650
I heard the Emperor gave you the Sword of Justice

186
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,700
and tasked you with investigating Cao Jingxian's death.

187
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,180
Are you here today

188
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,940
because you suspect the Cabinet?

189
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,730
The Cabinet drafts the Emperor's replies

190
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,730
and handles many state secrets.

191
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,980
Do you really intend to probe into that?

192
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:29,890
With respect, Mr. Shi,

193
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,010
I don't have any leads yet.

194
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,730
But I cannot defy the Emperor's orders.

195
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,250
Since I've accepted the Sword of Justice,

196
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,250
I will see this through.

197
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,610
This case is full of strange details.

198
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,580
Zang Hai simply hopes to hear your perspective.

199
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,460
Mr. Zhao,

200
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,460
you truly are a fine judge of talent.

201
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,220
With such resolve,

202
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,290
Zang Hai may well serve

203
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,810
in the Cabinet one day.

204
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,420
He's still young

205
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,940
and can be impulsive.

206
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,220
I'll make sure he visits often,

207
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,460
so you can help

208
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,050
shape him.

209
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,380
The younger generation is full of promise.

210
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,050
I think you've

211
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,290
underestimated him.

212
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,770
Zang Hai,

213
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,330
pursue your investigation as you see fit. You have my full support.

214
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,050
Thank you, sir.

215
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,620
Mr. Shi certainly acted like he had nothing to hide,

216
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,290
letting us investigate the Cabinet without resistance.

217
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,620
He's trying to turn you into a blade

218
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,900
that cuts into the Cabinet for him.

219
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,730
So he's ready to start consolidating power.

220
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,620
He won't make

221
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,700
any overt moves.

222
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,360
Instead, he plans to use me to tighten his grip

223
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,290
without getting his hands dirty.

224
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,980
I've worked alongside him for years.

225
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,090
I've seen him silence or sideline

226
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,490
countless officials, both openly and in secret.

227
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,990
He even used that list you submitted

228
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,410
from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

229
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,620
to stir up trouble.

230
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,900
There's also been long-standing friction

231
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,420
between Cao Jingxian's Surveillance Office and the Cabinet.

232
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,620
But Shi Yiping's attitude

233
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,770
toward Cao had always been

234
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,380
inconsistent.

235
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,050
Their relationship swung

236
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,770
between open conflict and quiet collusion.

237
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,050
By the way, sir,

238
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,140
I've heard Mr. Shi

239
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,090
has a well-known fondness for paintings.

240
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,490
I did notice that the front hall of his residence

241
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,050
was lined with valuable pieces.

242
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,380
Some of them looked

243
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,290
like the ones I'd seen on the market just recently.

244
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,010
Now that you mention it,

245
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,490
I recall something odd.

246
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,220
The prices of calligraphy and paintings in the Capital

247
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,140
have nearly doubled lately,

248
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,940
while antiques and jade have dropped in value.

249
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,980
Sounds like people are using artwork

250
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,730
to get in Mr. Shi's good graces.

251
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,810
If that's the case,

252
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,490
I'll pay him another visit tonight.

253
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,490
I'll bring a fine painting as a gift

254
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,290
and make it seem like I'm eager to build a closer relationship.

255
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,010
That way, he'll lower his guard,

256
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,940
and I can probe deeper.

257
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,860
Greetings, Mr. Zang.

258
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,660
It's quite late.

259
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,660
Is something urgent?

260
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,050
I visited earlier rather hastily and came empty-handed.

261
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,770
This time, I've brought two paintings and would like

262
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,530
to ask Mr. Shi for an inscription.

263
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,010
Please come with me, sir.

264
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,420
"Autumn Colors Among Streams and Mountains."

265
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,730
"Strumming the Zither Under Trees."

266
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,620
Both

267
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,860
are authentic works.

268
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,570
I didn't expect you to have such refined taste.

269
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,140
You flatter me, sir.

270
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,730
You're a true connoisseur of art.

271
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,380
I'm just pretending to be a man of culture.

272
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,460
I've long admired your calligraphy,

273
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,490
so I came hoping you might grace these with a few words.

274
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,250
Apologies for disturbing

275
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,730
your rest.

276
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,010
Mr. Zang, you come to visit this late at night.

277
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:27,330
Surely it's not just about a few inscriptions, right?

278
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,220
To be honest,

279
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,120
I caught a glimpse

280
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,900
of your "Landscape of Mount Yuren" earlier.

281
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,190
Its depiction of that famed Dongxia peak

282
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,330
was magnificent and extraordinary.

283
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,010
I couldn't resist

284
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,050
coming back for a closer look.

285
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,180
Everyone has their passions.

286
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,290
I'm fond of painting,

287
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,730
just as His Majesty is of carpentry.

288
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,700
The "Landscape of Mount Yuren"

289
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,730
isn't some timeless masterpiece,

290
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,660
but the two you've brought

291
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,620
are treasures I'd be glad to have.

292
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,700
You certainly know how to appeal to someone's tastes.

293
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,050
But I can tell

294
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,700
you don't truly care for art.

295
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,770
Nor do you crave power and status

296
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,140
like most officials.

297
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,420
Your mind is set on something else.

298
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,770
I only wish to ease the Emperor's burdens.

299
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,500
Still, one thing puzzles me.

300
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,980
What is it, sir?

301
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,480
Criminal investigations

302
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,250
are typically handled by the Three Judicial Offices.

303
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,660
You're from the Ministry of Works, not the Surveillance Office.

304
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,980
Yet His Majesty assigned the case to you.

305
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,460
Is there

306
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,460
something special about you that I don't know?

307
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,980
Sir,

308
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,810
His Majesty trusts me.

309
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,010
That's why he entrusted me with this case.

310
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,530
Even if the Emperor trusts you,

311
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,900
I do not.

312
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,700
You've risen so far

313
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,330
in just one year.

314
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,860
Remarkable indeed.

315
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,010
Tomorrow,

316
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,620
I'll advise His Majesty

317
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,620
to hand the case over to me.

318
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,220
You won't have to trouble yourself with it anymore.

319
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,620
If you can persuade His Majesty,

320
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,660
I'll follow his orders.

321
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,140
What,

322
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,140
does the Emperor want more than just the truth behind Cao Jingxian's death?

323
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,220
Is there something else he tasked you with?

324
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,620
What else do you think needs investigating?

325
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,010
Master, what's wrong?

326
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,050
Master!

327
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:53,980
Master!

328
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,490
Help!

329
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,810
Master!

330
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,770
Lu Yan?

331
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,700
Go after her!

332
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,140
On it.

333
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,770
Go get help.

334
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,700
Now!

335
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,980
Who's there?

336
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,050
Lu Yan,

337
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,730
why did you kill Shi Yiping?

338
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,530
He tricked my adoptive father into giving him the Gui Seal

339
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,330
and made us follow his orders.

340
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,220
But after we carried them out,

341
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,050
he killed nearly all of us.

342
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,090
He deserved to die.

343
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,250
But you deserve it even more!

344
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,860
So the person Cao Jingxian

345
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,460
told you to obey before he died

346
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,730
was Shi Yiping?

347
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:10,940
Zang Hai,

348
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,010
I should've killed you long ago.

349
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,010
If you hadn't gotten Father killed,

350
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,220
none of this would've happened.

351
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,940
Assassin!

352
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,080
Guards, get the assassin!

353
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,290
Too bad I couldn't kill you.

354
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,290
Father,

355
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,820
I'm coming to join you.

356
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,660
Stop her!

357
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,490
Mr. Zang,

358
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,290
we searched every possible hiding spot

359
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,250
in the residence,

360
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,460
but we found nothing.

361
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,910
Sirs,

362
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,400
what exactly are you looking for?

363
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,700
Without evidence,

364
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,420
we can't prove anything against him.

365
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,620
This is serious.

366
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,420
Either way,

367
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,090
we need to report to His Majesty first.

368
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,570
Mr. Sun,

369
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,600
this matter is of great importance.

370
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,620
Please clear the room.

371
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,050
Everyone out.

372
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,460
Yes, sir.

373
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,490
Your Majesty.

374
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,380
Your Majesty.

375
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,620
Your Majesty.

376
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,570
It's my Gui Seal.

377
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,420
Your Majesty,

378
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,010
it was found in the residence of Grand Secretary Shi Yiping.

379
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,620
He was killed by Cao Jingxian's close attendant,

380
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,620
Lu Yan,

381
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,570
who then killed herself to avoid punishment.

382
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,140
Before she died, she revealed

383
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,050
that Shi Yiping poisoned all the Surveillance Officers at Cao's Mansion.

384
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,730
So the one

385
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,220
behind it all was Shi Yiping.

386
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,900
My Chief Grand Secretary

387
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,330
was coveting what belonged to me day and night.

388
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,940
I truly misjudged him.

389
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,770
Your Majesty entrusted me with the Sword of Justice

390
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,980
and even helped me take down my third enemy.

391
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,810
Now,

392
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,460
I should return this sword to Your Majesty.

393
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:02,980
Your Majesty,

394
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,090
may I ask for a painting I saw

395
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,860
at the Shi Residence?

396
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,570
Which famous painting from his collection caught your eye?

397
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,660
It is not a renowned work,

398
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,290
just a landscape of Dongxia's mountain range.

399
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,530
That's it?

400
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,420
You may have it.

401
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,490
Thank you, Your Majesty.

402
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,050
I take my leave.

403
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,940
[Zang Residence]

404
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,290
How is

405
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,570
Zang Hai?

406
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,010
He's fine.

407
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,140
Miss Xiang is looking after him.

408
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,700
He'd carried a heavy burden for years.

409
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,180
Maybe a night of drinking is just what he needs.

410
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,460
He's sharp,

411
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,660
but he's still young.

412
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,250
True.

413
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,290
Do you think

414
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,620
he handed over both the Gui Seal and the bronze fish to the Emperor?

415
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,490
What are you implying, sir?

416
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,290
If he gave up everything,

417
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,730
then I have nothing to worry about.

418
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,900
You think he might've

419
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,620
kept something from His Majesty?

420
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,530
If he really kept the bronze fish,

421
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,330
then like his father,

422
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,980
he must fear that the Emperor might one day use the Gui Seal.

423
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,380
But doing so is very dangerous.

424
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,090
You just lay down. Why are you up again?

425
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,300
You drank so much.

426
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,570
You should rest.

427
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,210
I'm not drunk.

428
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,530
Then what's wrong?

429
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,570
Everything went so smoothly today.

430
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,050
My last enemy is dead,

431
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,130
and I found the Gui Seal.

432
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,570
But something still doesn't sit right with me.

433
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,010
What are you worried about?

434
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,420
It took me a long time to track down

435
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,050
my third enemy.

436
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,300
Both the Marquis of Pingjin and Cao Jingxian

437
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,210
went to great lengths to hide his identity.

438
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,340
But today,

439
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,780
just when I finally got the chance to face him,

440
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,460
he dropped dead right in front of me.

441
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,690
If my third enemy is someone else entirely,

442
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,260
then maybe he made Lu Yan

443
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,530
sacrifice her own life

444
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,570
to put on this whole show for us.

445
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,530
He was even willing to give up the Gui Seal and the bronze fish.

446
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,980
All to make us believe

447
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,570
that Shi Yiping was your third enemy.

448
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,980
If that's the case,

449
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,900
then he's far more cunning and ruthless

450
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,650
than Cao Jingxian or Zhuang Luyin ever were.

451
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,980
Antu,

452
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,740
come with me.

453
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,460
Take a close look at this.

454
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,490
It's a painting of Mount Yuren in Dongxia.

455
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,170
Shi Yiping's steward said

456
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,340
it was put up only recently.

457
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,380
What does that tell us?

458
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,210
His home is filled with works by Great Yong's most renowned artists.

459
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,820
Why did he hang this one

460
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,570
in the most prominent place?

461
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,170
It almost felt like he was trying to signal

462
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,050
his connection to the Gui Seal.

463
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,490
Could someone have sent him that painting

464
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,740
and ensured it was displayed

465
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,210
just to catch my attention?

466
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,170
If so,

467
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,340
that same person likely ordered Lu Yan

468
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,300
to hide the Gui Seal and bronze fish in the Shi Residence.

469
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,650
That person is the one

470
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,740
I'm really after.

471
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,940
But the Gui Seal and the bronze fish

472
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,300
were what he wanted most.

473
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,860
Why would he just

474
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,010
give them up like that?

475
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,900
Maybe he's after the bronze fish I still have.

476
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,490
I see.

477
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,380
Even with two in hand,

478
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,820
he'd still need all three

479
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,050
to activate

480
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,490
the Gui Seal.

481
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,090
Don't push yourself.

482
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,170
Get some rest first.

483
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,210
I'll help you figure this out.

484
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,090
I just can't let go

485
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,940
of this doubt.

486
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,530
I'm not going anywhere.

487
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,860
I'm right here with you.

488
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,740
When everything's finally over,

489
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,570
we'll leave the Capital

490
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,530
and travel the world, just like we planned.

491
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,460
By then,

492
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,610
you won't be able to break your promise.

493
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,820
Antu,

494
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,170
I think I know what to do.

495
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,460
What is it?

496
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,010
I'm going to resign.

497
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,680
You're up.

498
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,530
It smells great.

499
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,130
Not so fast.

500
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,170
Hold your horses.

501
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,090
It's not ready yet.

502
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,860
Wait a bit longer.

503
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,420
Give that back.

504
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,420
Let it sit a bit longer.

505
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,570
Cover it.

506
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,300
All right.

507
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,090
Then I'll help keep the fire going.

508
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,530
No need.

509
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:43,860
Leave it.

510
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,170
Congee

511
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,420
needs slow simmering.

512
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,650
If you stoke the fire,

513
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,340
you'll burn the whole pot.

514
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,940
All right.

515
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,010
Let me.

516
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,420
Here. Have a taste.

517
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,820
Thank you, Master.

518
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,490
Be careful. It's hot.

519
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,610
It's good.

520
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,090
Do you feel a bit better now?

521
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,980
Now that you've taken your revenge,

522
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,420
I want to have a talk with you.

523
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,490
But you were drunk last night.

524
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,900
We didn't get the chance.

525
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,900
It's all right, Master.

526
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,740
That part of my life is over.

527
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,690
So what are your plans for the future?

528
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,820
I plan to resign and leave the Capital.

529
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,690
Master,

530
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,940
I've got it all figured out.

531
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,610
You, Antu, Guanfeng, Shilei, and I

532
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,900
will leave together.

533
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,610
If Antu wants to bring Fengliu and Yingqi, that's fine too.

534
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,980
We'll find a quiet place

535
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,780
and live out our days in peace.

536
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,170
Of course,

537
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,980
only if everyone's willing.

538
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,740
That sounds perfect.

539
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,130
You've got no ties left in the Capital,

540
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,050
and you don't want to stay in office anyway.

541
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,050
Then let's leave.

542
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,210
I also want to stop by Qingquan Town

543
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,740
and tell Master Xing Dou the news myself.

544
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,690
I wonder if he's still there.

545
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,570
He always said he had no ties,

546
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,090
but in truth,

547
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,050
he just didn't want to be anyone's burden.

548
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,300
We'll see when we get there.

549
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,940
It looks about done.

550
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,170
I'll go call everyone for breakfast

551
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,740
and let them know my plans.

552
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,900
All right. Go ahead.

553
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,090
I'm off.

554
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,740
Go on.

555
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,650
Your Majesty,

556
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,050
Mr. Zhao has arrived.

557
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,050
Your Majesty.

558
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,460
Bingwen,

559
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,780
I summoned you here

560
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,300
to ask you something.

561
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,420
Please, Your Majesty.

562
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,570
I will answer as best I can.

563
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:52,900
You may rise.

564
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:53,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

565
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,530
Tell me,

566
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,210
now that Shi Yiping is dead,

567
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,210
would you like to take his place as Chief Grand Secretary of the Cabinet?

568
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,860
I've served many years in the Ministry of Revenue,

569
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,900
but I've never handled personnel affairs.

570
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,780
I fear I'm unfit for the role.

571
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,530
I ask Your Majesty to reconsider.

572
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,210
But the Cabinet needs a chief.

573
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,170
You're already the deputy.

574
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,490
If not you, then who?

575
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,260
If I can't ease Your Majesty's burdens,

576
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,210
then I've failed in my duty.

577
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,820
If Your Majesty approves,

578
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,380
I'm willing to serve as the acting Chief Grand Secretary

579
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,170
until a more suitable candidate is found.

580
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,260
Very well.

581
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,650
Acting or not,

582
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,860
you'll lead the Cabinet from now on.

583
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,210
I will not fail Your Majesty's trust.
