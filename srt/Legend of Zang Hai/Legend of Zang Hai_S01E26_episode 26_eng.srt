1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:16,230



2
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,773
   

4
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,440
Zhixing grew up near the border.

5
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,120
Back then, he used to go on patrols with me.

6
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,750
It's a shame his mother passed away too soon

7
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,000
to see this happy day.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,620
My Lord.

9
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,410
Could you please tell me...

10
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,870
how many wives you have?

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,250
What are you doing here?

12
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,030
Zhixing ranked first in the imperial martial arts examination.

13
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,060
As the female head of the Marquis's Mansion,

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,710
shouldn't I celebrate with you?

15
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,660
I am his rightful mother, not her.

16
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,442
   

17
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,170
Have you lost it? Go back to your room.

18
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,870
   

19
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,790
Take the lady back.

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,190
Go away.

21
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,310
My father was the Minister of Rites.

22
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,840
Meanwhile, Shen Wan's father

23
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,740
was merely a sixth-rank commandant who held no power.

24
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,120
She was from a poor family.

25
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,400
Why does her tablet get to be placed in the Zhuang Clan Ancestral Hall now?

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,080
Your principal wife is me.

27
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,960
Zhixing is my rightful heir.

28
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,690
Of course, his mother's tablet can be placed in the Clan Ancestral Hall.

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,470
Who dares to say anything?

30
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,880
He is your rightful heir?

31
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,560
Then what about Zhifu?

32
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,430
If that woman was your wife, then what am I?

33
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,910
Even if Zhuang Zhixing is your rightful heir,

34
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,430
he is considered my son.

35
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,840
I am the rightful female head of this household.

36
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,530
What kind of female head would make a scene like this?

37
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,560
Take her back.

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,210
My Lady. Please go back, My Lady.

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,360
I know what you're thinking.

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,910
You'll be relying on him from now on.

41
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,190
Therefore, he must be the rightful heir.

42
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,990
But my son, Zhifu, will never stand up.

43
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,840
Do you really think the Zhuang family can be brought back to its glory?

44
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,030
You act like you have a deep affection for Shen Wan.

45
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,020
But don't you forget how she died back then.

46
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,150
Take her away!

47
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,790
Get lost!

48
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,830
My wife lost it.

49
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Please forgive her.

50
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,460
Let me toast to you.

51
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,750
 Come on, let's toast to our lord. 

52
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,600
 - To the Marquis. 
 - To the Marquis. 

53
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,170
Second Young Master.

54
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,630
   

55
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,720
Come on. Let's toast to the Marquis.

56
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
- Cheers. 
 - That's right.

57
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,900
- To the Marquis. 
 - To the Marquis.

58
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,170
Here's to you.

59
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,070
Take a bite.

60
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,830
My Lady.

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,120
Take a bite.

62
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,880
Let me do it.

63
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,430
Come on. Have another one.

64
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,630
Mother, what happened to your face?

65
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,030
 Is it sweet? 

66
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,120
 Open your mouth. 

67
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,830
It's okay.

68
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,070
Is it sweet?

69
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,150
- Have another one. 
 - My Lady.

70
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,000
My Lady, the Marquis said

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,800
that Eldest Young Master needs to rest without getting disturbed.

72
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,100
We're told to send Eldest Young Master and Young Madam

73
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,840
to the ancestral mansion in Yongzhou.

74
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,160
On what grounds?

75
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,070
The Marquis said that Second Young Master will take office soon

76
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,870
and have visitors at home.

77
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,880
It won't be nice for people to see Eldest Young Master like this.

78
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,460
You'll get to my son...

79
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,340
over my dead body.

80
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,560
My Lady, the Marquis granted you permission to join them

81
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,380
and take care of Eldest Young Master.

82
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,780
Get out.

83
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,580
Get out!

84
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,440
Get out. Get out.

85
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,530
My Lady, please start packing.

86
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,930
We'll set off tomorrow morning.

87
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,390
Mother.

88
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,760
What's going on?

89
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,530
Mother.

90
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,680
Go to my room

91
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,750
and get my attire of Imperial Lady of First Rank.

92
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,390
- Mother. 
 - Go get it!

93
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,590
All right.

94
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,200
Mother.

95
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,220
Fu'er.

96
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:12,390
Your father has really abandoned us.

97
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,810
Zhuang Luyin.

98
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,060
I've served you for so many years

99
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,340
but you wouldn't even grant me the basic courtesy in the end.

100
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,450
All right.

101
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,320
You're really something.

102
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,520
Sir.

103
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,170
Everyone celebrated for me today.

104
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,380
I've never heard so many compliments in my life.

105
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,150
Is this the taste of power?

106
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,270
This is what many people pursue throughout their lives.

107
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,030
Once you have a taste of it,

108
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,510
it's hard to let it go.

109
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,630
As you expected,

110
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:40,890
my father called me to his study and told me everything tonight.

111
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,550
I stood in front of him and suddenly realized

112
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,630
that much of his hair had turned gray.

113
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,390
He has returned military command and even lost his position.

114
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,030
He's no longer that awe-inspiring Marquis of Pingjin anymore.

115
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:00,550
He even seemed a bit shorter than he used to be.

116
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,390
Zang Hai,

117
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,720
when my dad saved you from that fire,

118
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,910
I was very jealous.

119
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,850
But he had no idea that you wanted him dead.

120
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,080
You have achieved your goal.

121
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,720
My father has lost.

122
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,910
His hard work is in vain and he is already an old man.

123
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,370
Can't you let him go?

124
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,550
You feel sorry for your father

125
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,370
and don't want him to die to his enemy?

126
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,890
Then, you should know exactly how I feel.

127
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,870
It was just my wishful thinking.

128
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,800
You are too determined to be wavered.

129
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,150
We have an agreement.

130
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,020
I have obtained the answer you needed.

131
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,510
My father gave me this bronze fish and told me the truth.

132
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,390
This is what he found on your father.

133
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,500
I'm giving it back to you.

134
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,240
This is my father's deepest secret.

135
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,600
He fought the Dongxia army twice.

136
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,320
He witnessed the power of the Gui Seal and the invincible ghost soldiers.

137
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,860
But even after he broke the gate to Dongxia,

138
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,150
he didn't find the Gui Seal.

139
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,870
In the sixth year of the Zhenshun era,

140
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,870
the court sent Kuai Duo to build the Fengshan Altar in Dongxia.

141
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,000
My father was concerned about Dongxia

142
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,340
and asked his secret confidant, Chu Huaiming, to keep an eye on it.

143
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,860
Three years later, my father escorted the hostage back to the capital.

144
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,340
When they were about to arrive,

145
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,260
my father received a secret letter from Chu Huaiming,

146
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,930
saying that the Fengshan Altar collapsed.

147
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,150
 The Fengshan Altar collapsed. 

148
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,510
 Help! 

149
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,460
 Help! 

150
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,720
Kuai Duo, who should have been crushed,

151
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,040
hurried back to the camp with a mysterious item.

152
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,240
 The Fengshan Altar collapsed. 

153
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
 Help! 

154
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,030
 Help! 

155
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,410
 Help! 

156
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,900
 Hurry. 

157
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,530
 Hurry. 

158
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,140
 Hurry. 

159
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,610
 Over here. 

160
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,480
 - Step aside. 
 - Get help! 

161
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,720
 Hurry. 

162
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,020
 - Sir, something happened. 
 - Go over there. 

163
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,090
 Help them! 

164
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,510
On the night we returned to the capital,

165
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,910
that was when you kidnapped me,

166
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,170
my father went to meet two people.

167
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,270
They suspected that Kuai Duo dug up the Gui Seal and wanted to keep it to himself.

168
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,870
Later, they found out that he was coming back in secret

169
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,440
and concluded that he would leave the capital with his family.

170
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,270
They waited outside the Kuai Mansion with my father.

171
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,960
Finally, your father showed up.

172
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,840
You already know who one of them is.

173
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,270
Cao Jingxian.

174
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,100
Who is the other person?

175
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,150
Dongxia lost its treasure to a total outsider.

176
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,500
They would try to get it back at all costs.

177
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,460
Are you saying that the other person was from the Dongxia imperial court?

178
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,440
She wasn't just from the Dongxia imperial court.

179
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,650
She represented the Dongxia imperial court.

180
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,550
Queen of Dongxia?

181
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,510
You are truly smart, sir.

182
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,050
Nothing gets past you.

183
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,390
I bet they allied with the Queen of Dongxia for mutual benefit.

184
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,500
They annihilated the Kuai family to get the Gui Seal from your father.

185
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,770
Even if she is the Queen of Dongxia,

186
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,220
I won't let her off.

187
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,960
I have come this far thanks to you, sir.

188
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,200
No matter how you want to take revenge on her,

189
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
I will help you.

190
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,890
But let me make one thing clear.

191
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,900
I've fulfilled the agreement and told you everything.

192
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,120
You can seek revenge on those two culprits.

193
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,650
But you can't kill my father.

194
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,170
Second Young Master Zhuang.

195
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,680
Thank you.

196
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,860
Today, Zhuang Zhixing was officially made the heir.

197
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,050
The Marquis of Pingjin told him everything.

198
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,380
So, who was the third culprit who killed your family?

199
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
Your mother.

200
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,480
No way. It couldn't have been my mother.

201
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,830
I bet the Marquis of Pingjin was framing her.

202
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,680
Hasn't your mother kept asking you

203
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,510
to look for the Gui Seal here in the past decade?

204
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,380
Your mother told you to meet Cao Jingxian in private

205
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,730
before the night banquet. Right?

206
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,830
My mother told me that Cao Jingxian was cunning

207
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,780
and we were just pretending to work with him.

208
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,270
Once I find the Gui Seal,

209
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,310
I'll do my best to send it back to Dongxia.

210
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,620
We won't share it with him.

211
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,020
Of course, she won't share it with him.

212
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,930
The Marquis of Pingjin, Cao Jingxian,

213
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,700
and the Queen of Dongxia...

214
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,000
formed a temporary alliance for the Gui Seal,

215
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,960
but they each had their own motive.

216
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,000
It's not like that.

217
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,880
The Gui Seal is a treasure of Dongxia.

218
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,920
The Queen of Dongxia would do whatever it takes to find it.

219
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,630
In that case,

220
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:53,060
why would she hesitate to kill my entire family?

221
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,980
Nonsense!

222
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,030
I was just sent here when your family was killed.

223
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,720
My mother was in Dongxia.

224
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,300
She hasn't come yet. How could she kill your family?

225
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,800
How do you know that she didn't come in secret?

226
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
My mother is the Queen of Dongxia.

227
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,540
You think it's easy for her to come to the capital of Great Yong?

228
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,090
Zang Hai! Don't just listen to one side of the story!

229
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,500
♫  The building is lighted up, the fog has dissipated  ♫

230
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,550
♫  I kissed the frost and also embraced the cold  ♫

231
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,700
You won't believe anything I say at this point.

232
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,320
You resent me now. Don't you?

233
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,340
♫  Though the light boat has not passed the mountains  ♫

234
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:52,940
♫  Perhaps it's better to rest because the sky is already dark  ♫

235
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,940
♫  I must hurry before the long road  ♫

236
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,100
♫  To catch that fleeting moonlight from years past  ♫

237
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,920
♫  Each step yesterday rang firm and clear  ♫

238
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,900
♫  Stirring up so many dreams I hold dear to  ♫

239
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,700
♫  Until dawn came  ♫

240
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,330
Summon Zhuang Zhixing.

241
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,330
I, Zhuang Zhixing, pay my respects to Your Majesty.

242
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,720
Zhuang Zhixing ranked first in the imperial martial arts examination

243
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,110
and became a martial arts scholar.

244
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,550
He shall be conferred the title of Distinctive Martial Artist

245
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:50,270
and Zhennan Guard Regional Commissioner of the Zhongzhou Forces.

246
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,560
I prostrate in gratitude to His Majesty.

247
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,070
The Petition Drum?

248
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,730
Who's striking the Petition Drum?

249
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,880
Your Majesty, it's Lady Zhuang-Jiang, the Imperial Lady of First Rank,

250
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,430
beating the drum outside, asking to see Your Majesty.

251
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,920
Your Majesty, my wife is not well and has disturbed you.

252
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,340
Please allow me to handle my family business at home.

253
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,030
The Petition Drum has been struck.

254
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,260
So, it's no longer your family business, but a national affair.

255
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:36,910
I'd like to know why she struck the drum on such a happy day.

256
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,990
Summon Lady Zhuang-Jiang.

257
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,540
Why did you come?

258
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,480
Go home.

259
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,070
I, Jiang Xiang, pay my respects to Your Majesty.

260
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,370
Lady Zhuang-Jiang, do you know what the Petition Drum does?

261
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,960
Yes, I do.

262
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,910
The heir of the Zhuang family was rewarded for his performance in the exam.

263
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,790
I changed into the formal attire of the Imperial Lady of First Rank

264
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,790
to beat the Petition Drum

265
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:57,780
because I have one thing to report to Your Majesty.

266
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,720
I'm listening.

267
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,070
Your Majesty, shouldn't the martial arts scholar

268
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,920
of Great Yong possess both martial prowess and virtue?

269
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,040
Of course.

270
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,250
What if the "martial arts scholar" won by foul means,

271
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,070
his title neither justified nor legitimate,

272
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,350
and worse yet, stained by the scandal of bribery?

273
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,160
What then?

274
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,010
I came here today to press charges against someone.

275
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,870
This person committed fraud and deceived Your Majesty.

276
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,580
He is... the father of the martial arts scholar Zhuang Zhixing.

277
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,420
The Marquis of Pingjin, Zhuang Luyin!

278
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,440
Zhuang Luyin wanted to make sure his son Zhuang Zhixing

279
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,410
ranked first in the exam.

280
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,630
So, he paid off a number of examiners.

281
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,470
Please do me justice. There is no such thing.

282
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,820
My eldest son became gravely ill

283
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,060
with no hope of recovery just a few days ago.

284
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,400
My wife was deeply worried and developed hysteria.

285
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,140
That's why she is talking nonsense.

286
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,780
Let me take her home now.

287
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,960
- Let's go. 
 - Let her finish.

288
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,110
Lady Zhuang-Jiang, do you have any idea what crime you have committed

289
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,030
by slandering a great general of Great Yong before the entire court,

290
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,270
civil and military officials alike?

291
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:40,310
I wouldn't have dared to strike the Petition Drum,

292
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,200
nor accused my husband before Your Majesty's very eyes,

293
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,240
without irrefutable proof.

294
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,000
I have enough evidence to incriminate Zhuang Luyin.

295
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,720
Your Majesty, please take a look.

296
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,900
Feng Zhang, the chief examiner of the exam and Vice Minister of War.

297
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,620
Wang Renliang, co-examiner and Vice Director of the Ministry of War.

298
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:36,510
Director Yuan Cong. They have all been paid off by Zhuang Luyin.

299
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,580
This ledger is evidence of his bribery.

300
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,350
To help Zhuang Zhixing rank first in the exam,

301
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,860
Zhuang Luyin spent a fortune on those examiners.

302
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,510
I bet they still

303
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,080
have the money at home because they haven't had time to spend it.

304
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,380
Please look into it.

305
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,240
Did you three hear what she said?

306
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,300
Feng Zhang, tell me.

307
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,560
Is she telling the truth?

308
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,700
I dared not do anything like this.

309
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,790
What about you two?

310
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:38,380
Tell the truth, and I will spare your lives.

311
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,480
I was indeed solicited by Zhuang Luyin and lost my judgment.

312
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,750
That's why I helped him cheat in the exam.

313
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,150
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

314
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,860
Zhuang Luyin.

315
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,920
Do you have anything to say?

316
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,330
Your Majesty, I don't know what they're saying.

317
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,100
I disdain even to consider manipulating the imperial exam.

318
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,210
I have guarded the border for Great Yong for years

319
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,210
and conquered Dongxia for Your Majesty.

320
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,300
Heaven can testify to my loyalty to Your Majesty.

321
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,310
I'm asking what you did in the exam,

322
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,720
not the achievements you've made in the past.

323
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,110
I am He Ziqing, Vice Minister of Rites.

324
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,070
- May I report something? 
 - Speak.

325
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,660
Your Majesty, as the Grand Master for Glorious Happiness,

326
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,400
Zhuang Luyin has been watching his eldest son Zhuang Zhifu

327
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,510
embezzling money from the court over the years.

328
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,070
Is that true?

329
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,250
This is not Zhuang Luyin's only crime.

330
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,520
He let his subordinates kill the craftsmen at the late emperor's mausoleum.

331
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,560
Everyone in the court was infuriated but dared not say anything.

332
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,700
Your Majesty, please look into it and do people justice.

333
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,490
Zhuang Luyin.

334
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,800
Do you confess?

335
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,450
Your Majesty... I did not kill any innocent people.

336
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,380
I did that to serve Great Yong...

337
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,570
Where is the Three Judicial Offices?

338
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,780
 - Here. 
 - Here. 

339
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,900
You three must investigate this thoroughly.

340
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,750
 - As Your Majesty commands. 
 - As Your Majesty commands. 

341
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,890
Zhuang Luyin shall be imprisoned from this moment

342
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,070
to wait for the court trial held by the Three Judicial Offices.

343
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,720
Everyone in the Zhuang family will be grounded.

344
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,620
- Understood. 
 - Undersstood.

345
00:29:55,406 --> 00:30:00,901
   

346
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,430
My Lord, it's damp and cold in prison.

347
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,180
Have some liquor to warm up.

348
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,200
You have until the incense burns out. You'd better hurry.

349
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,490
What's going on out there?

350
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,770
The Three Judicial Offices confirmed that you bribed the examiners

351
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,780
and deployed confidants in the army to control the border defense.

352
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,200
What does His Majesty think?

353
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,880
No one knows what His Majesty is thinking.

354
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,360
But not a single minister pleaded for you in court.

355
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,100
Cao Jingxian has even advised His Majesty to execute you many times.

356
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,580
That eunuch wants me dead.

357
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,790
In his dreams!

358
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,880
I'm afraid that His Majesty won't let you off easy this time.

359
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,960
This offense would doom someone insignificant.

360
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,420
But I will walk out of here intact.

361
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,790
For over a century, the Zhuang family

362
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,510
has led armies and guarded Great Yong.

363
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,290
His Majesty won't really do anything to me.

364
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,340
As for that eunuch...

365
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:13,940
Zang Hai, go to Xie Houhuang of the Ministry of War

366
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,680
and Huang Shen of the Ministry of Rites.

367
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,440
They know what to do.

368
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,580
I'd like to see who laughs last.

369
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,930
What are you waiting for?

370
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,880
My Lord,

371
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,540
do you really believe you can get out of here alive?

372
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,940
You serve Cao Jingxian now?

373
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:08,100
Have you ever realized that Cao Jingxian is not the only one in this world

374
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,080
who wants you dead?

375
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,920
What are you trying to say?

376
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,650
Ten years ago,

377
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:27,110
you killed the Director of Imperial Astronomical Bureau, Kuai Duo, and his entire family.

378
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,610
You set a fire...

379
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,000
to disguise it as a robbery to avoid getting caught.

380
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,050
You thought you concealed the truth well.

381
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,380
However,

382
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,040
their son survived.

383
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,280
Kuai Duo's son...

384
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,030
Kuai Duo...

385
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,140
You are Kuai Duo's son.

386
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,260
I have killed too many insignificant people.

387
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,820
Your father was just one of those petty worms.

388
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,800
There were so many ways to get the Gui Seal.

389
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,530
Why did you have to kill my whole family?

390
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,880
Why did you have to implicate so many innocent people?

391
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,240
People are bound to die.

392
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,840
Does it matter when, where, and to whom they die?

393
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,170
I see.

394
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,000
This world has always bred men

395
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,590
who treat other people as worms for their own selfish desires.

396
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,230
But don't you forget that justice always comes

397
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,480
and karma will catch up with you.

398
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,030
Don't be ridiculous.

399
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,780
I have been fighting wars for so many years

400
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,880
with so many people's blood on my sword.

401
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,090
I never believe in karma.

402
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,190
You pretended to pledge allegiance,

403
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,860
biding your time by my side to strip me of my allies.

404
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,860
You even set Zhifu up.

405
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,150
You are smart, indeed.

406
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,990
But, Zang Hai,

407
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,470
you're too young...

408
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,550
and too impatient.

409
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,580
You think you've won.

410
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,320
Do you really think I will die here?

411
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,210
I will definitely pass this trial!

412
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,220
Anyone can die,

413
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,380
but not me!

414
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,310
When I get out,

415
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:25,980
I'll kill you first!

416
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,670
My Lord, think about it.

417
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,060
You cling to your pride and have the Muji Army under control

418
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,280
although you have stepped down from your position.

419
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
His Majesty feels threatened.

420
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,030
He won't personally kill a general

421
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:45,110
who has a widespread network of disciples and former subordinates.

422
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:50,280
But what if someone kills you for him?

423
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,230
Even if it causes turbulence and disrupts the morale of the army,

424
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:59,790
he only has to get rid of that killer to appease everyone.

425
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,330
Tell me.

426
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,390
What will His Majesty do?

427
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,300
So, you're the one who drove a wedge...

428
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,340
between Cao Jingxian and me.

429
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,020
I bet you know...

430
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,100
that Cao Jingxian is also your enemy.

431
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,190
As long as I tell him who you really are,

432
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,360
he will surely kill you.

433
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,760
If you can really get out of here alive,

434
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,740
do you think I would reveal my identity to you?

435
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,360
After that battle in the mansion,

436
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:47,060
you and Cao Jingxian have turned against each other for the Gui Seal.

437
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,150
You impose a huge threat to him by staying alive.

438
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,440
You're the person he wants to kill the most.

439
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,730
And he will only find out who I am when he becomes like you today.

440
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:05,020
You learned the truth but can't do anything about it.

441
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,960
Zhuang Luyin.

442
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,740
How do you like being desperate?

443
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,780
I dare you to have a fair fight with me

444
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,710
instead of plotting against me.

445
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,250
Who do you think you are?

446
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,290
I haven't been living like a normal human being.

447
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,150
Even since I survived ten years ago,

448
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,790
I've been living in torment.

449
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,540
For me, the process and the means are not important for revenge.

450
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,740
The ends justify the means.

451
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:39,480
Besides, I've found the three culprits who slaughtered my family.

452
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,320
Revenge is the only thing left in my life.

453
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,570
And you...

454
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,280
shall head to the afterlife.

455
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,030
You figured it all out?

456
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:02,820
Why do you think I did my best to support Zhuang Zhixing?

457
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,390
You think I was helping you bring your family back to glory?

458
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:12,230
You think you can keep him in the dark about how his mother died?

459
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,880
Your elder son is rendered useless.

460
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,280
Your younger son listens to everything I say.

461
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,740
I've cut off all your retreats.

462
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,880
Zhuang Luyin. Cao Jingxian. Queen of Dongxia.

463
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:35,290
One by one, I'm coming after you.

464
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,390
My good son,

465
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,580
Zhuang Zhixing.

466
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,340
What a good son.

467
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,330
Kuai Duo.

468
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:19,210
If you get to see your son like this,

469
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,320
will you laugh or cry?

470
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:10,050



471
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:22,200
 "It’s Me" - Sun Nan 

472
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,100
♫  I conceal the ambition in my eyes  ♫

00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,420
♫  I grant and deprive  ♫

492
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,780
♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

493
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,480
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫

494
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,740
♫  I am the sowing season  ♫

495
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,460
♫  I am the autumn harvest  ♫

496
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,820
♫  I am the kingdom  ♫

497
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,580
♫  I’m the commoner  ♫

498
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,960
♫  You’re also me  ♫
