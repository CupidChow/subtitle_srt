1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:16,830



2
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,753
   

4
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,680
Everyone experiences pain and confusion.

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,190
It's hard to take action. The Marquis of Pingjin is no exception.

6
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,870
To make him rely on you, you must solve his problems and pains.

7
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,190
What are his pains?

8
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,480
It concerns the person who disappeared from the Zhuang family.

9
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,660
Shen Wan was the daughter of Zhuang Luyin's father's subordinate.

10
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,870
She and Zhuang Luyin grew up together.

11
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,510
To revive the Zhuang family, he abandoned Shen Wan

12
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,000
and married Jiang Xiang, who is the daughter of the Minister of Rites, Jiang Jin.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,730
From then on, his career soared and he achieved great merits.

14
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,190
In the 35th year of Wuhe,

15
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,400
he suffered a major defeat in Dongxia.

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,280
The Emperor ordered him to guard the border.

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,150
Jiang Xiang was unwilling to suffer the hardship with him

18
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,900
and remained in the capital with Zhuang Zhifu.

19
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
 Stop! 

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,520
Life at the border was tough,

21
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,130
yet someone appeared in his desolate life.

22
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,730
That was Shen Wan.

23
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,080
She didn't marry for many years

24
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,810
and went to the border to care for her wounded father.

25
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,610
She finally reunited with Zhuang Luyin.

26
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,640
They lived at the frontier

27
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,660
and had a son, Zhuang Zhixing.

28
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,910
When Zhuang Zhixing was five years old,

29
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,800
the imperial court decided to wage war on Dongxia again.

30
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Zhuang Luyin was ordered to be the vanguard.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,840
He crushed Dongxia and redeemed his past humiliation.

32
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,260
But just as his fame soared

33
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,460
and he achieved unparalleled glory,

34
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,430
an unexpected visitor arrived at the border.

35
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,120
Jiang Xiang brought along Zhuang Zhifu to see him.

36
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,800
She wanted to rekindle their marriage.

37
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,470
Zhuang Luyin was in a dilemma.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,680
He dreamed of surpassing his father's legacy.

39
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,420
But slighting Jiang Xiang

40
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,240
would offend her father, a man of immense power.

41
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,840
But how could he disappoint Shen Wan again?

42
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,170
When he was in a dilemma, Shen Wan stepped forward.

43
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,590
She willingly gave up her place to make way for Jiang Xiang.

44
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,830
And Zhuang Luyin didn't refuse.

45
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,950
He later obtained all his wishes, the titles of a Marquis and General.

46
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,410
He became a powerful figure in the imperial court.

47
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,510
 Three! 

48
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,680
He thought he could treat them equally

49
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,290
and not let Shen Wan suffer.

50
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,950
But he underestimated Jiang Xiang's ambition and tactics.

51
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,920
 Since you hold a high post in the imperial court, 

52
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,950
 you should focus on your career. 

53
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,530
 Leave household matters to Jiang Xiang. 

54
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,310
Jiang Xiang slowly drove a wedge between him and Shen Wan

55
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,600
until Zhuang Luyin believed that Shen Wan was unfaithful.

56
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,800
With his silent consent, Jiang Xiang poisoned her.

57
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,000
 Mother! 

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,260
 Mother! 

59
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,480
 Mother! 

60
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,480
 Don't leave me! 

61
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,390
 Please! 

62
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,190
 I'm begging you! 

63
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,430
 Mother! Mother! 

64
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,150
 Mother! 

65
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,770
A great kindness is like a deep grudge.

66
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,210
No one wants to carry the debt of kindness for life.

67
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,500
A debt of kindness that can't be repaid over time

68
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,830
turns either into indifference or resentment.

69
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,650
Selfish people usually live the happiest life in this world.

70
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,550
But why can't he untie the knot?

71
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,770
He can't let go of Shen Wan from his past

72
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,800
or is he ashamed of the man he once was?

73
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,480
No one can say for sure.

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,750
Thus, he refuses to give Zhuang Zhixing any fatherly love

75
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,560
because whenever he sees his second son,

76
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,920
he'll recall how despicable he was back then.

77
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,580
The more you bury this kind of pain, the deeper it takes root.

78
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,530
Which strong man would admit this weakness inside him?

79
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,790
Marquis, you asked to see me?

80
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,460
Do you know why I wanted you to come here?

81
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,600
I know this is where Second Young Master lived when he was young.

82
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,060
Marquis, you summoned me here

83
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,910
because of what I said earlier about Second Young Master?

84
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,780
Zhixing...

85
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,240
was once dearly loved by me.

86
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,830
But over time, we grew distant.

87
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,270
I treated him far worse than Zhifu in recent years.

88
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,800
Zhixing became the disappointing son.

89
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,250
Did I make a mistake?

90
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,070
You're the head of the family who provides shelter and protection.

91
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,720
How could you be at fault?

92
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,950
I was thinking,

93
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,630
the garden is full of blooming peonies to appreciate

94
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,290
but why did you come here alone?

95
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,090
I once knew a poor gardener.

96
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,120
He made a living growing plum blossoms

97
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,430
but the prices of plum blossoms were cheap.

98
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,630
Over time, he became poorer

99
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,330
and barely able to support himself.

100
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,850
He later realized that people adored peonies.

101
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,030
The prices were naturally higher.

102
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,270
He switched to growing peonies,

103
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,870
and finally lived a life of comfort.

104
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,840
But he told me that deep down,

105
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,440
he still loved the plum blossoms more.

106
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,630
But it was too late.

107
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,400
Because no one took care of the plum blossoms in the garden,

108
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,460
they withered and died.

109
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,380
The gardener chose to plant plum blossoms when he was poor.

110
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,260
It shows how deeply he loved them.

111
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,290
But since he sold flowers for a living,

112
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,240
he had no choice but to grow peonies.

113
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,600
His beloved plum blossoms fell into ruin and withered.

114
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,500
Perhaps he blamed himself for that

115
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,680
but I don't think he was wrong.

116
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,880
Why do you think so?

117
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,130
Plum blossoms bloom in winter.

118
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,030
They endure snow and frost, with no intention to compete with spring.

119
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,030
It's not that the gardener heartlessly chose peonies.

120
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,240
It's that the plum blossoms chose to bloom in hardship

121
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,750
and fall into the mud.

122
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,960
If the gardener didn't do this,

123
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,800
the whole garden may not have survived the winter.

124
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,030
It reminds me of a poem.

125
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,960
"The scattered dried fragments are tragic enough.

126
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,440
The storm teases and bullies us.

127
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,240
How can this sudden hatred be resolved?

128
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,740
Hope depends on the fresh buds on the new branches."

129
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,150
The poet mourned the withered plum blossoms in the storm.

130
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,960
But he didn't dwell in sorrow

131
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,490
because he believed that as long as new branches grow,

132
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,890
the plum blossoms will bloom again.

133
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,380
The gardener mourned over the withered plum blossoms,

134
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,000
unaware that a single young plum blossom still lingered in a corner of a wall.

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,240
It's inconspicuous in the warm spring

136
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,980
but if nurtured with care,

137
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,910
one day, in snow and frost again,

138
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,730
it might stand proud and bloom anew.

139
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,440
What did my father talk to you about earlier?

140
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,010
My father actually asked about my studies.

141
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,720
I believe the Marquis intends to groom you.

142
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,600
His care for you now may be more than

143
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,090
what he gives to Zhuang Zhifu.

144
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,930
He's willing to be close to me because of you.

145
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,080
It's not important what I said.

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,080
What matters most is the kind of son he sees you as.

147
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,960
So, from now on, study harder,

148
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,180
and never let your guard down.

149
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,650
Understood.

150
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,800
   

151
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,750
Who is it?

152
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,320
 Sir, it's me, Zhuang Shan. 

153
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,230
 The Marquis asked to see you. 

154
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,870
Understood.

155
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,300
The Marquis is inside. Sir Zang, please.

156
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,000
Marquis.

157
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,740
Whenever I'm troubled, I'll come here to sit for a while.

158
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,900
This place helps to clear my mind...

159
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,110
and let me think things through.

160
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,690
I'm willing to share your worries.

161
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,410
Do you think General Fu Zhisong's death

162
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,500
was really an accident?

163
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,470
I have no idea.

164
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:22,280
Loyal dogs are often killed when the chase ends.

165
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,150
No matter how great your deeds,

166
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,560
they can never outweigh the heartlessness of an emperor.

167
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,380
But I believe you're not like General Fu.

168
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:41,610
He was the late Empress Dowager's nephew, a royal in-law.

169
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,550
You once led the army that broke through Dongxia's city gate

170
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,500
and achieved great merit.

171
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,330
I believe His Majesty will remember this merit.

172
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,340
With Fu Zhisong death,

173
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,050
the post of the Commander of Zhongzhou Army is now vacant.

174
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,870
No one is more qualified than me in the imperial court.

175
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,790
Many officials have recommended me to His Majesty.

176
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,080
So, tell me... should I fight for it?

177
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,860
Many current generals once served under your command.

178
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,090
Even your former deputy general now leads the Muji camp outside the capital.

179
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,410
If you fight for this position now,

180
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,910
I'm afraid His Majesty won't be able

181
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,050
to hide his growing unease toward you.

182
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,740
So, you want me to just sit idly

183
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,050
and let the position go to someone else?

184
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,930
Marquis, this is not about contending with others.

185
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,380
It's contending with His Majesty instead.

186
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,540
I believe His Majesty already has his plan in mind.

187
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,910
Why not wait for a few days

188
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,020
and see who'll finally take up the post?

189
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,860
I think if you don't fight for it,

190
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,170
it might work in your favor.

191
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,570
If you really wish to command again,

192
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,380
there must be another way.

193
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,920
I want you to do something for me.

194
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,260
Please give your order, Marquis.

195
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,740
Once you know about this, there will be no turning back.

196
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,980
You must think carefully.

197
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,110
Even if I die, I won't give up.

198
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,500
In all my years, I've only lost one battle.

199
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,030
The one who defeated me wasn't a human.

200
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,660
It's something called the Gui Seal.

201
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,280
Gui Seal?

202
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,850
During the 35th year of Wuhe,

203
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,570
the late Emperor led a massive campaign against Dongxia.

204
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,810
I served as the vanguard then.

205
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,360
We stormed many cities in Dongxia

206
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,370
and almost conquered most of the entire land.

207
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,740
Just as we were about to take the capital,

208
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,910
something strange happened.

209
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,360
 Report to the General. 

210
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,950
 Yes, sir! 

211
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,190
 Are those even human? 

212
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,070
 Prepare to fight! 

213
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,260
 Kill them! 

214
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:31,160
 - Kill! 
 - Kill! 

215
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,760
 - Kill! 
 - Kill! 

216
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,710
The Empress of Dongxia summoned a sacred relic, the Gui Seal.

217
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,070
It unleashed countless plague soldiers.

218
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,830
They're monsters that can't be killed.

219
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,680
No matter how strong our forces,

220
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,340
they were helpless before them.

221
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,230
 Retreat! 

222
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,000
From that day on, I swore that I must find that Gui Seal!

223
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,820
Six years later, Great Yong regrouped its troops

224
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,720
and launched another campaign.

225
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,550
I went on the campaign with the determination to die, if necessary.

226
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,580
But this time,

227
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,040
Dongxia lost the protection of the Gui Seal,

228
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,380
and was swiftly crushed into submission.

229
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,480
I was stationed in Dongxia for three years and still...

230
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,180
couldn't find this treasure.

231
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,070
A geomancer found this bronze fish.

232
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,780
He discovered the Gui Seal in Dongxia

233
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,300
and wanted to keep it for himself.

234
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,250
I attempted to take it from him, but failed.

235
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,930
I believe this bronze fish is related to the Gui Seal.

236
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,210
Perhaps they're parts of a whole.

237
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,180
So, is the Gul Seal still with that person?

238
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,240
No.

239
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,960
It's not with him.

240
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,350
He's already dead.

241
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,790
That was his fate.

242
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,180
He dared to take what belonged to you.

243
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,080
He needed to die.

244
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,180
It's been ten years.

245
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:23,080
I searched everywhere, but still couldn't find it.

246
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,380
I lost hope

247
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,350
but I have you now. It's different.

248
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,060
Marquis, you want me to help you find the Gui Seal?

249
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,700
That's right.

250
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,100
I'm willing to do whatever I can for you.

251
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,530
I'm handing over this task to you.

252
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,900
Understood.

253
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:02,140
May I ask if there's only one bronze fish?

254
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,450
What do you mean?

255
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,540
When I was young, I studied geomancy under my master.

256
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,780
I read a bit about the Dongxia culture.

257
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,680
Dongxia's early days relied on fishing and hunting.

258
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,250
Thus, the fish became their totem.

259
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,450
I've never seen this bronze fish

260
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,890
but I've seen many of their fish symbols.

261
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,860
This fish always appears in groups in their paintings.

262
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,690
They're symbols of abundance and prosperity.

263
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,730
That's why I asked this question.

264
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,100
You're indeed very knowledgeable, have a sharp mind, and keen insight.

265
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,850
You're right. This isn't the only bronze fish.

266
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,450
I knew it.

267
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,220
You really are the perfect man for the job.

268
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,930
Should I search for the other bronze fishes as well?

269
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,250
Don't worry about the other bronze fishes.

270
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,000
I know where they are.

271
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,370
You only need to remember this. Once you've found the Gui Seal,

272
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,940
I'll make sure you're well rewarded.

273
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,900
I'll brave fire and death to fulfill your wish.

274
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,720
Gui Seal?

275
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,200
I once heard rumors about this legend in Dongxia.

276
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,650
They called it a gift from the Holy Lady of Kunlun.

277
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,650
It's a secret treasure of Dongxia's emperors.

278
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,100
But it always sounded so far-fetched.

279
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,100
I thought it only existed in myths.

280
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,090
No one in Great Yong even knows about this.

281
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,380
I didn't expect your father to find it, and even brought it back.

282
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,030
I also didn't expect I'd help the Marquis to search for it.

283
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,570
Do you still remember the bronze fish in the Marquis' secret chamber?

284
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,900
Last night, I took the opportunity to ask about the other two fish.

285
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,720
He said he knows their whereabouts.

286
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,490
Looks like my guess was correct.

287
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,380
They're with the other two enemies.

288
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,580
But no matter how much the Marquis trusts me,

289
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,990
he still refused to tell me anything about the third person.

290
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,010
One should do things step by step.

291
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,780
We've already taken a big step forward.

292
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,140
At least you now have the Marquis' approval.

293
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,000
From now on, whatever we do, we no longer need to hide.

294
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,510
Master,

295
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,770
do you think the Gui Seal really exists?

296
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,750
I don't know either.

297
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,200
But there's one thing I'm sure of.

298
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,000
It's that your enemies didn't give up searching for it till today.

299
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,110
It seems like if we find the Gui Seal and the bronze fishes,

300
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,040
we'll definitely uncover the third person.

301
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,960
Marquis. Madam.

302
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,170
Zang Hai, have a seat.

303
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,810
Sit!

304
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,790
Is there a happy occasion today, Marquis?

305
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,270
Did you know? Yesterday,

306
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,770
His Majesty summoned all military officials to the palace for a discussion.

307
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,170
I claimed illness and didn't go.

308
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:27,030
His Majesty appointed Wu Mafu as the Commander of Zhongzhou.

309
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:31,400
Those military officials who fought over that position

310
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,880
were demoted or punished.

311
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,450
Although I didn't show up,

312
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,720
His Majesty didn't blame me.

313
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,790
He even forgave me for my illness

314
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,200
and rewarded me with a thousand taels of silver.

315
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,510
The Marquis is wise.

316
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,780
You didn't fight or scheme but won the favor of His Majesty instead.

317
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,660
There's one more thing.

318
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,240
A few days ago, I submitted a memorial to the Cabinet to recommend you.

319
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,790
Zang Hai, your geomancy skills are famous in the capital.

320
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,680
His Majesty gave you a great tribute.

321
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:10,190
Starting today, you're the Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

322
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
Congratulations, Zang Hai!

323
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,020
No, Lord Zang.

324
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,030
Thank you, Marquis.

325
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,680
Thank you, Second Young Master.

326
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,280
Have a seat.

327
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,550
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau works closely with the Ministry of Works.

328
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:32,580
You and Zhifu will have many opportunities to work together.

329
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,690
Both of you serve under His Majesty's grace.

330
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,140
You must do a good job for His Majesty.

331
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,290
I'll take good care of Zang Hai in the future.

332
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,880
Thank you, Eldest Young Master.

333
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,440
In just six months,

334
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,110
Zang Hai rose from an aide to a fifth-rank imperial official.

335
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,200
Chu Huaiming was never as skilled.

336
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,480
How can he be compared to Lord Zang?

337
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,880
All of this is due to the care of the Marquis and the influence of the Marquis Mansion.

338
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,120
As a fifth-rank imperial official, you'll have your own residence.

339
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,960
Chu Huaiming's old place was unlucky.

340
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,790
I picked a new one for you.

341
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,110
Pack your things.

342
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,190
You can move in tomorrow.

343
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,680
I'll never dare to forget your great kindness.

344
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,030
No matter where I go, I'll always remember that

345
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,480
I came from the Marquis Mansion.

346
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,720
That's enough.

347
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,170
In the future, you don't need to call yourself a humble person.

348
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,430
You should call yourself an official.

349
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,330
Yes, Marquis.

350
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,110
   

351
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,820
   

352
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,590
Greetings, sir.

353
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,680
 Father, you're an official, too. 

354
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,650
 Why aren't you sitting in this kind of carriage? 

355
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,400
 Officials ride in carriages, 

356
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,590
 but those walking on foot are also officials. 

357
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,270
 Besides, once you get used to sitting in this kind of carriage, 

358
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,030
 you'll be too lazy to walk. 

359
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,190
 You may never come down again. 

360
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,680
   

361
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,930
   

362
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,450
   

363
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,140
Greetings, Lord Zang! This way, please.

364
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:34,954
   

365
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:46,100
♫  I conceal the ambition in my eyes  ♫

366
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:53,790
♫  In my palm, I hold a dangerous desire  ♫

367
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,010
♫  Turbulent waves hide in my sleeves  ♫

368
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,580
♫  Silent like the clap of thunder  ♫

369
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,010
 Father, I've grown taller again! 

370
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,490
 I can now reach the dragon head of the armillary sphere! 

371
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,010
 You've played with it for a long time. 

372
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,590
 Do you know what this is used for? 

373
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,560
 It's for star-gazing. 

374
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,820
 Then do you know how it works? 

375
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,140
 I have no idea. 

376
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,400
 - Want to learn? 
 - Yes! 

377
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,100
 Come here. 

378
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,270
 See these four rotating rings? 

379
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,200
 Try turning them. 

380
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,480
 Slower... 

381
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,650
 A bit more... 

382
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,680
 That's it. 

383
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
 Now move the sighting bar on top, 

384
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,620
 and adjust it by three notches. 

385
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,300
 At night, look through this tiny hole, 

386
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,850
 - and you'll see the brightest star in the sky. 
 - Really? 

387
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,400
♫  My heart is burning bright  ♫

388
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,470
♫  I’m the turning clouds  ♫

389
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,220
♫  I’m the falling rain  ♫

390
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,840
♫  The compass of the human soul is unpredictable  ♫

391
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,040
♫  There will always be people who rise and fall  ♫

392
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,640
♫  I'm clear-headed  ♫

393
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,350
♫  I'm insane  ♫

394
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,720
♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

395
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,340
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫

396
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,700
♫  I am the sowing season  ♫

397
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,460
♫  I am the autumn harvest  ♫

398
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,810
   

399
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:31,590
♫  I’m the commoner  ♫

400
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,620
♫  You’re also me  ♫

401
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,790
 - Greetings, sir! 
 - Greetings, sir! 

402
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,070
Everyone, please rise.

403
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:51,110
Sir, I'm Min Shining, Calendar Official in the Five Offices, Astronomical Division.

404
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:55,940
I'm Lin Wei, Water Clock Official in the Five Offices, Timekeeping Division.

405
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,510
I'm Shang Jiu, Forest Official in the Five Offices, Forestry Division.

406
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,910
Sir, I'm Chang Wuyi,

407
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,520
Calendrical Calculations Official in the Five Offices, Observation and Topography Division.

408
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,680
What about the Prison's Mortuary Division?

409
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,350
Sir, Official Shi Quan in the Five Offices, Prison's Mortuary Division

410
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:17,270
said he had urgent matters and couldn't come to greet you.

411
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,830
It's fine.

412
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:24,180
Sir, we finally met you.

413
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,170
The imperial court established this bureau

414
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,030
to honor the gods, benefit the people, and eliminate calamities.

415
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,510
Although it's a small department,

416
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,230
but whether it's star-gazing, divination, or geomantic construction,

417
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,580
each craft takes years to master.

418
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,000
All of you have been here far longer than I have.

419
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,310
I'll need your help for many matters in the future.

420
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,790
Sir, you're far too modest.

421
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,980
If you say that, what does that make the rest of us?

422
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,790
Sir, I've been curious about

423
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,880
how you achieved such a high rank at your young age.

424
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,510
After meeting you today, you're indeed extraordinary.

425
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:10,780
Compared to you, I'm hopelessly incompetent.

426
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,790
I hope you won't mind my stupidity

427
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,350
and will continue to guide me,

428
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,110
so that I don't embarrass myself.

429
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,590
Enough small talk.

430
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,670
Let's get to official matters.

431
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,550
Have you brought the documents from each division?

432
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,530
- We have. 
 - Yes, they're here.

433
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,830
Let's begin with the Astronomical Division.

434
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,440
Sir, the Astronomical Division's duties

435
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,640
include daily star observations

436
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,830
and monitoring celestial phenomena. 
    

437
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,790
We also revise the summer calendar

438
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,790
and precisely mark each solar term,

439
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,940
so that the people can follow the seasons and live in harmony.

440
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,770
The Timekeeping Division manages the water clock and reports hours.

441
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,550
   

442
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,800
It may seem minor, but precision is crucial.

443
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,880
   

444
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,830
The Forestry Division's job

445
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,480
is to collect timber for construction projects. 
    

446
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,830
Since spring began this year,

447
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,920
we've supplied the palace with rare woods.

448
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,440
It includes yellow rosewoods, 
    

449
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,450
rosewoods, wenges, and others.

450
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,670
A total of three thousand logs.

451
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,780
Sir, the Observation and Topography Division

452
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,690
handles land surveying and soil testing. 
    

453
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,240
We assess terrain and locate auspicious burial sites.

454
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,160
The recent urgent task 
    

455
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,080
is the funeral of General Fu Zhisong.

456
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,750
Excellent.

457
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,160
Leave all the documents here.

458
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,960
Today is my first day in office.

459
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,820
There are still many things I'm not clear about.

460
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,170
I'll make notes on the documents.

461
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,920
If I have further questions,

462
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,880
I'll visit you all privately this afternoon.

463
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,660
You may go now.

464
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,400
Sir, shall we take a look at the study?

465
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,070
Please instruct us 
    

466
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,340
on its management and arrangement.

467
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,900
No. Take me to the Prison's Mortuary Division first.

468
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,720
The most delicate autopsy skill is stitching and patching.

469
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,070
For stitching, we use mulberry bark fiber

470
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,360
to suture skin wounds and reattach the separated parts.

471
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
As for patching, we usually use dough.

472
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,380
But General Fu held a high and respectable rank.

473
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,510
So, we'll use sandalwood to patch up his body as a whole.

474
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,320
-  Got it? 
 - Yes, sir.

475
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,190
The bones here are broken.

476
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,560
We'll bind them with copper wire.

477
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,840
Here it is.

478
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Not that.

479
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,280
The scissors.

480
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,530
Here it is.

481
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,070
Sir!

482
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,190
- Sir! 
 - Sir!

483
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,400
Which of you is Shi Quan?

484
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,800
Sir, how may I help?

485
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,210
I'd like to speak to you alone.

486
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,710
The rest of you, step out.

487
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,460
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

488
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,670
Are you here to question me, sir?

489
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,630
Is there anything to question?

490
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,960
The general's body arrived this morning.

491
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,030
It must be handled immediately.

492
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,400
I hope you'll understand.

493
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,110
His Majesty ordered a grand burial for General Fu.

494
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,000
The body was delayed on the trip for several days.

495
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,920
It's right that you prepared for this earlier.

496
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,000
It's not winter yet.

497
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,570
Even a few hours' difference can make a big impact.

498
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,150
Were you teaching them just now?

499
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,870
Why are they the only ones helping you with such important work?

500
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,880
Lord Chu said autopsy work in the mortuary isn't demanding,

501
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,820
so he cut our division's staff to save costs.

502
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,030
I'm usually the only one here.

503
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:21,960
Sometimes, I will call the apprentices to help out.

504
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,070
They're civilians who came to learn from the master.

505
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,570
Thus, they're still a bit clumsy.

506
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,400
I'll lend a hand.

507
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,790
I didn't expect you to be this skilled.

508
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,510
I learned this as a child,

509
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,630
but I've never been able to master it.

510
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:19,150
To be good at this, you need more than talent.

511
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,280
It takes a lot of patience.

512
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,290
You're too modest, sir.

513
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,630
You've served in the bureau for many years, right?

514
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,010
Have you always been stationed here?

515
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,760
Sir, no need to be so polite with me.

516
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,530
Say what's on your mind.

517
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,820
Did you come to the Astronomical Bureau

518
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,180
to make a fortune, or just to climb up the ranks?

519
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,240
I don't really care.

520
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,640
I only hope you'll let me work in peace

521
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,920
and focus on my duties.

522
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:20,710
   

523
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,030
Make sure this courtyard is spotless every day,

524
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,530
and not a speck of dust left behind.

525
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,380
It's Lord Zang's first day in office.

526
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,000
Inform the kitchen that tonight's meal must be perfect!

527
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,590
Understood?

528
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,070
From now on, all of you...

529
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,670
- Sir. 
 - Sir.

530
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,150
Sir.

531
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,180
All right, you may leave.

532
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,910
You're back.

533
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,510
I met all the officials at the Astronomical Bureau today...

534
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,960
Don't talk about that yet.

535
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,630
Turn around.

536
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,670
Turn around.

537
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,360
Take a few steps.

538
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,560
Master...

539
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,800
This outfit suits you well.

540
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,280
The first clothes you wore in the capital

541
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,360
were the ones I got for you.

542
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,030
You're now wearing an official robe.

543
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,870
Looks good.

544
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,360
If Old Man Xing Dou were to see you now,

545
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,640
he'd probably complain that one sleeve is longer.

546
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,640
So, how did it go today?

547
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,230
The current bureau is nothing like

548
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,610
when my father was in charge.

549
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,740
Back then, everyone did their jobs and got along well with each other.

550
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,920
If my father could help, he always would.

551
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,670
But now, everyone wears a mask.

552
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,280
There's no sincerity left.

553
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,000
What nonsense are you spouting?

554
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,670
Your father was just a man who ran a funeral business.

555
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,380
He had nothing to do with the bureau.

556
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,360
You're now an official.

557
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,660
You're no longer an aide from the Marquis Mansion.

558
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,000
Many people are watching you.

559
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,110
Back at the Marquis Mansion,

560
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,800
you're fine as long as he trusts you.

561
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,840
But in the imperial court, hidden arrows come from all directions.

562
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,170
You'll need to be more careful.

563
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,340
You're right, Master.

564
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,670
The bureau today is full of opportunists and spies.

565
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:26,190
I'm afraid the road ahead won't be smooth.

566
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,070
When Chu Huaiming was in charge,

567
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,030
the bureau served the wicked people many times.

568
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,800
I've heard of those stories.

569
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,330
Ever hear about the missing daughter of the Lin family?

570
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,440
That was three years ago.

571
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:43,110
She was just 13 years old

572
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,660
but the Duke of E's eldest son fancied her.

573
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,630
He insisted on making her his concubine,

574
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,110
but he was 30 years older than her.

575
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,070
The Lin family flatly refused.

576
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:58,550
Talking about this, it's strange. He died from taking an aphrodisiac.

577
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,840
The Lin family thought it was over.

578
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,510
Who would know that three days after his death,

579
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:08,110
their daughter suddenly vanished.

580
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,230
Guess where they found her?

581
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,550
Where?

582
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,230
In the tomb of the Duke of E's son.

583
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:18,380
She was strangled and wore a bridal gown.

584
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,440
Her poor parents went insane.

585
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,160
But Great Yong's law clearly forbids ghost marriages.

586
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,550
This rule only applies to commoners.

587
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,590
The imperial court turns a blind eye when it comes to the nobles.

588
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,630
That ghost marriage might've been arranged

589
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,110
by the Astronomical Bureau.

590
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,550
And not just that.

591
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,710
Last October, under the guise of aiding nobles,

592
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,840
the bureau took over every orchard in Wang Village.

593
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,400
Left with nowhere to appeal,

594
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,070
those poor farmers were evicted from their homes.

595
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,130
This bureau is long overdue for a clean-up.

596
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:16,950



597
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:22,260
 "It's me" - Sun Nan
