00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,746
   

4
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,200
Everything is here, Miss Xiang.

5
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,940
Where is Master Gao Ming?

6
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,080
He went to buy horses.

7
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,770
We have a lot of people and luggage.

8
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,870
Not even three horse carriages can fit everything.

9
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,350
I've dismissed the indentured maids and servants.

10
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,940
I also gave them some extra money.

11
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,350
I'm sure you don't mind, Official Zang.

12
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,820
No one in the capital makes more money than you, Proprietor Xiang.

13
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,410
In the future, we have to rely on you.

14
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,940
Xiao Hai! Xiao Hai.

15
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,780
Look who's here.

16
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,890
Official Zhao.

17
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,980
Benefactor.

18
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,480
Zang Hai,

19
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,910
are you going to resign and leave the capital?

20
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,140
I've submitted my resignation to the Cabinet.

21
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,280
I planned to tell you after His Majesty approves it.

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you free to talk with me now?

23
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,320
A horse carriage...

24
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,440
can go left or right.

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,690
Yet,

26
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,060
the reins are in the coachman's hands.

27
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,760
Sometimes, I think...

28
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,140
people are like these horses.

29
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,180
They seem like they have a choice

30
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,170
but in truth,

31
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,480
it's out of their control.

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,310
I rescued you back then

33
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,190
and asked you to make your own decision.

34
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,260
You chose revenge.

35
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,950
However, I've been thinking all these years.

36
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,410
Was I right to let a child...

37
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,640
make such a cruel choice?

38
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,210
I owed you a debt of gratitude for saving me.

39
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,770
You also asked my masters to take care of me, raise me,

40
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,120
and let me get my revenge.

41
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,000
I will never blame you.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,680
Yes.

43
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,280
You've grown up over time

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,820
and have matured.

45
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Now, your third enemy is dead.

46
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,520
You can begin a new life now.

47
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,770
I want you to make another decision.

48
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,040
 Sir, spare me some food. 

49
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,670
 Sir, spare me some food. 

50
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,860
 - Show some mercy. 
 - Sir. 

51
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,750
 - Have a heart. 
 - Spare me some food. 

52
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,310
 Sir, show some mercy. 

53
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,050
 Have a heart, sir. 

54
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,210
 Have a heart, sir. 

55
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,540
Sir!

56
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,580
 Spare me some food. 

57
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,900
 Spare some food, sir. 

58
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,750
Thank you, sir!

59
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,390
 Spare me some food. 

60
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,800
 Be kind, sir. 

61
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,820
 Thank you, sir. 

62
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,720
Thank you, sir.

63
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,920
Thank you.

64
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,580
 - Thank you, sir. 
 - Thank you, sir. 

65
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,850
 - Thank you, sir. 
 - Thank you, sir. 

66
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 - Thank you, sir. 
 - Thank you, sir. 

67
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,510
 Thank you, sir. 

68
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:35,140
 - Thank you, sir. 
 - Thank you, sir. 

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,630
 - Thank you, sir. 
 - Thank you, sir. 

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,940
 Thank you, sir. 

71
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,930
 Thank you, sir. 

72
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,730
- Take it for him. 
  - Thank you, sir. 

73
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,000
- Thank you, sir. 
 - Thank you, sir.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,430
We have food now.

75
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,300
Quick. We have food now.

76
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,220
After so many years,

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,660
corrupt officials bled Great Yong dry.

78
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,110
The nine rivers flood every year.

79
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,900
Imperial exams are mostly rigged.

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,250
There are still people who starve to death under the Emperor's rule.

81
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,320
What decision are you talking about?

82
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,460
Do you still remember when you first entered the Marquis of Pingjin Mansion

83
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,940
and exchanged all the gifts you received

84
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,700
into food for the starving people?

85
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,000
Your father...

86
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,920
used to do the same as well.

87
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,970
He would ask those who starved to work

88
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,050
in exchange for food.

89
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,650
Many of your seniors were orphans of refugees.

90
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,930
They had no one to rely on since young...

91
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,700
and were raised by your father at his mansion.

92
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,750
However, that was all he did.

93
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,330
Do you still remember what I said to you

94
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,630
when you came to my place to probe me back then?

95
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,850
Before you can achieve what you set out to achieve,

96
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,000
assume that you have achieved it.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,630
You mean...

98
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,170
Your father could only save them for a while.

99
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:39,190
Why not go further and save the people forever?

100
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,120
From tomorrow onward,

101
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,120
I will be the interim Chief Cabinet Secretary.

102
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,140
You have the talent to be a great leader.

103
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,190
If you want to do it,

104
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,270
accept this edict to join the Cabinet 
    

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,560
and continue being an official in the imperial court.

106
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,820
If you want to be free from now on, just reject it.

107
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,720
Go and live the life that you want, yet couldn't possess until now.

108
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,390
   

109
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,790
Let's go.

110
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,740
 Antu. 

111
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
 I have a way. 

112
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,340
 What is it? 

113
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,530
 Resignation. 

114
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,760
 Let everyone know that we are leaving the capital 

115
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,670
 and will not come back again. 

116
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,510
 If the third enemy truly exists, 

117
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,390
 he knows who I am 

118
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,980
 and knows I have knowledge of the Gui Seal and bronze fish. 

119
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,020
 Do you think he will let me go 

120
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,320
 and allow me to leave freely? 

121
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,240
 He will surely keep you by his side where he can see you 

122
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,860
 and do everything to see 

123
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,020
 whether you gave the Gui Seal and bronze fish to the Emperor or not. 

124
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,410
 He will make sure that you won't ruin the next step in his plan. 

125
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,940
 He may even kill you... 

126
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,840
 if it's necessary. 

127
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,790
 That's right. 

128
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,370
 The person who doesn't want us to leave the most... 

129
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,820
 might be the real third enemy. 

130
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,940
He asked me to stay in the capital and aid him in the Cabinet.

131
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,770
Right now, he is the only one...

132
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,350
who has asked me to stay.

133
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,080
What if he only appreciates you as a talent

134
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,720
and it is all a coincidence?

135
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,390
No matter what, I must give it a try.

136
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,080
Not only will I see him every day after joining the Cabinet,

137
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,010
but I will also have access to many confidential files.

138
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,790
Whether it is him or not,

139
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,790
I will find out the truth.

140
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,000
Help me keep an eye on Master.

141
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,550
If Zhao Bingwen is the third enemy,

142
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,000
are we going to suspect Master Gao Ming as well?

143
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,220
If my benefactor is truly the third enemy,

144
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,750
Master might have been deceived as well.

145
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,030
However, they share a genuine relationship.

146
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,150
Whether it's my benefactor or Master,

147
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:31,250
I can't show them my true self before the truth comes to light.

148
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't worry.

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I know what to do.

150
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,510
Why is it always so hard

151
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,170
to write the words Balance and Harmony?

152
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,440
You taught me it must be without excess and deficiency.

153
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,960
Precision is hard to attain. 
    

154
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,440
The same goes for calligraphy as well.

155
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,390
A gentleman is only a person of balance and harmony

156
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,510
if they have the virtues of a gentry.

157
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,620
To interpret it narrowly, it's the virtue of preserving life.

158
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,250
To interpret it broadly, it's to deliver the people from suffering.

159
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,620
That is why you asked Zang Hai to join the Cabinet

160
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,360
and help you govern the empire and help the people.

161
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,450
However...

162
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,620
Zang Hai is still young.

163
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,470
This is not where he excels.

164
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,000
   

165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,670
Is this your opinion

166
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,340
or Zang Hai's opinion?

167
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,570
Zang Hai admires and respects you a lot.

168
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,320
This is merely my opinion.

169
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,500
Are you hiding anything from me?

170
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,100
I dare not.

171
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,410
You should do your job well as a master.

172
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,770
Don't let the past incident repeat itself.

173
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,650
Have you found the bronze fish?

174
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,600
Zang Hai is very cautious.

175
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,220
I still can't take action.

176
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,740
It'll be too late if you don't act soon. 
    

177
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,470
I'm doing this for his own good.

178
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,140
Getting him to stay in the capital and join the Cabinet

179
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,770
is the only way to protect him.

180
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,470
I will act as soon as possible.

181
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,390
Grand Secretary Zhao.

182
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,650
Thanks to His Majesty's grace,

183
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,100
I will take over as interim Chief Cabinet Secretary.

184
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,510
I still need everyone's help

185
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,150
regarding the Cabinet's matters.

186
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,650
 Please order us as you see fit, Grand Secretary Zhao. 

187
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,720
Everyone is sad about what happened to the Shi family.

188
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,000
Grand Secretary Shi did his best to serve the Emperor.

189
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,500
I hope all of you can follow his ambition

190
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,410
and do your duty in the Cabinet

191
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,790
- to share His Majesty's burdens. 
  - Yes. 

192
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,240
His Majesty has approved Zang Hai's appointment to the Cabinet.

193
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,790
In the future, he can participate in important matters of the imperial court.

194
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,720
Zang Hai, you can enter the Cabinet's archive as you wish.

195
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,220
Yes, Official Zhao.

196
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,200
All right.

197
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,610
Get ready for today's meeting.

198
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,830
Zang Hai.

199
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,630
If you need any help, come and ask me anytime.

200
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,340
There's no need to be so formal between us.

201
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,510
Yes.

202
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,650
Official Zhao.

203
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,600
I have something to ask you.

204
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,858
   

205
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:19,113
   

206
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,667
   

207
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,360
I've gone through the draft opinions in the last few years.

208
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,080
I realized most of them were drafted by Official Zhao.

209
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,540
From what he wrote,

210
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,070
his integrity and loyalty were infallible.

211
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,000
In that case, not only does he not have any flaws,

212
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,310
but the more you investigate,

213
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,490
the more he seems like an official who cares about the empire and the people.

214
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,110
Have we misunderstood him?

215
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,010
I'm not sure if he wants to nurture me

216
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,940
or learn about the whereabouts of my bronze fish.

217
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,850
There must be a larger objective

218
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,440
for him to put up an act for so long.

219
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,780
Before you achieve what you set out to achieve,

220
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,700
assume that you have achieved it.

221
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,640
I must keep investigating.

222
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,980
What comes next is a test of patience.

223
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,301
   

224
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,830
Darn you, Xiang Antu.

225
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,640
You've been ignoring me recently.

226
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,610
Why did you suddenly think of me today?

227
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,350
I wanted to see you today.

228
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,110
Look. I brewed some premium flower tea for you.

229
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,810
Try it.

230
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,490
I even bought you some fragrance powder.

231
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,440
- Not bad. 
 - They are for you if you like them.

232
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,590
That's more like it.

233
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,870
How are you doing with Zang Hai recently?

234
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,240
He just joined the Cabinet

235
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,350
and is busy with court matters with your father every day.

236
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,400
I can't even see him.

237
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,960
I knew it.

238
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,000
You only remember mewhen you can't hang out with him.

239
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,800
This painting...

240
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,830
Do you recognize this drawing?

241
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,240
It belongs to my father.

242
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,410
I've seen it since I was young.

243
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,350
Of course, I recognize it.

244
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,270
This is it.

245
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,930
Why do you have this painting?

246
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,070
This painting was in Shi Yiping's residence.

247
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,160
Zang Hai requested it from the Emperor after his death.

248
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,480
Why would Shi Yiping possess my father's painting?

249
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,960
Whatever.

250
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,380
Zang Hai is such a sweet person.

251
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,790
He requested a painting of Dongxia from the Emperor for you

252
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,830
so you won't feel homesick.

253
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,860
That's right. He has no time to accompany me.

254
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,110
He owes me this painting.

255
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,350
All right. Don't stay cooped up at home.

256
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,460
Come and have fun with me outside.

257
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,700
Official Zhao.

258
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,240
I have something I don't understand. Please guide me.

259
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,550
The documents submitted by the Ministry of Works recently

260
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,000
were all rejected by the Cabinet.

261
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,100
It's spring, and many places suffer from floods.

262
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,160
The Ministry of Works knows the damage it will cause

263
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,590
and wants to improve the flood control system

264
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,610
- but for some reason... 
 - Zang Hai.

265
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,540
In recent years, Great Yong's treasury has been drained.

266
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,340
Even the Ministry of Rites struggled to organize the Spring Exam,

267
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,410
let alone the Ministry of Works.

268
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:48,410
If we keep allocating money to every ministry's needs,

269
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,150
we're going to create a bigger problem.

270
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,800
This problem must be dealt with at its roots.

271
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,590
Are you talking about getting rid of corruption?

272
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,000
That's right.

273
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,310
The treasury's money has gone to corrupt officials.

274
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,310
It's no use, no matter how much money you allocate.

275
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,410
In the end, it's the problem of the law.

276
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,960
A heavy punishment is needed

277
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,140
to get rid of corruption.

278
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,910
But won't doing this bring the opposite effect?

279
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,320
Zang Hai.

280
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,110
If you can think of that,

281
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,190
it's very good.

282
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,640
This is also what I'm most worried about.

283
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,400
The corruption culture in the imperial court

284
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
happens mostly due to officials

285
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,270
who can't feed their families with their meager salaries.

286
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,340
If you don't want them to harm the common people,

287
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,530
killing a few of them won't solve the problem.

288
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,690
I've petitioned the Emperor

289
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,670
to increase the salaries of all fifth-rank officials and above by 30%.

290
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:18,860
This is the money that the imperial court must spend.

291
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,250
One must have a roof above their head and a full stomach.

292
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,240
Officials must be able to feed their families

293
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,030
so they don't prey on the people.

294
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,490
This is a good method indeed.

295
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,970
However...

296
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,300
shouldn't we start from those working closely with the people?

297
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,100
If the treasury has a lot of money,

298
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,620
I will surely do that.

299
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:47,090
However, prioritizing the small officials over the powerful officials...

300
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,810
is not something even the Emperor can do.

301
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,310
As the saying goes, "If one intends to take something,

302
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,770
one must first give something away."

303
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,070
You are involved in the imperial court now.

304
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,400
You must remember this in the future.

305
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,680
Yes.

306
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,490
I will remember it.

307
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,890
Tong'er came today and recognized the painting to be Official Zhao's.

308
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,480
She even asked how the painting ended up in our place.

309
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,070
It's his indeed.

310
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,760
This is very suspicious indeed.

311
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,900
I've never lied to Tong'er before.

312
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,970
I didn't tell her the truth today

313
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,730
and I feel a little guilty.

314
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,580
She is my best friend.

315
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,510
I really hope Official Zhao is just your benefactor

316
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,530
and not your enemy.

317
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,980
Tong'er.

318
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,390
Father.

319
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,830
What are you looking for?

320
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,490
Father, did you give Shi Yiping this painting?

321
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,550
Which painting?

322
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,790
The "Landscape of Mount Yuren" painting that was kept here previously.

323
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,370
That painting?

324
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,140
Previously, I went to visit the Shi residence with my colleagues

325
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,100
for a so-called painting and calligraphy appreciation session.

326
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,140
I brought this painting with me without much thought.

327
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,860
To my surprise, he loved it.

328
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,900
He forced me to give it to him, so I did.

329
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,610
I went to hang out with Antu today and saw this painting at her place.

330
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,650
I thought I was mistaken

331
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,520
but when I came back and looked for it, the painting was indeed yours.

332
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,900
This painting should belong to the imperial court

333
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,490
now that the Shi Residence was seized following Shi Yiping's death.

334
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,250
How come she possesses the painting?

335
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,970
She said Zang Hai asked the Emperor for it

336
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,060
to be given to her as a gift because it was a painting of Dongxia.

337
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,140
I see.

338
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,770
Tong'er,

339
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,590
sit with me for a while.

340
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,480
Since your mother passed away,

341
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,540
both of us have been relying on each other,

342
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,950
so I allowed you...

343
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,340
to go to Zhen Tower dressed as a man to tell stories.

344
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,190
But now,

345
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,630
you are no longer a child.

346
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,350
It's time to act your age.

347
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,980
But I enjoy reading and telling stories.

348
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,000
You've been rebellious

349
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,200
since your childhood, because I've always doted on you.

350
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,350
You do things without caring about the consequences.

351
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,640
You will regret it one day.

352
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,410
Father.

353
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,440
Zhen Tower is gone now.

354
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,960
You should cease thinking about telling and reading stories anymore.

355
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,000
From now on, you should stay home and accompany me more.

356
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,090
Master.

357
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,410
I'm going to work.

358
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,570
Go back and rest.

359
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,510
Zhao Geng.

360
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,780
Yes, Master.

361
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,390
Tong'er is a lady now.

362
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,530
When she goes out in the future,

363
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,320
assign a few men to follow her in case anything happens to her.

364
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,910
Yes.

365
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,010
Official Zang, it's late.

366
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,510
Our work is endless.

367
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,130
Continue tomorrow.

368
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,400
I still have work to do for the Ministry of Works

369
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,000
and the Imperial Astronomical Bureau tomorrow.

370
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,740
Grand Secretary Shi used to reprimand me in the past for being lazy and carefree.

371
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,150
If he were to see you now, he would surely appreciate you.

372
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,150
I'll be going back.

373
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,860
What a pity.

374
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,410
I joined the Cabinet too late.

375
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,450
Otherwise, I could learn from Grand Secretary Shi.

376
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,100
Having a superior who keeps giving me reminders

377
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,870
in political affairs is a lucky thing.

378
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,490
You are different from what I imagined.

379
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,670
What do you mean?

380
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,350
Official Zang, you served Zhuang Luyin in the past.

381
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,380
You became an official through recommendation.

382
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,450
However, you caused a mess in the imperial court.

383
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,320
In Grand Secretary Shi's opinion,

384
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,380
you broke the balance he spent his whole life maintaining.

385
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,210
Balance?

386
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:03,030
But didn't Grand Secretary Shi turn a blind eye to what Cao Jingxian did?

387
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,220
Cao Jingxian and Zhuang Luyin

388
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,300
were two authoritative figures no one would dare offend.

389
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,540
Grand Secretary Shi had been going against them by leading the Cabinet.

390
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,820
Both of them are dead now.

391
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,080
Unfortunately, Grand Secretary Shi passed away as well.

392
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,300
However, rumors in the capital are saying

393
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,970
that Grand Secretary Shi was close to Cao Jingxian.

394
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,700
However, he was killed by Cao Jingxian's surveillance officers.

395
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,540
They say both of them had a falling out and turned against each other.

396
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,900
Impossible. I don't believe it.

397
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,970
Grand Secretary Shi was my superior for many years.

398
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,250
I know him very well.

399
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,330
Official Zang, let me show you something.

400
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,690
This is the name list of Great Yong's officials.

401
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,690
Grand Secretary Shi gave it to me back then.

402
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:00,940
He started writing this name list when he was the Vice Minister of Personnel.

403
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,170
Everyone said Grand Secretary Shi remembered every official of Great Yong

404
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,550
when he was the Vice Minister of Personnel.

405
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,590
I suppose good memory still has to make way for note-taking.

406
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,950
Before the New Year, Grand Secretary Shi saw that I was busy working

407
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,140
and gave me this name list. 
    

408
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,220
The name list has always been kept at the Cabinet, with no one to retrieve it.

409
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,838
   

410
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,600
Lu Min?

411
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,078
   

412
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,730
Lu Min...

413
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,900
I noticed this before.

414
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,480
This should be Cao Jingxian's name before he entered the palace.

415
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,340
All his foster sons have the surname of "Lu".

416
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,860
He just couldn't give up on passing his lineage.

417
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,480
Sir.

418
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,750
I didn't know you were coming.

419
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,790
Sorry for the poor reception.

420
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,480
Sit.

421
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,520
Thank you, sir.

422
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,210
You may leave.

423
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,210
Are you Eunuch Liu?

424
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,760
Yes.

425
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:41,330
You were the one who taught the new eunuchs the rules in the past.

426
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,830
I want to ask you about someone.

427
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,880
If I know something, I will tell you honestly.

428
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,750
Lu Min.

429
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,590
Lu Min?

430
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,660
Lu Min...

431
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,900
I remember.

432
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,790
Do you really remember?

433
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,680
I do.

434
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,580
He wasn't castrated when he entered the palace.

435
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,930
He had long lost his manhood.

436
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,480
He castrated himself.

437
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,070
There are many rules and forms of etiquette in the palace.

438
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,140
Those who graduated here

439
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,900
can have a chance of becoming a eunuch at the inner palace.

440
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,620
Lu Min was hardworking and liked to study.

441
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,880
It didn't take long for him to learn most of the skills

442
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,670
from veterans like us.

443
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:54,060
When it was time for him to change his name and enter the palace,

444
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,970
he was more capable than eunuchs

445
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,380
years his senior.

446
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,520
What did he change his name to later?

447
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,680
I don't remember.

448
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:14,640
I remember he went to work at the Imperial Stables Directorate.

449
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,350
Lu Min was educated, and he could read.

450
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,790
He spoke in a formal and elegant way.

451
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,510
He used to say that he shouldn't become a eunuch.

452
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,310
He said if he participated in the exams,

453
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,540
he would surely become a highly-ranked official.

454
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:35,340
He told me he used to study in the best academy in the capital,

455
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,350
the Academy of Great Yong.

456
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,580
Sir,

457
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,110
all the original documents and files

458
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:59,170
since the establishment of the Academy of Great Yong are stored here.

459
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,340
You may leave.

460
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,880
I can search for it myself.

461
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,280
Yes.

462
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:32,892
   

463
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,911
   

464
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,833
   

465
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,460
   

466
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,066
   

467
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,802
   

468
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,190
Master.

469
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,590
You're back?

470
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,760
We are having Fried Bean Sauce Noodles tonight.

471
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,290
It will take some time.

472
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:27,190
I'm too tired today and don't have an appetite.

473
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,760
I want to rest for a while.

474
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,260
The Cabinet is a difficult place to be.

475
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,670
Look at you.

476
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,050
You hold three positions at once.

477
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,000
There are too many things you need to do.

478
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,900
I feel exhausted for you already.

479
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,070
All of these responsibilities are too many

480
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,940
and too heavy for me.

481
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,250
Why don't I tell Master

482
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,380
and ask him to relieve you of your burden?

483
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,110
I'll think about it.

484
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,610
Once I think it through, I'll tell him myself.

485
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,340
Xiao Hai.

486
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,800
You're like a stranger to me now.

487
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,180
You won't even chat with me.

488
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,610
Have you forgotten about me now that you have Miss Xiang?

489
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,960
When you put it like that,

490
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,880
I have no choice but to chat with you.

491
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,170
That's more like it.

492
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,790
Peel the garlic.

493
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,570
Master, do you still remember when you asked me

494
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:36,430
what kind of life I would want to live after getting my revenge?

495
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,410
I couldn't answer you back then.

496
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,940
You also told me the day would come soon.

497
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,380
You were right.

498
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,700
I've made my choice

499
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,510
and I'm still an official with my benefactor.

500
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But I want to know your answer.

501
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,650
Me?

502
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,030
My benefactor asked you to aid me in my revenge.

503
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,570
Now that I've taken my revenge,

504
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:16,000
haven't you thought about what you want to do?

505
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,510
Are you calling me useless now?

506
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,960
Since you're in the Cabinet now,

507
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,150
you no longer need the things I taught you.

508
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,660
That's not what I mean.

509
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,660
I know that's not what you mean.

510
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,260
I was just teasing you.

511
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,290
Do you really want to know?

512
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,840
Royal silver.

513
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,190
Master, do you still remember the time when you took me

514
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,280
to trick a corrupt official when I was young?

515
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,000
I remember.

516
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,510
Look.

517
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:17,380
I have gotten the newly minted royal silver now.

518
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,970
Look how much you've achieved.

519
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,670
The royal silver I used back then

520
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,260
was the tuition fee I received from your benefactor.

521
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,840
Yet, I spent all of it in the first lesson.

522
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,070
You are good at pretending to be an official.

523
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,270
Did you learn it from my benefactor?

524
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:42,030
Why don't you become an official?

525
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,880
That won't do.

526
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,510
I'm just a fraud.

527
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,340
I'll be exposed if I become an official.

528
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,360
I don't think so.

529
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,710
We humans don't need to live for a certain goal.

530
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,360
Living our days with people we care about by our side,

531
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,000
doesn't it sound good?

532
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,130
You are in the capital, and your benefactor is also in the capital.

533
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,130
Where else can I go?

534
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,550
I'll just serve you and become a cook.

535
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,880
If I can't teach you anything else,

536
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,790
I'll feed you instead.

537
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:39,470
You used to tell me that no matter how capable I was,

538
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,610
I still wouldn't surpass you.

539
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,880
Enough.

540
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,550
You've been busy the whole day.

541
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,820
Go inside your room and sleep.

542
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,250
I'll slowly make these noodles.

543
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,000
You can eat them when you wake up.

544
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,510
I won't need to wake you up.

545
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:00,070
The smell of the noodles will do just that.

546
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,530
Go on.

547
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,860
All right.

548
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,070
 Official Zhao. 

549
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,810
 My benefactor. 

550
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,010
 My third enemy. 

551
00:41:54,590 --> 00:42:01,280
 I used to think my obsession with vengeance 

552
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,780
 compelled me to keep investigating... 

553
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,780
 until the truth came out. 

554
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,780
Have you thought about what you are going to do?

555
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,880
Should you tell the Emperor directly?

556
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,110
No.

557
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,070
I've hidden the bronze fish as well.

558
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,910
We can't go through the Emperor anymore.

559
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,520
We must deal with it ourselves.

560
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,980
Since I've chosen this path,

561
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,670
I have to see it through until the end.

562
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,030
All right.

563
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:43,150
Move forward for your past and current self.

564
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:47,360
Antu, make the preparations.

565
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,700
I want to invite Zhao Bingwen to my residence

566
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,620
and confront him.

567
