2
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:29,960
   

3
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,900
   

4
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,640
This is the place.

5
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,350
It's so well hidden.

6
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,950
After more than ten years, you still found it.

7
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,400
Have you forgotten everything my father taught you about geomancy?

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,130
I never really learned properly.

9
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,560
Right beneath our feet is the tunnel my father

10
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,780
used to take me then.

11
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,640
It connects directly to the tomb passage, which is closest to the diamond wall.

12
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,030
When I left, my father told me to fill it up again,

13
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,420
to keep tomb robbers out.

14
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,090
If it's sealed off, how did Master get inside?

15
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,860
My father was away in Dongxia for so long.

16
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,370
Other tomb robbers must've discovered this place.

17
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,250
Here's what we'll do: Split up and search.

18
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,820
Guan Feng! Come here.

19
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,220
Here.

20
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,300
 Father, this tomb is actually for a married couple. 

21
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,510
 Check around and find out who they were. 

22
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,260
 The coffin decorations are exquisite, 

23
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,340
 and the materials are high quality. 

24
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,000
 This isn't an ordinary family's coffin. 

25
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,930
 But why isn't there an inscription? 

26
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,680
 This tomb owner is so strange. 

27
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,130
 The gold, jade, and coffin here are all top-quality, 

28
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,940
 but there's no inscription. 

29
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,000
 Could it be they didn't want their identity known? 

30
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,000
 Both sides of the coffin are full of books. 

31
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,420
 The owner was clearly a civil official, and a very high-ranking one at that. 

32
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,340
 What kind of high official would need to hide their identity? 

33
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,510
 I suspect the inscription is hidden inside this stone turtle. 

34
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,870
 Then why didn't he carve it openly on the outside, 

35
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,430
 but hid it instead, where no one would find it? 

36
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,110
 When Mom taught me, she mentioned a person who traveled everywhere, 

37
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,530
 using money to stir conflict among nations. 

38
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,310
 And if that didn't work, he'd assassinate them. 

39
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,210
 That man was Liu Xian, the former Senior Secretary. 

40
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,390
 He was used to hiding his true identity, 

41
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,190
 so naturally, he'd hide his inscription, too. 

42
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,070
 Let me check if it's really him. 

43
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,920
 It really is Liu Xian! 

44
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,390
 It's really Liu Xian's tomb! 
   

45
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,920
 Master. 

46
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,510
 We've finished checking Liu Xian's tomb tunnels. 

47
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,390
 It seems like they've been digging for several days. 

48
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,300
 They'll probably break through to the rear chamber in less than two days. 

49
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,660
 And the tunnel we used to get in is connected to the passage. 

50
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,290
 Luckily, the robbers died in the traps. 

51
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,700
 Otherwise, this place would be ruined. 

52
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
 They'll definitely keep digging. 

53
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,750
 Wait here and catch them all. 

54
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,120
 And don't forget to fill up every single tunnel. 

55
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,680
 Nothing here should be disturbed. 

56
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,720
 Yes. 

57
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,770
 The Imperial Astronomers are responsible 

58
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,000
 for restoring and protecting important tombs, 

59
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,390
 but we're forbidden from excavating on our own. 

60
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,900
 Understood. 

61
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,810
There are burned torches on the ground.

62
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
Here.

63
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,360
All cleaned out by tomb robbers.

64
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,000
Judging from the tunnels, three groups of robbers came here.

65
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,880
Some died in traps,

66
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,140
others died fighting each other.

67
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,680
Then could what we're looking for already be gone?

68
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,580
Split up and check around.

69
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,700
If you find anything strange, tell me immediately.

70
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,220
All right.

71
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,220
Be careful!

72
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,080
What's this thing?

73
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,680
Don't worry.

74
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,320
This is Liu Xian's inscription.

75
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,320
The coffin is empty.

76
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,770
Shi Lei, give me a hand.

77
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,340
What are you doing?

78
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,980
My father always said Imperial Astronomers

79
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,430
must show respect for every person's remains.

80
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,190
Even if we don't find what we're looking for,

81
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,620
we should still give them a proper burial.

82
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,140
Before we leave, restore the coffin to how it was.

83
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,770
Why is this pattern reversed?

84
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,896
   

85
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,030
Not even tomb robbers realized

86
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,820
there's another secret hidden in Liu Xian's tomb.

87
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,270
This carving knife was my father's favorite.

88
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,450
The handle of the knife has a chipped corner.

89
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,800
My father felt bad about it for a long time.

90
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,460
It seems this carving was secretly made by my father.

91
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,290
But if Master carved this,

92
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,200
why did he leave one character blank at the end?

93
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,570
"The way of the sage can be summed up in one word..."

94
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,170
"Human"?

95
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,930
Or...

96
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,560
"Victory"?

97
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,930
- Hey, stop! 
 - What's wrong?

98
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,900
There are so many scattered characters here, but he left only one blank.

99
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,520
I'm afraid that if we choose wrong, we won't get another chance.

100
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,950
Then, which character should we choose?

101
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,960
A word that can summarize Shan Yi Zi's entire life...

102
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,570
Shan Yi Zi?

103
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,320
Not Liu Xian?

104
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,120
Look carefully at this carving.

105
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,690
It describes a sage who cared deeply for the people.

106
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,690
These words couldn't describe Liu Xian.

107
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,960
They can only refer to his master, Shan Yi Zi.

108
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,350
Liu Xian wasn't capable of traveling to many states

109
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,510
and preserving peace, like Shan Yi Zi.

110
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,920
All Liu Xian could do was create conflicts through schemes and assassinations,

111
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,610
seeking his own benefit.

112
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,150
The thing he never understood is precisely this missing character.

113
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,530
"Virtue."

114
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,130
"Benevolence."

115
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,310
"Mercy."

116
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,080
"Harmony."

117
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,690
"Balance."

118
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,460
"The sage's way in one word is..."

119
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,610
   

120
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,010
Zhinu, is this the thing Master hid?

121
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,270
The one they fought over,

122
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,920
the thing that led them to destroy my entire family,

123
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,750
is it this?

124
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,160
Quick, take it out and see!

125
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,470
Shi Lei.

126
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,300
Be careful!

127
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,070
What... What is this thing?

128
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,430
This isn't what we were looking for.

129
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,230
This is a bronze tube my father made.

130
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,440
 Father, didn't you always want to make this? 

131
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,410
 Now that it's finished, why aren't you happy? 

132
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,440
 This bronze tube holds our ancestors' wisdom. 

133
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,270
 I studied ancient texts to find out how to make it. 

134
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,440
 But when it was finally completed, 

135
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,560
 I suddenly realized 

136
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,870
 I was too focused on its clever mechanisms 

137
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,850
 and overlooked that it's actually a weapon. 

138
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,870
 If it falls into the wrong hands, 

139
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,200
 the consequences could be disastrous. 

140
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,970
 Then let's hide it so no bad guys can find it. 

141
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,380
 Zhinu, you're very clever. 

142
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,870
 All right. We'll put it away for now 

143
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,900
 and find a place where no one will discover it. 

144
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,320
After that, I never saw this bronze tube again.

145
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,200
Only today did I realize

146
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,030
my father had hidden it here long ago.

147
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,380
Was it the day he returned from Dongxia?

148
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,200
No.

149
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,900
It must have been when I was young, the time he brought me here.

150
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,840
But if Master didn't visit here that day,

151
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,500
why did he take a detour home from the southwest?

152
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,290
Anyway, since Father didn't take the bronze tube,

153
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:42,760
the thing he brought from Dongxia won't be here either.

154
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,990
Let's go back. No need to search here anymore.

155
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,780
Let's go.

156
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:11,410
Zhinu, we didn't find the thing you're looking for.

157
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,130
What should we do next?

158
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,590
We didn't come away empty-handed.

159
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,540
This bronze tube is extremely powerful.

160
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,020
Compared to poisoning someone directly,

161
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,530
this tube gives us better chances to succeed.

162
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,070
Then let's kill him together.

163
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,320
I... I can help you.

164
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,870
No. We've only just reunited, and you're my only family now.

165
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,670
I can't let you risk your life with me.

166
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,770
But I can't let you go alone on such a dangerous mission!

167
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,550
Guan Feng, trust me.

168
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,950
I've already made a plan to escape safely.

169
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,860
Are you sure?

170
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,580
Once I'm done, we'll leave together.

171
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:01,250
We'll find a beautiful place, where no one knows us.

172
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,350
Zhinu.

173
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,990
You've always been smarter than me.

174
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,690
Your plan must be a good one.

175
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,440
But you must promise me to come back safely.

176
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,540
Don't worry. There's one more thing for you two.

177
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,140
Fill up this tunnel and pack it tight.

178
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,520
See you.

179
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:04,300
   

180
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,750
Sir, please deliver this letter to the gentleman in your storeroom.

181
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,520
All right.

182
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,869
   

183
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,210
Place it closer to the center.

184
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,730
Put the fruits on the sides.

185
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,140
Butler.

186
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,830
Mr. Zang.

187
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,030
Are the offerings for the late marquis all prepared?

188
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,810
Everything is ready. We're just waiting for the ceremony in the evening.

189
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,790
Good. You can continue your work.

190
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,520
Yes, sir.

191
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:34,660
 Father, I know you made this incredible device not to kill people, 

192
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,740
 but because you didn't want the technique lost. 

193
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,880
 You cherished this skill deeply 

194
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,450
 and never wanted it tainted by evil intent. 

195
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,400
 But, Father, I have no choice now. 

196
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,280
 It's in my hands, and I will use it to kill the Marquis of Pingjin, 

197
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,680
 to avenge you, Mother, my younger sister, 

198
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,960
 and all my fellow disciples! 

199
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,450
Mr. Zang.

200
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,640
What are you doing?

201
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,420
I was reconsidering the timing. Tonight's ceremony is at sunset.

202
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,520
Sunset corresponds to wine vessels and symbolizes a good harvest.

203
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,450
So, I moved the wine vessel to the left, to show respect.

204
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,920
I got some ashes on it. I was just cleaning them.

205
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,970
There's even a custom for this?

206
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,240
You're truly meticulous, sir.

207
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,730
It's my duty.

208
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,643
   

209
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,900
My Lord, it's time to light the incense.

210
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,480
Father, everything at home is well.

211
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
The Emperor still favors us greatly.

212
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,440
A few days ago, he praised Zhifu for his good work.

213
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,110
You can rest easy in the afterlife.

214
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,000
In a few days, on your death anniversary,

215
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,200
I'll take the family to the ancestral tombs

216
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,430
to offer wine and burn incense in honor of our ancestors.

217
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,380
I promise not to let you down.

218
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,630
I'll preserve our legacy and ensure our family's future.

219
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,140
   

220
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,400
Father!

221
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,680
- Father! 
 - My Lord!

222
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,880
- Father! 
 - My Lord!

223
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,240
- My Lord! 
 - Father!

224
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,070
My Lord!

225
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,680
- Father! 
 - My Lord!

226
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,000
Father!

227
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,690
Father!

228
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,440
Why isn't Zhixing here yet?

229
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,920
My Lord, I've sent someone to find him.

230
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Zhixing hasn't been home since yesterday.

231
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,680
He probably went somewhere to play.

232
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,400
 Why isn't the mechanism working? 

233
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,740
When he returns, he'll answer for it.

234
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,660
My Lord!

235
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,470
My Lord, honoring ancestors is a serious family tradition.

236
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,380
Perhaps we should wait for Second Young Master and do it together?

237
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,240
Why wait for him?

238
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,520
I don't want to see someone who has no respect for family tradition.

239
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,570
Without him today, our numbers of people are off.

240
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,650
The incense sticks in the burner aren't the lucky number nine.

241
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,900
Nine returns to unity.

242
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,070
I'm worried the late marquis might find it inauspicious in the afterlife.

243
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,690
My father was fearless in battle, bold and free.

244
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,000
He never believed in superstitions.

245
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,480
Even in the afterlife,

246
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,880
he wouldn't care about lucky numbers.

247
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,190
However, why are you so nervous?

248
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,560
You've been staring at the burner since just now.

249
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,430
Is something wrong?

250
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,380
My Lord...

251
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,940
My Lord,

252
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,510
Mr. Zang always plans carefully.

253
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,830
He just took care of arranging the ancestral hall

254
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,460
and specially selected the incense.

255
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,850
What's special about this incense?

256
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,310
My Lord, these incenses were chosen by Mr. Zang.

257
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,110
I noticed they are unusual.

258
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,400
There's a golden thread inside each.

259
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,790
So, I took the liberty of replacing them.

260
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,850
Mr. Zang, what is your intention here?

261
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,350
Forgive me, My Lord.

262
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,920
Today's ceremony honors the late marquis.

263
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,210
These incenses contain golden threads.

264
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,680
When burning the incense, fire melts gold,

265
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,010
which can dispel killing energy and military violence.

266
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,550
I boldly chose them for the prayers,

267
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,160
hoping the late marquis will bless us, ward off misfortune,

268
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,520
and ensure our family's prosperity.

269
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,690
- Zhuang Shan. 
 - Yes?

270
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,510
Check the incense burner.

271
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,940
Yes, sir.

272
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,350
If it's for the family's well-being,

273
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,420
why did you act on your own without consulting anyone?

274
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,140
My Lord, you're strong-willed and decisive.

275
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,110
I feared you wouldn't believe in these feng shui things and be annoyed,

276
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,030
so I acted on my own.

277
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,050
Please punish me, My Lord.

278
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,400
I was born with the fire element.

279
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,720
Why else could I achieve so many victories?

280
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,650
Zhuang Shan.

281
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,510
My Lord.

282
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,440
Zang Hai was thinking of our family's welfare.

283
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,510
You disrupted his good intentions.

284
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,930
You deserve punishment.

285
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,980
It was my fault. I acted foolishly.

286
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,110
Carry on.

287
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,770
   

288
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,900
 If the mechanism isn't in the burner, where could it be? 

289
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,560
 I placed it there at 3:00 p.m., but by 5:00 p.m., it was gone. 

290
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,510
 That's only two hours. 

291
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,920
 How could it just vanish? 

292
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,020
 Someone must have noticed my plot, 

293
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,510
 but clearly the Marquis doesn't know yet. 

294
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,880
 Could a servant have seen it 

295
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,000
 and thrown it away as something useless? 

296
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Or did someone take it, 

297
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,520
 waiting for the right moment to inform the Marquis? 

298
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,920
Sir, you're back.

299
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,750
Would you like some snacks?

300
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,710
No, I don't eat sweets. You can take them and share.

301
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,190
Thank you, sir.

302
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,110
Has the ancestral hall altar been cleaned up?

303
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,920
Yes, sir. It's all done.

304
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,200
The offerings were already shared out among the servants.

305
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,110
All ritual items are neatly stored.

306
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,240
The leftover garbage was moved to the backyard.

307
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,720
It'll be carted away soon.

308
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,400
All right. Understood. You may leave now.

309
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,800
Yes, sir.

310
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,050
Looking for something?

311
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,210
Is this what you're after?

312
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,510
Why do you want to kill him now?

313
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,810
I saw my parents.

314
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,880
They were skinned and tortured by the Marquis.

315
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,070
Their bodies were hidden in a secret chamber,

316
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,030
trampled underfoot.

317
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,240
They can't rest in peace even now.

318
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,480
Have you thought about how you'll escape?

319
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,510
My original plan was to flee in the chaos

320
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,920
before the guards sealed off the mansion.

321
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,700
But unexpectedly, the steward swapped my incense.

322
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,200
If you hadn't stepped in,

323
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,480
the Marquis would've discovered my plot today.

324
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,020
A mere steward wouldn't dare act alone.

325
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,830
The Marquis must have planned this long ago,

326
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,910
just waiting for you to fall into his trap.

327
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,510
Have you never considered the person who wants you to kill him

328
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,270
could be the Marquis himself?

329
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,310
 In a few days, it'll be my father's anniversary. 

330
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,070
 We'll hold a private ceremony first, 

331
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,720
 then visit the tombs. 
   

332
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,110
 Make your preparations. 

333
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,960
 Why did the Marquis move me into the inner courtyard? 

334
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,880
 Aides usually live in the Scholar Hall. 

335
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,030
 Even at Yang Zhen's peak, 

336
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,440
 he didn't get to live in the inner courtyard. 

337
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,510
 Those seated at this table are my most trusted men. 

338
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,510
 My Lord, lately in town, 
   

339
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,480
 there are rumors about me. 

340
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,550
 I've heard plenty of rumors. 

341
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,480
 They're just nonsense. 

342
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,970
 Don't pay attention. 

343
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,750
 These are all blueprints from the Ministry of Works. 

344
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,720
 The Marquis means in the future, 

345
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,200
 he wants you to assist Eldest Young Master more. 

346
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,480
 It shows he trusts you. 

347
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,690
 Getting close to him is easier now. 

348
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,160
 Once you're done with the congee, 

349
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,960
 go to my study and get "Wei Liao's Art of War." 

350
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,500
 The Marquis has just granted you free access to his study. 

351
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,240
So, the Marquis is testing me.

352
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,960
He lets me freely enter the treasury and study

353
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,240
just to make me lower my guard.

354
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,780
If you calm down now, you'll see it clearly.

355
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,880
The Marquis of Pingjin has many enemies.

356
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,000
Now you're his closest aide.

357
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,780
He just wants to see if you'll betray him under pressure.

358
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,750
Don't underestimate him.

359
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,030
And don't think you can easily outsmart him.

360
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,200
If he dies, you're doomed, too.

361
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:47,490
Killing the Marquis of Pingjin is the only reason I'm still alive.

362
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,240
 Come in. 

363
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,500
My Lord.

364
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,030
My Lord, I've made a huge mistake.

365
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,210
Please punish me!

366
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,180
What happened?

367
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,070
I received this recently.

368
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,400
I'm afraid someone believes the rumors

369
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,570
and is trying to blackmail me into harming you.

370
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,890
I was overconfident, thinking I could easily expose

371
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:00,000
this small-time trickster within two days.

372
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,770
I didn't want to trouble you with something so trivial.

373
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,190
But... But I'm useless.

374
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,670
Two days have passed without any clues.

375
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,300
Now, the three-day deadline written on this fan is near.

376
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,240
I'm worried they mean real harm,

377
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,220
and someone truly intends to hurt you.

378
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,920
So, I must inform you in time.

379
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,900
Since they could reach me, they might target others, too.

380
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,110
My Lord, please be extra cautious these days.

381
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,970
You're worried they'll hurt me,

382
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:41,990
but more afraid that they'll punish you instead if nothing happens in three days.

383
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,400
Forgive me, My Lord! I... I'm indeed afraid to die,

384
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,760
but I'm more afraid of putting you in danger.

385
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,060
You smart people always overthink things.

386
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,250
I've told you before,

387
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,900
don't worry so much.

388
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,440
Forget these silly rumors.

389
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,870
The number of people wanting me dead is too large to count.

390
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:19,560
But these cowards who hide their faces can't possibly harm me.

391
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,820
Now you're one of my trusted aides.

392
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,600
Naturally, they'll target you first.

393
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,920
Remember, I'm backing you now.

394
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,800
If anything comes up, don't keep it bottled up. Just speak up.

395
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,650
Thank you, My Lord! Then about this matter...

396
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,750
Enough. You can leave now.

397
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,160
I'll investigate this myself.

398
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,950
Yes, My Lord.

399
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,180
   

400
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,930
 Killing the Marquis of Pingjinis the only reason I'm still alive. 

401
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:42,880
 If you're blinded by hatred, you'll never get revenge. 

402
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,020
 Even if the Marquis dies by your hand, 

403
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:52,760
 you won't get another chance for a second or third strike. 

404
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,320
 Benefactor, you mean... 

405
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,650
 What if I told you the Marquis of Pingjin isn't your only enemy? 

406
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,060
 And there are others involved? 

407
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,900
 I've investigated the capital for years, 

408
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,380
 and found out the true masterminds 

409
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,340
 behind the destruction of the Kuai family. 

410
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:21,360
 Besides the Marquis of Pingjin, include two others. 

411
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,630
 These three conspired to seize the item 

412
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,080
 your father brought back from Dongxia. 

413
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:37,730
 So, your enemy isn't one person, but three. 

414
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,790
 Sir, I found a bronze fish in the Marquis's secret chamber. 

415
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,460
 A bronze fish? 

416
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:55,130
 I saw him take it from my father on the night my family was slaughtered. 

417
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:59,750
 But as I remember, there were three fish linked together. 

418
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,500
 That means 

419
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,430
 each of the three conspirators probably took one fish. 

420
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,360
 Who are they? 

421
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:16,580
 One is the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director, Cao Jingxian. 

422
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,730
 With immense power in his hands, he does whatever he wants. 

423
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,840
 He often frames court officials 

424
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,450
 to eliminate political rivals and expand his influence. 

425
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:33,000
 The Marquis of Pingjin allowed Qu Jiao to kill openly. 

426
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,040
 Guess why all the petitions against him  

427
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,900
 ended up in his mansion? 

428
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,360
 Cao Jingxian suppressed them? 

429
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,820
 They cover for each other. 

430
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,250
 Who's the third one? 

431
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:58,620
 I've been wondering for years how two unrelated people 

432
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,770
 suddenly allied overnight. 

433
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:08,400
 Ten years ago, the night the Marquis of Pingjin returned from Dongxia, 

434
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,400
 both he and Cao Jingxian left their residences. 

435
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,440
 The next day, the Kuai family was destroyed. 

436
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,000
 I'm certain they met the third conspirator that night. 

437
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 But this person is deeply hidden. 

438
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,880
 I've never found any clues about him. 

439
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:37,810
 The bronze fish you mentioned confirms he exists. 

440
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,530
 Please instruct me on what I should do. 

441
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,480
 If it were me, 

442
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:51,020
 I'd lay low and wait for the right moment. 

443
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,280
 I'm sorry, sir. I can't do that. 

444
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,590
 It seems Gao Ming didn't teach you how to keep calm. 

445
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:11,050
 Your mind is too restless. 

446
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,140
 Sir, you overestimate me. 

447
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,380
 I've hidden myself for ten years just to kill the Marquis of Pingjin. 

448
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,030
 I thought I'd finally gotten close enough, 

449
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:30,920
 and only needed one last strike to succeed. 

450
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,110
 But now, instead of gaining his trust, 

451
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,730
 I've gained two more enemies. 

452
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:44,200
 Every night, in my dreams, I see my parents' longing eyes. 

453
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,030
 Every day I live in unbearable torment. 

454
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,230
 I don't want them to wait forever. 

455
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,250
 But what I fear most isn't the waiting. 

456
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:02,110
 It's wasting my whole life, only to fail at revenge. 

457
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:07,280
 You could, of course, use all your strength to strike once. 

458
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,080
 But if the Marquis dies, the other two will know immediately. 

459
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,250
 Then you'll have no chance to approach them again. 

460
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,550
 You can kill the Marquis now and die afterward, 

461
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:26,340
 or swallow your anger for a bigger plan. 

462
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,040
 It's your choice. 

463
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,430
