00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:30,060

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,726
   

4
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,330
   

5
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,820
By Imperial decree,

6
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,350
all the assets of the Marquis of Pingjin Residence are to be seized by the national treasury.

7
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,150
All servants are to be sent to the army,

8
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,870
and the family will be detained in the manor to await punishment.

9
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,310
Take them all away!

10
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,340
 - My Lady, save us!  
 - Move!

11
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,900
- Move! 
  - My Lady! 

12
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,860
&lt;- Help us! 
 - My Lady, please save us!

13
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,610
- Hurry! 
  - Help us! 

14
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,500
 My Lady! 

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,700
 - My Lady, please!  
 - Keep moving!

16
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,100
 My Lady! 

17
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,250
 Help! 

18
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,460
One, two, three.

19
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,730
Mother...

20
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,780
I'm hungry.

21
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,990
Hungry again?

22
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,710
Mother, the ginger tea is ready.

23
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,890
Drink some to warm up.

24
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,780
Fu'er is hungry.

25
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,220
Quickly, feed him something.

26
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,020
More!

27
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,130
I want more!

28
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,260
Yue Rou.

29
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,460
Come here.

30
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,680
Take this bowl of ginger tea to your brother-in-law.

31
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,540
Go on.

32
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,740
Okay.

33
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,510
It's getting cold.

34
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,120
There are no servants left in the house,

35
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
so I made this myself.

36
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,420
Please, drink it while it's warm.

37
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,220
Thanks.

38
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,340
Mother, I want more milk cake.

39
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,630
Drink this soup first.

40
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,680
It's medicine.

41
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,830
But, Mother, I'm not sick.

42
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,920
Why do I have to take medicine?

43
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,090
It's not just you who is sick,

44
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,600
everyone is sick.

45
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,310
Even Father?

46
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,290
And you?

47
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,680
Your father...

48
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,290
He grew tired of us and cast us aside.

49
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,920
That made me very angry, so I made him sick.

50
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,500
And now, the whole family has fallen ill.

51
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,440
But I don't regret it at all.

52
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,150
Because everything...

53
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,150
has become relaxed,

54
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,170
simpler.

55
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,260
All right, Mother.

56
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,900
I'll drink it.

57
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,900
Mother, I finished it.

58
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,360
You should drink, too.

59
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,900
Once we drink it, our illness will be gone.

60
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,580
I'll drink it, too.

61
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,100
I'll drink it, too!

62
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,720
Yue Rou,

63
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,390
did you bring the ginger tea over?

64
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,480
I did.

65
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,560
I saved you a bowl, too.

66
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,390
Hurry up, drink it while it's warm.

67
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,760
Okay.

68
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,330
 Guards! 

69
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,560
 Lady Jiang Xiang, Zhuang Zhifu, and the others are dead! 

70
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,980
 Yes, sir! 

71
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,530
Your Majesty, Lady Jiang Xiang and Zhuang Zhifu of the Marquis of Pingjin Residence

72
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,120
took poison and ended their lives. 
    

73
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,360
Does Zhuang Luyin know?

74
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,320
Your Majesty, not yet.

75
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,630
Many have advised me to execute Zhuang Luyin.

76
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,480
What do you all think?

77
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,140
Your Majesty, Zhuang Luyin cheated in the imperial exams

78
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,260
and manipulated the border forces.

79
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,460
Even death wouldn't be sufficient.

80
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,790
Your Majesty, the Zhuang family has served the nation for generations.

81
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,640
If you execute Zhuang Luyin like that, it may break the faith of the troops.

82
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,570
So what if he has merits?

83
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,670
What we fear is that it breeds arrogance.

84
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,720
Your Majesty, if you don't punish him severely now,

85
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,000
it'll spiral out of control.

86
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,050
   

87
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,870
By the Emperor's command:

88
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,250
"Zhuang Luyin embezzled national funds and stole from the people, abusing power for personal gain,

89
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,550
sold official positions, manipulated the system,

90
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,150
deceived the throne, betrayed imperial trust,

91
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,080
and showed disloyalty to the nation. His crimes

92
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,120
are grave and undeniable.

93
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,870
He is hereby stripped of his title, reduced to commoner status,

94
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,630
and his hereditary nobility is abolished."

95
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,920
That is all.

96
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,100
Where is my family?

97
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,160
Commoner Jiang Xiang and her son Zhuang Zhifu took poison and committed suicide yesterday.

98
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,820
- They passed away this morning... 
 - What about my heir?

99
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,840
He's under house arrest, awaiting judgment.

100
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,180
My Lord, I'm sorry for your loss.

101
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,940
It's mealtime.

102
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Zhuang Luyin! What are you doing?

103
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,440
My wife, Zhifu...

104
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,630
I've failed you.

105
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll join you now.

106
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,960
You've lost your mind!

107
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,100
My Lord...

108
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,720
Even if you kill me, you won't get out.

109
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,270
You know it.

110
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,480
Not only will I not kill you,

111
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,590
I can also reward you handsomely.

112
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,480
Help me send a letter out.

113
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,860
Sending a letter out is punishable by death.

114
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,740
Then I'll kill you right now.

115
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,740
I'll do it!

116
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,410
I'll send it, I will!

117
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,650
Deliver this letter to the Seal-Holding Eunuch, Eunuch Cao.

118
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,940
If you fail,

119
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:17,150
I'll surely have a way to ensure that no one in your family survives.

120
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,400
Got it!

121
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,966
   

122
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,600
Where are you going?

123
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,030
That's none of your business.

124
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,870
You're sneaking around outside Eunuch Cao's house.

125
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,180
Do you really think it's none of our business?

126
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,270
Sirs, I'm sorry.

127
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,980
I'm ignorant. I didn't realize you served Mr. Cao.

128
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,320
Enough nonsense.

129
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,100
Tell us the truth. Why are you here?

130
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,220
Sir...

131
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,360
I'm the jailer watching over the Marquis of Pingjin.

132
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,270
He wanted me to deliver a letter to Eunuch Cao.

133
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,750
A letter?

134
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,740
Where is it?

135
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,870
With me.

136
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,140
Hand it over.

137
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,330
- Well... 
 - You've got a death wish?

138
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,320
Please, sir... Sir...

139
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,520
A blood-written letter?

140
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,360
Fine. You can go. We'll deliver it to Eunuch Cao. Go.

141
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,510
- Get going. 
 - Sir!

142
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,960
- Just go! 
 - Please forgive me.

143
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,750
I must deliver it myself.

144
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,920
I really have no choice.

145
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,000
Since it's for Eunuch Cao, we won't stop you.

146
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,630
Thank you, sirs.

147
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,000
Move along now.

148
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,630
Hurry up!

149
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,830
Done.

150
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,600
 We were both fooled by Zang Hai. 

151
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,270
 He's the last of the Kuai family. 

152
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,670
 Come to me immediately. 

153
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,040
Just as Xiao Hai predicted.

154
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,050
 Clear my name, restore my title, 

155
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,970
 or the Kuai family matter will reach His Majesty. 

156
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,000
Where did this blood letter come from?

157
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,390
Someone showed up at our door,

158
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,440
said he was the guard watching over Zhuang Luyin,

159
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,610
and sent to deliver the letter on his behalf.

160
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,150
- A prison guard? 
 - Yes.

161
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,790
I investigated. He is indeed a prison guard.

162
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,150
Zhuang Luyin told him,

163
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,360
if he failed to deliver it, his whole family would die.

164
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,000
The one who's family should die most is Zhuang Luyin's!

165
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
Want me to take care of him now?

166
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,810
No.

167
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,030
Now everyone knows I want him dead.

168
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:16,870
If he dies in that prison, there's no way it won't get traced back to me.

169
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,910
Zhuang Luyin...

170
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,370
you're trying to use this to threaten me?

171
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,100
Seems you already know...

172
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,220
your days are numbered.

173
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,080
Since...

174
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,320
you show no mercy,

175
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,550
don't blame me for showing none either.

176
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,630
- Lu Ran. 
 - Here.

177
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,430
Copy Zhuang Luyin's handwriting immediately

178
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,750
and write a blood letter.

179
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,810
Get someone to pose as a prison guard and send it to Muji Camp.

180
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,240
- Deliver it directly to Zhang Lang. 
 - Father, what's your plan?

181
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,320
I'm helping His Majesty eliminate a major threat!

182
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,420
What did the Marquis say?

183
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,440
The Marquis said he's been framed by traitors.

184
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,210
And that at midnight tonight, we're to rescue him with our men.

185
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,590
It's definitely his handwriting.

186
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,200
Zhang Mao.

187
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,600
Take 50 men with you. You'll lead the charge.

188
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,260
Go in disguise, break into the prison, and get the Marquis out!

189
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,480
- Yes, sir! 
 - Lan Yongji.

190
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,910
Take 80 men and scatter them throughout the city.

191
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,550
Make sure the city gates are opened!

192
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,550
Yes, sir!

193
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,910
I'll wait with 300 men outside the city.

194
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,150
If anything goes wrong, use fireworks as a signal.

195
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,000
Then I'll lead the army in to break the siege.

196
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,010
- Go now! 
 - Yes, sir!

197
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,530
The Marquis said you'd be rewarded

198
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,030
once the letter was delivered. Right?

199
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,130
Yes. He said I'd get it as long as the letter was delivered.

200
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,320
Take him to collect it.

201
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,100
Thank you, General!

202
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,182
   

203
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,630
Why the sudden appearance?

204
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,620
And why haven't you said a word since coming?

205
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,590
Let me sit here a while.

206
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,320
Can I?

207
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,200
 This humble hut is fragrant with virtue. 

208
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,830
 Moss greens the steps..." 

209
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,680
 When I'm not home, be good and listen to your mother. 

210
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,110
 Take care of your sister. 

211
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,350
 No common fools among my guests. 

212
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,340
 Here, I pluck the quiet zither, read golden scriptures... 

213
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,390
 When I return, I'll make you a bigger one. Okay? 

214
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,400
 Feel no bureaucratic strain. 

215
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,760
 Like Zhuge Liang's cottage in Nanyang... 

216
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,140
After tonight,

217
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,000
my family's first great grudge...

218
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,720
will finally be avenged.

219
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,763
   

220
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,200
â™ª  Sharp knives, large bows  â™ª

221
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,590
â™ª  Commanding Jiangdong  â™ª

222
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,730
â™ª  Chariots flow like water, horses surge like dragons  â™ª

223
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,860
â™ª  I gaze proudly at my empire  â™ª

224
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,900
â™ª  The flute sends along a fragrant wind  â™ª

225
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,210
â™ª  Countless banners rise like clouds  â™ª

226
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:10,830
â™ª  Suzhou Tower, draped in rich silk  â™ª

227
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:18,930
â™ª  Tonight, I feast in splendor  â™ª

228
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,270
â™ª  Sharp knives, large bows   â™ª

229
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,400
Brothers, let's go and rescue the Marquis!

230
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,650
â™ª  Chariots flow like water, horses surge like dragons  â™ª

231
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,200
â™ª  I gaze proudly at my empire  â™ª

232
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,490
â™ª  The flute sends along a fragrant wind  â™ª 
    

233
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,300
â™ª  Countless banners rise like clouds  â™ª

234
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,110
â™ª  Suzhou Tower, draped in rich silk  â™ª

235
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,420
â™ª  Tonight, I feast in splendor...  â™ª

236
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,900
Father, Muji Camp troops have entered the capital.

237
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,440
No one's stopped them.

238
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,680
Per your instructions, I've pulled the heavy guards from the prison.

239
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,750
In no time at all, they'll break Zhuang Luyin out.

240
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,170
What about Zhuang Zhixing?

241
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,140
Lu Yan's already there.

242
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,400
You want Zhuang Zhixing and Zhuang Luyin to reunite?

243
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,920
Leave no loose ends.

244
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,720
Zhuang Luyin's a traitor.

245
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,630
His son can't be left out of it!

246
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,540
â™ª  Cockfight reservoir bristles with weapons  â™ª

247
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,200
â™ª  Running Dog Pond roars with war cries  â™ª

248
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,380
â™ª  Fine robes hang loose, flowered caps thick with fur  â™ª

249
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,350
â™ª  Golden whips gleam, jade reins on swift horses...  â™ª

250
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,760
Who's there?

251
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,550
â™ª  Surrounded by escorts front and rear...  â™ª

252
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,160
Who's out there?

253
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,940
â™ª  Seeking feathers, chasing flowers, wandering freely...  â™ª

254
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,050
My Lord!

255
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,700
Please forgive my late arrival.

256
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,280
Zhang Mao?

257
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,450
Who sent you?

258
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,790
The moment we got your message, we rushed here.

259
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,980
My Lord, you've suffered.

260
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,930
Who delivered the message?

261
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,410
A prison guard watching over you.

262
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,350
He's already been executed.

263
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,380
My Lord, what is it?

264
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,390
Is something wrong?

265
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,420
I asked for Cao Jingxian.

266
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,230
And yet you were the ones who came!

267
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,100
My Lord, didn't you ask us to come?

268
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,730
Is this a trap?

269
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,410
His Majesty was going to spare my life.

270
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,780
But now that you're here, I'm as good as dead!

271
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,190
My Lord, then what do we do now?

272
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,490
How many men did you bring?

273
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,780
Lan Yongji has 80 men stationed around the city waiting to take you.

274
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,860
Zhang Lang has 300 outside the walls.

275
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,860
We're waiting for your command.

276
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,520
At this point,

277
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,180
there's only one way out,

278
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,140
a single shot at survival.

279
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,170
We swear our loyalty to you!

280
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,300
Good!

281
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,620
Then follow me into the palace.

282
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,650
Clear the Emperor's side.

283
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,340
We'll clear our name with His Majesty.

284
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,960
Yes, sir!

285
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,180
 - Greetings, My Lord! 
 - Greetings, My Lord! 

286
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,920
Send word to Lan Yongji and Zhang Lang.

287
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,450
Tell them to regroup now.

288
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,840
Yes, sir!

289
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,380
Everyone, follow me to save the Marquis!

290
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,420
Charge!

291
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:55,068
   

292
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,120
- Open the gate! 
 - Yes, sir!

293
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,561
   

294
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,190
Protect the Marquis!

295
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,450
Zhuang Luyin, what are you doing?

296
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,750
Escaping and gathering troops? Are you trying to rebel?

297
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,970
What I'm doing is for His Majesty.

298
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,490
For Great Yong.

299
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,400
I don't care who sent you, step aside!

300
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,730
Commoner Zhuang Luyin has escaped and rebelled!

301
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,210
Kill on sight!

302
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,490
You want to kill me?

303
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,150
The bow!

304
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,690
Kill them all.

305
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,460
Leave no one alive.

306
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,900
Second Young Master!

307
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,730
Uncle Zhang Lang?

308
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,100
What are you doing here?

309
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
What's going on?

310
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,300
No time to explain!

311
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,400
Come with us to meet the Marquis!

312
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,620
Get on the horse and catch up!

313
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,210
You?

314
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,300
What are you doing here?

315
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,650
Listen to me. Leave the city immediately.

316
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,410
Don't get caught up in this mess.

317
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,550
What's going on?

318
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,970
Those men were from Muji Camp, right?

319
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,730
They must be here to rescue your father.

320
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,210
There's going to be a fierce battle tonight.

321
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,050
And your showing up here now is no coincidence.

322
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,410
Someone tried to kill me at the Marquis' Residence.

323
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,380
I chased him out, and the fireworks led me here.

324
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,900
It was someone from Cao Jingxian's side.

325
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,380
He wants you and your father to die in tonight's chaos.

326
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,550
Leave the capital now while you can.

327
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,900
Don't come back until this is over.

328
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,210
Here, take this.

329
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,240
This money should be enough to get by out there for a while.

330
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,210
Go, now!

331
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,040
What about my father?

332
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,780
He's beyond saving.

333
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,970
Only if you leave now will you have a chance.

334
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,690
If you stay in the capital, you will die.

335
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,290
Move now!

336
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,510
My Lord! Forgive my delay!

337
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,290
You're right on time!

338
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,650
Everyone, the court is ruled by traitors.

339
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,820
I was framed and betrayed.

340
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,210
I owe you my life today.

341
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,530
All of you, follow me to fight our way into the palace!

342
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,860
Clear the Emperor's side!

343
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,520
 Clear the Emperor's side! 

344
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,470
Father.

345
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,730
How's it going with the Imperial Guards?

346
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,040
We sent someone to disguise as a prison guard to warn them.

347
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,100
Zhuang Luyin...

348
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,880
Get ready to send yourself to your death.

349
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,960
Tonight, I'll make sure His Majesty doesn't sleep!

350
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,550
â™ª  Cavalry lined in perfect rows  â™ª

351
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,180
â™ª  Foot soldiers packed closely  â™ª

352
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,570
â™ª  Raising the banners on the western outskirts  â™ª

353
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,150
â™ª  Red silk canopies and embroidered parasols  â™ª

354
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,840
â™ª  Hoping for our emperor's early arrival  â™ª

355
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,380
â™ª  Wearing dragon robes, a golden belt  â™ª

356
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,860
â™ª  Thousands gather in formation  â™ª

357
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,280
â™ª  Countless voices roar chaotically  â™ª

358
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,360
â™ª  Noisy as rivers churning, seas overturning  â™ª

359
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,630
â™ª  As rivers churning, seas overturning  â™ª

360
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,800
â™ª  Dogs race swift, hawks dive fast  â™ª

361
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,810
â™ª  Dogs race swift, hawks dive fast  â™ª

362
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,230
 Kill! 

363
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,780
Get ready to fight!

364
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,030
 Kill! 

365
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,110
 Kill! 

366
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,140
 Kill! 

367
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,400
Zhuang Luyin! You've got some nerve!

368
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,070
I'm coming to the palace to clear my name!

369
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,710
And you bring troops with you to meet the Emperor?

370
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,820
This is rebellion!

371
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,880
Everyone, listen to my command!

372
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,180
Take the gate!

373
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,510
Clear the Emperor's side!

374
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,860
Clear the Emperor's side!

375
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,010
 Kill! 

376
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,250
Release the arrows!

377
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,070
 Your Majesty! 

378
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:02,760
 Your Majesty! Zhuang Luyin has been broken out of prison. 

379
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,670
 He's leading troops toward the palace! 

380
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,440
 Your Majesty! 

381
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,340
Close the gate!

382
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,140
Hurry!

383
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,360
Fire!

384
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,940
Raise the shields!

385
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,920
Archers!

386
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,740
Report!

387
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,630
Commander Xue! Muji Camp's assault is too fierce!

388
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,110
We can't hold them much longer!

389
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,560
Have everyone hold the line!

390
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,890
Storm the palace!

391
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,880
Break it down!

392
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,680
Zhuang Luyin!

393
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,920
Zang Hai!

394
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:07,260
I told you, if I saw you again, I'd kill you!

395
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,370
And now, you walk right into my blade!

396
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,630
Stop!

397
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,270
Everyone, stop!

398
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,140
Stop!

399
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,110
Second Young Master?

400
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,040
Lan Yongji!

401
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,030
Why are you doing this?

402
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,750
Father...

403
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,670
Surrender.

404
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,780
What did you say?

405
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,000
Do you realize what surrender means?

406
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,050
You'll have the Zhuang family branded as traitors!

407
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,740
I had no choice.

408
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,980
Once we're inside the palace, I have a plan to explain things to His Majesty!

409
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,180
But how is this not rebellion?

410
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,700
The Zhuang family has always been loyal.

411
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,610
You're determined to bring shame upon the family, reducing our honor to rubble!

412
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,880
I really misjudged you.

413
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,940
You're still the same useless coward.

414
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:32,030
Either fight with me or get out of my way!

415
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,170
Father, you're forcing the Emperor's hand!

416
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,840
His Majesty will never forgive you!

417
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,960
To break into the palace, you'll have to step over my dead body to get there!

418
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,800
You ungrateful son!

419
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,290
You think I won't?

420
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:57,590
You dare defy me!

421
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:15,950
