00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,621
   

4
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,960
Get ready.

5
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,900
One.

6
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,660
Two.

7
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,310
Three!

8
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,940
My eyes!

9
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,220
- My legs! 
 - I can't see!

10
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,770
Nobody move!

11
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,040
I'll think of something!

12
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,610
Sir, there's no way out for the two of us.

13
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,960
Forget about us.

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,820
- Just go! 
 - There has to be a way.

15
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,220
- Trust me. I'll find a way out! 
 - Sir...

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,420
Marquis of Pingjin...

17
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,110
You bastard!

18
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,030
I'll haunt you even after death!

19
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,130
Sir, someone's coming out!

20
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,310
Go. Report to His Lordship.

21
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,730
Yes, sir!

22
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,800
You! Get over here!

23
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,620
I, humble commoner Zang Hai, greets you.

24
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,230
How did you know how to disarm the traps in the imperial tomb?

25
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,720
The tomb's construction was top secret.

26
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,060
Only the artisans who built it knew the details.

27
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,520
Could it be you're one of their descendants

28
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,420
and plan to rob the tomb?

29
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,460
Official, I'm confused.

30
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,790
You seek a feng shui master who can make it out alive from the tomb,

31
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,260
yet you question their credibility.

32
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,770
Do you not believe in feng shui?

33
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,160
That's enough of your clever talk!

34
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,580
Speak! How did you get out?

35
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,020
I only figured out the Bone-Cutting Wires inside the tomb.

36
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,850
It's a rare mechanism,

37
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,700
so it had to be arranged in a special pattern.

38
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,840
The tomb passage is guarded by the Wing-Chariot Beast.

39
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,090
Naturally, it's based on the Nine-Star Layout.

40
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,150
So, the Bone-Cutting Wires follow the same logic.

41
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,220
You actually know the Nine-Star Layout?

42
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,970
That's a secret technique used only for imperial tombs.

43
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,650
We humble craftsmen only understand a little.

44
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,510
Of course, we're no match for you officials.

45
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,350
I merely made a wild guess in a life-or-death moment.

46
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,620
Thanks to divine mercy, I made it out.

47
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,120
Folk knowledge can't possibly compare with official doctrine.

48
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,020
If your jumbled theories

49
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,990
can even brush against the edges of geomancy,

50
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,040
then consider yourself lucky. But...

51
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,100
His Lordship has arrived!

52
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,170
So, you solved the tomb traps?

53
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,910
Yes, My Lord.

54
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,540
Step forward.

55
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,870
I, humble commoner Zang Hai, greets Your Lordship.

56
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,460
Then tell me, do you have a way to handle the Empress Dowager's burial?

57
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,820
Yes.

58
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,560
My Lord.

59
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,020
This man's background is unclear.

60
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,770
Letting him handle it could be risky.

61
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,120
If he made it out of the tomb, he must have some skill.

62
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,040
Let's hear your solution.

63
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,160
Your Lordship, the Empress Dowager's burial

64
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,220
can be resolved after a heavy rain.

65
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,630
Why after rain, specifically?

66
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,620
Thunder above, water below. It forms the Hexagram of Liberation.

67
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,770
It symbolizes easing danger and tension.

68
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,420
When thunder and rain gather energy,

69
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,460
any stalemate will naturally break.

70
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,290
Will it rain today?

71
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,670
This place is surrounded by mountains, shaped like a screen.

72
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,620
And it's early summer. Warm southern air is moving in.

73
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,940
Today, I noticed moist foliage.

74
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,190
Warm air rising, and cool air sinking,

75
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,460
clouds and rain will surge like thousands of horses.

76
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,270
Is he right?

77
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,340
It is indeed humid today,

78
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,010
but there's no sign of energy convergence.

79
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,660
By our calculations, rain today is a fifty-fifty chance.

80
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,680
Before the Shen* hour, it will rain for sure. 
  (*3:00 p.m.) 

81
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,410
We at the Imperial Astronomical Bureau serve the court.

82
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,260
We must speak with caution.

83
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,530
Not like you back-alley mystics,

84
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,500
twisting 50 percent probabilities into absolute certainty.

85
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,200
It's not 50 percent. It's 100 percent.

86
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,100
The rain will definitely fall today.

87
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,070
Go outside the tomb and summon Eunuch Sun!

88
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,510
Yes, sir!

89
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,670
Eunuch Sun has arrived!

90
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,810
The weather was fine.

91
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,120
But when I got to the gate, it started pouring.

92
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,840
My Lord, I heard someone has disarmed the imperial tomb's traps.

93
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,530
They must have a solution.

94
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,730
We were just talking about that.

95
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,930
You were right. The rain has fallen.

96
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,570
So, what's your plan to solve the burial dilemma?

97
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,260
Your Lordship, this matter has already been resolved.

98
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,530
It's just that... I don't dare say it aloud.

99
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,500
Quit stalling. Speak!

100
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,290
On my way here, I dozed off.

101
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,680
And in that sleep, Dowager Noble Consort Li appeared to me in a dream.

102
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,430
She said the love between the late emperor and Empress Dowager

103
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,210
moved the heavens.

104
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,570
She wished to fulfill their wish to be buried together.

105
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,530
You country bumpkin,

106
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,860
why would the Dowager Noble Consort appear to you?

107
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,930
In the tomb earlier, I faced deadly traps.

108
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,050
If not for her protection, how else could I have come out unscathed?

109
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,610
- Watch your tongue! 
 - Let him speak!

110
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,030
But a joint burial is a major feng shui matter,

111
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,250
especially in an imperial tomb.

112
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,070
If it defies heaven's will,

113
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,650
at best, the spirits won't rest.

114
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,410
At worst, it'll shake the dynasty's foundation.

115
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,930
So, we must light ever-burning lamps

116
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,690
across five sites; east, west, south, north, and center

117
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,260
of the Great Yong territory.

118
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,020
Then the imperial descendants must guard the lamps for 49 days.

119
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,570
Only then can the realm remain stable.

120
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,140
For 300 years, whenever an emperor or empress passed,

121
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,740
the imperial family would be summoned back to the capital.

122
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:29,570
But the Dowager Noble Consort says the princes need not return this time?

123
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,340
They can't return.

124
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,260
To ensure Great Yong's future,

125
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,410
the sacred lamps must be lit by imperial hands.

126
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,380
Especially the Prince of Linzi, who guards the Eastern Azure Dragon position.

127
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,680
Whenever an emperor or empress dies,

128
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,950
that star position becomes unstable.

129
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,800
So, Prince of Linzi must personally hold the line.

130
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,380
So, you're saying the Dowager Noble Consort told you all this in a dream?

131
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,620
How do we know you're not making it all up?

132
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,100
Every word I said is true.

133
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,930
Dowager Noble Consort Li loved her son deeply,

134
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,630
but she also understood the greater good.

135
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,710
She didn't want to burden His Majesty, so she chose to move aside

136
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,510
and let the Empress Dowager be buried with the late emperor.

137
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,790
She'll show a sign before noon tomorrow.

138
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,480
My Lord, why not wait a little longer?

139
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,690
By tomorrow, all will be clear.

140
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,170
You want me to wait for you?

141
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,930
Based on what?

142
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,690
Just your worthless life?

143
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,570
This life of mine is nothing.

144
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,860
But if Your Lordship has no better option,

145
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,010
why not bet on me?

146
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,740
Eunuch Sun, what do you think?

147
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,790
Since the Dowager Noble Consort had sent a dream,

148
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,910
I'll return and wait quietly.

149
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,620
If something really happens tomorrow,

150
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,080
I'll report it truthfully to His Majesty and let him decide.

151
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,160
Thank you, Eunuch Sun.

152
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,100
Do you know who that eunuch is?

153
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,400
My Lord, he...

154
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,960
he serves His Majesty directly.

155
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,500
That's right.

156
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,790
All the previous feng shui masters gave their suggestions,

157
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,570
but Eunuch Sun never even moved.

158
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,620
But this time, he actually listened to your words.

159
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,360
Do you know why?

160
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:46,160
Maybe His Majesty already had something in mind.

161
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,460
You're really clever.

162
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,100
But talk is talk.

163
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,340
What matters is the result.

164
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,530
My Lord, I have one more request.

165
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,930
May I enter the inner hall?

166
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,450
I'd like to deliver a message to Dowager Noble Consort Li.

167
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,050
You think someone like you

168
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,770
can just stroll into the inner hall?

169
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,650
- Take him in. 
 - My Lord...

170
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,310
No need to say more.

171
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:25,320
Let's see if the Dowager Noble Consort really shows a sign tomorrow.

172
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,220
Follow me.

173
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,530
Qu Jiao, look into his background.

174
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,880
Yes, sir.

175
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,980
This is the tomb chamber.

176
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,570
The larger coffin belongs to the late emperor.

177
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,360
The smaller one is Dowager Noble Consort Li's.

178
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,340
To be here is a rare honor.

179
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,490
Even if you die tomorrow, your life wouldn't be wasted.

180
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,650
Official, may I ask, why is it so damp in this hall?

181
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,800
What underground place isn't damp?

182
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,190
You clearly don't have much experience.

183
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,010
Seen enough?

184
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,080
Please wait a moment, Official.

185
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,270
I'd like to bow to the Dowager Noble Consort and report something.

186
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,670
Zang Hai, humble commoner, kneels before the Dowager Noble Consort.

187
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,900
Thank you, Your Grace, for sparing my life in great peril.

188
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,650
You're bowing the wrong way.

189
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,660
If you disturb her peace, can you bear the consequences?

190
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,260
I've passed on your wish.

191
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,450
I didn't fail your trust.

192
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,620
That's enough. Let's go.

193
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,120
Yes.

194
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,200
Once the incense burns out, noon will have passed.

195
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,240
If the Dowager Noble Consort still shows no sign,

196
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,120
you'll be buried with her.

197
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,600
Please rest assured, My Lord.

198
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,830
Dowager Noble Consort Li will show a sign.

199
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,550
My Lord! The Dowager Noble Consort's coffin just caved forward!

200
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,620
Congratulations to His Majesty and Your Lordship!

201
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,420
Dowager Noble Consort Li is kind and virtuous.

202
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,620
This is her way of fulfilling

203
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,060
the late emperor and Empress Dowager's wish!

204
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,550
Thank you, Dowager Noble Consort, for making it happen!

205
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,600
Thank you, Dowager Noble Consort!

206
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,890
 Thank you, Dowager Noble Consort! 

207
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,860
You've helped me settle one of His Majesty's concerns.

208
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,060
What reward do you want?

209
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,790
Helping Your Lordship is my duty as a humble subject.

210
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,130
I dare not ask for a reward.

211
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,910
Since you don't want a reward,

212
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,950
then let me count your crimes instead.

213
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,420
You do know tampering with imperial burial rites is a capital offense?

214
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,600
My Lord, I wouldn't dare!

215
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,110
How about this...

216
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,620
I'll show both kindness and authority:

217
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,380
kill you first,

218
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,670
then reward you with a fine coffin and silver for burial.

219
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,680
My Lord!

220
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,300
I came here willingly, not as a prisoner.

221
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,480
But does Your Lordship know why I insisted on coming?

222
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,040
To show off how clever you are?

223
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,090
But clever men die young.

224
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,300
The brighter they are, the shorter they live.

225
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,350
I came hoping Your Lordship would spare me a meal.

226
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,810
I wish to follow Your Lordship and serve faithfully!

227
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,690
Plenty want to serve me.

228
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,860
Why should I choose you?

229
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,320
Your eldest son serves in the Ministry of Works and is overburdened.

230
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,220
I'm willing to dedicate my life to the arts of architecture and geomancy,

231
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,480
to serve Your Lordship and your son to the bitter end!

232
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,370
My Lord.

233
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,000
- Speak. 
 - We've looked into him.

234
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,340
Born in Wenzhou Prefecture.

235
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,910
Orphaned at eight.

236
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,410
Drifted to Qingquan Town in Jiangning.

237
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,180
Apprenticed to a carpenter.

238
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,690
A recent fire left him homeless.

239
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,280
So, he headed north to find work.

240
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,960
He arrived in the capital just a few days ago.

241
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,770
Keep him.

242
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,250
Much obliged, My Lord!

243
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,020
Report to the Marquis's residence without delay.

244
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,500
My Lord, I have one more request.

245
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,810
The others who came with me perished in the tomb.

246
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,540
If Your Lordship could offer them a token of respect,

247
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,190
they would surely be grateful in the afterlife!

248
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:39,090
   

249
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,450
I'm Zang Hai, the new aide.

250
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,640
Please announce my arrival.

251
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,090
Hold on.

252
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,950
   

253
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,240
You're Zang Hai?

254
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,520
Yes, that's me.

255
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,200
Here are your robes and badge.

256
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,650
Pack your things.

257
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,690
You'll report to the back gate's Scholar Hall tomorrow.

258
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,120
Understood.

259
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,540
   

260
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,970
My dear disciple!

261
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,610
With just one move, you helped His Majesty solve a major dilemma.

262
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,040
It was Dowager Noble Consort Li who showed a sign and shifted her coffin.

263
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,060
That way, His Majesty won the court's support

264
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,430
without losing the people's favor.

265
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,650
You had the imperial family light lamps in five directions,

266
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,410
which gave His Majesty an excuse

267
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,930
to keep the princes mourning in their own fiefdoms,

268
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,750
especially Prince of Linzi.

269
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,930
If he returned to the capital for the funeral, he might've stirred up trouble.

270
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,150
But you've fundamentally eliminated the risk of rebellion.

271
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,140
Even now, I can't figure out how just one heavy rain

272
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,940
made the Dowager Noble Consort's coffin collapse forward like that.

273
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,220
Tell me the trick.

274
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,720
It's not as complicated as you think.

275
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,970
When I entered the tomb hall,

276
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,580
I noticed severe groundwater seepage.

277
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,860
The Dragon Vein Shaft and the coffin were already corroded.

278
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,970
And the coffin anchoring stones weren't properly joined.

279
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,910
If just then, a wedge of lightning-struck wood

280
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,340
was inserted underneath, it would unbalance the coffin.

281
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,980
Plus, a heavy rain brought rising ground moisture.

282
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,300
Under that weight,

283
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,950
Dowager Noble Consort Li showing a sign was only natural.

284
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,490
You really did inherit Xing Dou's teachings.

285
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:07,270
What I didn't expect was how deep corruption runs in the court.

286
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,200
Even an imperial tomb gets shortchanged with shoddy work.

287
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,810
Now that it's exposed, they might finally fix it properly.

288
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,380
Even the funds for the Emperor's tomb get embezzled.

289
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,690
Don't be fooled by their bows and chants before the throne.

290
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:23,000
They're all scheming for personal gain.

291
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
If my father were still alive,

292
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,310
seeing today's filthy, corrupted Astronomical Bureau,

293
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,600
it would break his heart.

294
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,580
In any case, you made a brilliant first step.

295
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,080
You really impressed the Marquis of Pingjin.

296
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,580
What's wrong?

297
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,930
Yesterday, the Marquis put his hand on my shoulder,

298
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,630
and I couldn't even lift my arm.

299
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,640
Let me massage it for you.

300
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,860
Master, easy!

301
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,700
Come on, bear with it.

302
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,380
Now I finally get why my benefactor

303
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,100
didn't want me learning martial arts.

304
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,100
For the Marquis to let me get that close,

305
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,000
he must have absolute confidence in his skills.

306
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,480
But he chose to press hard on my shoulder.

307
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,140
It shows just how cautious and suspicious he is.

308
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,010
He's surrounded by elite guards,

309
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,350
and always wears golden-threaded soft armor.

310
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,040
Even the top fighters in Great Yong might not be able to get close to him.

311
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,970
Even if you knew martial arts,

312
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,260
your sword would still be sheathed

313
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,950
before he struck you down.

314
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,910
Relying on brute force...

315
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,480
would be the worst plan.

316
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
Forget it.

317
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,690
At least I've made it into the Marquis's household.

318
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,200
I'll take my time and think long-term.

319
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,410
Once I'm inside, I'll study everything carefully

320
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,620
and wait for the right chance.

321
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,690
If you need me, come to the inn.

322
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,710
But stay out of sight.

323
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,620
Master, when I'm not around, what do you usually do?

324
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,750
If you weren't my master, where would you be,

325
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,520
and what would you be doing?

326
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,340
Of course, I've got my own life.

327
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,100
If I weren't helping you seek revenge,

328
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,480
I'd be living carefree!

329
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,310
Before I left, Master Xing Dou told me.

330
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,590
You're the one to ask about my benefactor

331
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,620
and the other three masters.

332
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,860
Want to know?

333
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
- Then this meal is on you. 
 - I...

334
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,620
Master, I'm still young and broke.

335
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,830
Well, I'm old and still empty-handed.

336
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,900
Isn't that even sadder?

337
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,160
Hand it over.

338
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,520
You...

339
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,390
Fine.

340
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,260
Now can you tell me?

341
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,560
Of course I can.

342
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,500
But not just yet.

343
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,250
- Hey! 
 - You tricked me again!

344
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,340
- Give my money back! 
 - All's fair in war and strategy.

345
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,280
The older, the craftier!

346
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,560
   

347
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,300
You're the new aide?

348
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,010
I'm Zang Hai.

349
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,690
I'm Hui Jian, also an aide here.

350
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,860
I got here two years before you.

351
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,380
From now on, we're colleagues.

352
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,490
Want some?

353
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,840
No, thanks.

354
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,250
I heard about you.

355
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,140
Quite impressive.

356
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,590
You made it out of the imperial tomb alive

357
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,300
and even got into our Scholar Hall.

358
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,220
I'll be relying on you, Brother Hui Jian, for guidance from here on.

359
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,000
No need to flatter me.

360
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,170
But I'll say this.

361
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,520
In our Scholar Hall, being too capable isn't always a good thing.

362
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,960
I won't be able to look out for you for long.

363
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,110
You do love to joke.

364
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,940
Come on, follow me.

365
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,300
I'll show you how things work here.

366
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,650
That gate you came through

367
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,340
opens at the Mao* hour, closes at the Hai* hour. 
  (*5:00 a.m., *9:00 p.m.) 

368
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,100
It's for the household staff to go in and out.

369
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,340
The main gate is for the Marquis and his family.

370
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,720
Other than that, it only opens for an hour on special occasions.

371
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,910
As for us aides,

372
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,410
from the Chen* hour to the Wu* hour, we write and record history. 
  (*7:00 a.m., *11:00 a.m.) 

373
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,060
From the Wei* hour to the You* hour, we discuss state affairs. 
  (*1:00 p.m., *5:00 p.m.) 

374
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,580
During mealtime, we eat in the east wing.

375
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,510
And by the Xu* hour, we must finish evening lessons before going to bed. 
  (*7:00 p.m.) 

376
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,450
That's the basic routine.

377
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,100
Got it?

378
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,790
Got it.

379
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,010
All these rules were set by the Marquis's senior secretary, Sir Yang.

380
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,250
Other times, you're free to do as you wish.

381
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,400
But honestly, after I'm done with all that each day,

382
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,930
I'm so tired that I fall right asleep.

383
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,650
You'll be the same.

384
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,800
Sir Yang has put a lot of effort into this.

385
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,620
Come on, I'll show you the study hall.

386
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,390
Much appreciated.

387
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,510
Brother Chu, a promising young man has joined.

388
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,860
That's a good thing.

389
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,860
Why so uneasy?

390
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,210
I met this Zang Hai in the imperial tomb. 
    

391
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,170
He's smart and cautious.

392
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,440
Brother Yang, you mustn't take him lightly.

393
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,300
You worry too much.

394
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,480
As long as he can ease the Marquis's burdens,

395
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
I would be grateful beyond words.

396
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,620
What's there to worry about?

397
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,410
Neither of us could solve the Empress Dowager's burial problem.

398
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,900
But this Zang Hai popped up out of nowhere and handled it.

399
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,490
If I were willing to take that risk, I would've done it, too.

400
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,610
But the outcome is eight parts risk, and only two parts gain.

401
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,100
Guys like us don't need to take that gamble.

402
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,010
But he's young.

403
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:23,370
Taking a gamble for future glory is understandable. 
    

404
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,780
In that case, he does remind me of a younger version of you, Sir Yang.

405
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,300
I think this guy's got ambition.

406
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,310
One day, he might not be content working under you.

407
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,140
If we really have someone who can surpass us,

408
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,490
then I, Yang Zhen, would step down and return home in peace.

409
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,440
But from what I heard,

410
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,960
what he's best at is feng shui and geomancy.

411
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:51,260
You're not worried for me, but for yourself. Right?

412
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,650
Checkmate! 
    

413
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,780
Thanks for letting me win.

414
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,930
I'm not satisfied. Let's play another round.

415
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:04,100
Brother Qu, a new aide just joined.

416
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,680
As the Scholar Hall supervisor,

417
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,890
it'd be rude of me not to welcome him.

418
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,730
Excuse me.

419
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,620
All right, this is the study hall,

420
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,040
where the aides write and compile texts.

421
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,980
Sir Yang ordered that the Marquis's achievements be documented here.

422
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:44,900
Every so often, he selects the best works to present to the Marquis.

423
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,130
In the future, you'll do the same as us.

424
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,140
We'll submit all our writings through Sir Yang?

425
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,300
Even if the Marquis wants to discuss matters?

426
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,380
What are you thinking?

427
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,960
You expect him to face dozens of people

428
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,370
all talking at once?

429
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,410
That'd drive anyone crazy.

430
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:09,450
Sir Yang will organize the proposals,

431
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,540
then lets the aides speak their minds.

432
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,240
He has someone record everything,

433
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,730
and submits the best ideas.

434
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,810
However...

435
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:27,110
none of us will ever know whichever opinion the Marquis adopts.

436
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,480
Because they all become Sir Yang's ideas.

437
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,540
   

438
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,060
Nobles founded kingdoms,

439
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,930
and their descendants inherited them.

440
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,140
Thus, the term "clan of legacy."

441
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,530
So, this family record of the Marquis is titled "Zhuang Clan Chronicle."

442
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,140
Greetings, Sir Yang.

443
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,490
Hui Jian, you may go for now.

444
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,250
Yes, sir.

445
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,030
You're the one who helped the Marquis

446
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,300
solve the Empress Dowager's burial issue?

447
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,790
I'm Zang Hai.

448
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,100
Greetings, Sir Yang.

449
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,900
You really are a talented young man.

450
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,250
For the Marquis's mansion to have someone like you,

451
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,570
I, Yang Zhen, am truly fortunate.

452
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,100
Hui Jian must've explained the rules here?

453
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,690
Yes.

454
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,300
The rules here

455
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,890
are even stricter than at the Imperial Academy or Court of Attendants.

456
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,730
But once you're used to them,

457
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,580
you won't make mistakes or embarrass the Marquis

458
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,970
when you step into court someday.

459
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,730
So, you mean we aides even have a chance

460
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,810
to enter the court and serve in office?

461
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,820
Of course.

462
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,310
The Marquis established the Scholar Hall

463
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,790
to scout talent and future pillars for the empire.

464
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,700
You think you're just here to waste time?

465
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,930
But do you scholars even know

466
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,230
how to deal with the Marquis, a military official?

467
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,210
One misstep, and it's martial punishment.

468
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:12,220
Forget about promotion, you might not even survive.

469
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,340
If I don't protect you, no one else will.

470
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,230
You're truly thoughtful, Sir Yang.

471
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:24,250
You know why I had them write the "Zhuang Clan Chronicle"?

472
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,860
It's so they can understand the Marquis better,

473
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,580
understand what pleases him, so they don't offend him.

474
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,300
Once the time is right,

475
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,620
I'll personally recommend them for the Marquis's favor.

476
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,210
I see.

477
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,140
Thank you for the guidance.

478
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,140
With your talent for grand design,

479
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,390
you'll surely make your mark in the Marquis's household.

480
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,100
Sir Yang!

481
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,650
The Marquis asked if a new aide named Zang Hai

482
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,390
has reported in today.

483
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,860
What does the Marquis want?

484
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,180
He said he wants him to inspect the inner garden's feng shui.

485
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,730
I see.

486
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,010
Zang Hai is here.

487
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,930
Go at once!

488
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,390
Yes, sir.

489
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,030
Oh, right. I almost forgot something important.

490
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,440
There was a heavy rain yesterday.

491
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,360
The ancestral hall is leaking.

492
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,440
The Marquis ordered repairs,

493
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,880
but the eaves corbel brackets were all an old style.

494
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,590
I searched everywhere, but couldn't find a craftsman who knows that method.

495
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:40,390
If it rains again, the ancestral tablets will suffer damage.

496
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,360
I heard you're skilled in geomancy.

497
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,880
Can you handle old building repairs?

498
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,670
I have some basic knowledge of geomantic construction.

499
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,650
I might be able to help, Mr. Yang.

500
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,840
That's great.

501
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,000
Judging by today's sky, it's probably going to pour.

502
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,450
Not sure if there's still enough time.

503
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,480
Forget it. Meeting the Marquis comes first.

504
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,280
Don't delay the real business.

505
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,400
If the Marquis gets upset, I'll take the blame.

506
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,300
It won't affect you in any way.

507
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,510
The ancestral hall houses the Zhuang family's ancestral tablets.

508
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,710
The Great Yong Dynasty values filial piety,

509
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,280
and so does the Marquis.

510
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,880
If I let the hall fall into disrepair

511
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,070
and damage the ancestral tablets,

512
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,230
I'd be gravely neglecting my duty.

513
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,960
But about the Marquis's request...

514
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,360
Sir Yang, could you please explain to him on my behalf?

515
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,980
I'm afraid I won't be able to check the garden today.

516
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,230
No worries.

517
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,590
I'll speak well of you before the Marquis.

518
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,490
Thank you, Sir Yang.

519
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:58,460
   

520
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,230
   

521
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:07,670
   

522
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,490
You didn't get to see the Marquis?

523
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,660
The manor is heavily guarded.

524
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,050
He's a military man after all.

525
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,960
With so many lives on his hands,

526
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,490
he naturally fears for his own.

527
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,800
I studied the sun and clouds closely.

528
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,070
There really was going to be a storm that night.

529
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,360
If I hadn't acted, the rain would've ruined the ancestral hall.

530
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,610
Then Yang Zhen would've gone to the Marquis behind my back and slandered me.

531
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,170
I'd be in deep trouble.

532
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,740
So, I backed off,

533
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,190
but I missed a golden opportunity.

534
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,570
These past few days, the Marquis hasn't summoned me again.

535
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,900
That's the way it is for men of true talent.

536
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,280
The Marquis forgets people easily.

537
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,880
Day one, he remembers you.

538
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,590
Day two, maybe a faint impression.

539
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,110
By day three, you're completely erased.

540
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,960
Yang Zhen knows him too well.

541
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,480
He knows if you don't seize your first chance,

542
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,260
you'll never break through again.

543
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,230
My benefactor was right.

544
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,760
Yang Zhen may seem kind on the surface,

545
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,550
but deep down, he's jealous and fake.

546
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,710
He keeps tight control over the Scholar Hall.

547
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,700
Every aide is under his thumb.

548
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,710
   

549
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,800
He feeds them empty promises,

550
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,400
but in truth, he's made them useless.

551
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,250
What I must do is take down Yang Zhen and take his place.

552
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,210
   

553
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,750
How many times do we have to revise this?

554
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,730
When will it be finished?

555
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,030
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

556
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,190
The Marquis went to the palace today.

557
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,480
The Emperor rewarded him with treasures.

558
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,150
Move everything to the treasury and record the inventory.

559
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,800
Guo En, Yuan Shang, Wang Yuanpei, Fu Yuwen,

560
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,390
Gu Changsheng, and... Zang Hai.

561
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,600
One tortoiseshell-carved pipa.

562
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,230
  . 

563
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,920
One pair of Ding kiln white-glazed peony vases.

564
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,880
Two golden-inlaid gemstone belts.

565
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,960
One "Early Spring Landscape" scroll.

566
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,740
One statue of Cundi with a jeweled crown and belt.

567
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,950
Two gold armbands from Fuxia.

568
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,820
   

569
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,610
One Long Wind Sword.

570
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:09,670
Two pairs of dragon-carved jade pendants.

571
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,710
Ten Hetian jade belt hooks.

572
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,290
Ten tinkling jade bracelets.

573
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,200
   

574
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,360
Mr. Yang, all items have been accounted for.

575
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,740
Categorize everything and place them on the display shelves.

576
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,920
Then double-check the full inventory list.

577
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,300
Understood.

578
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,030
This pair of Hetian jade cups... Why is one missing?

579
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,570
It's not there?

580
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,190
Give me the pen.

581
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,780
"Retrieved by the master"...

582
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,630
What does that mean?

583
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,150
Just don't ask.

584
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,240
Pretend you didn't see anything.

585
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,477
   

586
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,209
   

587
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,690
   

588
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,560
Sir Yang, everything's been logged and stored properly.

589
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,450
- Good. You're all dismissed. 
 - Yes, sir.

590
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,670
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

591
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,990
Zang Hai, stay.

592
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,690
- You may go. 
 - Yes, sir.

593
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,820
Zang Hai, you stay behind and go over the inventory one more time.

594
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,970
Yes, Sir Yang.

595
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,710
I chose you because I trust you.

596
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:17,920
Though tedious and detailed, this job has its secrets.

597
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,560
Others are careless with it, but you're meticulous.

598
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,760
You've only just arrived,

599
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,840
so you're unfamiliar with how things work here.

600
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,340
So, start with this task, train yourself, and broaden your horizon.

601
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,230
Thank you, Sir Yang.

602
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,130
Much appreciated.

603
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:52,660
Search this man thoroughly when he leaves.

604
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,710
If he's carrying anything extra, arrest him on the spot.

605
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,150
Yes, sir.
