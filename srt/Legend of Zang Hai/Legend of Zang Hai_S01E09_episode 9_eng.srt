00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:30,100
   

3
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,746
   

4
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,110
   

5
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,470
I knew it. Anyone who walks out from the imperial tomb alive

6
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,620
is not an ordinary man.

7
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,320
The Marquis of Pingjin is truly fortunate to have you,

8
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,990
a talented and experienced aide in politics working for him.

9
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,080
You flatter me.

10
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
I've been his aide for only a few days.

11
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,800
I'm not good at socializing, but I appreciate your compliments.

12
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,030
Please get to the point.

13
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,470
Fine.

14
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,830
I'll get to the point.

15
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm Xiang Antu, the owner of Zhen Tower.

16
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,830
Greetings, Owner Xiang.

17
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,590
This is our third meeting.

18
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,030
I really didn't expect this.

19
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,280
You were penniless when you had just arrived at the capital

20
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,050
but you're now the Chief Aide for the Marquis of Pingjin.

21
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,430
You were rapidly promoted in just a few months.

22
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,150
I'm really curious.

23
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,400
What tactics did you use to rise rapidly overnight?

24
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,320
I was merely lucky.

25
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,280
Let me be frank.

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,190
I admire your talent.

27
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,380
We've crossed paths more than once,

28
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,520
and I consider that fate.

29
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,960
Since you can become the aide of the Marquis of Pingjin,

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,310
why not also consider becoming an honored guest of Zhen Tower?

31
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,840
Be it wealth or fame,

32
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,160
I can give you whatever the Marquis gives you.

33
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,240
Are you trying to poach the aide of the Marquis?

34
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,630
Can't I do that?

35
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,490
It's extremely worthwhile to be my friend.

36
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,840
Forgive me.

37
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,430
If you think highly of me, I will remember this.

38
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,710
As for being friends,

39
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,950
I dare not social climb.

40
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,090
Previously, at Zhen Tower,

41
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,900
Yang Zhen, Qu Jiao, and Chu Huaiming humiliated you.

42
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,740
I could've just stood by and watched.

43
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,630
Do you know why I helped you?

44
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,560
It's because you're different from them.

45
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,120
You're not evil by nature.

46
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,360
That's why you should know

47
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,430
the Marquis of Pingjin is a military general.

48
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,190
He kills without hesitation and trusts no one.

49
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,430
Working for him is like living your life on the edge.

50
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,450
So, tell me, why seek connections with him and put your life at risk?

51
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,020
You're a pearl covered in dust. 
  (Hidden talent) 

52
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,030
I think it's a waste for you.

53
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,310
You're too kind, Owner Xiang.

54
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,970
I'm just a fake pearl passing off as a genuine pearl.

55
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,840
Everything I did was just to survive in this vast world

56
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,710
and find a safe place to stay.

57
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,800
This is what you said but I can see this is not your aspiration.

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,130
Are you trying to help him regain command of the army

59
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,790
to prove your worth?

60
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,150
I always hope to do what others can't.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,090
Looks like I was wrong about you.

62
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,600
You and the Marquis are the same kind of people.

63
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,920
In that case, I won't force you again.

64
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,100
I wish you great success and glory.

65
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,360
Thank you, Owner Xiang.

66
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,930
I'll take my leave.

67
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,380
Sir, please remember this.

68
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,510
Here in the capital, you'll need Zhen Tower's help

69
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,120
far more than I'll need yours.

70
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,510
If you're ever in trouble and look for me,

71
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,270
remember what you said today and don't be embarrassed.

72
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,980
   

73
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,930
I heard he turned down your offer.

74
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,950
So, that's Zang Hai?

75
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,160
He described himself as a man pursuing fame and fortune.

76
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,950
Because of who he is, he refused the owner of Zhen Tower.

77
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,720
He seems to have some principles after all.

78
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,760
What's going on again?

79
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,830
Can't you tell, Eighth Young Master?

80
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,680
He's determined to stake everything on the Marquis of Pingjin

81
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,380
to prove to the world that he's not an ordinary man.

82
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,630
He can achieve greatness

83
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,590
but it's a pity.

84
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,950
He violated your taboos.

85
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,220
With the Marquis' temperament,

86
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,290
if he ever regains military command,

87
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,140
he'll lead an expedition to the border to display his power.

88
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,160
Yang Zhen was a petty man.

89
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,780
He wasn't a threat at all

90
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,680
but Zang Hai is different.

91
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,140
I don't want to see a talent like him under the Marquis' command.

92
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,140
You want to get rid of him?

93
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,830
"Good fortune doesn't last forever. Flowers don't bloom all year round."

94
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,270
He's now the Chief Aide of the Marquis of Pingjin

95
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,160
but with all the matters coming his way,

96
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,360
he'll be careless in his work and lose the favor of the Marquis.

97
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,700
Steward.

98
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,490
Sir Zang, you're back.

99
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,550
These are...

100
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,630
These are gifts from outsiders.

101
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,950
They're for you.

102
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,530
Now that you're favored by the Marquis,

103
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,410
everyone's rushing to curry favor with you.

104
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,000
Look. A jade belt hook carved with dragons and clouds.

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,120
Look at the material used.

106
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,050
It's top quality.

107
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,630
Come and look at this, too.

108
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,100
Come, unroll it.

109
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,490
"Peacocks and a Loquat Tree" by Cui Zixi of the Song Dynasty.

110
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,240
One glance, and you know it's genuine.

111
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,560
Look at this. 
    

112
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,950
These leaves and feathers

113
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,600
are rich, vibrant, and detached from worldly feelings. 
    

114
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,900
Absolutely elegant.

115
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,890
Steward, why are these accompanying notes without names?

116
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,070
You...

117
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,100
Take them all inside.

118
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,510
Sir, you must not know.

119
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,380
These are reciprocal gifts.

120
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,480
It's an unwritten rule in the capital.

121
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,120
Even if you want to return them, you won't know who to return them to.

122
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,890
When they need my help,

123
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,490
they'll show up and identify their gifts.

124
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,910
Sir, you're smart.

125
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,320
Does the Marquis know?

126
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,250
These gifts are in the Marquis Residence. Of course, he knows.

127
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,240
Did he say anything?

128
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,510
He doesn't bother with these things.

129
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,910
Since the gifts are meant for you,

130
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,750
you can handle them as you see fit.

131
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,440
I see.

132
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,120
I'll accept these gifts then.

133
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,790
Did he accept the items?

134
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,390
He did.

135
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,750
Did you explain the meaning of a reciprocal gift?

136
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,120
I did.

137
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,550
He also knows that once the gifts are accepted,

138
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,470
he needs to eliminate disasters and solve problems for them.

139
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,570
   

140
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,150
 - Thank you... 
 - Here you go. 

141
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,600
What's going on?

142
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,750
- Someone's distributing porridge. 
  - Here, take this. 

143
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,820
 - Thank you. 
 - The Marquis is so kind. 

144
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,550
 - Come back if you need more. 
 - Thank you. 

145
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,030
 Be careful, it's hot. Hold it properly. 

146
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,520
 - Here.  
 - Thank you, sir.

147
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
 There's more if you need it. 

148
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,320
- Little girl, take this. 
 - Thank you.

149
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,240
- Be careful, it's hot. 
 - Thank you.

150
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,480
 Take this. 

151
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,200
Here.

152
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,320
 - Thank you. 
 - Thank you. 

153
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,830
 - Here. 
 - Thank you. 

154
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,210
 Thank you. 

155
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,480
 - Here, take this. 
 - Thank you. 

156
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,960
- Greetings, Marquis. 
  - The Marquis is so kind. 

157
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,300
 - Next.  
 - What are you doing?

158
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,720
 - Be careful, it's hot. 
 - All right. 

159
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,440
Marquis, I received some reciprocal gifts yesterday.

160
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,130
It weighed heavily on me, so I converted the gifts into grains

161
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,480
and gave them out in your name to the struggling commoners.

162
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,840
The Marquis is here!

163
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,490
The Marquis is here!

164
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,870
Thank you, Marquis, for your grace!

165
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,790
Thank you for your kindness!

166
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,600
 Thank you for your grace! 

167
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,670
 - We'll never forget your kindness. 
 - Thank you, My Lord! 

168
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,130
- All right, enough. 
  - Thank you for your grace! 

169
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,270
The Marquis is giving out porridge for you to fill your stomachs.

170
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,290
Go and get it.

171
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,320
 Thank you, Marquis! 

172
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,480
 Thank you, Marquis! 

173
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,610
 Let's go and get the porridge! 

174
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,000
 Let's go and get the porridge. Quick. 

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,200
 There's enough for everyone! 

176
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,150
I acted on my own.

177
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,230
Please forgive me, Marquis.

178
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,320
Zang Hai, I didn't expect you

179
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,010
to handle this beautifully. I underestimated you.

180
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,490
 - That's enough. 
 - Thank you. 

181
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,080
My Lord, I'm embarrassed.

182
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,670
I dare not forget that I'm serving you.

183
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,000
Those gifts were too expensive and extravagant.

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,320
If I had accepted them,

185
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,480
I would have been indebted to them on your behalf.

186
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,950
By doing this today, I believe it'll stop them from sending gifts again.

187
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,300
If they send them again, just accept the gifts.

188
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,670
Do you think I can't eliminate disasters or solve problems for them?

189
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,420
I dare not think this way.

190
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,840
Once you're done distributing the porridge,

191
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,440
go to my study and retrieve "Wei Liaozi's Military Strategies".

192
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,110
If you follow me, don't just read the Four Books and Five Classics of Confucianism.

193
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,700
Read more books on military strategies, too.

194
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,750
Understood.

195
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,580
Congratulations, Sir Zang!

196
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,980
The Marquis just granted you access to his study. Consent is not required.

197
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,610
Tea tastes better when brewed in this jade teapot.

198
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,360
If you like it, keep it.

199
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,300
There won't be any again in the future.

200
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,360
Everyone in the capital knows about yesterday's incident.

201
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,150
No one will deliver gifts again today.

202
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,270
Whether you accept them or not, it leads to trouble.

203
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,910
Turn them down, and you'll seem arrogant and invite suspicion.

204
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,720
But I can't just accept them either.

205
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,150
Yang Zhen served the Marquis for over a decade.

206
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,270
The Marquis knows him inside out.

207
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,440
Yang Zhen can violate the taboo and accept gifts, but I can't.

208
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,190
That's right. Many eyes are watching you now.

209
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,720
However, you're quick to pick up on these matters.

210
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,280
I wonder who taught you these.

211
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,320
Of course, you taught me these.

212
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,850
Master, were you ever in officialdom?

213
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,900
It's inexplicable.

214
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,370
When I was making waves back then,

215
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,080
you were still busy playing in the mud.

216
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,720
There's something I never expected.

217
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,630
The mastermind behind the famed Zhen Tower

218
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,720
is actually that pretty young lady.

219
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
She set me up at first, but then pulled me out of danger.

220
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,320
She now wants me to turn against the Marquis and join her.

221
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,890
She made you a generous offer and you even declined her.

222
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,850
She's not a simple person.

223
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,110
She's smart, resourceful, and doesn't seem like a bad person.

224
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,720
Zang Hai really played this game beautifully.

225
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,480
All the poor people in the capital received his kindness.

226
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,910
Not only did he kill off the intentions of those who sent the gifts,

227
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,850
he obtained recognition from the Marquis.

228
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,700
You've been outsmarted.

229
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,970
Looking at your smile... Zang Hai will be facing bad luck.

230
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,300
Do something for me.

231
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,200
What are you up to again?

232
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,280
When news comes from Eighth Young Master, the entire capital believes it.

233
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,600
Spread a few words for me.

234
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,300
What are they?

235
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,730
   

236
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,870
No way.

237
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,120
I only speak the truth. I don't start rumors.

238
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,680
You make your living off Zhen Tower

239
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,610
and you still dare to decline me?

240
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,120
Will you help me or not?

241
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,810
I'm not helping you.

242
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,140
When you previously insisted on talking about the Empress Dowager,

243
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,600
you drew the attention of the undercover guards.

244
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,040
Didn't I get you out of trouble?

245
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,200
I did that to help Zhen Tower earn more money.

246
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,390
How about this?

247
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,630
You'll get extra cuts from ticket sales for your future storytelling sessions.

248
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,030
Just help me this once. All right?

249
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,340
I'm begging you. Please?

250
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,020
Let's be clear. Just this once.

251
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,670
Make it once a year.

252
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,810
It's only once in this lifetime.

253
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,340
The seawater overflows, drowning the strong tree.

254
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,200
The tiger in the grass is bound to die.

255
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Its claws, heart, and ears will decay.

256
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,360
Among ten thousand people, someone hides,

257
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,360
bringing ruin to his master.

258
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,000
The seawater overflows, drowning the strong tree.

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,940
The tiger in the grass is bound to die.

260
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,360
Its claws, heart, and ears...

261
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,800
They're saying 
    

262
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,420
you're an alchemist helping the Marquis to seek immortality,

263
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,750
a political spy planted by one of his enemies,

264
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,950
and even his illegitimate son.

265
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,120
Can you guess who's behind it?

266
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,510
Zhen Tower.

267
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,480
This is your outcome from offending Owner Xiang.

268
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,930
I'm not worried about other matters

269
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,530
but this nursery rhyme... 
    

270
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,330
   

271
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,230
   

272
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,000
   

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,300
"The seawater overflows,

274
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,600
drowning the strong* tree." 
    

275
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,460
"The tiger in the grass is bound to die."

276
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,023
   

277
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,250
"Its claws, heart, and ears

278
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,400
will decay."

279
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,540
The nursery rhyme is implying that 
    

280
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,320
you joined the Zhuang family

281
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,150
with an ill intention to bring down his entire family.

282
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:55,530
Among all these rumors, there's actually one close to the truth.

283
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,180
These rumors sound like a joke, but they're deadly.

284
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,060
They've already put me in serious danger.

285
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,820
Words may be spoken in jest, but someone will believe them.

286
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,400
Xiao Hai, before this matter gets worse,

287
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,520
I think you should go to Zhen Tower and apologize to Owner Xiang.

288
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,370
Is Owner Xiang here?

289
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,960
Our mistress left a few days ago.

290
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,170
Sir, please go back.

291
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,550
When will she be back?

292
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,960
I've no idea.

293
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,670
Then she...

294
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,330
   

295
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,000
   

296
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,240
It's what you wished for.

297
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,830
Many people want favors from the Marquis of Pingjin

298
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,130
but there are many who wants him dead, too.

299
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,640
I've provided every possible excuse.

300
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,510
A smart person will know how to slip away.

301
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,930
But what if Zang Hai doesn't leave and loses his life instead?

302
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,720
That's the price he pays for choosing the Marquis of Pingjin.

303
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,110
But I think he won't die that easily.

304
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,520
Let's see how he handles this.

305
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,130
Sir, you're back.

306
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,480
Who delivered these gifts again?

307
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,200
They arrived today. There was no name indicated.

308
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,380
Seems like someone still hasn't given up on trying to win your favor.

309
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,590
All right, I know. You may leave.

310
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,250
Understood.

311
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,690
 "You moved into the Marquis Mansion with hidden motives." 

312
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,780
 "I, too, have suffered at his hands." 

313
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,400
 "I failed to take revenge." 

314
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
 "There's a lethal poison in this vial. Use it to kill the Marquis." 

315
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,000
 "You have three days." 

316
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,028
   

317
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,950
 Father! 

318
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,530
 Mother, I don't feel well. 

319
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,150
 Here, take the medicine, and you'll feel better. 

320
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,220
Father. Mother.

321
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,650
Please watch over me.

322
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,650
I must kill the Marquis of Pingjin.

323
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,690
When it's done,

324
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,690
I'll give you both a proper burial.

325
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,390
   

326
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,640
Zang Hai, have some, too.

327
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,700
 The maids deliver refreshments every afternoon 

328
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,100
 and dinner at You hour (5:00 - 7:00 p.m.) 

329
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,590
 During this time, the steward is always present. 

330
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,430
 There's no way to take action. 

331
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:45,640
 Perhaps, the only opportunity is when I'm alone with the Marquis. 

332
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,700
 I'll poison him then. 

333
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,670
Thank you. 
    

334
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,930
   

335
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,500
- They are fresh. 
 - Customers, take a look at the tea leaves.

336
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,060
- Fresh fruit... Sweet and juicy! 
 - There are all kinds of tea leaves.

337
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,000
You're awake.

338
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,600
You're Hui Jian.

339
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,930
I didn't expect you to remember me.

340
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,400
You're the one who threatened me.

341
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,280
When did I threaten you?

342
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,720
Disciple, what is he talking about?

343
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,110
No idea, Master.

344
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,240
He's spouting nonsense.

345
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,880
Did you hit him too hard?

346
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,760
No way. I know how much force I used.

347
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,700
Who ordered you?

348
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,600
Ordered us?

349
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,300
Do you think we look like we would take orders?

350
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,450
Why did you tie me up?

351
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,920
I'll be honest.

352
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,980
I need a favor from you.

353
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,100
I want to borrow something. Your face.

354
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,590
I want to slice it and wear it on my face.

355
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,580
You want to use my face to impersonate me?

356
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,080
That's right.

357
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,720
The truth is,

358
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,300
I've been dormant in the Marquis Residence for many years

359
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,200
just for one very important matter.

360
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,500
It's to get close to the Marquis of Pingjin.

361
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,780
When Yang Zhen left, I thought my opportunity finally came.

362
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,210
No one else could stop me.

363
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,600
I didn't expect you to show up and dismiss us.

364
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,780
I lost my opportunity. I hate you.

365
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,830
Did it occur to you that this face-switching won't work?

366
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,110
This kind of far-fetched trick

367
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,300
will fall apart once you set foot in the Marquis Residence.

368
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,400
That's because you lack foresight.

369
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,040
Don't worry.

370
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,500
My knife skills are excellent. It won't hurt.

371
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,900
And we'll give you a proper ritual to send you off.

372
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,180
You're insane!

373
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,900
In fact, I'm very sorry

374
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,160
but I really don't have a choice.

375
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,200
Don't worry, I won't live long after this.

376
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,770
I'll personally apologize to you in the netherworld.

377
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,900
Shi Lei!

378
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,070
Don't you know how to tie a man up?

379
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,030
I tied him up tightly.

380
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,400
This brat is strong.

381
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,500
Come, hold him down.

382
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,600
The Eight-Lancet Set?

383
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,300
You're quite knowledgeable.

384
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,690
Where did you get these tools?

385
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,380
None of your business.

386
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,400
Let me ask you.

387
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,440
Why do you want to get close to the Marquis?

388
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,100
You're going to die anyway.

389
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
I might as well tell you.

390
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,550
I want to get close to him

391
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,900
so that I can kill him and avenge my master.

392
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,500
Your master?

393
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,830
Isn't he right here?

394
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,900
He's not my real master.

395
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,430
I'm avenging the death of my real master.

396
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,200
Who are you referring to?

397
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,540
Enough. Stop wasting time.

398
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,810
In any case, you will die today.

399
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,100
Yes. In any case, I'll die today. Let me finish talking.

400
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,400
Even if you really want to use my face,

401
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:04,140
taking the skin above the neck won't be sufficient.

402
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,110
You didn't know this, right?

403
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,880
The skin on the neck, chest and back are all connected.

404
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,760
One mistake and you'll tear the whole thing.

405
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,800
If you want a clean cut,

406
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
you need to start from the back.

407
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,000
Cut the crap. I don't need you to tell me this.

408
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,210
Of course I know. I was just testing the angle.

409
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,640
Strip him. Hurry.

410
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,890
What's wrong?

411
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,000
There are scars.

412
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,630
So what?

413
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,480
We just need his face.

414
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,660
- I'll knock him out now. 
 - Wait!

415
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,580
How did you get these scars?

416
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:55,230
I got them from being whipped as a child.

417
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,550
My father was in Dongxia back then.

418
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,400
My senior brother applied medicine for me.

419
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,190
But the wounds were too deep. He couldn't do anything.

420
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,290
Later, a master helped to patch up the scars for me.

421
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,190
Why were the scars patched up?

422
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,860
Because I also have a blood feud to settle.

423
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,850
You are...

424
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,070
When my senior brother was three years old,

425
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,180
my father took him in as a disciple.

426
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,560
As kids, we would go up the mountains together

427
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,760
to survey the land and gather herbs.

428
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,410
We skipped lessons and were punished together.

429
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:49,500
Whenever I got into trouble, I'd make him take the blame.

430
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,730
I was always pranking him.

431
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,180
Your senior brother...

432
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,400
because he made a mistake, he was punished and sent to the back mountain.

433
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,480
He couldn't die with his master and his wife...

434
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,230
and has been barely surviving till today.

435
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,690
Although he wasn't outstanding,

436
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,500
he was the disciple my father doted on the most.

437
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,790
If Father knew he were still alive, he would be overjoyed.

438
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,590
Father named him Guan Feng*, 
  (*Watching the wind) 

439
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:37,590
hoping he would live freely like the wind.

440
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,890
I am Guan Feng.

441
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,460
I am Guan Feng!

442
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,480
I am Guan Feng! It's really you, Zhinu!

443
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,060
You're alive!

444
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,780
Zhinu... it's good that you're alive.

445
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,080
It's good that you're alive.

446
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,650
That's the whole story.

447
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,900
So, your face was changed.

448
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,560
No wonder I didn't recognize you.

449
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,310
Weren't you also chubby back then?

450
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,710
We've changed a lot.

451
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,950
Is that young master of yours really reliable?

452
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,870
He's an orphan from outside the capital.

453
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,380
He's devoted to his training.

454
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,010
We've known each other for years.

455
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,400
Besides, he's willing to help me take revenge.

456
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,280
Don't worry,

457
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,510
but he's not my real master.

458
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,570
Seems like you've also been through a lot over the past years.

459
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,440
Tell me everything.

460
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,020
That day, Master's wife sent me to the mountain

461
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,520
to chop firewood and reflect on my mistakes.

462
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,470
Just after nightfall, I saw Master returning from the southwest.

463
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,050
I thought Master's wife would be glad to see him coming home...

464
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,330
 - Master, Master!  
 - and wouldn't punish me.

465
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,750
-  Master...  
 - So, I rushed down the mountain.

466
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,290
But when I was almost home, I suddenly heard screams.

467
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,940
A group of people were at the entrance

468
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,630
and they were armed with swords.

469
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,980
I hid right away.

470
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,190
I saw someone come out from inside.

471
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,280
It was the Marquis of Pingjin.

472
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,070
I later saw Master and his wife being carried out by his men.

473
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,970
 I was terrified. I didn't know what had happened. 

474
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,880
I waited till they'd left and ran home.

475
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,030
But the fire had already spread. I couldn't get inside.

476
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,510
 Help! Put out the fire immediately! 

477
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,280
 Uncle Li, put out the fire quickly! 

478
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,800
I wanted to seek help from the neighbors

479
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,810
but when I opened the door, that place was full of corpses.

480
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,880
After that, I ended up on the streets,

481
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,860
living from day to day.

482
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,200
But all this time,

483
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,590
I held on to the Eight-Lancet Set Master gave me,

484
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,310
and vowed to take revenge one day.

485
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,510
 - Two buns, please. 
 - Right away. 

486
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,850
 - Here you go. 
 - Thank you. 

487
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,580
 - Sir. 
 - Coming! 

488
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,510
 Here's the money for the bun. 

489
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,570
 All right. Thank you. 

490
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,360
 Go ahead and eat. 

491
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,880
That day, I met Shi Lei and Kaizhen Sanren.

492
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,060
They took me in and Shi Lei became my new master.

493
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,230
After Kaizhen Sanren passed away from illness,

494
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,340
Shi Lei and I depended on each other for survival.

495
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:54,400
But there's one thing I've never let go of.

496
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,180
That is revenge.

497
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,660
So, later,

498
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,590
I thought of a way to enter the Marquis Residence as an aide.

499
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,560
It's my fault.

500
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,170
I was incompetent. All these years, and I still couldn't get close to him.

501
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,800
But fortunately, you're here now.

502
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,880
Let's take revenge together.

503
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,280
You're now the Chief Aide of the Marquis.

504
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,040
How should we make it convenient for you to take action?

505
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,910
Actually, before you two came, someone tried to force me to kill the Marquis.

506
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:30,140
I was about to take the risk but you both captured me.

507
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,110
You said that person threatened you.

508
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,960
Who could he be?

509
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,110
I'm not sure yet

510
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,000
but it's not important who he is.

511
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,690
I'm going to kill the Marquis of Pingjin anyway.

512
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,330
You just mentioned there's something crucial. What is it?

513
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,000
The Marquis of Pingjin killed many people in our family

514
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,690
because he was after something my father brought back from Dongxia.

515
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,360
But he didn't succeed.

516
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,480
Father must have hidden it beforehand

517
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,360
but I can't figure out where he could've hidden it.

518
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,790
Something was hidden?

519
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,730
He hid something?

520
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,810
Didn't you just say that when my father returned from Dongxia,

521
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,690
he came from the southwest?

522
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,880
Normally, he should've come from the northeast.

523
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,670
If he came from the southwest, he would have taken a detour.

524
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,590
Do you think he took that route to hide that item?

525
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,890
When we were young, didn't he often take us

526
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,800
to the mountains for lessons?

527
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,760
But I only remember a few mountains in that area.

528
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,920
Where could he have hidden it

529
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,250
so that it's not easily found?

530
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,190
The Tomb of Liu Xian.

531
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,230
Before going to Dongxia, he took me to that tomb once.

532
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,910
That's right. What better place to hide it than there?

533
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:17,010
