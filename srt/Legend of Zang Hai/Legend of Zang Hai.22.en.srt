[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,620
Greetings, sir.

4
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,180
I was sent to check on Mr. Zang.

5
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,330
Where is he?

6
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,540
He's working in the burial grounds.

7
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,460
All right.

8
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,010
Looks a bit better than last time.

9
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,690
But still far from finished.

10
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,290
Mr. Zang,

11
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,730
why didn't you show up

12
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,660
at Mr. Cao's banquet?

13
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,010
Were you too busy?

14
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,290
Or you didn't think it mattered?

15
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,060
You've misunderstood me, Mr. Lu.

16
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,690
How would I dare

17
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,010
look down on Mr. Cao's invitation?

18
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,170
It's just that

19
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,570
I've been swamped lately and forgot all about it.

20
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,980
No worries. There's another chance.

21
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,500
The next banquet is in five days.

22
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,850
You can join us then.

23
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,290
No need to trouble yourself, Mr. Lu.

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,380
Right now, I only wish to give my all

25
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,130
to finish the General's funeral.

26
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,380
Are you really that busy?

27
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,610
Yes.

28
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,290
Originally, I came here

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,850
to deliver a letter from Mr. Cao.

30
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,410
It could bring you fortune and save you from disaster.

31
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,010
But clearly,

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,500
you don't want the favor.

33
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,260
So, this letter

34
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,290
is no longer yours to receive.

35
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,170
Every year during the Double Ninth Festival,

36
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,220
the ministers must go pay respects

37
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,570
at the late Emperor's tomb.

38
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,540
No matter how General Fu's contributions,

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,380
his tomb can't be built

40
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,690
during the late Emperor's memorial rites.

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,060
So,

42
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,130
the funeral must be completed before the festival.

43
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,170
Mr. Zang,

44
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,570
don't take this lightly.

45
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,890
Mr. Lu,

46
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,410
are you giving me a reminder

47
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,660
or a warning?

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,100
How could I dare warn you?

49
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,730
You're a fifth-rank official,

50
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,140
the Imperial Astronomer!

51
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,490
I'm just reminding you,

52
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,810
nothing more.

53
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,370
It's just that

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,050
the festival is less than a month away.

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,020
So, while you still have a little time,

56
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,250
enjoy the rest of your days.

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,250
Sir,

58
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,050
drop the act, will you?

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,140
We're already short-handed,

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,490
and now we have to rush the schedule?

61
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,020
Everyone can tell

62
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,290
Mr. Cao's making things difficult on purpose.

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,900
Stop pretending to be the nice guy!

64
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,980
And you are?

65
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,780
Forgive him, sir.

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,220
He's the overseer of the Astronomical Bureau.

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,410
Shi Quan,

68
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,810
mind your tongue.

69
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,170
Overseer, huh?

70
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,410
One, two, three, four, five,

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,460
six, seven, eight.

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,220
My apologies.

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,780
I didn't realize this craftsman

74
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,810
was actually an eighth-rank official!

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,460
Mr. Shi, you may not serve at court,

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,290
but at least you hold an official post in the Bureau.

77
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,170
May I ask, sir,

78
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,610
what's the punishment for slandering

79
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,340
the Seal-holding Eunuch Director?

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,900
Please don't take offense.

81
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,700
Shi Quan didn't mean it that way.

82
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,020
But I heard what Mr. Shi said

83
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,460
loud and clear.

84
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,580
Shall I escort him to the Surveillance Office

85
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,540
and let him explain to Mr. Cao directly?

86
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,460
Who are you trying to scare?

87
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,610
Take me to the Emperor if you've got the guts!

88
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,810
Stop, Lu Ran!

89
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,290
He's an imperial officer, not just a craftsman.

90
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,610
If you dare raise a hand near the late Emperor's tomb,

91
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,980
and His Majesty finds out,

92
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,980
the Surveillance Office will be charged with grave disrespect.

93
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,170
No one will be able to save you then.

94
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,460
Shi Quan,

95
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,540
apologize to Mr. Lu right now!

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,580
I spoke out of turn. Please forgive me, sir.

97
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,140
I ask for your understanding, Mr. Lu.

98
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,050
As for Mr. Cao,

99
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,980
I'll give it serious thought.

100
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,580
All right then.

101
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,100
For Mr. Zang's sake,

102
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,290
I'll let you off the hook.

103
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,410
Mr. Zang,

104
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,100
there's one more thing I want to ask.

105
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,410
I had a younger brother, Lu Jin.

106
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,490
Do you know how he died?

107
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,250
Take care, Mr. Zang.

108
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,610
Here, get up.

109
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,290
Are you all right?

110
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,900
I'm fine.

111
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,980
Sir,

112
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,020
how can we finish before the Double Ninth Festival?

113
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,780
Even if we never sleep, it's impossible!

114
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,790
The Marquis of Pingjin is fierce and tough.

115
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,380
I've gained his trust by now,

116
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,790
but killing him still won't be easy.

117
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,510
Maybe I can make him fall into his own trap.

118
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,330
His achievements already go unrewarded,

119
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,910
which easily invites the Emperor's suspicion.

120
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,850
Cao Jingxian is ruthless and cold.

121
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,610
He's always held a grudge against me.

122
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,170
Now there's a rift between him and the Marquis.

123
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,780
If timed right, I can pull him into the game.

124
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,140
Let the two of them fight.

125
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,530
But man proposes, Heaven disposes.

126
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,420
Anything can still go wrong.

127
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,250
I need absolute certainty.

128
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,050
After all,

129
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,120
the third enemy

130
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,100
is lurking in the shadows, watching it all.

131
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,730
Anyway,

132
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,980
I must set the Marquis and Cao against each other.

133
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,890
Only when both are wounded, and chaos ensues,

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,940
will the third party show their hand.

135
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,030
And when the eagle strikes, that's when I strike back.

136
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,900
[Zang Residence]

137
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,250
Young Master.

138
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,730
What brings you here in person?

139
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,100
Please, have a seat.

140
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,460
Now that's too formal,

141
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,100
Zang Hai.

142
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,650
My father was the one

143
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,490
who recommended you as Imperial Astronomer.

144
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,420
He even picked out this fancy house for you.

145
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,180
What, am I not welcome now?

146
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,980
Don't say that, Young Master.

147
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,180
If you ever need me,

148
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,980
just send someone to call,

149
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,130
and I'll come right away.

150
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,340
A few days ago, you asked me for help,

151
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,980
but I didn't come through.

152
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,130
I've felt bad about it ever since.

153
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,980
I haven't slept well for nights.

154
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,010
So, worrying about me

155
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,610
has kept you up?

156
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,130
Please, sit.

157
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,890
I came tonight

158
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,460
because I heard

159
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,220
Mr. Cao wants you to finish before the Double Ninth Festival.

160
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,700
That's a tough deadline.

161
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,730
I can still speak on your behalf to Mr. Cao,

162
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,530
so I figured

163
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,370
I'd put in a good word for you,

164
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,490
spare you from losing your post over this.

165
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,850
That's too much trouble for you.

166
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,460
Really, there's no need.

167
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,530
You came from the Marquis's household.

168
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,980
So in a way, we're family.

169
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,460
If you're in trouble,

170
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,610
I can't just stand by, can I?

171
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,530
Exactly, I came from the Marquis's household.

172
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,130
So I shouldn't drag you

173
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,340
into this.

174
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,890
Besides, I'm already in charge

175
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,460
of General Fu's tomb construction.

176
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,770
A few kind words won't fix it.

177
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,650
Enough of that.

178
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,010
Let me be straight with you.

179
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,340
Give me the ledger,

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,060
and I'll handle everything.

181
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,370
The ledger?

182
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,460
That's right.

183
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,770
The festival is right around the corner,

184
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,250
and you're rushing the timeline.

185
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,610
Hiring a few more craftsmen

186
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,130
won't be enough this time.

187
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,060
Zang Hai?

188
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,700
Since I'm here tonight,

189
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,610
I've already come up with a solution for you.

190
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,420
Just hand me the ledger,

191
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,490
and I guarantee

192
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,610
you'll finish on time.

193
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,420
Finish on time?

194
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,820
Young Master,

195
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,060
do you have some kind of magical power?

196
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,580
No need to answer me right away.

197
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,250
Think it over.

198
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,530
I've got nothing else planned tonight.

199
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,850
This courtyard of yours

200
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,890
has got a nice view.

201
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,010
I'll take a stroll around

202
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,730
while I wait.

203
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,770
Wait, Young Master...

204
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,010
Let's do as you say.

205
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,010
No need to see me out.

206
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,650
Then it's settled.

207
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,370
Tomorrow, I'll come to the Bureau for the ledger.

208
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,340
I'll be waiting, Young Master.

209
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,700
Hai!

210
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,700
Are you really giving him the ledger?

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,220
No matter what tricks he has up his sleeve,

212
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,300
the tomb will be completed in the end.

213
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,420
He's got people backing him.

214
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,220
But have you figured out how to answer to the Marquis?

215
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,010
My earlier plan was to drag him into this,

216
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,010
so if the Marquis blames anyone,

217
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,340
it would fall on Zhuang Zhifu for meddling.

218
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,530
But I still don't think

219
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,650
that's good enough.

220
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,250
So, what's your brilliant idea, "Mr. Zang"?

221
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,700
Hey, wait!

222
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,300
Your leg okay?

223
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,460
You little rascal!

224
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,610
Forget your knack for lying,

225
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,060
your way of keeping us guessing

226
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,130
is even better!

227
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,740
[Ledger for General Fu's Tomb Construction]

228
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,130
Hai!

229
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,820
Those palace craftsmen are back!

230
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,460
And not just them, right?

231
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,650
How do you know?

232
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,490
They brought over another group, over twenty seasoned craftsmen!

233
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,580
Any more?

234
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,300
Yes!

235
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,940
They're pushing carts piled high with carved bricks,

236
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,610
plus two carts of timber and stone!

237
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,420
Are you sure?

238
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,460
Absolutely!

239
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,730
Lately, Zhuang Zhifu has been visiting Zang Hai often.

240
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,010
With his help,

241
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,250
the Ministry of Works gave Zang Hai a green light.

242
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,730
Looks like Zang Hai will finish by the Double Ninth Festival.

243
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,420
No wonder Zang Hai's been so confident

244
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,420
and refused to join our ranks.

245
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,060
He had a backup plan all along.

246
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,770
That idiot Zhuang Zhifu,

247
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,730
how dare he go against you?

248
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,460
Well, as you said,

249
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,060
he's an idiot.

250
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,490
Maybe,

251
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,460
he can't even tell

252
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,580
we're giving Zang Hai a hard time.

253
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,180
Father,

254
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,530
Zang Hai doesn't know what's good for him.

255
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,850
We tried winning him over twice and failed.

256
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,850
Then, what should we do

257
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,060
about that thing we're looking for?

258
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,060
How much do you think Zhuang Luyin knows?

259
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,340
Zhuang Luyin...

260
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,010
Don't act rashly yet.

261
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,940
Let me try one more move.

262
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,460
You mean...

263
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,300
Zhuang Zhifu only cares about profit.

264
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,610
If he's involved,

265
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,890
there's bound to be some financial trickery.

266
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,820
And Zhuang Luyin has always despised betrayal.

267
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,180
If Zang Hai dragged Zhuang Zhifu into this

268
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,940
to protect himself

269
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,010
and Zhuang Luyin finds out,

270
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,610
Zang Hai won't survive!

271
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,650
Find a way to let Zhuang Luyin know

272
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,980
what his men have done!

273
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,880
[Zhuang Zhifu embezzled state funds]

274
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,660
[and cut corners on General Fu's tomb construction]

275
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:51,850
Father.

276
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,730
You called for me?

277
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,420
Kneel.

278
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,890
I said kneel!

279
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,530
Father...

280
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,770
Zhuang Zhifu,

281
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,940
you've grown bold, huh?

282
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:09,090
You even dared to pocket the funds for Fu Zhisong's tomb?

283
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:10,900
Father...

284
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,380
I... I didn't...

285
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,330
You still have the nerve to lie to me?

286
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,700
Father...

287
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,620
I...

288
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,860
I just swapped some materials, that's all.

289
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,620
I didn't touch anything on the surface.

290
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,420
As long as Zang Hai finishes on time,

291
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,090
no one will ever find out.

292
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,090
What is this, then? Take a look yourself!

293
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,730
Oh... this...

294
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,220
It's one thing to steal silver,

295
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,330
but getting caught is just stupid enough.

296
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,770
You're bad even at being corrupt!

297
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,860
Sir,

298
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,770
Zhifu knows he was wrong.

299
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,180
Please have mercy on him.

300
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,980
You still have the nerve to plead for him?

301
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,250
You spoiled him rotten!

302
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,250
Listen well,

303
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,730
if Zang Hai fails to complete the funeral,

304
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,220
the Ministries of Rites and Revenue will launch a full investigation.

305
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,220
Do you really think switching materials

306
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,250
and fudging the numbers

307
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,420
will cover it up?

308
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,700
Then tell me, how did I find out?

309
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,490
Father...

310
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,290
Father...

311
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,900
Please, Father...

312
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,220
I... I know I was wrong.

313
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,770
I swear I'll never do it again!

314
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,980
But what do we do now?

315
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,330
You have to help me, Father!

316
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,010
It's all because of Zang Hai,

317
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,420
Father!

318
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,860
He dragged me into this!

319
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,010
Why don't we

320
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,570
throw him under the bus?

321
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,090
Let him take the fall for us?

322
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,090
You took the silver.

323
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,770
What good is it throwing him out now?

324
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,250
Sir,

325
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,180
please calm down.

326
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,770
Don't let this ruin your health.

327
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,250
But you still need to help Zhifu out of this mess.

328
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,980
If you don't want others to take you down,

329
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,290
you'd better start cleaning up your own tracks.

330
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,810
Replace every piece

331
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,860
of tampered material,

332
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,810
and return every bit of silver you stole!

333
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,220
Make up for the shortfall from our treasury!

334
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,770
Understood.

335
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,180
You're using this garbage stone on the tomb?

336
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,220
My Lord...

337
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,140
How did you even find out?

338
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,770
You dare ask me that?

339
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,250
Where did you learn

340
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,620
how to cut corners like this?

341
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,140
My Lord, please forgive me.

342
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,050
I let greed cloud my judgment.

343
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,460
It's all my fault.

344
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,460
I had no idea this would reach your ears.

345
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,380
Zang Hai,

346
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,330
you weren't greedy before.

347
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,530
That's because...

348
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,380
I was working in your household back then,

349
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,570
and I didn't dare bring you any trouble.

350
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,570
I know I was wrong. Please punish me!

351
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,380
Get up.

352
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,490
I feel you're lying to me.

353
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,140
You're not stupid.

354
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,290
You know full well the stakes here.

355
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,050
Now tell me,

356
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,140
did someone force you to do it?

357
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,730
I don't understand

358
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,290
what you mean, My Lord.

359
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,810
I've only ever had you behind me.

360
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,250
This matter

361
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,460
really was all my doing.

362
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,770
I'll ask you one last time.

363
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,290
Did someone force you?

364
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,700
Be honest,

365
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,770
and I won't press further.

366
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,810
But if you stay silent

367
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,620
and I find out later,

368
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,700
I won't be so forgiving.

369
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,180
I swear...

370
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,420
it was all me.

371
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,700
If this ever gets exposed,

372
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,010
the fault will lie with me alone.

373
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,570
I will never drag your household into this.

374
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,660
Something this small

375
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,250
can never drag down my household.

376
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,620
I'll let it slide this time.

377
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,180
But be smarter next time.

378
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,700
I'll remember your kindness, My Lord.

379
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:14,900
Father.

380
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,010
What brings you back?

381
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,860
I'm off duty today,

382
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,330
so I came to pay my respects.

383
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,860
I hunted a leopard recently.

384
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,140
I had the pelt prepared and gave it to the steward.

385
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,730
The weather's getting colder now.

386
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,090
You used to fight in harsh lands,

387
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,570
and it left your legs in poor condition.

388
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,860
I figure a leopard skin

389
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,140
may help keep you warm.

390
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,050
That's thoughtful of you.

391
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,490
But I'm not in the mood today.

392
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,940
You may go now.

393
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,730
Yes, Father.

394
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,010
So, you're a squad leader now?

395
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,010
Yes.

396
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,770
I earned a merit not long ago,

397
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,380
and got promoted.

398
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,010
If I hadn't asked, you wouldn't say a word.

399
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,010
Just a squad leader,

400
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,620
not much to brag about.

401
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,220
That armor

402
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,010
looks good on you.

403
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,050
Zhuang Zhifu should be called "Zhuang the Corrupt."

404
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,180
Still, I owe him a proper thank-you.

405
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,380
If he hadn't

406
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,810
gotten so greedy this time,

407
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,980
I wouldn't have known how to get more hands.

408
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,420
But he never imagined

409
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,010
we weren't after the craftsmen.

410
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,900
We were after him, Zhuang Zhifu himself.

411
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,900
He must've pulled strings

412
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,330
at the Ministries of Works and Rites.

413
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,940
All the timber and stone

414
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,250
were sent over as promised.

415
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,770
Except they were all tampered with.

416
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,810
The Ministry of Revenue allocated

417
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,860
a set amount of silver,

418
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,220
but he used inferior goods

419
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,010
and inflated the labor count.

420
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,620
And he still managed to balance the books perfectly.

421
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,050
If he uses that brain of his properly,

422
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,250
maybe he has made minister by now.

423
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,010
For someone like him

424
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,860
to survive this long in court,

425
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,140
he must've had serious protection.

426
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,050
And the one protecting him

427
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,420
now has to protect you, too.

428
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,180
[Huangji Hall]

429
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,620
Minister He Ziqing seeks audience.

430
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,180
Ministry of Rites,

431
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,700
what is the matter?

432
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,220
The Double Ninth Festival is approaching.

433
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,900
We're preparing the memorial for the late Emperor.

434
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,980
I've heard

435
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,530
General Fu's tomb

436
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,660
won't be finished until after the festival.

437
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,700
However,

438
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,940
in the ten days leading up to a memorial,

439
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,620
construction is considered unlucky.

440
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,140
It may disrupt the rites.

441
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,940
I propose

442
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,330
burying General Fu ten days before the festival.

443
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,530
That way, the memorial stays undisturbed,

444
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,050
and the General receives proper honors.

445
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,050
Minister He, that's well thought-out.

446
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,810
His Majesty will surely be pleased.

447
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,460
But word has it,

448
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,570
the tomb's been progressing very slowly.

449
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,090
Finishing by the festival is already a stretch.

450
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,180
If we move it up ten more days,

451
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,980
it may put the Astronomical Bureau in a bind.

452
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,570
Mr. Cao,

453
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,250
we're already struggling

454
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,180
due to a lack of craftsmen.

455
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,730
If we push it ten days earlier,

456
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,980
I'm afraid we won't be able to manage.

457
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,010
If Mr. Zang truly finds it difficult,

458
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,730
then, Ministry of Rites,

459
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,420
perhaps consider

460
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,490
an alternative plan?

461
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,860
I can't think of any better options,

462
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,570
and we risk messing up either side.

463
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,250
Mr. Zang,

464
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,420
this year's the Double Ninth Festival,

465
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,660
His Majesty plans to attend the memorial in person

466
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,530
to honor the late Emperor and Empress Dowager.

467
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,330
It's a matter of great importance,

468
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,940
not to be taken lightly.

469
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,420
Your skills

470
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,770
in geomancy and construction

471
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,730
are second to none.

472
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,900
Since you managed to reach the deadline

473
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,810
even with a shortage of workers,

474
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,620
we'll assign you more hands this time.

475
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,220
Push a little harder, and finishing ten days early should be possible.

476
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,140
It's a win-win for everyone.

477
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,980
Surely, you won't turn down Minister He's goodwill?

478
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,570
All right.

479
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,180
I'll go report this to His Majesty.

480
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,530
Wait, Mr. Cao!

481
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,810
Matters of funerals and memorial rites

482
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,770
have been jointly handled by the Astronomical Bureau and the Ministry of Rites.

483
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,860
How come now it's all up to Minister He alone?

484
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,980
But since Minister He insists

485
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,490
the tomb must avoid

486
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,460
the ten days before the festival,

487
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,860
then in my opinion, rather than moving it earlier,

488
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,050
why not delay it ten days

489
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,290
after the memorial?

490
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,460
That way, the late Emperor is honored properly,

491
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,420
and we avoid rushing the work

492
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,530
and slighting General Fu.

493
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,700
Minister He,

494
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,290
don't you agree?

495
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,250
Yes.

496
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,490
No, this is wrong.

497
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,420
In the war against the Xiqiang,

498
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,220
General Fu saved the Emperor

499
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,250
and the nation!

500
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,900
Delaying his burial

501
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,860
will be denying him peace.

502
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,620
If we rush it just for a ceremonial offering,

503
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,620
that's even more disrespectful!

504
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,620
It will chill the hearts of our soldiers!

505
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,330
General Fu was loyal and patriotic.

506
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,380
To be buried after the Emperor's rites

507
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,380
is a fitting duty for a subject.

508
00:27:59,030 --> 00:27:59,810
Marquis of Pingjin is right.

509
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,530
General Fu must not be slighted.

510
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,330
There is a proper order in rank and ritual.

511
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,530
The burial should wait till after the festival.

512
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,460
Agreed.

513
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,290
Agreed.

514
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,810
- I agree. - I agree.

515
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,770
Since Marquis of Pingjin has considered all sides,

516
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,380
I'll report this to His Majesty

517
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,290
and follow your recommendation.

518
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,620
He knows full well

519
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,700
Zang Hai dragged his son down with him,

520
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,220
yet he didn't kill him.

521
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,570
He even defended him in court today,

522
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,940
going head-to-head with me.

523
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,810
How protective!

524
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,420
Father,

525
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,420
at least now we've confirmed his stance.

526
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,530
Zhuang Luyin

527
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,530
likely even used his own silver

528
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,530
to cover the shortfall.

529
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,090
For Zang Hai,

530
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,620
he really went all in!

531
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,420
What makes Zang Hai so special?

532
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,810
It has to be the Gui Seal.

533
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,460
Zang Hai must be helping him find it.

534
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,900
And I'd bet

535
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,180
they probably already have a lead.

536
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,810
That's why he's so protective.

537
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,380
After years of lying low,

538
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,290
Zhuang Luyin

539
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,660
suddenly starts making all these moves.

540
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,730
That makes me wonder

541
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,090
how far along he really is.

542
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,940
So that's the full picture.

543
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,140
The Marquis of Pingjin

544
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,050
is surprisingly capable.

545
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,770
Not only did he solve Zang Hai's trouble,

546
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,980
he even bought him ten more days.

547
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,530
Which means

548
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,090
General Fu's tomb can now be completed on time.

549
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,050
But the Marquis and Mr. Cao

550
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,620
used to get along just fine.

551
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,660
Why are they suddenly at odds

552
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,180
over Zang Hai?

553
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,460
Because Mr. Zang is clearly capable

554
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,980
and the Marquis sees his worth.

555
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,460
I don't think it's that simple.

556
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,330
It might have something to do with his secret.

557
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,140
He won't tell us.

558
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,090
Maybe he really has his reasons.

559
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,380
Oh, and I don't?

560
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,660
Fine.

561
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,490
You've got yours. You're the most miserable.

562
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,900
I'm on your side.

563
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,460
You've just recovered.

564
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:37,980
Miss.

565
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,490
Here, drink your medicine.

566
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,180
Then will you...

567
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,010
I know.

568
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,090
I'll keep tracking Mr. Zang's movements for you.

569
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,180
You're truly my bestie!

570
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,050
Greetings, Mr. Cao.

571
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,250
What would you have me do, sir?

572
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,180
Zhifu,

573
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,770
you're the heir of the Marquis

574
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,570
and a Vice Minister of Works.

575
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,290
You're a man with a bright future.

576
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,980
I've always thought highly of you.

577
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,660
But lately,

578
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,980
you've really let me down.

579
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,140
Sir,

580
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,530
I don't understand...

581
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,420
Lu Ran,

582
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,050
show Mr. Zhuang

583
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,180
what you've compiled.

584
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,540
[Zhuang Zhifu's embezzlement of canal construction funds]

585
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,620
[Zhuang Zhifu's embezzlement of canal construction funds]

586
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,010
In the tenth year of Zhenshun, you were posted to Lishui County.

587
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,700
You embezzled state funds for the dam construction.

588
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,380
The next year, the dam broke.

589
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,220
Three counties downstream were flooded.

590
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,220
Your maternal grandfather was still in office back then.

591
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,940
He found someone to take the fall for you.

592
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,660
In the thirteenth year of Zhenshun, as Salt Official in Jian'an,

593
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,220
you illegally raised salt taxes for personal gain.

594
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,660
Your father strong-armed local officials

595
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,770
into taking the blame.

596
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,290
To rein you in,

597
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,460
your grandfather placed you in the Ministry of Works,

598
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,180
the least profitable department.

599
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,330
But you just couldn't change your ways.

600
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,180
Five years ago, when the You River was diverted,

601
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,940
the funds meant to restore the imperial tomb

602
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,940
all ended up in your pocket, right?

603
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,010
You caused water damage to the tomb.

604
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,380
How could the late Emperor rest in peace?

605
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,530
But, sir...

606
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,220
Some of that money...

607
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,940
was yours too!

608
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,770
How dare you!

609
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,330
These formal charges

610
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,420
are all from local officials.

611
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,620
I've kept them sealed until now.

612
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,330
Every time, I covered for you.

613
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,530
You even pulled your petty tricks

614
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,570
during General Fu's burial.

615
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,290
Maybe the Emperor can't see it,

616
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,660
but you think I can't?

617
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,860
If the Emperor ever investigates this,

618
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,660
tell me,

619
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,380
how am I supposed to explain it to His Majesty?

620
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:19,980
Please calm your anger, sir.

621
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,250
Forgive me, sir.

622
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,810
I was foolish

623
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,660
in the past.

624
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,050
Please, for the sake of my father,

625
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,290
let this one go.

626
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,900
I swear

627
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,420
I'll make it up to you.

628
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,660
Good.

629
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,140
Now, tell me,

630
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,140
how exactly will you repay me?

631
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,700
Just recently,

632
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,570
there've been repairs all over the palace.

633
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,330
You've worked so hard.

634
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,730
You worry for His Majesty,

635
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,180
and I worry for you, sir.

636
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,660
How about...

637
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,810
I will check the accounts

638
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,010
and scrape together some silver to honor you?

639
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,140
Even now,

640
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,820
you still thinking about skimming?

641
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,210
This time, even your father can't save you.

642
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,380
Enough. Get up.

643
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,980
For your little show of loyalty,

644
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,690
I'll let it slide.

645
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,860
I have a task for you.

646
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,380
And only you can handle it.

647
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,740
Word is, Zang Hai is helping your father look for something important.

648
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,380
I want you to find out

649
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,780
if he's found it yet.

650
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,460
Sir,

651
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,490
if you want to know what my father's doing,

652
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,900
why not ask him yourself?

653
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,010
If he finds out

654
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,690
I've been snooping behind his back...

655
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,820
I'm not asking you.

656
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,820
You have to look into this for me.

657
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,340
And if you come up empty...

658
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,010
Lu Yan!

659
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,570
This is...

660
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,570
Zhang Ding,

661
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,210
the Military Affairs Censor!

662
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,010
Did he confess?

663
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,460
He confessed to everything.

664
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,420
I was investigating army fund embezzlement for the Emperor.

665
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,420
I didn't expect it to lead to you, Mr. Zhang.

666
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,690
If the amount were smaller,

667
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,650
I could've helped you bury it.

668
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,130
But...

669
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,940
you stole a full eighty thousand taels of silver!

670
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,650
I've been waiting all this time

671
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,570
for you to come clean

672
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,820
on your own.

673
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,340
But you stayed quiet.

674
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,300
So now, I have no choice

675
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,650
but to report it to His Majesty.

676
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,860
And let him decide your fate!

677
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,170
Mr. Cao,

678
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,780
please spare me!

679
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,780
I... I didn't know the rules before!

680
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,490
Sir,

681
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,460
please let me live!

682
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,050
I'll repay you!

683
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,460
Sir,

684
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,820
have mercy!

685
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,980
Too late.

686
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,380
Please, have mercy!

687
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,530
Sir...

688
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,780
No, please!

689
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,860
Spare me!

690
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,610
I'm begging you...

691
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,530
Sir...

692
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,740
Sir... I...

693
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:41,900
I...

694
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,530
Zhifu,

695
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,650
then it's settled between us.

696
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,690
You must get this done for me.

697
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,980
Find out the truth.

698
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,090
Dear, eat something.

699
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,780
I'm not in the mood. Take it away.

700
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,650
Just a bite?

701
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,740
I said no!

702
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,420
Take it away!

703
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,690
Get out. Now!

704
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,940
Mr. Zang.

705
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,740
Oh, Mr. Zhuang.

706
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,900
What brings you here?

707
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,050
No need to be so formal.

708
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,780
Just call me Zhifu.

709
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,130
So, do you need something from me?

710
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:08,690
Come on.

711
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,570
This way, please.

712
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,010
Have a seat.

713
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,740
Zang Hai,

714
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,570
in the past,

715
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,530
I may have slighted you. Don't take it to heart.

716
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,170
After all, we're on the same side.

717
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,210
Young Master, you've always treated me well.

718
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,610
You never once slighted me.

719
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,780
I'm just someone who worked for the Marquis.

720
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,420
We're practically family.

721
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,780
Exactly!

722
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,530
We're family!

723
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,010
Then it's settled.

724
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,420
From today on,

725
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,340
I'm your sworn elder brother,

726
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,130
and you're my younger brother Zang Hai.

727
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,530
Zang Hai, look.

728
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,740
What do you think of this jade?

729
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,780
It's pure in color, smooth like cream.

730
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,940
What top-quality mutton-fat jade!

731
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,820
Do you like it?

732
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,170
Young Master...

733
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,130
You've worked tirelessly on General Fu's funeral,

734
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,260
solved such a tough problem for the Ministry

735
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,490
and lifted a burden off my shoulders.

736
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,780
This jade is my gift to you, bro.

737
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,780
Young Master,

738
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,170
I really can't accept it.

739
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,820
- Just take it! - Young Master...

740
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,260
I truly can't.

741
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,690
Come on, bro.

742
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,340
A gentleman deserves fine jade. Just take it!

743
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,420
No, Young Master...

744
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,820
Fine.

745
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,820
Then...

746
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,860
Thanks for your generosity.

747
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,260
You're welcome.

748
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,340
Come, sit.

749
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,210
Back when you were serving in our household,

750
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,130
I already admired your talent.

751
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,050
But work kept me too busy

752
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,300
to ever really talk with you.

753
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,210
My father once told me

754
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,740
to get close to you

755
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,820
and learn from your way of dealing with people.

756
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,260
Now that I've finally wrapped up my duties,

757
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,380
I've got time.

758
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,090
I'll be visiting more often to seek your guidance.

759
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,090
Of course.

760
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,340
If there's ever anything I can help you with,

761
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,050
I'll hold nothing back.

762
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,490
Great!

763
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,340
It's a deal, then.

764
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,380
I'll come by tomorrow.

765
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,340
Excellent tea.

766
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,460
People don't just show up for no reason.

767
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,740
That last matter's over,

768
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,380
and now Zhuang Zhifu's suddenly buttering you up...

769
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,340
Hai,

770
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,820
is he trying to cash in again?

771
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,490
The Marquis just gave him a good scare.

772
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,490
He probably doesn't have the guts to try anything soon.

773
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,570
Right now,

774
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,090
the one most eager to get to the bottom of things

775
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,260
is Cao Jingxian.

776
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,940
What kind of deal did he offer Zhuang Zhifu

777
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,340
to get him to betray his father?

778
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,170
Maybe Zhuang Zhifu

779
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,900
gave Cao Jingxian too many favors in the past.

780
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,460
Hai,

781
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,340
what are you drawing?

782
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,940
The Gui Seal.

783
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,610
You've seen it?

784
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,050
Of course not.

785
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,050
But neither have Cao Jingxian or Zhuang Zhifu.

786
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,530
Ever since Lu Jin's death,

787
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,780
I've planted a seed of doubt

788
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,820
in Cao Jingxian's heart.

789
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:53,210
And now, it's ready to sprout.
