00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,740
This is the place.

4
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,930
It's so well hidden.

5
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,980
After more than ten years, you still found it.

6
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,460
Have you forgotten everything my father taught you

7
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,630
about geomancy?

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,130
I never really learned properly.

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,410
Right beneath our feet

10
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,340
is the tunnel my father used

11
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,610
to sneak me out back then.

12
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,730
It connects directly to the tomb passage,

13
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,690
which is closest to the diamond wall.

14
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,780
When I left, my father told me

15
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,500
to fill it up again,

16
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,220
to keep tomb robbers out.

17
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,290
If it's sealed off,

18
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,540
how did Master get inside?

19
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,500
My father was away in Dongxia for so long.

20
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,100
Other tomb robbers must've discovered this place.

21
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,010
Here's what we'll do:

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,450
Split up and search.

23
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:24,940
Guanfeng!

24
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,820
Come here.

25
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,220
Here.

26
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,100
Father,

27
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,010
this tomb is actually for a married couple.

28
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,290
Check around and find out

29
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,410
who they were.

30
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,810
The coffin decorations are very detailed,

31
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,900
and the materials are high quality.

32
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,900
This isn't an ordinary family's coffin.

33
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,730
But why isn't there an inscription?

34
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,290
This tomb owner is so strange.

35
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,780
The gold, jade, and coffin here

36
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,900
are all top-quality,

37
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,290
but there's no inscription.

38
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,780
Could it be...

39
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,100
they didn't want their identity known?

40
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,050
Both sides of the coffin are full of books.

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,220
The owner was clearly a civil official,

42
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,340
and a very high-ranking one at that.

43
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,700
What kind of high official

44
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,540
would need to hide their identity?

45
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,170
I suspect the inscription

46
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,050
is hidden inside this stone turtle.

47
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,810
Then why didn't he

48
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,290
carve it openly on the outside,

49
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,220
but hid it instead where no one would find it?

50
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,490
When Mom taught me,

51
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,730
she mentioned a person

52
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,980
who traveled everywhere,

53
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,340
using money to stir conflict among nations.

54
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,780
And if that didn't work, he'd assassinate them.

55
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,100
That man was Liu Xian, the former Senior Secretary.

56
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,250
He always hid his true identity,

57
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,980
so naturally, he'd hide his inscription too.

58
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,100
Let me check

59
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,170
if it's really him.

60
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,850
It really is Liu Xian!

61
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,140
[Liu Xian]
It's really Liu Xian's tomb!

62
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,050
Master.

63
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,780
We've finished checking

64
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,810
Liu Xian's tomb tunnels.

65
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,250
It seems like

66
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,580
they've been digging for several days.

67
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,610
They'll probably break through

68
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,850
to the rear chamber in less than two days.

69
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,340
And the tunnel we used to get in

70
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,410
is connected to the passage.

71
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,220
Luckily, the robbers died in the traps.

72
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,900
Otherwise, this place would be ruined.

73
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,050
They'll definitely keep digging.

74
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,220
Wait here and catch them all.

75
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,250
And don't forget to fill up

76
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,930
every single tunnel.

77
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,850
Nothing here should be disturbed.

78
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,140
Yes.

79
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,460
The Imperial Astronomers are responsible

80
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,410
for restoring and protecting important tombs,

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,100
but we're forbidden from excavating on our own.

82
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,100
Understood.

83
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,810
There are burnt torches on the ground.

84
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,460
All cleaned out.

85
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,050
Judging from the tunnels,

86
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,410
three groups of robbers came here.

87
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,780
Some died in traps,

88
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,140
others died fighting each other.

89
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,980
Then could what we're looking for

90
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,780
already be gone?

91
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,850
Split up and check around.

92
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,020
If you find anything strange,

93
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,170
tell me immediately.

94
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,220
Alright.

95
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,220
Be careful!

96
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,420
What's this thing?

97
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,580
Don't worry.

98
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,420
This is Liu Xian's inscription.

99
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,420
The coffin is empty.

100
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,770
Shilei, give me a hand.

101
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,940
What are you doing?

102
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,220
My father always said

103
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,490
Imperial Astronomers

104
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,490
must show respect for every body.

105
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,460
Even if we don't find

106
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,580
what we're looking for,

107
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,180
we should still give them a proper burial.

108
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,610
Before we leave,

109
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,340
restore the coffin to how it was.

110
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,770
Why is this pattern reversed?

111
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,900
[Inscription]

112
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,700
Not even tomb robbers realized

113
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,980
there's another secret

114
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,940
hidden in Liu Xian's tomb.

115
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,980
This carving knife

116
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,100
was my father's favorite.

117
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,340
The handle of the knife

118
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,730
has a chipped corner.

119
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,700
My father felt bad about it for a long time.

120
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,580
It seems this carving

121
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,460
was secretly made by my father.

122
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,180
But if Master carved this,

123
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,420
why did he

124
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,420
leave one character blank at the end?

125
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,610
"The way of the sage

126
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,770
can be summed up in one word..."

127
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,370
"Human"?

128
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,130
Or...

129
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,460
"Victory"?

130
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,420
Hey, stop!

131
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,010
What's wrong?

132
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,180
There are so many scattered characters here,

133
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,940
but he left only one blank.

134
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,530
I'm afraid if we choose wrong,

135
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,250
we won't get another chance.

136
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,850
Then which character should we choose?

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,300
A word that can summarize

138
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,580
Shan Yizi's entire life...

139
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,980
Shan Yizi?

140
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,420
Not Liu Xian?

141
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,580
Look carefully at this carving.

142
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,300
It describes a sage

143
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,820
who cared deeply for the people.

144
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,490
These words couldn't describe

145
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,180
Liu Xian.

146
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,420
They can only refer to his master, Shan Yizi.

147
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,610
Liu Xian wasn't capable

148
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,730
of traveling to many states

149
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,890
and preserving peace,

150
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,650
like Shan Yizi.

151
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,220
All Liu Xian could do was create conflicts

152
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,650
through schemes and assassinations,

153
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,610
seeking his own benefit.

154
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,460
The thing he never understood

155
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,250
is precisely this missing character.

156
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,130
"Virtue."

157
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,730
"Benevolence."

158
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,010
"Mercy."

159
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,580
"Harmony."

160
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,490
"Balance."

161
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,610
"The sage's way

162
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,060
in one word is..."

163
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:50,980
Zhinu,

164
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,130
is this the thing

165
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,060
Master hid?

166
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,420
The one they fought over,

167
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,340
the thing that led them

168
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,420
to destroy my entire family,

169
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,940
is it this?

170
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,060
Quick, take it out and see!

171
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,770
Shilei, help me with this.

172
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,100
Be careful!

173
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,010
What... what is this thing?

174
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,300
This isn't what

175
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,130
we were looking for.

176
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,060
This is a bronze tube

177
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,130
my father made.

178
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,220
Father,

179
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,650
didn't you always

180
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,770
want to make this?

181
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,850
Now that it's finished,

182
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,060
why aren't you happy?

183
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,420
This bronze tube

184
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,610
holds our ancestors' wisdom.

185
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,650
I studied ancient texts

186
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,130
to find out how to make it.

187
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,820
But when it was finally completed,

188
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,580
I suddenly realized

189
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,370
I was too focused on its clever mechanisms

190
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,250
and overlooked that it's actually a weapon.

191
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,300
If it falls into the wrong hands,

192
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,420
the consequences could be disastrous.

193
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,250
Then let's hide it

194
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,770
so no bad guys can find it.

195
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,180
Zhinu, you're very clever.

196
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,850
All right.

197
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,370
We'll put it away for now

198
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,420
and find a place

199
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,300
where no one will discover it.

200
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,650
After that,

201
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,820
I never saw this bronze tube again.

202
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,610
Only today did I realize

203
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,180
my father

204
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,420
had hidden it here long ago.

205
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,580
Was it the day he returned from Dongxia?

206
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:18,820
No.

207
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,100
It must have been when I was young,

208
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,180
the time he brought me here.

209
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,980
But if Master

210
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,060
didn't visit here that day,

211
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,730
why did he

212
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,300
take a detour home from the southwest?

213
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,370
Anyway,

214
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,530
since Father didn't take the bronze tube,

215
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,730
the thing he brought from Dongxia

216
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,180
won't be here either.

217
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,580
Let's go back.

218
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,730
No need to search here anymore.

219
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,180
Come on.

220
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,330
Zhinu,

221
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,090
we didn't find

222
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,140
the thing you're looking for.

223
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,730
What should we do next?

224
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,660
We didn't come away empty-handed.

225
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,660
This bronze tube is extremely powerful.

226
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,700
Compared to poisoning someone directly,

227
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,620
this tube gives us

228
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,900
better chances to succeed.

229
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,700
Then let's kill him together.

230
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,330
I... I can help you.

231
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,730
No.

232
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,290
We've only just reunited,

233
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,490
and you're my only family now.

234
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,570
I can't let you risk your life with me.

235
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,620
But I can't

236
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,250
let you go alone

237
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,250
on such a dangerous mission!

238
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,220

239

trust me.

240
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,250
I've already made a plan to escape safely.

241
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,660
Are you sure?

242
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,380
Once I'm done,

243
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,730
we'll leave together.

244
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,770
We'll find

245
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,330
a beautiful place,

246
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,250
where no one knows us.

247
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,250
Zhinu,

248
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,490
you've always been smarter than me.

249
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,380
Your plan must be a good one.

250
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,180
But you must promise me

251
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,140
to come back safely.

252
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,730
Don't worry.

253
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,700
There's one more thing for you two.

254
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,490
Fill up this tunnel

255
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,940

all prepared?

269
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,980
Everything is ready.

270
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,700
We're just waiting for the evening ceremony.

271
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,180
Good.

272
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,490
You can continue your work.

Yes, sir.

274
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,530
Father, I know

275
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,290
you made

276
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,490
this incredible device

277
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,980
not to kill people,

278
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,570
but because you didn't want the technique lost.

279
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,250
You cherished this skill deeply

280
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,420
and never wanted it

281
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,010
tainted by evil intent.

282
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,220
But Father, I have no choice now.

283
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,770
It's in my hands,

284
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,220
and I will use it to kill the Marquis of Pingjin,

285

286

Mr. Zang.

288
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,140
What are you doing?

289
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,290
I was reconsidering the timing.

290
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,180
Tonight's ceremony is at sunset.

291
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,420
Sunset corresponds to wine vessels

292
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,810
and symbolizes a good harvest.

293
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,940
So I moved the wine vessel

294
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,380
to the left, to show respect.

295
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,460
I got some ashes on it.

296
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,620
I was just cleaning them.

297
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,570
There's even a custom for this?

298
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,940
You're truly meticulous, sir.

299

The Emperor still favors us greatly.

A few days ago,

00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,420
he praised Zhifu for his good work.

is a serious family tradition.

339
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,620
Perhaps we should wait for Zhixing

340

00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,290
why are you so nervous?

Mr. Zang always plans carefully.

of arranging the ancestral hall

364
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,460

there are unusual.

There's a golden thread inside each.

371

Forgive me, My Lord.

Today's ceremony honors the late Marquis.

376
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,620
These incenses contain golden threads.

00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,220
Fire melts gold,

380
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,860
I boldly chose them for the prayers,

381
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,420

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,420
and ensure our family's prosperity.

384
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,770
Zhuang Shan.

385
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,570
Yes?

386
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,900
Check the incense burner.

387
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:24,940
Yes, sir.

388
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,090
If it's for the family's well-being,

389
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,490
why did you act on your own

390
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,620
without consulting anyone?

391
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,730
My Lord, you're strong-willed and decisive.

392
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,180
I feared you wouldn't believe

393
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,620
in these feng shui things and be annoyed,

394
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,900
so I acted on my own.

395
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,050
Please punish me.

396
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,330
I was born with the fire element.

397
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,220
Why else could I achieve so many victories?

398
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,250
Zhuang Shan.

399
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,010
My Lord.

400
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,900
Zang Hai was thinking of our family's welfare.

401
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,460
You disrupted his good intentions.

402
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,250
You deserve punishment.

403
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,770
It was my fault.

404
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,180
I acted foolishly.

405
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,010
Carry on.

406
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,820
[Yu Garden]

407
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,090
If the mechanism isn't in the burner,

408
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,090
where could it be?

409
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,050
I placed it there at 3 p.m.,

410
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,090
but by 5 p.m., it was gone.

411
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,940
That's only two hours.

412
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,220
How could it just vanish?

413
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,220
Someone must have noticed my plot,

414
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,810
but clearly the Marquis doesn't know yet.

415
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,860
Could a servant have seen it

416
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,730
and thrown it away as something useless?

417
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,490
Or did someone take it,

418
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,420
waiting for the right moment

419
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,620
to inform the Marquis?

420
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,420
Sir, you're back.

421
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,940
Would you like some snacks?

422
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,730
No, I don't eat sweets.

423
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,140
You can take them and share.

424
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,290
Thank you, sir.

425
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,700
Has the ancestral hall altar

426
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,810
been cleaned up?

427
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,530
Yes, sir. It's all done.

428
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,140
The offerings were already shared out

429
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,050
among the servants.

430
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,940
All ritual items are neatly stored.

431
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,330
The leftover garbage

432
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,220
was moved to the backyard.

433
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,420
It'll be carted away soon.

434
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,050
All right.

435
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,980
Understood.

436
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,050
You may leave now.

437
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,900
Yes, sir.

438
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,250
Looking for something?

439
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,010
Is this what you're after?

440
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,530
Why do you want to kill him now?

441
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,010
I saw my parents.

442
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,180
They were skinned and tortured by the Marquis.

443
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,050
Their bodies were hidden in a secret chamber,

444
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,490
trampled underfoot.

445
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,570
They can't rest in peace even now.

446
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,980
Have you thought about how you'll escape?

447
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,460
My original plan

448
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,380
was to flee in the chaos

449
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,420
before the guards sealed off the mansion.

450
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,810
But unexpectedly,

451
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,900
the steward swapped my incense.

452
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,530
If you hadn't stepped in,

453
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,620
the Marquis would have discovered my plot today.

454
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,620
A mere steward wouldn't dare act alone.

455
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,380
The Marquis

456
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,570
must have planned this long ago,

457
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,810
just waiting for you to fall into his trap.

458
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,660
Have you never considered

459
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,380
the person who wants you to kill him

460
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,770
could be the Marquis himself?

461
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,700
In a few days, it'll be my father's anniversary.

462
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,570
We'll hold a private ceremony first,

463
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,220
[Zhuang Clan Ancestral Hall]
then visit the tombs.

464
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,810
Make your preparations.

465
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,330
Why the Marquis moved me into the inner courtyard?

466
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,220
Aides usually live in the Scholar Hall.

467
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,660
Even at Yang Zhen's peak,

468
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,220
he didn't get to live in the inner courtyard.

469
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,380
Those seated at this table

470
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,980
are my most trusted men.

471
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,420
[In the vial is deadly poison. Use it to kill the Marquis.]
My Lord, lately in town,

472
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,010
there are rumors about me.

473
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,050
I've heard plenty of rumors.

474
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,980
They're just nonsense.

475
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,220
Don't pay attention.

476
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,420
These are all blueprints from the Ministry of Works.

477
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,620
The Marquis means

478
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,530
in the future,

479
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,620
he wants you to assist Zhifu more.

480
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,460
It shows he trusts you.

481
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,900
Getting close to him is easier now.

482
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,570
After serving the congee,

483
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,330
go directly to my study

484
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,660
and fetch the "Wei Liao's Art of War."

485
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,700
From now on,

486
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,050
you may freely enter my study

487
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,700
without needing permission.

488
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,530
So, the Marquis is testing me.

489
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,940
He lets me freely enter the treasury and study

490
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,620
just to make me lower my guard.

491
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,900
If you calm down now,

492
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,980
you'll see it clearly.

493
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,530
The Marquis of Pingjin has many enemies.

494
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,180
Now you're his closest aide.

495
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,220
He just wants to see

496
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,730
if you'll betray him under pressure.

497
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,380
Don't underestimate him.

498
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,860
And don't think

499
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,290
you can easily outsmart him.

500
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,250
If he dies, you're doomed too.

501
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,180
Killing the Marquis of Pingjin

502
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,140
is the only reason

503
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,220
I'm still alive.

504
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,140
Come in.

505
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,300
My Lord.

506
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:25,980
My Lord,

507
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,010
I've made a huge mistake.

508
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,010
Please punish me!

509
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:33,980
What happened?

510
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,090
I received this recently.

511
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,940
I'm afraid someone believes the rumors

512
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,170
and is trying to blackmail me into harming you.

513
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,650
I was overconfident,

514
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,260
thinking I could easily expose

515
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,050
this small-time trickster

516
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,780
within two days.

517
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,050
I didn't want to trouble you

518
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,570
with something so trivial.

519
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,090
But...

520
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,610
But I'm useless.

521
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,860
Two days have passed without any clues.

522
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,340
Now,

523
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,780
the three-day deadline written on this fan is near.

524
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,940
I'm worried they mean real harm,

525
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,300
and someone truly intends

526
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,380
to hurt you.

527
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,530
So I must inform you in time.

528
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,050
Since they could reach me,

529
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,940
they might target others too.

530
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,210
My Lord,

531
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,420
please be extra cautious these days.

532
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,740
You're worried they'll hurt me,

533
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,820
but more afraid that they'll punish you instead

534
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,780
if nothing happens in three days.

535
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,610
Forgive me, My Lord!

536
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,490
I...

537
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,820
I'm indeed afraid to die,

538
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,490
but I'm more afraid of putting you in danger.

539
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,610
You smart people

540
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,860
always overthink things.

541
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,650
I've told you before,

542
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,010
don't worry so much.

543
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,090
Forget these silly rumors.

544
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,610
The number of people wanting me dead

545
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,780
is too many to count.

546
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,820
But these cowards who hide their faces

547
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,300
can't possibly harm me.

548
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,420
Now you're one of my trusted aides.

549
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,300
Naturally, they'll target you first.

550
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,090
Remember,

551
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,570
I'm backing you now.

552
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,820
If anything comes up,

553
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,420
don't keep it bottled up.

554
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,490
Just speak up.

555
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,130
Thank you, My Lord!

556
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,860
Then about this matter...

557
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,340
Enough.

558
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,860
You can leave now.

559
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,460
I'll investigate this myself.

560
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,650
Yes, My Lord.

561
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,380
[Reflect Deeply, Grow Endlessly]

562
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,130
Killing the Marquis of Pingjin

563
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,210
is the only reason

564
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,460
I'm still alive.

565
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,940
If you're blinded by hatred,

566
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,690
you'll never get revenge.

567
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,260
Even if the Marquis dies by your hand,

568
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,010
you won't get another chance

569
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,460
for a second or third strike.

570
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,380
You mean...

571
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,490
What if I told you

572
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,300
The Marquis of Pingjin isn't your only enemy?

573
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,860
And there are others involved?

574
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,860
I've investigated in the Capital for years,

575
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,940
and found out the true masterminds

576
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,300
behind the destruction of the Kuai family.

577
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,940
Besides the Marquis of Pingjin,

578
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,260
include two others.

579
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,460
These three conspired to seize the item

580
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,090
your father brought back from Dongxia.

581
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,170
So, your enemy isn't one person,

582
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,530
but three.

583
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,820
Sir,

584
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,940
I found a bronze fish

585
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,340
in the Marquis's secret chamber.

586
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,650
A bronze fish?

587
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,490
I saw him take it from my father

588
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,010
on the night my family was slaughtered.

589
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,300
But as I remember,

590
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,820
there were three fish linked together.

591
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,610
That means

592
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,740
each of the three conspirators

593
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,210
probably took one fish.

594
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,490
Who are they?

595
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,420
One is the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director,

596
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,780
Cao Jingxian.

597
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,170
With immense power in his hands,

598
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,260
he does whatever he wants.

599
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,490
He often frames court officials

600
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,380
to eliminate political rivals

601
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,340
and expands his influence.

602
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,210
The Marquis of Pingjin allowed Qu Jiao to kill openly.

603
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,340
Guess why all the petitions against him

604
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,940
ended up in his mansion?

605
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,690
Cao Jingxian suppressed them?

606
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,820
They cover for each other.

607
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,050
Who's the third one?

608
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,340
I've been wondering for years

609
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,530
how two unrelated people

610
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,570
suddenly allied overnight.

611
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,460
Ten years ago,

612
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,570
the night the Marquis of Pingjin returned from Dongxia,

613
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,690
both he and Cao Jingxian

614
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,820
left their residences.

615
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,530
The next day, the Kuai family was destroyed.

616
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,130
I'm certain they met the third conspirator

617
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,050
that night.

618
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,610
But this person is deeply hidden.

619
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,300
I've never found

620
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,780
any clues about him.

621
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,650
The bronze fish you mentioned

622
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,610
confirms he exists.

623
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,530
Please teach me what I should do.

624
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,380
If it were me,

625
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,420
I'd lay low

626
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,820
and wait for the right moment.

627
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,330
I'm sorry, sir.

628
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,420
I can't do that.

629
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,340
It seems Gao Ming didn't teach you

630
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,940
how to keep calm.

631
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,650
Your mind is too restless.

632
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,940
Sir, you overestimate me.

633
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,210
I've hidden myself for ten years

634
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,420
just to kill the Marquis of Pingjin.

635
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,820
I thought I'd finally gotten close enough,

636
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,210
and only needed one last strike

637
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,610
to succeed.

638
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,650
But now,

639
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,860
instead of gaining his trust,

640
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,530
I've gained two more enemies.

641
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,940
Every night, in my dreams,

642
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,050
I see my parents' longing eyes.

643
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,530
Every day I live

644
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,340
is unbearable torment.

645
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,340
I don't want them to wait forever.

646
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,050
But what I fear most isn't the waiting.

647
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,530
It's wasting my whole life,

648
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,610
only to fail at revenge.

649
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,530
You could, of course,

650
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,170
use all your strength to strike once.

651
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,980
But if the Marquis dies,

652
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,940
the other two will know immediately.

653
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,090
Then you'll have no chance

654
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,050
to approach them again.

655
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,690
You can kill the Marquis now

656
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,130
and die afterward,

657
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:25,260
or swallow your anger for a bigger plan.

658
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,940
It's your choice.
