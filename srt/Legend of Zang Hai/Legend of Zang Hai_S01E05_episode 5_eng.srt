1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,010



2
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,686
   

4
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,480
You stay behind and go over the inventory one more time.

5
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,540
Yes, Sir Yang.

6
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,310
I chose you because I trust you.

7
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,460
You're meticulous.

8
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,680
You've only just arrived, so you're unfamiliar with how things work here.

9
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,310
So, start with this task, train yourself, and broaden your horizons.

10
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,870
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

11
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,430
Search this man thoroughly when he leaves.

12
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,000
If he's carrying anything extra, arrest him on the spot.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,450
Yes, sir.

14
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,950
   

15
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,840
Who are you?

16
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,650
Who are you?

17
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,680
What are you doing here?

18
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,700
Why didn't you show respect when seeing the Young Master?

19
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,820
 It's three against one. 

20
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,240
 How despicable! 

21
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,930
 When I become a general in the future, I'll kill you all. 

22
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,120
I am Zang Hai.

23
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,900
Greetings, Second Young Master.

24
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,360
You recognize me?

25
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,610
Second Young Master is talented. Everyone here knows you.

26
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,950
Let me ask you.

27
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,720
What is an aide doing in the treasury

28
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,090
instead of staying in the Scholar Hall late at night?

29
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,160
I was ordered

30
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,900
to check the inventory. 
    

31
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,310
Why do the inventory in pitch darkness?

32
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,850
You must have been overwhelmed by what you saw.

33
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,090
I'm from a humble background without many possessions.

34
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,750
I've indeed never seen such a magnificent place

35
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,930
filled with the rarest treasures.

36
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,530
I knew it.

37
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,950
But ever since I was young, my mother taught me,

38
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,430
"A true man's will grows stronger in poverty."

39
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,310
No matter how poor I am,

40
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,360
I will never steal from the treasury.

41
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,070
I'm here alone tonight under Sir Yang's order.

42
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,830
Ask the guards at the entrance if you don't believe me.

43
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,090
Fine.

44
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,510
If you say so, I believe you.

45
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,600
I've matters to attend, too. I'm leaving.

46
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,820
How strange.

47
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,810
I didn't plan to take so many things when I went out today.

48
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,020
What's so funny?

49
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,510
Listen. You're lucky to run into me instead of my father.

50
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,530
If he saw you sneaking around at this late hour,

51
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,380
you wouldn't have an excuse for this.

52
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,330
As the Second Young Master, why are you here to steal something?

53
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,320
I'm not stealing.

54
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,650
I'm taking them.

55
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,060
The Marquis Residence is my home.

56
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,950
Naturally, everything here also belongs to me.

57
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,390
I'm simply taking a few things to appreciate and play with.

58
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,350
Is there a problem?

59
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,380
No problem. Of course, it's not a problem.

60
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,160
I was too talkative.

61
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,220
I talked too much.

62
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,070
Second Young Master, don't worry.

63
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,650
I absolutely didn't see you tonight.

64
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,980
All right.

65
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,490
Let's bind our vow with clasped palms.

66
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,440
This golden gourd is a gift for you.

67
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,700
- Let's go. 
 - Second Young Master, this...

68
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,920
Why aren't you leaving?

69
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,550
I haven't finished my task.

70
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,740
Fine. It's so late.

71
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,480
Go back now.

72
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,030
   

73
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,530
Marquis,

74
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,410
this is the list of the treasures rewarded by His Majesty.

75
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,200
Please review it.

76
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,440
   

77
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,770
   

78
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,510
   

79
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,790
Who compiled this treasury list?

80
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,030
It's different from what you compiled.

81
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,530
It was done by one of our aides.

82
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,260
Am I asking a general question?

83
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,080
Who compiled this list?

84
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,080
An aide named Zang Hai.

85
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,940
That geomancy master?

86
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,630
You've a good memory, Marquis.

87
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,680
Seems like he left a deep impression on you.

88
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,016
   
   

89
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,440
This new aide doesn't understand the rules.

90
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,000
He made you angry.

91
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,870
Please forgive him.

92
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,290
I will send him away tomorrow.

93
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,910
Who said he made me angry?

94
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,050
Do you think I'm that narrow-minded?

95
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,620
No, I wouldn't dare.

96
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,620
   
   

97
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,600
   

98
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,820
 In the sixth year of the Zhenshun era, 

99
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,040
 the General of Agile Cavalry led 800 cavalrymen 

100
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,800
 on a night attack at Yanling Pass 

101
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,680
 and beheaded General Sepuli. 

102
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,580
 The army of Dongxia was in disarray. 

103
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,940
 The General of Agile Cavalry pursued the retreating enemies, 

104
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,030
 claimed three cities, and seized countless trophies. 

105
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,100
 Military morale soared, the imperial court and people rejoiced. 

106
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,340
 The battle of Yanling Pass laid the foundation 

107
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,030
 for the final victory of Great Yong. 

108
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,750
 Therefore, among all the trophies, 

109
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,800
 this Long Wind Sword of Sepuli was the most precious item. 

110
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,680
He actually knows.

111
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,710
The Yanling night attack

112
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,010
wasn't as awe-inspiring as the other battles,

113
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:45,080
but to me, it was thrilling and unforgettable.

114
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,870
I was quite young back then.

115
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,520
I had the courage for that night ride.

116
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,500
I'm old now.

117
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,840
You're not old and are in good shape, just like back then.

118
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,380
Those who wrote about my legends,

119
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,360
wrote about my major victories to please me.

120
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,690
But few know the significance of the Yanling night attack to me.

121
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,060
This Zang Hai has insight.

122
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,270
He does know a few things about me.

123
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,710
What is he doing in the residence now?

124
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,200
Just like the others, he's writing your biographies.

125
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,720
What do you think of him?

126
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,020
Your judgement of him must be right.

127
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,550
If he is truly talented,

128
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,630
you must nurture him well on my behalf.

129
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,940
He can share your burden one day.

130
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,740
Yes, My Lord.

131
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,350
I will not disappoint your painstaking hard work.

132
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,630
I told you this brat was full of tricks.

133
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,020
He won't stop until he shows off in front of the Marquis.

134
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,390
He could even be outstanding with an inventory list.

135
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,100
He spent a lot of effort on it.

136
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:09,270
I fear you will work for the Marquis with him soon.

137
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,720
You've been in charge of the aides for years.

138
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,200
Don't let this young man rock the boat.

139
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,720
If you let him do this, my life won't be easy, either.

140
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,860
He'll hold a grudge for the hardship I've put him through.

141
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,260
There were many young men

142
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,420
smarter than he who failed to obtain power.

143
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,180
Since the Marquis has mentioned him,

144
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,110
we should pay some attention.

145
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,240
Coming.

146
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,170
Sir Zang, Sir Yang invites you to Zhen Tower at the Xu* ( 7:00 p.m.) hour.

147
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,700
All right.

148
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,120
- Bravo. 
 - Bravo.

149
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,520
   

150
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,790
Second Young Master Zhuang owes Lotus House 500 taels,

151
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,080
Peony House, 320 taels,

152
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,790
850 taels to Exquisite Music Winehouse,

153
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,537
170 taels to *Yaksha Comedy Theater, 
  (*A ferocious Buddhist spirit) 

154
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:43,777
and also owes 1,325 taels to the gambling house.

155
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,170
-  Bookkeepers, is the debt correct? 
 - Yes.

156
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,790
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

157
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,700
So, he owes Zhen Tower 3,165 taels in total.

158
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,600
Where is Second Young Master Zhuang now?

159
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,370
In the gambling house.

160
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,670
Invite him over.

161
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,060
Understood.

162
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,650
Yang Zhen from the Marquis Residence is also here.

163
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,590
He's at Jing'er Court.

164
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,530
Is he alone?

165
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,980
He's with Qu Jiao and Chu Huaiming.

166
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,380
Are they only here for fun?

167
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,270
I heard they're holding a feast for an aide called Zang Hai.

168
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,250
Zang Hai?

169
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,320
I have never heard of him.

170
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,990
He's here.

171
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,870
It's him.

172
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,250
- Keep an eye on him. 
 - Understood.

173
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,630
Brother Qu, come.

174
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,200
Let's drink to this wonderful moment.

175
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,810
Come, let's have some fun.

176
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,800
- Sing aloud in daylight, we drink with cheer. 
 - Guess which hand.

177
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,570
- With spring as companion, homeward we steer. 
 - Whoever loses drinks.

178
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,530
   

179
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,540
Feed me again.

180
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,040
It doesn't count.

181
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,000
Stop teasing me, Sir Yang.

182
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,360
I just fed you.

183
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,640
Why doesn't it count?

184
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,860
It only counts if you feed me with your rosy lips.

185
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,000
I am Aide Zang Hai from the Scholar Hall.

186
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,960
I pay my respects to you.

187
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,670
There you are, Brother Zang Hai.

188
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,120
Come here. Sit.

189
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,480
Brother, don't be shy.

190
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,960
You've been living in the Marquis Residence for quite some time

191
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,550
and so deserve a fleeting moment of joy and pleasure.

192
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,360
It will help you with the writing.

193
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,320
This is my humble opinion.

194
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,890
What do you think, Brother?

195
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,295
What a refined hobby you have, My Lords.

196
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:13,160
I wonder why Sir Yang summoned me here tonight.

197
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Don't be so uptight.

198
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,880
It's Sir Yang's birthday today.

199
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,070
We especially invited you here to celebrate.

200
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,000
So, it is Sir Yang's birthday.

201
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,900
But... But I didn't prepare anything.

202
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,580
Your presence is all we need.

203
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,400
We see each other all the time in the Marquis Residence.

204
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,960
Spare the formality.

205
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,670
You're new and haven't seen the liveliness of the capital.

206
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,250
Today, let's just hang out and relax.

207
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,720
You heard Sir Yang.

208
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,800
Don't turn down Sir Yang's goodwill.

209
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,590
Thank you, Sir Yang.

210
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,190
Come in.

211
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,340
Among all the aides,

212
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,160
only one person managed to pull some tricks under my nose.

213
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,490
And only one person managed to catch my attention.

214
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,060
Sir Yang, what do you mean?

215
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,190
I don't understand.

216
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,780
It's fine that you don't understand.

217
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,830
I searched the entire city and found this beauty.

218
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,720
She is a talented songstress.

219
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,390
Her voice weaves and lingers around the place endlessly.

220
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,780
Miss, what is your name?

221
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,380
My Lord, my name is Xiao Zhi.

222
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,640
Xiao Zhi.

223
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,620
Why don't you sing to this young man with your great voice?

224
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,270
He just came to the capital.

225
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,270
You must make him like this place.

226
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,860
Understood.

227
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,200
 ♫ The red dragonfly ♫ 

228
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,650
 ♫ Flies above the green willow branches ♫ 

229
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,550
 ♫ The spider spots it ♫ 

230
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,640
 ♫ And spins a web ♫ 

231
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:32,640
 ♫ And gaze at it with infatuation ♫ 

232
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,030
You called me here but ignore me.

233
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,000
What a party pooper. My friends are waiting for me.

234
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
Did you lose again today, Second Young Master?

235
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,640
I don't know why, but I keep losing at Zhen Tower.

236
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,790
Don't blame Zhen Tower for your poor card skills.

237
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,200
Others might think we're defrauding you if this leaks out.

238
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,300
Second Young Master, shouldn't you pay your debt?

239
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,590
I knew you were up to no good when you called me.

240
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,150
Come here.

241
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,910
As usual, these are for you.

242
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,880
These items are worth some money

243
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,980
but they can't pay for the debt.

244
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,720
You know our rules.

245
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,030
We only collect the rarest treasures.

246
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,290
Our boss has plenty of gold and silver.

247
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:35,680
However, our boss really loved the agate of Dongxia

248
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,430
that you brought last year.

249
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,160
That was a war trophy my father collected back then.

250
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,750
It's easy to be discovered.

251
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,830
Really?

252
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,180
I can only send the bill to the Marquis Residence then.

253
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,120
Don't.

254
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,930
 ♫ This net reminds you to think less ♫ 

255
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,310
 ♫ Don't spend efforts on your thoughts ♫ 

256
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,130
 ♫ I won't fall for your trick ♫ 

257
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,880
Sounds great! Nice song!

258
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,930
- Excellent. 
 - Wonderful.

259
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,380
Brother Zang Hai, this lady is a very talented songstress.

260
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,550
She is perfect for you.

261
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,640
Accept her as a gift from me today.

262
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,010
From now on, you shall be one of us.

263
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,150
Whenever you take an interest in a lady,

264
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,000
I will gift her to you.

265
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,070
Seems like he has high requirements.

266
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,080
I fear you're not good enough for him.

267
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,200
Young Master, accept me.

268
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,350
I am from a poor family

269
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,690
and owe a lot of debts.

270
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,270
- Let me serve you... 
 - Thank you, Sir Yang.

271
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,960
I fear...

272
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,550
I don't know what virtues I've to receive your kindness.

273
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,380
I've served the Marquis for years.

274
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,640
I know His Lordship

275
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,000
better than anyone else.

276
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,160
Our Lord has a heavy workload.

277
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,910
I've always wanted to find someone to assist our Lord with me.

278
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,350
Unfortunately, no one met my requirements.

279
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,180
I ended up waiting for over a decade.

280
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,590
But you're now here.

281
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:28,350
You are smart, adaptive, insightful,

282
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,210
and highly capable.

283
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,030
I find it very comforting.

284
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,400
I want to promote you to be my deputy.

285
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,590
From now on, we can work together and share the burden for the Marquis.

286
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,400
Sir Yang, thank you for your kindness for the promotion.

287
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,860
All right.

288
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,970
It's not easy to find this beauty.

289
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,640
Take her home as a gift today.

290
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,550
We will form an alliance

291
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,060
without taking an oath like common folks.

292
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,350
Thank you, Sir Yang, for your beautiful gesture

293
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:06,080
but I really dare not accept this generous gift.

294
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,070
Sir Yang just mentioned promoting you, but you're unappreciative.

295
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,640
You should know there are smart people everywhere.

296
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,480
But a truly smart person

297
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,940
knows how to be obedient.

298
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,830
My Lords,

299
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,270
please enlighten me.

300
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:39,020
What will happen if I don't accept this gift?

301
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,410
What do you mean?

302
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,200
Brother, your words are too harsh.

303
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,790
You're looking down on this songstress.

304
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,480
It's fine.

305
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,180
I'm not a petty person.

306
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,880
However, you just joined the Marquis Residence

307
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,140
and I promoted you to be my deputy.

308
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,090
It will inevitably attract envy from others.

309
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,590
I thought of a good solution for you.

310
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,000
Write a letter to the Marquis now.

311
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,650
Tell him you'll spend three years writing his biography

312
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,010
and can't serve him well during this period.

313
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,200
Once your work is done and you return three years later,

314
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,420
I will personally recommend you to the Marquis

315
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,240
to be his favorite person.

316
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,830
By then, even if others are jealous,

317
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,090
there is nothing they can do.

318
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,760
Brother Zang Hai, start writing.

319
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,190
What if I disagree?

320
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,070
I appreciate your kindness, My Lords.

321
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,640
It's just that I'm not skilled in writing.

322
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,210
I can't bear to keep writing for three years nonstop.

323
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,730
The pleasure here today is too much for me.

324
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,960
Don't let me ruin your fun.

325
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,630
I take my leave.

326
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,820
Stop there!

327
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,880
Brat,

328
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,480
don't be disrespectful.

329
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,030
I'm a regular customer here.

330
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,280
Can you be accommodating?

331
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,640
Sir Qu,

332
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,690
don't be furious.

333
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,100
Xiao Zhi, you didn't serve Brother Zang Hai well.

334
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,140
He's leaving.

335
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,270
My Lord.

336
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,620
My Lord, please spare me.

337
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,730
Please spare me.

338
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,940
Tell me how I should punish you.

339
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,640
Young Master, please.

340
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,150
Please don't dump me.

341
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,400
What are you doing?

342
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,440
What are you doing?

343
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,350
What are you doing?

344
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,410
What are you doing?

345
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,790
Stop it!

346
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,190
- Watch closely. 
 - Come here.

347
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,710
Open your mouth.

348
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,420
Stop it!

349
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,000
My Lords,

350
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I am just a country person.

351
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,500
I really don't know how to deal with something like this.

352
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,200
 I apologize for ruining your fun. 

353
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,590
I can't keep you company.

354
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,400
Since you have gifted this lady to me,

355
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,630
I shall take her with me.

356
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,910
Sirs, you're here.

357
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,070
What's going on?

358
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,680
Zhen Tower is not a place for you to wield swords.

359
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,400
Isn't it Miss Xiang?

360
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,530
What brings you here?

361
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,440
I'm here to relay a message.

362
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,250
Second Young Master Zhuang wants to invite you.

363
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,070
Second Young Master is here?

364
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,110
He's here today to settle the accounts.

365
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,350
Go and take a look.

366
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,570
He may have a hard time paying his debt today.

367
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,160
What do you mean?

368
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,790
Does he want us to settle his debt?

369
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,550
I don't know about that.

370
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,190
You all should chat with him in person.

371
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,480
How about this, My Lords?

372
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,960
I will see Young Master alone.

373
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,750
I am accepting this lady.

374
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,630
I'll think carefully about Sir Yang's proposal again.

375
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,400
Why didn't you say so earlier? It would have been fine.

376
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,490
What bad luck.

377
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,670
Ladies, let's go.

378
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,840
Miss Xiao Zhi.

379
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,270
Is there a clinic nearby?

380
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,070
We have a physician here

381
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,240
but it will cost a lot to save her.

382
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,310
Nobody will care even if someone like her dies.

383
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,350
Do you still want to save her?

384
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,010
Of course.

385
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,570
Just get the physician here.

386
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,270
Her throat is severely burned.

387
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,000
It depends on her luck whether she can live.

388
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,390
Physician,

389
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,210
please save her life at all costs.

390
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,960
I will do my best.

391
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,580
Thank you.

392
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,270
I am Zang Hai.

393
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,480
Thank you for your help, Miss Xiang.

394
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,420
Don't mention it.

395
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,350
You previously helped Zhen Tower avoid a disaster.

396
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,150
We are even now.

397
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,230
How did you offend them?

398
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,640
It was a trivial matter.

399
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,310
Really?

400
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,110
Forget it if you don't want to say.

401
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,620
Miss Xiang,

402
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,820
can Miss Xiao Zhi stay here tonight?

403
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm going back to fetch some money.

404
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,310
Don't bother about this.

405
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,010
Zhen Tower will take her in.

406
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,480
Her throat is ruined.

407
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,930
Can she still make a living here?

408
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,590
Don't worry about this.

409
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,900
Zhen Tower will take care of her.

410
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,160
You saved her life.

411
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,570
How can I repay you?

412
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,390
I need a favor from you.

413
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,920
Second Young Master Zhuang.

414
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,480
Your aide is here to pick you up.

415
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,290
It's you.

416
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,750
Young Master,

417
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,160
we are home.

418
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,400
Take it slow.

419
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,350
Come, stand firmly.

420
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,250
Come, take your time to come down.

421
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,330
Watch your step.

422
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,480
Come, support Young Master properly.

423
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,880
Zang Hai!

424
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,160
Take care, Second Young Master.

425
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,000
See you again.

426
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,730
Thankfully, that lady helped you tonight.

427
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,430
But innocent people were implicated.

428
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,590
You now realize what kind of people you are dealing with.

429
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,750
Those beasts have no respect for life

430
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,050
and no limits.

431
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,350
As for you...

432
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,380
you've principles for what you will and will not do.

433
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,790
It won't be easy to take them down.

434
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,140
Yang Zhen was anxious.

435
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,350
This means the Marquis of Pingjin has noticed me.

436
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,580
But it's still not enough.

437
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,520
I must show the Marquis that I'm more useful than Yang Zhen.

438
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,620
You make it sound so easy.

439
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,550
There are many people standing between you and the Marquis.

440
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,350
How can you catch his attention?

441
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,400
Master, I can't meet him

442
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,180
but someone can take me to see him.

443
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:46,270
Are you referring to Zhuang Zhixing?

444
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,350
Although he's not outstanding but he's easier to approach

445
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,510
than Zhuang Zhifu, his older brother.

446
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,880
Let me give it a try

447
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,190
and see if he can help me break the deadlock.

448
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,910
 Take a look. 

449
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,020
 Come and get me. 
   

450
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,040
Greetings, Second Young Master.

451
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,480
What took you so long?

452
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,730
You brought me home last night.

453
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,750
Am I right?

454
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,700
Yes.

455
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,960
So, you're also a customer here.

456
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,310
Why haven't I seen you here?

457
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,920
You are mistaken.

458
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,790
With my meager monthly wage, I dare not come here.

459
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,440
I came last night because Sir Yang invited me

460
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,880
to celebrate his birthday.

461
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,110
What a coincidence.

462
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,350
I don't like owing others.

463
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,480
I invited you here today to relax.

464
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,800
Come and take a bath.

465
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,070
Second Young Master, you're too serious.

466
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,510
I simply did what I had to do.

467
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,710
I dare not share the bath with someone of your status.

468
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,130
Why are you so distant?

469
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,760
Get in here when I tell you to.

470
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,300
It's still better that I serve tea to you.

471
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,710
As you like.

472
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,800
They use hundreds of rare herbs in this bath.

473
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,710
Take a bath and you will feel completely refreshed.

474
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,850
It works better than ten sea cucumbers.

475
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,280
It's your loss.

476
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,220
I am truly ignorant.

477
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,910
I didn't know there was such a place in Zhen Tower.

478
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,070
There are many floors and courts in Zhen Tower.

479
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,590
Only the main hall, gambling house,

480
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,510
and shops are open to the public.

481
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,920
The other places are not open to random customers.

482
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,380
You need a regular customer to take you there

483
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,800
or you must know the boss in person.

484
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,300
Otherwise, you can't enter even if you're rich.

485
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,660
You really know how to enjoy life.

486
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,170
If people like us don't know how to amuse ourselves,

487
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,510
what's the point?

488
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,280
You and your older brother are busy assisting the Marquis.

489
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,660
I didn't expect you would have leisure time for your own life.

490
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,760
I truly admire you.

491
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,800
Thanks to my older brother's protection, I can be carefree.

492
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,060
He also doesn't want me to work so hard.

493
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,960
I merely help my family with some trivial matters.

494
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,510
Of course, the main credit goes to my older brother

495
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:46,420
but my job is very important.

496
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,820
What's so funny?

497
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,730
You and your older brother care about each other.

498
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,760
I really envy you.

499
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,380
But you are living such a carefree life.

500
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,000
Other than being taken care of and protected by your older brother,

501
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,530
it's also because your father loves you.

502
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,150
You're right.

503
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,920
There's no need to talk more about my father.

504
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,110
To be honest,

505
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,400
my father loves me more than my older brother.

506
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,550
Back then, my father carried me on horseback for archery

507
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,280
and patrolled the garrison.

508
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,580
I was the only one he took on his horse.

509
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,360
But I've grown up and have many things to do.

510
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,796
My father has always been busy.

511
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,050
He stopped looking after me.

512
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,740
Although the Marquis doesn't bother you,

513
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,550
but he must be concerned about you.

514
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,610
Second Young Master, why not take the initiative to see him?

515
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,890
You're a clueless outsider.

516
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,760
My father cares about me.

517
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,000
We don't have to meet every day.

518
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,680
You're right.

519
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,880
If you want to see the Marquis more often,

520
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,160
I actually have a solution.

521
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,500
Why do you keep mentioning my father?

522
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,480
What do you want?

523
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,230
I admire your father

524
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,230
but I haven't had a chance to see him after entering the residence.

525
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,380
That's why I was a bit carried away and spoke recklessly.

526
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,590
Please forgive me, Second Young Master.

527
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,130
I knew it.

528
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,280
Everyone in the residence wants to see my father and gain his recognition.

529
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,440
At least, you're honest.

530
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,480
You waste your time seeking fame and wealth.

531
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,530
I really don't understand you people.

532
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,670
You are from a noble family.

533
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,300
Naturally, you don't need to understand people like me.

534
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,110
Do you want to hear my advice?

535
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,620
I'm all ears.

536
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,000
Many aides died in the Marquis Residence

537
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,510
because they were overly smart.

538
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,770
So, I think it's better..

539
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,190
that you're stupid.

540
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,190
Rumor has it that Zhuang Zhixing is without any skills

541
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,110
and disliked by the Marquis.

542
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,070
So, he can't do much but remain

543
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,030
a useless rich young man.

544
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:54,570
It's a huge challenge to work on him.

545
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,230
He is indeed different from when he was young.

546
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,400
He might have been a bit spoiled back then,

547
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,760
but at least, he had the backbone and fighting spirit

548
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,590
of a family of warriors.

549
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,550
It seems those qualities are long gone.

550
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,900
He has become a good-for-nothing,

551
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,550
but I can tell he craves his father's attention.

552
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,490
This is my opportunity.

553
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,590
You better hurry up.

554
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,580
Time doesn't wait for anyone.

555
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,160
Why are you late? It's your patrol shift.

556
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,360
Go now.

557
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,520
All right.

558
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,560
Be careful.

559
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,600
Noble Consort Li's coffin was just removed.

560
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,920
The late emperor might show up out of rage.

561
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,440
What nonsense are you spouting?

562
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,400
You even dared to say that?

563
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,940
Go now.

564
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,230
A ghost!

565
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,710
There's a ghost!

566
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,290
A ghost! There's a ghost!

567
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,110
The late emperor's spirit appeared?

568
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,320
Something's not right about this.

569
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,530
Last night, banging sounds came from the hall

570
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,070
where the late emperor's coffin rests.

571
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,840
Craftsmen entered the back hall from the side door this morning.

572
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,150
The coffin of the late emperor was moved

573
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,330
and blocked the entrance.

574
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,110
The coffin of Imperial Noble Consort Li was just removed

575
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,490
and weird things have happened.

576
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,000
Has the Marquis heard about this?

577
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,190
I haven't had time to inform him.

578
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,740
I rushed here to discuss it with you first.

579
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,580
The opportunity is here.

580
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,370
Sir Yang, are you saying...

581
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,210
we should use this opportunity to get rid of Zang Hai?

582
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:43,290
If he can solve the mystery of the emperor's coffin,

583
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,840
we can honor him by turning him into a burial object.

584
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,630
But if he can't solve the mystery,

585
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,550
we'll charge him with incompetence.

586
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,100
Either way, he dies.

587
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:16,940



588
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,360
