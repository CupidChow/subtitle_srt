1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000



2
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,960
   

3
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,780
   

4
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,800
I heard there was a battle

5
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,970
in the Marquis of Pingjin Mansion last night.

6
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,560
Zhuang Luyin.

7
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,280
Cao Jingxian claimed that you wanted to kill him.

8
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,560
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

9
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,950
If I wanted to kill Eunuch Cao,

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,820
why would I do it in my mansion?

11
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,640
Your Majesty, that's because I was investigating

12
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,310
the corruption allegation of Zhuang Zhifu, the Vice Minister of Works.

13
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,050
Thus, I had to investigate the Marquis Mansion.

14
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,680
To my surprise, the Marquis wanted to silence me.

15
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,840
Everyone present were witnesses.

16
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,410
I hope Your Majesty will be discerning.

17
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,040
Feng Zhang. Lu Gongchang.

18
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,910
- Present. 
 - Present.

19
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,980
Both of you were also there last night.

20
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,260
Tell me about it.

21
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,000
Your Majesty, I was indeed there last night.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,690
I only saw Eunuch Cao bringing his guards and giving a birthday gift to Lord Zhuang.

23
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,180
It was a precious blade.

24
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,710
I had matters to attend to. I left early.

25
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,790
What happened after that was...

26
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,310
You, tell me.

27
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:57,050
Your Majesty, I left with him last night.

28
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:03,090
However, I heard Eunuch Cao's screaming inside the mansion.

29
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,760
I saw him running out with an injured arm.

30
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,690
He also said that Lord Zhuang wanted to take his life.

31
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,000
Zhuang Luyin, what else do you have to say?

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,770
Your Majesty, when my son, Zhifu, was taken away by him,

33
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,180
he was a healthy person.

34
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,580
When he returned, he became a cripple with broken knees.

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,630
What was that for?

36
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,610
The surveillance officers interrogated Zhuang Zhifu according to the law

37
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,530
but he was stubborn and refused to explain everything

38
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,460
Hence, I tortured him.

39
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,430
The Vice Minister of Works, Zhuang Zhifu, admitted

40
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,170
to embezzling 30,000 taels of silver from the treasury.

41
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,260
Lord Zhuang, Eunuch Cao was merely carrying out his duty.

42
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,870
Why did you harm him and even tried to kill him?

43
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,680
Because he tried to frame me for treason.

44
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,330
How could I tolerate that?

45
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,140
I've heard about the tricks used by Eunuch Cao to eliminate his enemies.

46
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,430
I was shocked to witness it yesterday.

47
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,420
When facing such a treacherous official

48
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,240
who is corrupt and frames the good,

49
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,780
do you want me to do nothing and await my death?

50
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,750
One of you is the Grand Master for Glorious Happiness

51
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,240
and the other is the Seal-Holding Eunuch from the Directorate of Ceremonial.

52
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,900
Both of you even had a brawl in the capital.

53
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,510
Are you disrespecting me and the laws of Great Yong?

54
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,680
- Please calm down, Your Majesty. 
 - Please calm down, Your Majesty.

55
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,400
Your Majesty, Zhuang Zhifu admitted

56
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,240
that he handed over all the money he embezzled to Zhuang Luyin to raise an army.

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,800
I was anxious and afraid that he might harm Your Majesty.

58
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,830
Cao Jingxian broke my son's knees

59
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,310
and tortured a third-rank official.

60
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,160
How can a confession extracted from torture be trusted?

61
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,550
I've no intention of committing treason.

62
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,520
Please investigate thoroughly, Your Majesty.

63
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,750
Your Majesty, I think the case hasn't been investigated thoroughly.

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,240
It's hard to determine whether a treacherous official has been caught

65
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,870
or a loyal official is being framed.

66
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,630
Your Majesty, please assign someone else to investigate this.

67
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,482
   

68
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,070
Cao Jingxian, I asked you to lead the Surveillance Office

69
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,240
to keep watch on the officials

70
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,870
and get rid of any treacherous officials for me.

71
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,090
It's not for you to abuse your position

72
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,390
to get rid of your enemies!

73
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,410
I know my mistake.

74
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,160
Zhuang Luyin.

75
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm here.

76
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,430
You are a key official of mine.

77
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,120
You should be someone who stops a fight.

78
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,750
When you face a problem, you should come to me.

79
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,480
How dare you use your mansion guards to act out of personal spite?

80
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,720
If everyone in the capital does this,

81
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,870
how can I sleep in peace every night?

82
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,190
- I was wrong. 
 - I was wrong.

83
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,900
 - Please calm down, Your Majesty. 
 - Please calm down, Your Majesty. 

84
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,530
Both of you are veterans in the imperial court.

85
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,590
I'm sure you know where your priorities lie.

86
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,040
Let me ask you again.

87
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,360
Is Zhuang Zhifu the sole cause of your feud here?

88
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,380
Your Majesty, please investigate thoroughly.

89
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,410
Before this case is investigated thoroughly,

90
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,240
Cao Jingxian will be stripped of his position as head of the Surveillance Office

91
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,360
to serve as a warning.

92
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

93
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,000
Zhuang Luyin, tell me how you should be punished.

94
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,760
Your Majesty,

95
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,270
please dismiss Zhuang Zhifu as the Vice Minister of Works

96
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,260
and demote him to a commoner to punish him.

97
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,480
However, taking into consideration that Zhifu is now a cripple,

98
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,390
please spare his life, Your Majesty.

99
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,830
I'll agree to your request and will no longer pursue this matter.

100
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

101
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,600
I failed to educate my son.

102
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,940
That's why he committed such a grave crime.

103
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,360
I am at fault.

104
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,210
I request to retire from the imperial court.

105
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,970
Please approve my request, Your Majesty.

106
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,050
As you wish.

107
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,700
Foster Father, Zhuang Luyin tendered his resignation.

108
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,900
It seems like he has made a painful sacrifice.

109
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,080
He did it to stop His Majesty from doubting him.

110
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:15,020
He was really bold and nullified our attack.

111
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,750
Has the hostage been found?

112
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,650
We've searched all over the capital.

113
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,360
We also have men keeping a close eye on roads to Dongxia.

114
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,950
However, she vanished without a trace.

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,920
What about her own place?

116
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,980
She wasn't found in Zhen Tower or her mansion.

117
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,650
To prevent any suspicions,

118
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,320
the hostage's mansion even asked a servant to pretend to be the hostage.

119
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,080
Mingxiang Antu, what are you up to?

120
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,950
Send a letter to Dongxia.

121
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,300
Tell them the Gui Seal has appeared and the hostage is missing.

122
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,260
It has been many years. It's time for them to contribute.

123
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,650
Understood.

124
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,811
   

125
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,460
Xiao Hai, Eighth Young Master from Zhen Tower is here.

126
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,080
She means trouble.

127
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,780
What should we do?

128
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,980
Eighth Young Master.

129
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,960
Sorry for visiting suddenly and disturbing you.

130
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,250
You're too polite, Eighth Young Master. Please take a seat inside.

131
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,690
No need.

132
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,170
I came here today to ask you something.

133
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,100
Eighth Young Master, go ahead.

134
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,450
Antu hasn't returned since she left two nights ago.

135
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,650
It has been two days.

136
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,140
I'm worried so I dropped by here.

137
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,530
Do you know where she is?

138
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,240
Miss Xiang is missing?

139
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,100
What's going on?

140
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,260
It was she who appeared that day instead of Miss Xiang.

141
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,270
Lord Zang didn't show up on that day as well.

142
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,630
I was attending a banquet at the Marquis Mansion.

143
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,040
Thus, I couldn't meet Miss Xiang.

144
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,730
I could only send my physician to explain it to her.

145
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,270
I thought Miss Xiang was ill,

146
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,880
but she actually went out that night?

147
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,470
Where did she go?

148
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,520
You don't know where she went?

149
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,360
I really don't.

150
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,740
Two days ago, Eunuch Cao and the Marquis of Pingjin quarreled in the imperial court

151
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
and even fought at the Marquis Mansion.

152
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,830
This incident caused a stir.

153
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,250
I didn't have the time to go to Zhen Tower and apologized to Miss Xiang.

154
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,910
And now, you tell me that she's missing.

155
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,050
I'm worried, too.

156
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,870
Eighth Young Master, if you can think of any other possibilities,

157
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,580
I will help you to look for her.

158
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,840
I won't trouble you.

159
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,430
I think Antu is probably throwing a tantrum.

160
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,240
She does that occasionally.

161
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,740
We will search for her ourselves.

162
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,450
We'll be leaving soon.

163
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,590
I hope so.

164
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,850
Eighth Young Master, please inform me if you've found her.

165
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,840
Shi Lei.

166
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,410
I've dressed her wounds.

167
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,260
However, the people I trust are all men.

168
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,980
It's inconvenient for me to take care of her.

169
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,350
I had no choice but to trouble you, Master.

170
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,340
The wound on her body is serious,

171
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,930
but the wound on her heart probably hurts more.

172
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,820
You are really cruel to a lady.

173
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,150
She is my enemy.

174
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,700
Let me ask you.

175
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,300
Are you going to kill her?

176
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,770
I must avenge my family.

177
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,380
Let me go.

178
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,240
Otherwise...

179
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,700
Otherwise...

180
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,080
She took Guan Feng's secret concoction of muscle relaxant powder.

181
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,600
She has lost strength in her limbs but it won't harm her body.

182
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,800
Zang Hai, I'm not who you're looking for.

183
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,650
This place is so empty.

184
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,170
How can you let a lady live comfortably here?

185
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,850
I'm going to get a few sets of clothes.

186
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,010
Have a nice chat, both of you.

187
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,450
Your thigh is bleeding again.

188
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,690
I'll ask Master to dress it for you.

189
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,170
Zang Hai.

190
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,810
I'll tell you again.

191
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,220
Your enemy isn't me.

192
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,360
I don't know anything about your parents.

193
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,060
You colluded with Cao Jingxian to steal the Gui Seal that night.

194
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,510
Your desire for the Gui Seal

195
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,650
caused my whole family to be annihilated ten years ago.

196
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,740
I returned to the capital in hopes of killing my enemy one day.

197
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,840
I did meet Cao Jingxian,

198
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,000
but it was because of the Gui Seal.

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,670
You keep saying I colluded with him

200
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,790
but don't forget that I helped you to kill his foster son.

201
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,040
If I was working with him, would you still be alive today?

202
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,210
Aren't you keeping me alive just to make a fool out of me?

203
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,170
Yes,

204
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,330
I am extremely foolish.

205
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,100
Before I clarify this,

206
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,090
I've no choice but to keep you here for the time being.

207
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,630
I am a princess of Dongxia.

208
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:49,230
Aren't you afraid your emperor will punish you for treating me like this?

209
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,440
Forgive me, Your Highness.

210
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,060
How about this? Release me

211
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,970
and I will help you to find your enemy.

212
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,500
How's that?

213
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,140
Since you don't believe in anything I say,

214
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,200
just kill me now, Lord Zang.

215
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,900
What do you want?

216
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,530
I know

217
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,510
you're not the mastermind behind the massacre of my family.

218
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,520
However, it's related to Dongxia.

219
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,440
I will find out the truth.

220
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,020
Sure.

221
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,860
Go and investigate.

222
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,100
Find out the truth before you decide to kill or release me.

223
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,560
But if you accuse me wrongly,

224
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,400
I will never spare you.

225
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,144
   

226
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,140
No.

227
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,660
Don't kill me.

228
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,130
Don't kill me.

229
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,350
Mother.

230
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,890
Zhifu is...

231
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,170
Fu'er.

232
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,670
Fu'er.

233
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,860
Fu'er.

234
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,490
I am here.

235
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,680
Don't be afraid.

236
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,720
- Mother. 
 - It's all right.

237
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,140
It's all right.

238
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,650
It hurts.

239
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,660
Don't be afraid. It's all right now.

240
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,450
Don't just stand there.

241
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,570
Call for the physician.

242
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,550
Physician!

243
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,200
Physician!

244
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,540
He Zhi!

245
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,300
He Zhi!

246
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,820
You are so slow!

247
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,030
Sorry, Young Madam.

248
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,000
Where's the physician? Where did he go?

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,340
Didn't I tell him to stand guard outside?

250
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,410
Second Young Master hasn't recovered yet.

251
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,080
The physician is waiting over there.

252
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,440
Who told you to talk back?

253
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,640
Summon him immediately.

254
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,080
Understood.

255
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,400
He is just an illegitimate child,

256
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,920
but everyone wants to fawn on him.

257
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,000
Mother.

258
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,400
Mother.

259
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,200
- Fu'er. 
 - It hurts a lot.

260
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,110
I'm full of hatred.

261
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,690
I'm full of hatred.

262
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,720
I know.

263
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,730
Zhuang Zhixing wants to surpass you.

264
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,530
I won't let him do that.

265
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,280
Mother.

266
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,050
 The Marquis is mighty! 

267
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,870
 Great Yong is invincible! 

268
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,270
 The Marquis is mighty! 

269
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,210
 Great Yong is invincible! 

270
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,590
 The Marquis is mighty! 

271
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,540
 Great Yong is invincible! 

272
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,000
 The Marquis is mighty! 

273
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,530
 Great Yong is invincible! 

274
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,380
Father, were you looking for me?

275
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,070
The Marquis Mansion lost its power after this mess.

276
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,560
I'm also no longer an official...

277
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,920
 and your brother has become a cripple. 

278
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,620
 Other than the title of the Marquis of Pingjin, 

279
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,730
there's nothing much left.

280
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,430
Father, what can I do for this family?

281
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,690
If you want to have a firm foothold in the imperial court,

282
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,900
you must hold real power,

283
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,110
especially in military authority.

284
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:13,810
If I want to start anew with my current condition, it's a foolish dream.

285
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:19,500
You are the only hope of the Zhuang family.

286
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,270
I may be just a squad leader,

287
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,150
but there're still opportunities for me to achieve something.

288
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,280
Tomorrow, I'll make a request to the General of Wuyi to go to the border.

289
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,450
There's no need to go to war.

290
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,260
I still have other solutions.

291
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
Father, are you saying...

292
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,080
Zhixing,

293
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,250
I want you to participate in the imperial martial arts examination.

294
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,790
If you can become a martial arts scholar,

295
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,190
it's more useful than military achievements.

296
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,050
 Martial arts scholar? 

297
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,800
Although I've resumed martial arts training but it's still at basic level.

298
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,400
I fear I'm incompetent to compete with the other practitioners.

299
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,060
You are my son.

300
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,840
You just need to do your best.

301
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,090
Yes, Father.

302
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,880
The Marquis left early in the morning?

303
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,360
Yes. He went to Auspicious Month Tower today.

304
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,910
I heard he also invited a few officials from the Ministry of War.

305
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,340
Ministry of War?

306
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,690
They used to be the Marquis' retainers.

307
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,750
The servant that you sent to inquire has verified them.

308
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,860
These officials are invigilators of the imperial martial arts examination.

309
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,920
It seems like the Marquis is determined

310
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,780
to help Zhuang Zhixing become a martial arts scholar.

311
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,690
He no longer cares about me and my son!

312
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,180
My Lady, calm down. Your health is more important.

313
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,590
The Marquis of Pingjin asked you to join the imperial martial arts examination?

314
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,540
Yes. Do you think I can win?

315
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,940
You are cut out to practice martial arts, but you started too late.

316
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,620
You've only stayed in the military camp for a few months.

317
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,380
Although you've improved rapidly,

318
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,050
those who join the imperial martial arts examination

319
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,260
have had at least ten years of training.

320
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,870
It might be difficult for you to get first place.

321
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,490
But I still want to give it a shot.

322
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,550
My father's trust was once deemed unattainable.

323
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:01,160
But now that I've attained it, I realize it's not stable.

324
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,580
I must have a firm foothold in the imperial court.

325
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,510
The Zhuang family has suffered a great loss now.

326
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,350
If I can become a martial arts scholar,

327
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,460
I can make others see me and the Marquis Mansion in a new light.

328
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,550
It seems you're thinking further ahead than I am these days.

329
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,100
Did the Marquis say anything else?

330
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,760
He only asked me to do my best and didn't say anything else.

331
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,900
There's only half a month until the examination.

332
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,450
I will practice day and night.

333
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,340
The chance might be slim, but I'll seize it.

334
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:35,200
Since you're determined, you should be well-prepared.

335
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,250
You can't change yourself completely within half a month,

336
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,790
but the strategies and skills during a fight can be improved quickly.

337
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,760
I will tell Shi Lei to train you well.

338
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,040
Thank you, sir.

339
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,660
The first round of the examination is discourse on policies.

340
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,320
I'm done with the questions.

341
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,900
   

342
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,240
The second round of the examination is sparring.

343
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,160
Han Cheng versus Shi Cang.

344
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,400
Zheng Minglang versus Zeng Wenxuan.

345
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,170
Ye Xingwang versus Kang Hao.

346
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,670
Long Feihu versus Zhuang Zhixing.

347
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,900
 Great! Great! 

348
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,660
The final winners of the sparring examination

349
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,040
are Zhuang Zhixing and Fang Lei.

350
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,790
These two will compete to become the martial arts scholar

351
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,840
in the final round tomorrow.

352
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,780
The final round is horseback archery.

353
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,500
Whoever first brings back the brocade box hidden in a tree in the forest

354
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,490
will be placed first in the examination.

355
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,530
You followed me?

356
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,260
But let me tell you,

357
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,770
I found this first.

358
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,690
I'm giving this brocade box to you. I don't want it.

359
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,920
You're a coward.

360
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,880
A wise man knows when to cede.

361
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,390
My life is more valuable than being a martial arts scholar.

362
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,540
You are wrong.

363
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,440
Not only do I want your brocade box, but I also want your life.

364
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,560
Trying to become the martial arts scholar

365
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,990
when you're just a mere second young master?

366
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,940
The winner of the final round and examination is Zhuang Zhixing.

367
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,130
   

368
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,310
Marquis, Lord Zang is here.

369
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,000
Marquis.

370
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,880
Congratulations, Marquis.

371
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,920
Second Young Master has placed first in the examination.

372
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,980
He'll be appointed by His Majesty in the palace two days from now.

373
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,900
I'll host a banquet for important guests tomorrow night.

374
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,480
You should be here, too.

375
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,180
I want to show everyone that I have a successor.

376
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,880
Understood.

377
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,630
You may leave.

378
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,810
Marquis.

379
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,250
Is there anything else?

380
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,970
Now that Second Young Master has placed first in the examination,

381
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,110
he will surely become an official.

382
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,840
In the imperial court, a person's identity is most important.

383
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,260
Are you saying...

384
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,490
Second Young Master is an illegitimate child.

385
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,460
When it comes to promotion or a marriage,

386
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,460
he will still be inferior to others.

387
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,630
I'll support him as my legitimate son and establish him as the heir apparent.

388
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,660
It's reasonable as there's a deep father-and-son bond.

389
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,360
You've thought of everything, Marquis.

390
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,570
Tell Zhuang Shan to raise Shen Wan's status as a concurrent main wife,

391
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,190
and record her name in the family tree.

392
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:36,080
Find an auspicious day to relocate her grave back to the ancestral graveyard.

393
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,610
Understood.

394
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,378
   

395
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,780
Madam.

396
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,480
How is it?

397
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,630
Second Young Master is the martial arts scholar.

398
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,690
Fang Lei lost.

399
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,810
The Marquis said he wanted to make him the heir apparent.

400
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,540
Heir apparent?

401
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,580
Heir apparent?

402
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,860
Mother, I also want to be the heir apparent.

403
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,580
I also want to be the heir apparent.

404
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,860
Heir apparent.

405
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,610
Fu'er,

406
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,060
tell me.

407
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,370
What will happen to us in the future?

408
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,340
   

409
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,360
 - Here. 
 - Let me raise a toast to you. 

410
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,130
 - A toast to you. 
 - Sure. 

411
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,930
Congratulations, Marquis.

412
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,280
Congratulations, Second Young Master,

413
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,530
on becoming the martial arts scholar in one attempt.

414
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,590
Lord Huang, that's too much praise.

415
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,610
We still need to wait till tomorrow after His Majesty has appointed him

416
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,530
before he becomes the official martial arts scholar.

417
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,410
I heard His Majesty was very satisfied with the examination.

418
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,180
He even allowed you to watch the ceremony tomorrow.

419
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,320
In my opinion, it won't be long until you are reinstated.

420
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,740
Thank you, Lord Huang, for your nice words.

421
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,570
Please.

422
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,730
Zhixing, quickly offer a toast to everyone.

423
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,650
In the future, you'll need their support in the imperial court.

424
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,510
I am offering a toast to everyone.

425
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:12,900
If you need my help in the future, just ask.

426
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,580
 - Cheers, Second Young Master. 
 - Cheers, Second Young Master. 

427
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,760
Zhuang Shan!

428
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,610
Marquis.

429
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,230
Zhixing.

430
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,610
I wore this armor when I defeated Dongxia back then.

431
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,410
From now on,

432
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,030
I'm handing it over to you.

433
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,810
The Zhuang family is who we are today,

434
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,930
because of our ability in war.

435
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:14,660
Every military achievement was exchanged with fresh blood.

436
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,880
It is the same for every head of the family.

437
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:26,630
From now on, you're the heir apparent of the Marquis Mansion.

438
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,830
Whether it's in the imperial court or the army,

439
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:33,400
don't let the ancestors of the Zhuang family lose their dignity.

440
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,400
Father, I will not let you down...

441
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,020
and will bring glory to the Zhuang family!

442
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,840
 - Congratulations, Heir Apparent. 
 - Congratulations, Heir Apparent. 

443
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,180
Everyone, let's drink.

444
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,020
 - Thank you, Marquis. 
 - Thank you, Marquis. 

445
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:01,370
Zhixing, come to my room at the hour of Hai tonight. 
  (Between 9:00 - 11:00 p.m.) 

446
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,220
I have something to tell you.

447
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,470
All right.

448
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,780
Let's drink.

449
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,070
 - Sure. 
 - Cheers. 

450
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,140
 Cheers. 

451
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,770
I should thank you the most for what I've achieved today.

452
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:28,920
You should thank yourself the most.

453
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,890
Ancestors of the Zhuang family,

454
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,400
I seek your blessing and protection.

455
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,470
Please bless Zhifu for his quick recovery.

456
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,190
Don't let him continue to be clueless and foolish.

457
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:01,390
Everything that's happening out there today should belong to Zhifu.

458
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,710
Even if I did something wrong in the past,

459
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,490
I should be punished instead.

460
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,170
Zhifu is innocent.

461
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,820
He is the legitimate son of the Zhuang family.

462
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,560
If he can recover soon,

463
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,630
he will regain the Marquis' favor.

464
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:31,180
Ancestors, please bless and protect my son.

465
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,160
   

466
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,560
Madam.

467
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,677
   

468
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,590
   

469
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:19,550
Why is this slut's memorial tablet placed here?

470
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,710
Someone!

471
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,180
Someone!

472
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,960
What's going on with this memorial tablet?

473
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,970
This was instructed by the Marquis.

474
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,710
He instructed her name to be added to the family tree.

475
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,820
He said she...

476
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,320
She's the mother of the heir apparent.

477
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,660
She's what?

478
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,880
He said she's the mother of the heir apparent.

479
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,270
The heir apparent is the legitimate son.

480
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,110
Madam.

481
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,790
Madam.

482
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:17,040



483
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,200
 "It's me" - Sun Nan

00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,820
♫  I cleanse the filth of the world  ♫

495
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,540
♫  The night is not dark  ♫

496
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,640
♫  Because  ♫

497
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,320
♫  My heart is burning bright  ♫

498
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,500
♫  I’m the turning clouds  ♫

499
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,120
♫  I’m the falling rain  ♫

500
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,800
♫  The compass of the human soul is unpredictable  ♫

501
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,980
♫  There will always be people who rise and fall  ♫

502
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,500
♫  I am life and death  ♫

503
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,320
♫  I grant and deprive  ♫

504
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,780
♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

505
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,380
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫

506
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,740
♫  I am the sowing season  ♫

507
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,360
♫  I am the autumn harvest  ♫

508
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,820
♫  I am the kingdom  ♫

509
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,580
♫  I’m the commoner  ♫

510
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,860
♫  You’re also me  ♫
