00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,860
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,540
Zhixing grew up near the border.

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,980
Back then,

5
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,210
he used to go on patrols with me.

6
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,770
It's a shame

7
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,330
his mother passed away too soon

8
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,900
to see this happy day.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,620
My Lord.

10
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,210
Could you please tell me

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,770
how many wives you have?

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,050
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,060
Zhixing ranked first in the imperial martial arts examination.

14
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,060
As the Female head of the Marquis's Mansion,

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,610
shouldn't I celebrate with you?

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,170
I am his rightful mother,

17
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,540
not her.

18
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,540
[Late wife Shen Wan's tablet]

19
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,130
Have you lost it?

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,170
Go back to your room.

21
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,870
[Late wife Shen Wan's tablet]

22
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,890
Take her back.

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,890
Go away.

24
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,980
My father was the Minister of Rites.

25
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,410
Meanwhile, Shen Wan's father

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,660
was merely a sixth-rank commandant who held no power.

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,890
And she's dead for years.

28
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,690
How come her tablet

29
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,980
gets to be placed in the Zhuang Clan Ancestral Hall now?

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,980
Your principal wife is me.

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,500
Zhixing is my rightful heir.

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,690
Of course, his mother's tablet can be placed in the Clan Ancestral Hall.

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,820
Who dares to say anything?

34
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,780
He is your rightful heir?

35
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,220
Then what about Zhifu?

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,780
If that woman was your wife,

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,060
then what am I?

38
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,010
Even if Zhuang Zhixing is your rightful heir,

39
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,010
he is considered my son.

40
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,540
I am the rightful female head of this household.

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,980
What kind of female head would make a scene like this?

42
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,450
Take her back.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:30,940
My Lady.

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,410
Please go back, My Lady.

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,980
My Lord.

46
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,010
I know what you're thinking.

47
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,410
You'll be relying on him from now on.

48
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,340
Therefore, he must be the rightful heir.

49
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,890
But Zhifu is suffering and will never recover.

50
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,780
Do you really think the Zhuang family can be brought back to its glory?

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,380
You act like you have a deep affection for Shen Wan.

52
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,100
But didn't you forget

53
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,820
how she died back then?

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,820
Take her away!

55
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,890
Get lost!

56
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,930
My wife lost it.

57
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,370
Please forgive her.

58
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,460
Let me toast to you.

59
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,540
Come on, let's toast to our Lord.

60
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,540
- To the Marquis. - To the Marquis.

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,170
Young Master.

62
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,380
[Late wife Shen Wan's tablet]

63
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,340
Come on.

64
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,660
Let's toast to the Marquis.

65
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,290
Cheers.

66
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,170
That's right.

67
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,100
- To the Marquis. - To the Marquis.

68
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,370
Here's to you.

69
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,580
Take a bite.

70
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,730
My Lady.

71
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,540
Take a bite.

72
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,780
Let me do it.

73
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,100
Come on. Have another one.

74
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,100
Mother.

75
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,580
What happened to your face?

76
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:19,930
Is it sweet?

77
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,120
Open your mouth.

78
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,730
It's okay.

79
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,550
Is it sweet?

80
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,250
- Have another one. - My Lady.

81
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,660
My Lady,

82
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,220
the Marquis said

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,340
that Mr. Zhifu needs to rest without getting disturbed.

84
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,730
We're told

85
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,020
to send Mr. Zhifu

86
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,700
and Young Madam to the ancestral mansion in Yongzhou.

87
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,780
On what ground?

88
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,900
The Marquis said

89
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,580
that Mr. Zhixing will take office soon

90
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,700
and have visitors at home.

91
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,140
It won't be nice for people

92
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,980
to see Mr. Zhifu like this.

93
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,460
You'll get to my son

94
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,540
only over my dead body.

95
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,020
My Lady,

96
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,450
the Marquis

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,220
granted you permission to join them

98
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,280
and take care of Mr. Zhifu.

99
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,780
Get out.

100
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,660
Get out!

101
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,900
Get out.

102
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,490
Get out.

103
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,100
My Lady.

104
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,780
Please start packing.

105
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,730
We'll set off tomorrow morning.

106
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,930
Mother.

107
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,460
What's going on?

108
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,730
Mother.

109
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,140
Go to my room

110
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,660
and get my attire of Imperial Lady

111
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,140
of First Rank.

112
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,350
Mother.

113
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,490
Go get it!

114
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,790
Alright.

115
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,300
Mother.

116
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,220
Zhifu.

117
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,420
Your father

118
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,490
has really abandoned us.

119
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,010
Zhuang Luyin.

120
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,060
I've served you for so many years

121
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,340
but you wouldn't even grant me the basic courtesy in the end.

122
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,250
Alright.

123
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,220
You're really something.

124
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,420
Sir.

125
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,130
Everyone

126
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,850
celebrated for me today.

127
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,710
I've never heard

128
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,530
so many compliments in my life.

129
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,850
Is this the taste of power?

130
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,850
This is what many people pursue

131
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,340
throughout their lives.

132
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,730
Once you have a taste of it,

133
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,610
it's hard to let it go.

134
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,530
As you expected,

135
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,340
my father

136
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,890
called me to his study

137
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,730
and told me everything tonight.

138
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,130
I stood in front of him

139
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,370
and suddenly realized

140
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,420
that much of his hair had turned gray.

141
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,180
He has returned the military command

142
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,460
and even lost his position.

143
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,840
He's no longer that awe-inspiring

144
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,460
Marquis of Pingjin anymore.

145
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,100
He even seemed

146
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,340
a bit shorter than he used to be.

147
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,130
Zang Hai.

148
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,530
When my dad saved you

149
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,180
from that fire,

150
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,250
I was very jealous.

151
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,460
But he had no idea

152
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,650
that you wanted him dead.

153
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,010
You have achieved your goal.

154
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,340
My father has lost.

155
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,130
His hard work is in vain

156
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,130
and he is already an old man.

157
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,370
Can't you let him go?

158
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,220
You feel sorry for your father

159
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,370
and don't want him to die to his enemy?

160
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,890
Then you should know exactly how I feel.

161
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,850
It was just my wishful thinking.

162
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,250
You are too determined

163
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,700
to be wavered.

164
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,980
We have an agreement.

165
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,220
I have obtained the answer you needed.

166
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,420
My father gave me

167
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,530
this bronze fish and told me the truth.

168
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,700
This is what he found on your father.

169
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,700
I'm giving it back to you.

170
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,580
This is my father's deepest secret.

171
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,530
He fought the Dongxia army twice.

172
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,420
He witnessed the power of the Gui Seal

173
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,460
and the invincible ghost soldiers.

174
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,060
But even after he broke the gate to Dongxia,

175
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,650
he didn't find the Gui Seal.

176
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,180
In the sixth year of the Zhenshun era,

177
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,340
the court sent Kuai Duo to build the Fengshan Altar in Dongxia.

178
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,890
My father was concerned

179
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,650
about Dongxia

180
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,420
and asked his secret confidant

181
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,850
Chu Huaiming to keep an eye on it.

182
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,370
Three years later,

183
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,770
my father escorted the hostage back to the capital.

184
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,650
When they were about to arrive,

185
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,460
my father received a secret letter from Chu Huaiming,

186
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,250
saying

187
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,010
that the Fengshan Altar collapsed.

188
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,100
The Fengshan Altar collapsed.

189
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,450
Help!

190
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,460
Help!

191
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,010
Kuai Duo, who should have been crushed,

192
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,180
hurried back to the camp

193
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,650
with a mysterious item.

194
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,240
The Fengshan Altar collapsed.

195
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,060
Help!

196
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,340
Help!

197
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,880
Help!

198
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:25,900
Hurry.

199
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,130
Hurry.

200
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,610
Over here.

201
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,340
- Step aside. - Get help!

202
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,420
Hurry.

203
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,250
Sir, bad news.

204
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,920
Go over there.

205
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,890
Help them!

206
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,820
On the night we returned to the capital,

207
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,100
that is when you kidnapped me,

208
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,530
my father

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,370
went to meet two people.

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,980
They suspected

211
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,610
that Kuai Duo dug up the Gui Seal and wanted to keep it to himself.

212
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,490
Later, they found out that he was coming back in secret

213
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,460
and concluded

214
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,130
that he would leave the capital with his family.

215
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,580
They waited outside the Kuai's Mansion with my father.

216
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,850
Finally,

217
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,850
your father showed up.

218
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,940
You already know who one of them is.

219
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,060
Cao Jingxian.

220
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:41,940
Who is

221
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,300
the other person?

222
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,220
Dongxia lost its treasure

223
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,460
to a total outsider.

224
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,700
They would try to get it back at all costs.

225
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,700
Are you saying

226
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,460
that the other person was from the Dongxia imperial court?

227
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,580
She wasn't just from the Dongxia imperial court.

228
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,850
She represented the Dongxia imperial court.

229
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,650
Queen of Dongxia?

230
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,770
You are truly smart, sir.

231
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,250
Nothing gets past you.

232
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,980
I bet they allied

233
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,820
with the Queen of Dongxia for mutual benefit.

234
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,300
They annihilated the Kuai family

235
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,580
to get the Gui Seal from your father.

236
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,370
Even if she is the Queen of Dongxia,

237
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,420
I won't let her off.

238
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,850
I have come this far

239
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,650
thanks to you, sir.

240
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,370
No matter how you want to take revenge on her,

241
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,060
I will help you.

242
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,100
But let me

243
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,890
make one thing clear.

244
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,980
I've fulfilled the agreement

245
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,100
and told you everything.

246
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,820
You can seek revenge on those two culprits.

247
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,850
But you can't kill my father.

248
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,370
Young Master.

249
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,580
Thank you.

250
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,140
Today,

251
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,460
Zhuang Zhixing was officially made the heir.

252
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,250
The Marquis of Pingjin told him everything.

253
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,980
So who was the third culprit that killed

254
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,380
your family?

255
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,920
Your mother.

256
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,530
No way.

257
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,770
It couldn't have been my mother.

258
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,530
I bet the Marquis of Pingjin was framing her.

259
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,730
Hasn't your mother kept asking you

260
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,010
to look for the Gui Seal here in the past decade?

261
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,620
Your mother told you

262
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,250
to meet Cao Jingxian in private

263
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,730
before the night banquet, right?

264
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,220
My mother told me

265
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,010
that Cao Jingxian was cunning

266
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,620
and we were just pretending to work with him.

267
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,900
Once I find the Gui Seal,

268
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,090
I'll do my best to send it back to Dongxia.

269
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,620
We won't share it with him.

270
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,220
Of course, she won't share it with him.

271
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,220
The Marquis of Pingjin,

272
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,250
Cao Jingxian,

273
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,900
and the Queen of Dongxia

274
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,810
formed a temporary alliance for the Gui Seal,

275
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,800
but they each had their own motive.

276
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,860
It's not like that.

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,580
The Gui Seal is a treasure of Dongxia.

278
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,380
The Queen of Dongxia would do whatever it takes

279
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,330
to find it.

280
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,730
In that case,

281
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,420
why would she hesitate to kill

282
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,010
my entire family?

283
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,770
Nonsense.

284
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,250
I was just sent here

285
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,050
when your family was killed.

286
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,460
My mother was in Dongxia.

287
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,810
She hasn't come yet.

288
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,260
How could she kill your family?

289
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,900
How do you know that she didn't come in secret?

290
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,770
My mother is the Queen of Dongxia.

291
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,620
You think it's easy for her to come

292
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,980
to the capital of the Great Yong?

293
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,150
Zang Hai.

294
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,090
Don't just listen to one side of the story!

295
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,140
♪Lamplight fills the tower, driving away the mist♪

296
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,180
♪I have kissed the frost and embraced the cold...♪

297
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,680
You won't believe anything I say

298
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,700
at this point.

299
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,660
You resent me now.

300
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,360
Don't you?

301
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,900
♪Though the light boat has not passed the mountains♪

302
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:51,540
♪Perhaps it's better to rest because the sky is already dark♪

303
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,820
♪I must hurry before the long road♪

304
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,860
♪To catch that fleeting moonlight from years past♪

305
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,860
♪Each step yesterday rang firm and clear♪

306
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,580
♪Stirring up so many dreams I hold dear to♪

307
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,900
♪Until dawn came♪

308
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,330
Summon Zhuang Zhixing.

309
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,330
I, Zhuang Zhixing, pay my respects to Your Majesty.

310
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,530
Zhuang Zhixing ranked first in the imperial martial arts examination

311
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,620
and became a martial arts scholar.

312
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,050
He shall be conferred the title of Distinctive Martial Artist

313
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,810
and Zhennan Guard Regional Commissioner

314
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,660
of the Zhongzhou Forces.

315
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,460
I prostrate in gratitude to His Majesty.

316
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,570
The Petition Drum?

317
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,730
Who's striking the Petition Drum?

318
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,180
Your Majesty.

319
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,700
It's Lady Jiang, the Imperial Lady of First Rank,

320
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,330
beating the drum outside, asking to see Your Majesty.

321
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,860
Your Majesty.

322
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,290
My wife is not well and has disturbed you.

323
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,140
Please allow me to handle my family business at home.

324
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,620
The Petition Drum has been struck.

325
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,530
So it's no longer your family business,

326
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,810
but a national affair.

327
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,530
I'd like to know

328
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,770
why she

329
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,730
struck the Petition Drum

330
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,810
on such a happy day.

331
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,090
Summon Lady Jiang.

332
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,860
Why did you come?

333
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,380
Go home.

334
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,970
I, Jiang Xiang, pay my respects to Your Majesty.

335
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,220
Lady Jiang.

336
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,980
Do you know what the Petition Drum does?

337
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,570
Yes, I do.

338
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,490
The heir of the Zhuang family

339
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,380
was rewarded for his performance in the exam.

340
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,320
I changed into the formal attire

341
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,130
of the Imperial Lady of First Rank

342
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,250
to beat the Petition Drum

343
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,940
because I have one thing

344
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,490
to report to Your Majesty.

345
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,940
I'm listening.

346
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,870
Your Majesty,

347
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,660
shouldn't the martial arts scholar

348
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,010
of the Great Yong possess both martial prowess

349
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,520
and virtue?

350
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,940
Of course.

351
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,980
What if the "martial arts scholar"

352
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,290
won by foul means,

353
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,240
his title neither justified nor legitimate,

354
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,620
and worse yet, stained by the scandal of bribery?

355
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,730
What then?

356
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,640
I came here today

357
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,810
to press charges against someone.

358
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,220
This person committed fraud

359
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,700
and deceived Your Majesty.

360
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:37,980
He is

361
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,220
the father of the martial arts scholar Zhuang Zhixing.

362
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,220
The Marquis of Pingjin, Zhuang Luyin!

363
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,810
Zhuang Luyin

364
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,420
wanted to make sure his son Zhuang Zhixing

365
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,840
ranked first in the exam.

366
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,530
So he paid off a number of examiners.

367
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,380
Please do me justice.

368
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,010
There is no such thing.

369
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,380
My eldest son

370
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,810
became gravely ill with no hope of recovery

371
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,860
just a few days ago.

372
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,700
My wife was deeply worried and developed hysteria.

373
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,140
That's why she is talking nonsense.

374
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,770
Let me

375
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,290
take her home now.

376
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,330
Let's go.

377
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,860
Let her finish.

378
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,010
Lady Jiang.

379
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,940
Do you have any idea

380
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,570
what crime you have committed

381
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,570
by slandering a great general

382
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,860
of the Great Yong before the entire court,

383
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,530
civil and military officials alike?

384
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,420
I wouldn't have dared

385
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,700
to strike the Petition Drum,

386
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,270
nor accused my husband

387
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,700
before Your Majesty's very eyes,

388
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,940
without irrefutable proof.

389
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,900
I have enough evidence to incriminate Zhuang Luyin.

390
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,530
Your Majesty.

391
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,620
Please take a look.

392
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,420
Feng Zhang, the chief examiner of the exam and Vice Minister of War.

393
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,860
Wang Renliang,

394
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,050
co-examiner and Vice Director of the Ministry of War.

395
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,220
Director Yuan Cong.

396
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,900
They have all been paid off by Zhuang Luyin.

397
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,980
This ledger is the evidence of his bribery.

398
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,530
To help

399
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,700
Zhuang Zhixing rank first in the exam,

400
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,700
Zhuang Luyin spent a fortune

401
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,570
on those examiners.

402
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,050
I bet they still

403
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,090
have the money at home because they haven't had time to spend it.

404
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,180
Please look into it.

405
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,900
Did you three

406
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,140
hear what she said?

407
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,900
Feng Zhang.

408
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,220
Tell me.

409
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,460
Is she telling the truth?

410
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,700
I dared not do anything like this.

411
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,490
What about you two?

412
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,220
Tell the truth

413
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,330
and I will spare your lives.

414
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,090
I was indeed solicited by Zhuang Luyin

415
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,460
and lost my judgment.

416
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,900
That's why I helped him cheat in the exam.

417
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,050
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

418
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,660
Zhuang Luyin.

419
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,420
Do you have anything to say?

420
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,860
Your Majesty.

421
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,940
I don't know

422
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,380
what they're saying.

423
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,530
I disdain to even consider manipulating the imperial exam.

424
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,290
I have guarded the border

425
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,900
for the Great Yong for years

426
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,090
and conquered Dongxia for Your Majesty.

427
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,290
Heaven can testify to my loyalty

428
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,700
to Your Majesty.

429
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,490
I'm asking

430
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,380
what you did in the exam,

431
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,620
not the achievements you've made in the past.

432
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,730
I am He Ziqing, Vice Minister of Rites.

433
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,700
May I report something?

434
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,550
Speak.

435
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,670
Your Majesty.

436
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,330
As the Grand Master for Glorious Happiness,

437
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,010
Zhuang Luyin has been watching his eldest son Zhuang Zhifu

438
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,240
embezzling money from the court over the years.

439
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,730
Is that true?

440
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,810
This is not Zhuang Luyin's only crime.

441
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,320
He let his subordinates

442
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,260
kill the craftsmen at the Late Emperor's Mausoleum.

443
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,330
Everyone in the court was infuriated but dared not say anything.

444
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,930
Your Majesty, please look into it

445
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,570
and do people justice.

446
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,490
Zhuang Luyin.

447
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,140
Do you

448
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,700
confess?

449
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,050
Your Majesty.

450
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,220
I did not kill any innocent people.

451
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,330
I did that

452
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,280
to serve the Great Yong...

453
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,620
The Three Judicial Offices.

454
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,530
Here.

455
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,220
You three must investigate this thoroughly.

456
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,330
As Your Majesty commands.

457
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,810
Zhuang Luyin

458
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,140
shall be imprisoned from this moment

459
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,450
to wait for the court trial

460
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,820
held by the Three Judicial Offices.

461
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,900
Everyone in the Zhuang family will be grounded.

462
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,420
Understood.

463
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,140
[The Great Prison]

464
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,110
My Lord.

465
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,770
It's damp and cold in prison.

466
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,980
Have some liquor to warm up.

467
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,250
You have until the incense burns out.

468
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,180
You'd better hurry.

469
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,010
What's going on out there?

470
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,700
The Three Judicial Offices confirmed

471
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,330
that you bribed the examiners

472
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,530
and deployed confidants in the army

473
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,860
to control the border defense.

474
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,700
What does His Majesty think?

475
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,840
No one knows what His Majesty is thinking.

476
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,380
But

477
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,860
not a single minister pleaded for you in court.

478
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,810
Cao Jingxian has even advised His Majesty to execute you

479
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,250
many times.

480
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,050
That eunuch wants me dead.

481
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,330
In his dreams.

482
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,770
I'm afraid

483
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,090
that His Majesty won't let you off easy this time.

484
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,730
This offense would doom someone insignificant.

485
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,460
But I will walk out of here intact.

486
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,220
For over a century, the Zhuang family

487
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,700
has led armies and guarded the Great Yong.

488
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,140
His Majesty

489
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,290
won't really do anything to me.

490
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,140
As for that eunuch...

491
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,700
Zang Hai.

492
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,460
Go to

493
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,700
Xie Houguang of the Ministry of War

494
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,050
and Huang Shen of the Ministry of Rites.

495
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,940
They know what to do.

496
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,530
I'd like to see

497
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,180
who laughs last.

498
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,730
What are you waiting for?

499
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,730
My Lord.

500
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,700
Do you really believe

501
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,700
you can get out of here alive?

502
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,940
You serve Cao Jingxian now?

503
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,660
Have you ever realized

504
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,770
that Cao Jingxian is not the only one in this world

505
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,180
who wants you dead?

506
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,980
What are you trying to say?

507
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,250
Ten years ago,

508
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,570
you killed the Imperial Astronomer

509
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,220
Kuai Duo and his entire family.

510
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,380
You set a fire

511
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,730
to disguise it as a robbery

512
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,010
to avoid getting caught.

513
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,050
You thought you concealed the truth well.

514
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,380
However,

515
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,940
their son survived.

516
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,180
Kuai Duo's son...

517
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,980
Kuai Duo...

518
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,340
You are Kuai Duo's son.

519
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,820
I have killed

520
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,260
too many insignificant people.

521
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,980
Your father

522
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,820
was just one of those petty worms.

523
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,780
There were so many ways

524
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,820
to get the Gui Seal.

525
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,530
Why did you have to kill my whole family?

526
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,550
Why did you have to implicate

527
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,210
so many innocent people?

528
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,340
People are bound to die.

529
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,420
Does it matter when, where, and to whom

530
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,740
they die?

531
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,780
I see.

532
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,090
This world has always bred men

533
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,530
who treat other people as worms

534
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,650
for their own selfish desires.

535
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,650
But don't you forget

536
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,530
that justice always comes

537
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,010
and karma will catch up with you.

538
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,210
Don't be ridiculous.

539
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,900
I have been fighting wars for so many years

540
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,090
with so many people's blood on my sword.

541
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,090
I never believe in karma.

542
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,520
You pretended to pledge allegiance,

543
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,980
biding your time by my side

544
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,010
to strip me of my allies.

545
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,860
You even set Zhifu up.

546
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,690
You are smart, indeed.

547
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,090
But Zang Hai,

548
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,570
you're too young

549
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,530
and too impatient.

550
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,530
You thought you had won.

551
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,980
Do you really think I will die here?

552
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,050
I will definitely

553
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,210
pass this trial!

554
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,420
Anyone can die,

555
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,380
but not me!

556
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,900
When I get out,

557
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,980
I'll kill you first!

558
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,300
My Lord.

559
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,860
Think about it.

560
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,900
You cling to your pride

561
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,530
and have the Muji Camp under control

562
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,900
although you have stepped down from your position.

563
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,610
His Majesty feels threatened.

564
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,780
He won't personally kill a general

565
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,210
who has a widespread network of disciples and former subordinates.

566
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,530
But what if someone kills you

567
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,340
for him?

568
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,690
Even if it causes turbulence and disrupts the morale of the army,

569
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,900
he only has to get rid of that killer

570
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,610
to appease everyone.

571
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:01,940
Tell me.

572
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,390
What will His Majesty do?

573
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,300
So you're the one who drove a wedge

574
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,340
between Cao Jingxian and me.

575
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,210
I bet you know

576
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,900
that Cao Jingxian is also your enemy.

577
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,210
As long as I tell him

578
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,090
who you really are,

579
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,820
he will surely kill you.

580
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,130
If you can really get out of here alive,

581
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,740
do you think I would reveal my identity to you?

582
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,900
After that battle in the mansion,

583
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,530
you and Cao Jingxian

584
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,780
have turned against each other for the Gui Seal.

585
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,340
You impose a huge threat to him by staying alive.

586
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,690
You're the person he wants to kill

587
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,940
the most.

588
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,420
And he will only

589
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,940
find out who I am when he becomes like you today.

590
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,610
You learned the truth but can't do anything about it.

591
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,900
Zhuang Luyin.

592
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,650
How do you like

593
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,940
being desperate?

594
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,740
I dare you to have a fair fight with me

595
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,570
instead of plotting against me.

596
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,050
Where's your integrity?

597
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,610
My integrity is long lost.

598
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,690
Even since I survived ten years ago,

599
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,690
I've been living in torment.

600
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,860
For me,

601
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,900
no price is too high for revenge.

602
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,740
The ends justify the means.

603
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,170
Besides,

604
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,260
I've found the three culprits who slaughtered my family.

605
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,420
Revenge is the only thing left in my life.

606
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,570
And you

607
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,380
shall head to the afterworld.

608
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,420
You figured it all out?

609
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:58,980
Why do you think

610
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,980
I did my best to support Zhuang Zhixing?

611
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,960
You think I was helping you bring your family back to glory?

612
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,050
You think

613
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,700
you can keep him in the dark

614
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,340
about how his mother died?

615
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,490
Your elder son is rendered useless.

616
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,980
Your younger son listens to everything I say.

617
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,740
I've cut off all your retreats.

618
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,980
Zhuang Luyin.

619
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,980
Cao Jingxian.

620
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,210
Queen of Dongxia.

621
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,420
One by one,

622
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,490
I'm coming after you.

623
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,490
Great job.

624
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,780
Zhuang Zhixing.

625
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,340
What a good son.

626
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,530
Kuai Duo.

627
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,610
If you get to see your son like this,

628
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,420
will you laugh or cry?
