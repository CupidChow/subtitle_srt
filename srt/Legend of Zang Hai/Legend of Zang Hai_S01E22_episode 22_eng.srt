00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,813
   

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,230
Greetings, sir.

5
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,710
I was sent to check on Official Zang.

6
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,870
Where is he?

7
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,070
He's working in the burial ground.

8
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,460
All right.

9
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,120
Looks a bit better than last time.

10
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,490
But still far from finished.

11
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:40,400
Official Zang, why didn't you show up at Eunuch Cao's banquet?

12
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,520
Were you too busy?

13
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,100
Or you didn't think it mattered?

14
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,590
You've misunderstood me, Official Lu.

15
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,430
How would I dare look down on Eunuch Cao's invitation?

16
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,170
It's just that I've been swamped lately and forgot all about it.

17
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,030
No worries. There's another chance.

18
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,800
The next banquet is in five days.

19
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,220
You can join us then.

20
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,080
No need to trouble yourself, Official Lu.

21
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,730
Right now, I only wish to give my all to finish the General's funeral.

22
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,180
Are you really that busy?

23
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,610
Yes.

24
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,750
Originally, I came here to deliver a letter from Eunuch Cao.

25
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,080
It could bring you fortune and save you from disaster.

26
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,310
But clearly, you don't want the favor.

27
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,360
So, this letter is no longer yours to receive.

28
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,150
Every year during the Double Ninth Festival,

29
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,680
the ministers must go and pay respects at the late emperor's tomb.

30
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,260
No matter how great General Fu's contributions,

31
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,490
his tomb can't be built during the late emperor's memorial rites.

32
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,430
So, the funeral must be completed before the festival.

33
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,280
Official Zang, don't take this lightly.

34
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,000
Official Lu, are you giving me a reminder or a warning?

35
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,190
How could I dare warn you?

36
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,160
You're a fifth-rank official, the Director of Imperial Astronomical Bureau!

37
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,630
I'm just reminding you, nothing more.

38
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,850
It's just that the festival is less than a month away.

39
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,390
So, while you still have a little time,

40
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,600
enjoy the rest of your days.

41
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,900
Sir, drop the act, will you?

42
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,360
We're already short-handed,

43
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,920
and now we have to rush the schedule?

44
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,600
Everyone can tell Eunuch Cao is making things difficult on purpose.

45
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,850
Stop pretending to be the nice guy!

46
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,160
And you are?

47
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,360
Forgive him, sir.

48
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,920
He's the overseer of the Astronomical Bureau.

49
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,370
Shi Quan, mind your tongue.

50
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,830
Overseer, huh?

51
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:06,240
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

52
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,730
My apologies.

53
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,900
I didn't realize this craftsman was actually an eighth-rank official!

54
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,000
Mr. Shi, you may not serve at court,

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,480
but at least you hold an official post in the bureau.

56
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,360
May I ask, sir,

57
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,960
what the punishment is for slandering the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director?

58
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,880
Please don't take offense. Shi Quan didn't mean it that way.

59
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,630
But I heard what Official Shi said loud and clear.

60
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,920
Shall I escort him to the Surveillance Office

61
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,370
and let him explain to Eunuch Cao directly?

62
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,830
Who are you trying to scare?

63
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,310
Take me to the Emperor if you've got the guts!

64
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,010
Stop, Lu Ran!

65
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,390
He's an imperial officer, not just a craftsman.

66
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,920
If you dare raise a hand near the late emperor's tomb,

67
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,870
and His Majesty finds out,

68
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,530
the Surveillance Office will be charged with grave disrespect.

69
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,970
No one will be able to save you, then.

70
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,540
Shi Quan, apologize to Official Lu right now!

71
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,680
I spoke out of turn. Please forgive me, sir.

72
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,100
I ask for your understanding, Official Lu.

73
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,920
As for Eunuch Cao, I'll give it serious thought.

74
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,310
All right, then.

75
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,390
For Official Zang's sake, I'll let you off the hook.

76
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,500
Official Zang, there's one more thing I want to ask.

77
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,510
I had a younger brother, Lu Jin.

78
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,590
Do you know how he died?

79
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,150
Take care, Official Zang.

80
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,810
Here, get up.

81
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,390
Are you all right?

82
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,900
I'm fine.

83
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,850
Sir, how can we finish before the Double Ninth Festival?

84
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,780
Even if we never sleep, it's impossible!

85
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,000
 The Marquis of Pingjin is fierce and tough. 

86
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,130
 I've gained his trust by now, 

87
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,390
 but killing him still won't be easy. 

88
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,300
 Maybe I can make him fall into his own trap. 

89
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,950
 His achievements already go unrewarded, 

90
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,710
 which easily invites the Emperor's suspicion. 

91
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,160
 Cao Jingxian is ruthless and cold. 

92
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,770
 He's always held a grudge against me. 

93
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,830
 Now there's a rift between him and the Marquis. 

94
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,950
 If timed right, I can pull him into the game. 

95
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,340
 Let the two of them fight. 

96
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,030
 But man proposes, Heaven disposes. 

97
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,850
 Anything can still go wrong. 

98
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,450
 I need absolute certainty. 

99
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,750
 After all, 

100
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,200
 the third enemy is lurking in the shadows, watching it all. 

101
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,320
 Anyway, I must set the Marquis and Cao Jingxian against each other. 

102
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,100
 Only when both are wounded and chaos ensues, 

103
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,040
 will the third enemy show his hand. 

104
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,330
 And when the eagle strikes, that's when I strike back. 

105
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,889
   

106
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,630
Eldest Young Master, what brings you here in person?

107
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,300
Please, have a seat.

108
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,100
Now that's too formal, Zang Hai.

109
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,120
My father was the one who recommended you as the Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

110
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,440
He even picked out this fancy house for you.

111
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,600
What? Am I not welcome now?

112
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,790
Don't say that, Eldest Young Master.

113
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,650
If you ever need me, just send someone to call,

114
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,130
and I'll come right away.

115
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,870
A few days ago, you asked me for help,

116
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,390
but I didn't come through.

117
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,740
I've felt bad about it ever since.

118
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,910
I haven't slept well for nights.

119
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,510
So, worrying about me has kept you up?

120
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,330
Please, sit.

121
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,120
I came tonight because I heard

122
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,220
Eunuch Cao wants you to finish before the Double Ninth Festival.

123
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,600
That's a tough deadline.

124
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,500
I can still speak on your behalf to Eunuch Cao,

125
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,080
so I figured I'd put in a good word for you,

126
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,510
spare you from losing your post over this.

127
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,270
That's too much trouble for you.

128
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,480
Really, there's no need.

129
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,150
You came from the Marquis's household.

130
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,750
So, in a way, we're family.

131
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,030
If you're in trouble, I can't just stand by, can I?

132
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,510
Exactly, I came from the Marquis's household.

133
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,320
So, I shouldn't drag you into this.

134
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,600
Besides, I'm already in charge of General Fu's tomb construction.

135
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,960
A few kind words won't fix it.

136
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,850
Enough of that.

137
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,360
Let me be straight with you.

138
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,750
Give me the ledger, and I'll handle everything.

139
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,040
The ledger?

140
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,100
That's right. The festival is right around the corner,

141
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,410
and you're rushing the timeline.

142
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,510
Hiring a few more craftsmen won't be enough this time.

143
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,160
Zang Hai?

144
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,030
Since I'm here tonight,

145
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,910
I've already come up with a solution for you.

146
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,720
Just hand me the ledger,

147
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,410
and I guarantee you'll finish on time.

148
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,220
Finish on time?

149
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,060
Eldest Young Master, do you have some kind of magical power?

150
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,390
No need to answer me right away.

151
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,650
Think it over.

152
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,570
I've got nothing else planned tonight.

153
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,020
This courtyard of yours has a nice view.

154
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,050
I'll take a stroll around while I wait.

155
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,843
Wait, Eldest Young Master...

156
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,010
Let's do as you say.

157
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
No need to see me out.

158
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,150
Then it's settled.

159
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,080
Tomorrow, I'll come to the bureau for the ledger.

160
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,440
I'll be waiting, Eldest Young Master.

161
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,900
Xiao Hai!

162
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you really giving him the ledger?

163
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,550
No matter what tricks he has up his sleeve,

164
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,980
the tomb will be completed in the end.

165
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,050
He's got people backing him.

166
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,120
But have you figured out how to answer the Marquis?

167
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,600
My earlier plan was to drag him into this,

168
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,380
so if the Marquis blames anyone,

169
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,450
it would fall on Zhuang Zhifu for meddling.

170
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,630
But I still don't think that's good enough.

171
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,350
So, what's your brilliant idea, "Official Zang"?

172
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,700
Hey, wait!

173
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,530
- Is your leg okay? 
 - You little rascal!

174
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,910
Forget your knack for lying,

175
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,030
your way of keeping us guessing is even better!

176
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,640
   

177
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,390
Xiao Hai!

178
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,820
Those palace craftsmen are back!

179
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,910
And not just them, right?

180
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,480
How did you know?

181
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,130
They brought over another group, over twenty seasoned craftsmen!

182
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,670
- Any more? 
 - Yes!

183
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,930
They're pushing carts piled high with carved bricks,

184
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,610
plus two carts of timber and stone!

185
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,790
- Are you sure? 
 - Absolutely!

186
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,080
Lately, Zhuang Zhifu has been visiting Zang Hai often.

187
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,620
With his help, the Ministry of Works gave Zang Hai a green light.

188
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,270
Looks like Zang Hai will finish by the Double Ninth Festival.

189
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,080
No wonder Zang Hai's been so confident

190
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,020
and refused to join our ranks.

191
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,340
He had a backup plan all along.

192
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,510
That idiot Zhuang Zhifu, how dare he go against you?

193
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,570
Well, as you said, he's an idiot.

194
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:44,600
Maybe, he can't even tell we're giving Zang Hai a hard time.

195
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,630
Father, Zang Hai doesn't know what's good for him.

196
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,630
We tried winning him over twice and failed.

197
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,100
Then, what should we do about that thing we're looking for?

198
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,510
How much do you think Zhuang Luyin knows?

199
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,620
Zhuang Luyin...

200
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,390
Don't act rashly yet.

201
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,150
Let me try one more move.

202
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,020
You mean...

203
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,690
Zhuang Zhifu only cares about profit.

204
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,740
If he's involved, there's bound to be some financial trickery.

205
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,750
And Zhuang Luyin has always despised betrayal.

206
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,530
If Zang Hai dragged Zhuang Zhifu into this to protect himself

207
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,740
and Zhuang Luyin finds out, Zang Hai won't survive!

208
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,070
Find a way to let Zhuang Luyin know what his men have done!

209
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,405
   

210
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:41,706
   

211
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,810
Father, you called for me?

212
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,420
Kneel.

213
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,990
I said kneel!

214
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,200
Father...

215
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,270
Zhuang Zhifu, you've grown bold, huh?

216
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,040
You even dared to pocket the funds for Fu Zhisong's tomb?

217
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,180
Father... I... I didn't...

218
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,330
You still have the nerve to lie to me?

219
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,420
Father... I...

220
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,480
I just swapped some materials, that's all.

221
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,720
I didn't touch anything on the surface.

222
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,920
As long as Zang Hai finishes on time,

223
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,110
no one will ever find out.

224
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,190
What is this, then? Take a look for yourself!

225
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,730
Oh... this...

226
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,390
It's one thing to steal silver, but getting caught is just stupid enough.

227
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,870
You're bad even at being corrupt!

228
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,160
My Lord, my son knows he was wrong.

229
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,440
Please have mercy on him.

230
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,140
You still have the nerve to plead for him?

231
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,250
You spoiled him rotten!

232
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,250
Listen well.

233
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,200
If Zang Hai fails to complete the funeral,

234
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,590
the Ministries of Rites and Revenue will launch a full investigation.

235
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,580
Do you really think switching materials

236
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,750
and fudging the numbers will cover it up?

237
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,700
Then tell me, how did I find out?

238
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,480
Father... Father...

239
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,640
Please, Father... I... I know I was wrong.

240
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,960
I swear I'll never do it again!

241
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,720
But what do we do now?

242
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,430
You have to help me, Father!

243
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,110
It's all because of Zang Hai, Father!

244
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,760
He dragged me into this!

245
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,030
Why don't we throw him under the bus?

246
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,720
Let him take the fall for us?

247
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,140
You took the silver.

248
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,770
What good is it throwing him out now?

249
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,400
My Lord, please calm down.

250
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,160
Don't let this ruin your health.

251
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,250
But you still need to help Zhifu out of this mess.

252
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,880
If you don't want others to take you down,

253
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,960
you'd better start cleaning up your own tracks.

254
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,250
Replace every piece of tampered material,

255
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,170
and return every bit of silver you stole!

256
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,970
Make up for the shortfall from our treasury!

257
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,770
Understood.

258
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,180
You're using this garbage stone on the tomb?

259
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,480
My Lord... How did you even find out?

260
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,400
You dare ask me that?

261
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,520
Where did you learn how to cut corners like this?

262
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,830
My Lord, please forgive me.

263
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,240
I let greed cloud my judgment.

264
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,750
It's all my fault.

265
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,460
I had no idea this would reach your ears.

266
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,230
Zang Hai, you weren't greedy before.

267
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,530
That's because...

268
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,200
I was working in your household back then,

269
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,370
and I didn't dare bring you any trouble.

270
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,570
I know I was wrong. Please punish me!

271
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,280
Get up.

272
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,390
I feel you're lying to me.

273
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,750
You're not stupid.

274
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,590
You know full well the stakes here.

275
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,900
Now tell me, did someone force you to do it?

276
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,060
I don't understand what you mean, My Lord.

277
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,810
I've only ever had you behind me.

278
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,460
This matter really was all my doing.

279
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,670
I'll ask you one last time.

280
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,190
Did someone force you?

281
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,600
Be honest,

282
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,770
and I won't press further.

283
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,520
But if you stay silent and I find out later,

284
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,500
I won't be so forgiving.

285
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,080
I swear...

286
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,510
it was all me.

287
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,590
If this ever gets exposed,

288
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,000
the fault will lie with me alone.

289
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,370
I will never drag your household into this.

290
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,550
Something this small can never drag down my household.

291
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,620
I'll let it slide this time.

292
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,980
But be smarter next time.

293
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,500
I'll remember your kindness, My Lord.

294
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,980
Father.

295
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,820
What brings you back?

296
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,620
I'm off duty today, so I came to pay my respects.

297
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,250
I hunted a leopard recently.

298
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,010
I had the pelt prepared and gave it to the steward.

299
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,410
The weather's getting colder now.

300
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,590
You used to fight in harsh lands,

301
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,830
and it left your legs in poor condition.

302
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,410
I figure a leopard skin may help keep you warm.

303
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,140
That's thoughtful of you.

304
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,250
But I'm not in the mood today.

305
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,940
You may go now.

306
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,790
Yes, Father.

307
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,910
So, you're a squad leader now?

308
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,030
Yes.

309
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:51,380
I earned a merit not long ago, and got promoted.

310
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,110
If I hadn't asked, you wouldn't have said a word.

311
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,910
Just a squad leader,

312
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,520
not much to brag about.

313
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,010
That armor looks good on you.

314
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:21,150
Zhuang Zhifu should be "Zhuang the Corrupt."

315
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,250
Still, I owe him a proper thank-you.

316
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,620
If he hadn't gotten so greedy this time,

317
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,110
I wouldn't have known how to get more hands.

318
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,340
But he never imagined we weren't after the craftsmen.

319
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,100
We were after him, Zhuang Zhifu himself.

320
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,630
He must've pulled strings at the Ministries of Works and Rites.

321
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,030
All the timber and stone were sent over as promised.

322
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,070
Except they were all tampered with.

323
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,960
The Ministry of Revenue allocated a set amount of silver,

324
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,520
but he used inferior goods and inflated the labor count.

325
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,690
And he still managed to balance the books perfectly.

326
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,720
If he used that brain of his properly, maybe he would have been made minister by now.

327
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:16,160
For someone like him to survive this long in court,

328
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,840
he must've had serious protection.

329
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,560
And the one protecting him now has to protect you, too.

330
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,159
   

331
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,410
Minister He Ziqing seeks audience.

332
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,400
Ministry of Rites, what is the matter?

333
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,650
The Double Ninth Festival is approaching.

334
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,110
We're preparing the memorial for the late emperor.

335
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,080
I've heard General Fu's tomb won't be finished until after the festival.

336
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,240
However, in the ten days leading up to the memorial,

337
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,240
construction is considered unlucky. It may disrupt the rites.

338
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,830
I propose burying General Fu ten days before the festival.

339
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:02,480
That way, the memorial stays undisturbed, and the General receives proper honors.

340
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,110
Official He, that's well thought-out.

341
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,060
His Majesty will surely be pleased.

342
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,950
But word has it, the tomb's been progressing very slowly.

343
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,960
Finishing by the festival is already a stretch.

344
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,680
If we move it up ten more days,

345
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,080
it may put the Imperial Astronomical Bureau in a bind.

346
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:31,390
Eunuch Cao, we're already struggling due to a lack of craftsmen.

347
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,560
If we push it ten days earlier, I'm afraid we won't be able to manage.

348
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,210
If Official Zang truly finds it difficult,

349
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,880
then, Ministry of Rites, perhaps consider an alternative plan?

350
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,550
I can't think of any better options, and we risk messing up either side.

351
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,180
Official Zang, this year's the Double Ninth Festival,

352
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,620
His Majesty plans to attend the memorial in person

353
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,380
to honor the late emperor and Empress Dowager.

354
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,540
It's a matter of great importance, not to be taken lightly.

355
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:09,330
Your skills in geomancy and construction are second to none.

356
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:14,770
Since you managed to reach the deadline even with a shortage of workers,

357
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:18,170
we'll assign you more hands this time.

358
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:22,540
Push a little harder, and finishing early should be possible.

359
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,750
It's a win-win for everyone.

360
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,080
Surely, you won't turn down Minister He's goodwill?

361
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,470
All right. I'll go report this to His Majesty.

362
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,730
Wait, Eunuch Cao!

363
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,510
Matters of funerals and memorial rites

364
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,620
have been jointly handled by the Imperial Astronomical Bureau and the Ministry of Rites.

365
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,590
How come now it's all up to Minister He alone?

366
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,650
But since Minister He insists

367
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,930
the construction of the tomb should be avoided during the festival by moving it up ten days,

368
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:02,510
Then, in my opinion, rather than moving it earlier,

369
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:07,930
why not delay it ten days after the memorial?

370
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,630
That way, the late emperor is honored properly,

371
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,530
and we avoid rushing the work and slighting General Fu.

372
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,390
Official He, don't you agree?

373
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,350
Yes.

374
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,340
No, this is wrong.

375
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,510
In the war against the Xi Qiang,

376
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,450
General Fu saved the late emperor and the nation!

377
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,040
Delaying his burial will be denying him peace.

378
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,360
If we rush it just for a ceremonial offering,

379
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,140
that's even more disrespectful!

380
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,340
It will chill the hearts of our soldiers!

381
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,900
General Fu was loyal and patriotic.

382
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,720
To be buried after the emperor's rites is a fitting duty for a subject.

383
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,770
The Marquis of Pingjin is right. General Fu must not be slighted.

384
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,540
There is a proper order in rank and ritual.

385
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,650
The burial should wait till after the festival.

386
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,880
- Agreed. 
 - Agreed.

387
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,290
- I agree. 
 - I agree.

388
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,020
- Agreed. 
 - Agreed.

389
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,930
Since the Marquis of Pingjin has considered all sides,

390
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:43,580
I'll report this to His Majesty and follow your recommendation.

391
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,990
He knows full well that Zang Hai dragged his son down with him,

392
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,140
yet he didn't kill him.

393
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,220
He even defended him in court today, going head-to-head with me.

394
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,000
How protective!

395
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,720
Father, at least now we've confirmed his stance.

396
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,290
Zhuang Luyin likely even used his own silver to cover the shortfall.

397
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,250
For Zang Hai, he really went all in!

398
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,590
What makes Zang Hai so special?

399
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,400
It has to be the Gui Seal.

400
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,680
Zang Hai must be helping him find it.

401
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,580
And I'd bet they probably already have a lead.

402
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,400
That's why he's so protective.

403
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,210
After years of lying low,

404
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,960
Zhuang Luyin suddenly starts making all these moves.

405
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,230
That makes me wonder how far along he really is.

406
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,390
This truly terrifies me.

407
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,830
So, that's the full picture.

408
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,830
The Marquis of Pingjin is surprisingly capable.

409
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,390
Not only did he solve Zang Hai's trouble,

410
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,950
he even bought him ten more days.

411
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,490
Which means General Fu's tomb can now be completed on time.

412
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,300
But the Marquis and Cao Jingxian used to get along just fine.

413
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,510
Why are they suddenly at odds over Zang Hai?

414
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,220
Because Official Zang is clearly capable, and the Marquis sees his worth.

415
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,940
I don't think it's that simple.

416
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,030
It might have something to do with his secret.

417
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,440
He won't tell us.

418
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,590
Maybe he really has his reasons.

419
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,930
Oh, and I don't?

420
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,830
Fine. You've got yours. You're the most miserable.

421
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:37,500
I'm on your side. You've just recovered.

422
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,790
- Miss. 
 - Here, drink your medicine.

423
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,110
- Then will you... 
 - I know.

424
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,590
I'll keep tracking Official Zang's movements for you.

425
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,580
You're truly my bestie!

426
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:02,480
Greetings, Eunuch Cao. What would you have me do, sir?

427
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,910
Zhi Fu,

428
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,410
you're the heir of the Marquis and a Vice Minister of Works.

429
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,110
You're a man with a bright future.

430
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,440
I've always thought highly of you.

431
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,900
But lately, you've really let me down.

432
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,830
Eunuch, I don't understand...

433
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,380
Lu Ran, show Official Zhuang what you've compiled.

434
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,673
   

435
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,433
   

436
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,590
In the tenth year of Zhenshun, you were posted to Lishui County.

437
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,340
You embezzled state funds for the dam construction.

438
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,680
The next year, the dam broke.

439
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,490
Three counties downstream were flooded.

440
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,240
Your maternal grandfather was still in office back then.

441
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,650
He found someone to take the fall for you.

442
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:09,210
In the thirteenth year of Zhenshun, as Salt Official in Jian'an,

443
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,780
you illegally raised salt taxes for personal gain.

444
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:17,140
Your father strong-armed local officials into taking the blame.

445
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,450
To rein you in, your grandfather placed you in the Ministry of Works,

446
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,070
the least profitable department.

447
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,270
But you just couldn't change your ways.

448
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,550
Five years ago, when the You River was diverted,

449
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,920
the funds meant to restore the imperial tomb

450
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,630
all ended up in your pocket, right?

451
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,100
You caused water damage to the tomb.

452
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,580
How could the late emperor rest in peace?

453
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,650
But, Eunuch, some of that money...

454
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,010
was yours, too!

455
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,570
How dare you!

456
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:00,640
These formal charges are all from local officials.

457
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,060
I've kept them sealed until now.

458
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,100
Every time, I covered for you.

459
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,200
You even pulled your petty tricks during General Fu's burial.

460
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,000
Maybe the Emperor can't see it, but you think I can't?

461
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,100
If the Emperor ever investigates this,

462
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,300
tell me, how am I supposed to explain it to His Majesty?

463
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,580
Please calm your anger, Eunuch. Forgive me, Eunuch.

464
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,210
I was foolish in the past.

465
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,070
Please, for the sake of my father, let this one go.

466
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,720
I swear I'll make it up to you.

467
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,160
Good.

468
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,340
Now, tell me, how exactly will you repay me?

469
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,100
Just recently, there have been repairs all over the palace.

470
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,590
You've worked so hard.

471
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,990
You worry for His Majesty, and I worry for you, Eunuch.

472
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,610
How about... I check the accounts

473
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,550
and scrape together some silver to honor you?

474
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:10,340
Even now, you still thinking about skimming?

475
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,510
This time, even your father can't save you.

476
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,600
Enough. Get up.

477
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:27,070
For your little show of loyalty, I'll let it slide.

478
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:32,750
I have a task for you. And only you can handle it.

479
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,440
Word is, Zang Hai is helping your father look for something important.

480
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,980
I want you to find out if he's found it yet.

481
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,070
Eunuch, if you want to know what my father's doing,

482
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,410
why not ask him yourself?

483
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,860
If he finds out I've been snooping behind his back...

484
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,550
I'm not asking you.

485
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,620
You have to look into this for me.

486
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,440
And if you come up empty...

487
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,210
Lu Yan!

488
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,670
This is...

489
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,800
Zhang Ding, the Military Affairs Censor!

490
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,610
- Did he confess? 
 - He confessed to everything.

491
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,410
I was investigating army fund embezzlement for the Emperor.

492
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,450
I didn't expect it to lead to you, Official Zhang.

493
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:35,100
If the amount were smaller, I could've helped you bury it.

494
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:40,940
But you stole a full 80,000 taels of silver!

495
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,280
I've been waiting all this time

496
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,320
for you to come clean on your own.

497
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,340
But you stayed quiet.

498
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,670
So now, I have no choice

499
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,340
but to report it to His Majesty.

500
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,360
And let him decide your fate!

501
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,970
Eunuch Cao, please spare me!

502
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,070
I... I didn't know the rules before!

503
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,570
Eunuch, please let me live!

504
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,950
I'll repay you!

505
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,360
Eunuch, have mercy!

506
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,290
Too late.

507
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,110
Please, have mercy!

508
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,980
Eunuch... No, please!

509
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,860
Spare me!

510
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,610
I'm begging you...

511
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,800
Eunuch... Eunuch... I... I...

512
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,650
Zhifu, then it's settled between us.

513
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,790
You must get this done for me.

514
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,080
Find out the truth.

515
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,110
My dear, eat something.

516
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,840
I'm not in the mood. Take it away.

517
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,760
- Just a bite? 
 - I said no! Take it away!

518
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,690
Get out. Now!

519
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,740
Official Zang.

520
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,190
Oh, Official Zhuang.

521
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,220
What brings you here?

522
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,760
No need to be so formal.

523
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,880
Just call me Zhifu.

524
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,130
So, do you need something from me?

525
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,420
Yes.

526
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,570
Come on. This way, please.

527
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,010
Have a seat.

528
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,820
Zang Hai, in the past, I may have slighted you.

529
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,710
Don't take it to heart.

530
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,960
After all, we're on the same side.

531
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,590
Eldest Young Master, you've always treated me well.

532
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,610
You never once slighted me.

533
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,320
I'm just someone who works for the Marquis.

534
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,000
We're practically family.

535
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,400
Exactly!

536
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,510
We're family!

537
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,550
Then it's settled.

538
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,760
From today on, I'm your sworn elder brother,

539
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,230
and you're my younger brother Zang Hai.

540
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,920
Brother Zang Hai, look.

541
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,740
What do you think of this jade?

542
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,550
It's pure in color, smooth like cream.

543
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,050
What top-quality mutton-fat jade!

544
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,920
Do you like it?

545
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,400
Eldest Young Master...

546
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,260
You've worked tirelessly on General Fu's funeral,

547
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,410
solved such a tough problem for the Ministry

548
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,970
and lifted a burden off my shoulders.

549
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,100
This jade is my gift to you.

550
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,030
Eldest Young Master, I really can't accept it.

551
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,830
- Just take it! 
 - I truly can't.

552
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,680
Come on, Zang Hai. A gentleman deserves fine jade. Just take it!

553
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,320
No, Eldest Young Master...

554
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,800
Fine. Then...

555
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,590
Thanks for your generosity.

556
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,160
You're welcome.

557
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,190
Come, sit.

558
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,750
Back when you were serving in our household, I already admired your talent.

559
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,920
But work kept me too busy to ever really talk with you.

560
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,030
My father once told me to get close to you

561
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,180
and learn from your way of dealing with people.

562
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,740
Now that I've finally wrapped up my duties, I've got time.

563
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,570
I'll be visiting more often to seek your guidance.

564
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:22,630
Of course. If there's ever anything I can help you with,

565
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,960
I'll hold nothing back.

566
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,400
Great!

567
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,550
It's a deal, then.

568
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,580
I'll come by tomorrow.

569
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,240
Excellent tea.

570
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,510
People don't just show up for no reason.

571
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,640
That last matter's over,

572
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,800
and now Zhuang Zhifu's suddenly buttering you up...

573
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,820
Xiao Hai, is he trying to cash in again?

574
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,960
The Marquis just gave him a good scare.

575
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,590
He probably doesn't have the guts to try anything soon.

576
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,120
Right now,

577
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:09,060
the one most eager to get to the bottom of things is Cao Jingxian.

578
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,040
What kind of deal did he offer Zhuang Zhifu...

579
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,960
to get him to betray his father?

580
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,990
Maybe Zhuang Zhifu gave Cao Jingxian too many favors in the past.

581
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,400
My disciple, what are you drawing?

582
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,140
The Gui Seal.

583
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,360
You've seen it?

584
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,400
Of course not.

585
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,360
But neither have Cao Jingxian or Zhuang Zhifu.

586
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,280
Ever since Lu Jin's death,

587
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,570
I've planted a seed of doubt in Cao Jingxian's heart.

588
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:54,110
And now, it's ready to sprout.
