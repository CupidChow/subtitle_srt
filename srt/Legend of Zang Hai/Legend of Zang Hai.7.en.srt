00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,740
Zang Hai, the Emperor has spoken.

4
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,460
Zang Hai, Assistant Supervisor of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

5
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,130
is hereby honored

6
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,020
for reinforcing the royal tomb.

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,820
As he is a man of great talent

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,570
and compatible birth date,

9
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,980
he is authorized to send the Empress Dowager's coffin for burial

10
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,260
and never to leave the tomb

11
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,050
as a token of gratitude to the late Emperor,

12
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,460
Empress Dowager, and the court.

13
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,900
Sir.

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,460
Zang Hai was so young,

15
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,380
so how could he be buried?

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,930
He'll do well

17
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,180
in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

18
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,410
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,660
Sir, please think twice.

20
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,290
Mr. Zang shouldn't be buried.

21
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,690
This is the intention of the leaders.

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,060
It also pains me to say so.

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,260
Nowadays, there are conflicts,

24
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,730
many flooding rivers,

25
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,570
and earthquakes everywhere.

26
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,290
All because the world is not at peace.

27
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,780
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau has had its fortune told.

28
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,690
For the stability of the world

29
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,890
and the peace of life,

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,690
Zang Hai is the right man.

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,010
It's an honor no one else

32
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,690
could ask for.

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,220
Sir.

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,730
Sir.

35
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,380
Sir.

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,170
Aye.

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,940
I volunteer to be buried with the Empress Dowager.

38
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,540
Very good.

39
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,010
Congratulations, Zang Hai.

40
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,130
It's a great honor.

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,780
Mr. Zang.

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,980
Mr. Zang.

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,130
Why do you want

44
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,060
to be buried with us?

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,220
Why did you just say yes?

46
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,980
That's right.

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,780
That's right.

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,100
That's right.

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,540
A man who is too talented

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,450
will become

51
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,340
a thorn in the side

52
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,540
of others

53
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,730
and be scorned by them,

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,260
so they deliberately arranged

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,220
for you to build the tomb,

56
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,690
but it looks as if

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,690
you've already guessed that.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,980
Chu Huaiming's mind

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,010
is not hard to guess,

60
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,780
but I didn't expect this.

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,940
Did you all volunteer to be martyred?

62
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,290
Don't you want to think twice?

63
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,010
If we don't want to,

64
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,820
they'll ask again and again

65
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,170
until you agree.

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,060
In the end,

67
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,060
we still can't escape

68
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,130
being forced to volunteer with our limbs maimed.

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,820
The ethos of the imperial court

70
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,380
has come to such a pass.

71
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,690
The Great Yong Dynasty's founding emperors

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,780
had long ago

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,410
placed a ban on burials,

74
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,020
but that didn't stop some of those

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,250
from doing it forcibly.

76
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,700
Everyone should be loyal,

77
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,900
so who dared to refuse?

78
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,540
Of course, they were all forced

79
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,250
to volunteer.

80
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,660
As for Chu Huaiming,

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,220
he was even more blatant.

82
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,730
He could use it to claim credit

83
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,700
and enrich himself.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,730
Enrich himself?

85
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,170
The court

86
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,340
spends a lot of money

87
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,980
to honor those who will be buried.

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,730
We are all going to die,

89
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,460
so we can

90
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,700
exchange our lives for some money

91
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,460
to help our families and children survive.

92
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,020
The money

93
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,730
will be stolen by Chu Huaiming

94
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,700
and others,

95
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,250
and in the end,

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,140
there won't be much left,

97
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,140
but this money

98
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,580
is still life-saving

99
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,050
for our families.

100
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,220
However, Zang Hai,

101
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,580
you are so young and talented.

102
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,340
Why are you willing to die?

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,930
I'm as miserable

104
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,780
as everyone else.

105
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,250
Heaven and hell are all similar,

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,140
so we'll treat it as a trip to a foreign land.

107
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,140
Come on.

108
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,660
Let's drink.

109
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,220
Let's get drunk today

110
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,540
and

111
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,020
die tomorrow.

112
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,700
Come on.

113
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,980
Come on.

114
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,730
Come on.

115
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,340
Come on.

116
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,050
Come on.

117
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:26,810
Come on.

118
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,730
Fill it up.

119
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,370
Come on.

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,100
Come on.

121
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,610
Come on.

122
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,170
Let's drink.

123
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,020
- Come on. - Let's drink.

124
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:22,900
Come on.

125
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:40,020
[The Late Empress Dowager's Memorial]

126
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,540
The Emperor doesn't come

127
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,900
even when the Empress Dowager is buried?

128
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,340
I heard from a protocol officer

129
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,540
that the Emperor got sick

130
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,490
from grief

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,900
during the keeping vigil,

132
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,100
so he now

133
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,370
only prays for the Empress Dowager

134
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,340
in the palace

135
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,810
and can't come.

136
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,660
You were an officer,

137
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,700
so do you know

138
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,700
these people?

139
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,900
Over there.

140
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,490
The head of civil officers,

141
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,660
Minister of Personnel,

142
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,250
Grand Secretary of Zhongji Hall,

143
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,540
Shi Yiping.

144
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,900
He is prudent,

145
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,100
maybe

146
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,890
the top one of those with integrity.

147
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,460
Next to him

148
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,700
was the Minister of Revenue,

149
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,850
Grand Secretary of Jianji Hall,

150
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,010
Zhao Bingwen.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,490
He was the Deputy Chief Grand Secretary,

152
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,460
prideful and noble.

153
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,130
At the head of the military officers

154
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,490
was Zhuang Luyin of the Marquis of Pingjin,

155
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,980
the Guardian-General of the Nation

156
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,010
and current Grand Master for Glorious Happiness.

157
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,010
Vice Minister of Works, Zhuang Zhifu,

158
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,180
was his son.

159
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,530
Chu Huaiming

160
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,980
is their lackey.

161
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,420
Kneel.

162
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,420
Send the Empress Dowager's casket for burial.

163
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,530
Final step.

164
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,300
Check the paint on the coffin.

165
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,460
Sir.

166
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,730
The Empress Dowager's casket

167
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,530
has the Big Dipper on it.

168
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,940
What does that mean?

169
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,250
The emperor's residence

170
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,700
is called Zichen.

171
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,300
After their deaths,

172
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,700
the emperors wanted to reside on Zichen,

173
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,130
which is guarded by the Big Dipper.

174
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,820
They not only carved this design into their coffins

175
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,340
but also, I believe, placed the Empress Dowager's body

176
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,130
in this position

177
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,130
before burying her.

178
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,650
Do you think

179
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,010
we can live

180
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,420
on the Zichen after we die?

181
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,940
Let's go.

182
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,420
Gentlemen.

183
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,420
I'm here to say goodbye.

184
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,850
Come with me.

185
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,770
Here's some good wine

186
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,130
and food for you.

187
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,530
You should know

188
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,300
they are poisoned.

189
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,130
You won't feel any pain

190
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,490
when you eat them.

191
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,420
After three days,

192
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,180
you will die peacefully.

193
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,940
Just a death.

194
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,490
You don't need to explain so much.

195
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,580
Live out these three days

196
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,460
and go to heaven in peace.

197
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,730
This is Magu Wine from Jianchang Prefecture.

198
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,980
I heard

199
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,730
it's about 300 wen per liang.

200
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,610
Open it.

201
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,460
Good wine is really different.

202
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,610
It smells so good.

203
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,100
Kneel.

204
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,850
Salute.

205
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,890
Straighten up.

206
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,250
The mechanism has been turned on.

207
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,530
Then he'll soon see

208
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,850
the surprise we've prepared for him.

209
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,130
I really want to see what Zang Hai's face

210
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,420
will look like then.

211
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,300
Do you know what this is?

212
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,100
Venison.

213
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,220
Have you ever eaten it?

214
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,300
I used to hunt it,

215
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,580
but in the end,

216
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,940
they were taken by the town's security unit,

217
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,820
so I never ate it.

218
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,980
Paralyzing ourselves

219
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,370
can be a way of life.

220
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,180
An old friend of mine

221
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,610
once told me

222
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,530
that someday,

223
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,940
he was going to put an end

224
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,980
to the system of burial sacrifices,

225
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,220
but he didn't make it,

226
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,300
and neither did I.

227
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,420
Maybe posterity

228
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,490
will do it someday.

229
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,730
If we expect our descendants

230
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,610
to do everything for us,

231
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,850
their lives

232
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,580
will only get worse.

233
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,980
How can we live

234
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,700
in this world with dignity?

235
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,730
The second salute.

236
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,490
Are you thirsty?

237
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,340
Do you need me

238
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,060
to taste it for you?

239
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,580
Good point.

240
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,890
We all die sooner or later,

241
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,300
so we should be well-fed dead people.

242
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,340
Come on.

243
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,650
We can't get out anyway.

244
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,010
I'll drink first.

245
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,770
Let me quench my thirst.

246
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,770
Don't drink.

247
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,460
If you drink,

248
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,180
you can't get out.

249
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,130
What do you mean?

250
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,250
Do you mean

251
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,100
you want to get out?

252
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,820
Don't think about it

253
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,420
or persuade us.

254
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,250
Let's just get drunk.

255
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,220
I have a way out.

256
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,460
A way out?

257
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,490
The third salute.

258
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,530
What's your idea?

259
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,820
Did you secretly dig an escape well?

260
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,700
Don't tell me that.

261
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,850
Secretly digging an escape well in the royal tomb

262
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,850
is a cardinal sin that will get all our families executed.

263
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,730
- Yes. - Yes.

264
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,460
No.

265
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,730
We'll go through the gate.

266
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,770
Through the gate of the tomb.

267
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,940
We're gonna walk out in the open.

268
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,420
You're going

269
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,650
to take us out in the open?

270
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,130
The fourth salute.

271
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,090
Straighten up.

272
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,420
The ceremony won't be over

273
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,570
until the Dragon-Cracking Stone falls,

274
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,940
and the officials are there.

275
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,140
If we go out now,

276
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,660
they'll see us.

277
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,770
That's right.

278
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,010
That's what I want them to see.

279
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,620
We're going to walk out

280
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,010
in plain sight.

281
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,620
How can we?

282
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,730
If we go out in front of all those people,

283
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,290
they'll beat us to death with sticks.

284
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,290
That's right.

285
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,490
And that would involve our families.

286
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,420
If we don't fight,

287
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,940
someone else

288
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,530
will continue to be buried alive.

289
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,140
Your families

290
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,730
might even

291
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,730
be next.

292
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,180
How can we fight?

293
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,140
Just us?

294
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,380
That's right.

295
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,900
What do you got?

296
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,980
If we can make it

297
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,700
to the entrance of the tomb

298
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,940
before the Dragon-Cracking Stone falls,

299
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,290
I'm sure I can

300
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,290
put an end to this burial

301
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,050
and get them to let us out.

302
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,380
Are you sure about that?

303
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,220
I believe you.

304
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,730
Tell us

305
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,290
what to do.

306
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,660
Finish.

307
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,940
Drop the Dragon-Cracking Stone.

308
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,050
This door is not the Dragon-Cracking Stone.

309
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,330
It can be opened.

310
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,730
The mechanism is outside.

311
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,050
True,

312
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,620
but there must be a pull-wire switch

313
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,530
connected to the tomb door.

314
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,900
All we need to do

315
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,700
is find that pull-wire switch

316
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,860
to manipulate the outside mechanism.

317
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,860
I know.

318
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,730
The pull-wire switch that connects to the tomb door mechanism

319
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,730
is up there.

320
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,620
It's this brick.

321
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,530
Guys, come and help.

322
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,090
- Okay. - Okay.

323
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,380
Bring up the stools.

324
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,330
- Okay. - Okay.

325
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,140
Get down.

326
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,090
Chu Huaiming!

327
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,290
He'll think he can survive three days

328
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,140
after the Dragon-Cracking Stone falls.

329
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,730
They have a chance to survive now,

330
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,050
but not three days later.

331
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,050
They can only die then.

332
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,380
But once the mechanism was on...

333
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,860
It's the most painful

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,220
to be killed now.

335
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,980
They've already

336
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,860
set up a trap

337
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,220
for us to die

338
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,900
right here.

339
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,730
Didn't we all volunteer

340
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,530
to be buried?

341
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,090
Why are they still doing this to us?

342
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,570
We have to trigger

343
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,460
the switch

344
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,090
to open the door and get out.

345
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,220
Be careful.

346
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,460
I'll pull it.

347
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,940
Come and help.

348
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:22,770
Let's go.

349
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,250
Let's go.

350
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,940
Be careful.

351
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,220
Let's go.

352
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,090
Come on.

353
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,660
Go.

354
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,770
Go.

355
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,090
Go.

356
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,380
Put the shield up.

357
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,770
What to do?

358
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,250
We're the only ones left.

359
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,090
We can't stop it.

360
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,050
Don't give up.

361
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,090
Try again.

362
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,460
Zang Hai.

363
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,460
Get on my shoulder.

364
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,050
Come up!

365
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,770
Go.

366
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,490
Hold on.

367
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,810
Almost there.

368
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,700
Again.

369
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,010
It's open!

370
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,900
Higher!

371
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,940
Let's go.

372
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,570
Come on.

373
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,460
Get up.

374
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,700
The door is open.

375
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,700
We're going home.

376
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,140
Get up.

377
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,570
We're going home. Get up!

378
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,250
Get up!

379
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,860
Let's go.

380
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,330
Let's go.

381
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,980
Get up.

382
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,090
Get up.

383
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,250
Get up.

384
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,700
We're going home. Get up.

385
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,860
Let's go.

386
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,490
Let's go.

387
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,050
We're going home!

388
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,180
Let's go.

389
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,250
Let's go.

390
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,770
Let's go.

391
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,530
Zang Hai.

392
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,730
Come on.

393
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,090
Come on!

394
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,570
What's going on?

395
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,330
Why did Dragon-Cracking Stone stop?

396
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,860
Come on. I'll hold it.

397
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,860
Get over.

398
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,290
You go first. It's too late.

399
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,140
Now.

400
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,570
My Lord.

401
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,770
What's going on here?

402
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,220
I'm not sure.

403
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:04,980
Go and see.

404
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,290
Yes, sir.

405
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,420
Why isn't it coming down?

406
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,700
I've got it.

407
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,810
Now get out.

408
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,810
Now go.

409
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,290
Leave me alone!

410
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,700
No!

411
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,770
No!

412
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,090
I'm not leaving you!

413
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,530
Go now!

414
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,700
Go now!

415
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,290
I'll get you out of here!

416
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,050
Uncle Ji.

417
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,490
I'm Zhinu.

418
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,660
Uncle Ji. I'm Zhinu.

419
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,460
Uncle Ji.

420
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,180
Zhinu?

421
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,660
You're alive?

422
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,530
I'm incompetent,

423
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,570
so I can't go out with you.

424
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,050
You must live well.

425
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,810
Your father's

426
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,460
spirit in heaven

427
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,900
will bless you.

428
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,250
Uncle...

429
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,090
Uncle Ji.

430
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,380
Uncle Ji.

431
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,940
Uncle Ji!

432
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,700
Sir.

433
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,860
I don't know what's wrong,

434
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,290
but it can't come down,

435
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,220
seeming to be stuck.

436
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,010
Stuck?

437
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,620
Open it and fix it.

438
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,460
It can't be opened.

439
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,770
The mechanism is closed up,

440
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,660
so there's nothing we can do

441
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,700
except blow the gate up.

442
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:41,940
Blow it up?

443
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,860
There's someone.

444
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,490
Sir, someone is there.

445
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:07,860
Come on.

446
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,940
I've been thinking about how to defuse danger.

447
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,290
Don't come close to a sudden disaster.

448
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,050
I'm about to die, but I'm not yet dead.

449
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,050
A lucky star falls from the sky and comes to your aid.

450
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,940
The stick indicates

451
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,380
that there is already a lucky person

452
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,700
who will reveal himself

453
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,010
when he is about to die.

454
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,810
You will know when it happens.

455
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,810
Why would someone come out?

456
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,180
That's right.

457
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,380
Why is there a man?

458
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,900
My Lord.

459
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,140
Zang Hai?

460
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,570
How did you get out?

461
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,460
The Dragon-Cracking Stone stopped falling.

462
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,460
What trick did you pull?

463
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,050
I didn't pull any trick.

464
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,660
I just wasn't fated to die today!

465
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,530
As long as I walk out alive,

466
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,660
it'll fall on its own!

467
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,380
Let's go.

468
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,180
My Lord.

469
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,770
It's all Zang Hai's fault.

470
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,090
He removed

471
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,530
Dowager Noble Consort Li's coffin.

472
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,220
Now, the Dragon-Cracking Stone can't fall

473
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,090
just because the late Emperor is in a rage.

474
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,460
And, the Imperial Astronomical Bureau has done the fortunetelling.

475
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,810
We must have a person

476
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,090
whose Four Pillars of Destiny is Yin buried

477
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,810
to calm the storm.

478
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,700
Now, Zang Hai

479
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,660
is unwilling to be buried

480
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,940
and is walking out in style.

481
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,380
That's...

482
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,660
That's just

483
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,010
a big crime.

484
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,860
Let me venture a guess

485
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,090
that once Zang Hai is dead,

486
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,660
the Dragon-Cracking Stone will fall.

487
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,050
Assistant Supervisor of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

488
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,420
Previously, you were authorized to send the Empress Dowager's coffin

489
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,940
to the tomb because of your loyalty,

490
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,530
but today, why do you go back on your word?

491
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,180
The recent incidents in the cemetery

492
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,290
are all because of you.

493
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,810
Now go back in there.

494
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,900
If you persist,

495
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,570
you will suffer the pain of arrows through your heart.

496
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,330
What's so funny?

497
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,860
It's so funny that Marquis

498
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,010
believed in scumbags

499
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,220
and that officials

500
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,420
were duped by the despicable

501
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,050
into trusting

502
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,050
the Great Yong Dynasty's fortunes

503
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,570
to an insignificant Assistant Supervisor

504
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,620
like me.

505
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,940
If this can appease the spirit of the late Emperor,

506
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,490
I will die a worthy death,

507
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,490
but I feel so sorry for it

508
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,660
that I want to cry

509
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,250
for all the officials present,

510
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,700
as well as for the Vice Minister of Works.

511
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,220
Why do you want

512
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,220
to cry for me?

513
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,050
If I die,

514
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,010
but Dragon-Cracking Stone still can not fall,

515
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,050
what should you do?

516
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,010
If the Dragon-Cracking Stone

517
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,660
doesn't fall after you die,

518
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,570
there are craftsmen who will repair it.

519
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,620
How long will it take

520
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,220
to fix it?

521
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,260
Three months

522
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,900
or a year?

523
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,820
Wouldn't that leave the bodies

524
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,980
of the late Emperor and Empress Dowager

525
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,050
exposed to the wilderness for over a year?

526
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,420
National mourning

527
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,260
stems from a nation's morals and laws.

528
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,610
Morals

529
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,530
are the foundation of a nation,

530
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,860
and the law

531
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,530
is the keystone of a nation.

532
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,210
An act of such great disrespect,

533
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,380
even if my death is of no consequence,

534
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,130
will bring all the officers down for nothing.

535
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,380
My Lord.

536
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,490
Mr. Shi.

537
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,940
It's almost time.

538
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,090
It will be unlucky if it is past

539
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,050
quarter to ten in the morning.

540
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,380
Let me ask you.

541
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,090
What if you come out

542
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,780
and the Dragon-Cracking Stone doesn't fall?

543
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,900
If it doesn't fall,

544
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,260
I'll only live a few seconds

545
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,260
longer,

546
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,380
but what you want

547
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,340
is that the Dragon-Cracking Stone

548
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,820
will fall, isn't it?

549
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,530
Let him out.

550
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,570
Mr. Chu once told me that we need

551
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,130
to appease the spirit of the late emperor

552
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,300
and that we need someone whose Four Pillars of Destiny

553
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,300
match the late Emperor's

554
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,820
to stay in the tomb forever.

555
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,210
That's true,

556
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,170
but it's

557
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,860
not me.

558
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,420
Who is it?

559
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,170
Yang Zhen.

560
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,690
Nonsense.

561
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,010
Previously, Mr. Yang celebrated

562
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,170
his 36th birthday.

563
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,570
I deduced Mr. Yang's Four Pillars of Destiny

564
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,050
from his biography.

565
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,690
Mr. Yang's Four Pillars

566
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,380
are all Yin,

567
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,170
so he is a rare person

568
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,050
with Four Pillars of Yin.

569
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,900
If his life is used

570
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,860
to activate the Feng Shui of the royal tomb,

571
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,530
the Dragon-Cracking Stone will surely fall.

572
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,090
You...

573
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,570
Mr. Chu was present on the day

574
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,090
of his birth feast.

575
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,260
If you don't believe me,

576
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,570
you can ask Mr. Chu.

577
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,980
Chu Huaiming.

578
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,940
Is he telling the truth?

579
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,570
Yes.

580
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,380
Sorry.

581
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:41,940
No.

582
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,940
Yes or no?

583
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,570
Yes.

584
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,740
But...

585
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,170
Sirs. My Lord.

586
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,860
It's almost time.

587
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,010
My Lord.

588
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,170
Don't let it interfere

589
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,340
with this national mourning.

590
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,050
My Lord!

591
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,460
When the time is over,

592
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,170
my death

593
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,380
will be nothing,

594
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,530
but if this affects the officers,

595
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,300
even death will not be enough for me.

596
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,980
My Lord, please make a decision.

597
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,420
You.

598
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:28,940
Go in.

599
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,900
Don't.

600
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,050
He's...

601
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,650
He's deliberately excusing himself.

602
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,170
Please don't believe him.

603
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,690
Don't you see?

604
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,900
He's unafraid of death.

605
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,780
My Lord.

606
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,380
He wants me

607
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,610
to die with him.

608
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,260
Don't worry.

609
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,610
As long as the Dragon-Cracking Stone moves

610
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,980
after you go in,

611
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,170
I'll execute Zang Hai

612
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,690
and get you out,

613
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,650
but if you don't go in,

614
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,460
that means you don't trust me.

615
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,490
I believe you.

616
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,340
Don't fall.

617
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,210
Don't fall.

618
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,740
Don't fall.

619
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,460
It's not moving.

620
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,340
It's not moving.

621
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,300
My Lord.

622
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,340
He's lying.

623
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,650
He's lying.

624
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,260
It's moving.

625
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,210
It's moving.

626
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,740
How could it?

627
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,570
No.

628
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,380
The Dragon-Cracking Stone is falling.

629
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,340
It's really falling.

630
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,460
It's really falling.

631
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:01,610
No.

632
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,420
It's not me, My Lord.

633
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,260
It's Zang Hai's trick.

634
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,340
I don't want to die.

635
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,980
Let me out.

636
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:12,740
My Lord.

637
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,130
My Lord.

638
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,170
You said you'd get me out.

639
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,740
My Lord.

640
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,820
I'm loyal to you.

641
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,260
My Lord.

642
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,860
You can't just watch

643
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,570
Zang Hai frame me

644
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,490
to death, My Lord!

645
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,650
My Lord.

646
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,690
Zhuang Luyin.

647
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,980
Are you going to abandon

648
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,490
all these years of our friendship

649
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,420
for Zang Hai?

650
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,260
How many people

651
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,130
have I framed

652
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,050
and how many dirty deeds have I done for you?

653
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,780
How much can Zang Hai do for you?

654
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,420
Do you remember what happened

655
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,130
in the ninth year of the Zhenshun era?

656
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,860
Could that

657
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,170
have been solved

658
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,610
so neatly without me?

659
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,740
I'm going to tell everyone now

660
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,460
that

661
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,690
