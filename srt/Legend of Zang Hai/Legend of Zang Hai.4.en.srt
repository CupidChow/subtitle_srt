00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,660
Get ready.

4
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,740
One.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,450
Two.

6
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,210
Three!

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,260
My eyes!

8
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,450
My legs!

9
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,650
I can't see!

10
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,690
Nobody move!

11
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,740
I'll think of something!

12
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,010
Sir,

13
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,260
there's no way out for the two of us.

14
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,650
Forget about us.

15
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,900
Just go!

16
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,500
There has to be a way.

17
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,900
Trust me. I'll find a way out!

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,370
Sir...

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,330
Marquis of Pingjin...

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,540
You bastard!

21
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,730
I'll haunt you even after death!

22
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,730
Sir, someone's coming out!

23
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,130
Go!

24
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,060
Report to His Lordship.

25
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,730
Yes, sir!

26
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,850
You!

27
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,940
Get over here!

28
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,250
Zang Hai, a humble commoner,

29
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,540
greets My Lord.

30
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,610
How do you know

31
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,250
how to disarm the traps in the royal tomb?

32
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,020
The tomb's construction

33
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,170
was top secret.

34
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,540
Only the artisans

35
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,730
who built it back then knew the details.

36
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,850
Could it be

37
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,580
you're one of their descendants

38
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,220
and plan to rob the tomb?

39
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,930
My Lord,

40
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,540
I'm confused.

41
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,370
You seek a feng shui master

42
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,930
who can make it out alive from the tomb,

43
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,900
yet you question their credibility.

44
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,980
Do you

45
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,730
not believe in feng shui?

46
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,810
That's enough

47
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,810
of your clever talk!

48
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,810
Speak!

49
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,170
How did you get out?

50
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,340
My Lord,

51
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,170
I only figured out

52
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,780
the Bone-Cutting Wires inside the tomb.

53
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,850
It's a rare mechanism,

54
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,930
so it had to be arranged

55
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,370
in a special pattern.

56
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,540
The tomb passage

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,410
is guarded by the Wing-Chariot Beast.

58
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,100
Naturally, it's based

59
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,290
on the Nine-Star Layout.

60
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,050
So the Bone-Cutting Wires

61
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,050
follow the same logic.

62
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,220
You actually know the Nine-Star Layout?

63
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,660
That's a secret technique used only for royal tombs.

64
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,250
We humble craftsmen

65
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,250
only understand a little.

66
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,460
Of course,

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,410
we're no match for you officials.

68
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,100
I merely made

69
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,780
a wild guess

70
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,850
in a life-or-death moment.

71
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,980
Thanks to divine mercy, I made it out.

72
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,730
Folk knowledge

73
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,100
can't possibly compare

74
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,250
with official doctrine.

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,850
If your jumbled theories

76
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,980
can even brush against

77
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,490
the edges of geomancy,

78
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,410
then consider yourself lucky.

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,900
But...

80
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,900
His Lordship has arrived!

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,460
So you unlocked the tomb traps?

82
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,810
Yes, My Lord.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,540
Step forward.

84
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,900
Zang Hai, a humble commoner, greets Your Lordship.

85
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,900
Then tell me,

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,660
do you have a way

87
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,540
to handle the Empress Dowager's burial?

88
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,250
Yes.

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,460
My Lord.

90
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,540
This man's background is unclear.

91
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,930
Letting him handle it

92
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,290
could be risky.

93
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,050
If he made it out of the tomb,

94
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,660
he must have some skill.

95
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,730
Let's hear your solution.

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,850
Your Lordship,

97
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,340
as for the Empress Dowager's burial,

98
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,340
it can be resolved

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,020
after a heavy rain.

100
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,140
Why after rain, specifically?

101
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,490
Thunder above, water below.

102
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,140
It forms the Hexagram of Release.

103
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,100
It symbolizes easing danger and tension.

104
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,780
When thunder and rain gather energy,

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,170
any stalemate

106
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,700
will naturally break.

107
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,610
Will it rain today?

108
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,580
This place is ringed by mountains,

109
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,930
shaped like a screen.

110
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,660
And it's early summer.

111
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,140
Warm southern air is moving in.

112
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,290
Today,

113
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,660
I noticed moist foliage.

114
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,850
Warm air rising, and cool air sinking,

115
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,290
clouds and rain will surge

116
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,290
like thousands of horses.

117
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,370
Is he right?

118
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,660
It is indeed humid today,

119
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,700
but there's no sign of energy convergence.

120
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,050
By our calculations,

121
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,900
rain today

122
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,220
is a fifty-fifty chance.

123
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,410
But before the Shen hour,

124
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,460
it will rain for sure.

125
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,780
We at the Imperial Astronomical Bureau serve the court.

126
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,610
We must speak with caution.

127
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,050
Not like you back-alley mystics,

128
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,370
twisting half-truths

129
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,170
into absolute certainty.

130
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,290
It's not fifty percent.

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,580
It's one hundred percent.

132
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,850
The rain

133
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,100
will definitely fall today.

134
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:03,850
Go outside the tomb

135
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,410
and summon Eunuch Sun!

136
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,410
Yes, sir!

137
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,370
Eunuch Sun has arrived!

138
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,730
The weather was fine.

139
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,180
But when I got to the gate,

140
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,890
it started pouring.

141
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,650
My Lord,

142
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,420
I heard someone

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,130
disarmed the royal tomb's traps.

144
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,420
They must have a solution.

145
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,530
We were just talking about that.

146
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,580
You were right.

147
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,650
The rain is here.

148
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,980
So, what's your plan

149
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,220
to solve the burial dilemma?

150
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,370
Your Lordship,

151
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,650
this matter

152
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,770
has already been resolved.

153
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,890
It's just that...

154
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,220
I don't dare say it aloud.

155
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,820
Quit stalling. Speak!

156
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,730
On my way here,

157
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,650
I dozed off.

158
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,010
And in that sleep,

159
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,980
Dowager Noble Consort Li appeared to me in a dream.

160
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,370
She said

161
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,180
the love between the late Emperor and Empress Dowager

162
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,530
moved the heavens.

163
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,180
She wished to fulfill

164
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,890
their wish to be buried together.

165
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,060
You country bumpkin,

166
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,730
why would the Dowager appear to you?

167
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,220
In the tomb earlier,

168
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,370
I faced deadly traps.

169
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,340
If not for her protection,

170
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,460
how else could I

171
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,730
have come out unscathed?

172
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,610
Watch your tongue!

173
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,610
Let him speak!

174
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,490
But a joint burial

175
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,220
is a major feng shui matter,

176
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,650
especially in a royal tomb.

177
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,340
If it defies heaven's will,

178
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,770
at best,

179
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,300
the spirits won't rest.

180
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,220
At worst,

181
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,730
it'll shake the dynasty's foundation.

182
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,060
So we must

183
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,610
light ever-burning lamps

184
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,580
across five sites,

185
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,420
east, west, south, north, and center

186
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,700
of the Great Yong territory.

187
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,580
Then royal descendants must guard the lights

188
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,300
for forty-nine days.

189
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,370
Only then can the realm remain stable.

190
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,180
For 300 years,

191
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,460
whenever an emperor or empress passed,

192
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,180
royals were summoned back to the capital.

193
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,300
But the Dowager says

194
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,820
the princes

195
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,370
must not return this time?

196
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,610
They can't return.

197
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,980
To ensure the Great Yong's future,

198
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,940
the sacred lamps

199
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,820
must be lit

200
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,980
by royal hands alone.

201
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,060
Especially Prince of Linzi,

202
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,580
who guards

203
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,980
the Eastern Azure Dragon position.

204
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,530
Whenever an emperor or empress dies,

205
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,490
that star position becomes unstable.

206
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,300
So Prince of Linzi

207
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,700
must personally hold the line.

208
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,580
So you're saying

209
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,610
the Dowager told you all this in a dream?

210
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,100
How do we know

211
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,610
you're not making it all up?

212
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,460
Every word I said is true.

213
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,730
Dowager Noble Consort Li loved her son deeply,

214
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,220
but she also knew the greater good.

215
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,730
She didn't want to burden His Majesty,

216
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,340
so she chose to move aside

217
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,580
and let the Empress Dowager be buried with the late Emperor.

218
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,770
She'll show a sign before noon tomorrow.

219
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,370
My Lord,

220
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,730
why not wait a little longer?

221
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,130
By tomorrow,

222
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,530
all will be clear.

223
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,980
You want me to wait for you?

224
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:21,980
Based on what?

225
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,300
Just your worthless life?

226
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,580
This life of mine

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,730
is nothing.

228
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,370
But if Your Lordship

229
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,820
has no better option,

230
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,100
why not bet

231
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,610
on me?

232
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,100
Eunuch Sun, what do you think?

233
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,420
If the Dowager truly sent a dream,

234
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,650
then I'll return and wait quietly.

235
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,060
If something really happens tomorrow,

236
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,370
I'll report it truthfully to His Majesty

237
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,130
and let him decide.

238
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,060
Thank you, Eunuch Sun.

239
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,300
Do you know who that eunuch is?

240
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,340
My Lord,

241
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,460
he...

242
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,100
he serves His Majesty directly.

243
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,370
That's right.

244
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,370
All the previous feng shui masters

245
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,650
gave their suggestions,

246
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,580
but Eunuch Sun

247
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,940
was never moved.

248
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,770
But this time,

249
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,610
he actually listened your words.

250
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,460
Do you know why?

251
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,940
Maybe His Majesty

252
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,060
already had something in mind.

253
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,460
You're really clever.

254
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,180
But talk is talk.

255
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,340
What matters is the result.

256
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,890
My Lord,

257
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,130
I have one more request.

258
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,530
May I enter the inner hall?

259
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,530
I'd like

260
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,100
to deliver a message to the Dowager.

261
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,130
You think someone like you

262
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,580
can just stroll into the inner hall?

263
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,460
Take him in.

264
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,220
Lord...

265
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,420
No need to say more.

266
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,340
Let's see

267
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,770
if the Dowager

268
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,220
really shows a sign tomorrow.

269
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,420
Follow me.

270
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,010
Qu Jiao, look into his background.

271
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:43,980
Yes, sir.

272
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,940
This is the tomb chamber.

273
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,420
The larger coffin belongs to the late Emperor.

274
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,300
The smaller one

275
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,460
is Dowager Noble Consort Li's.

276
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,770
To be here is a rare honor.

277
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,650
Even if you die tomorrow,

278
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,490
your life wouldn't be wasted.

279
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,250
My Lord, may I ask,

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,130
why is it so damp

281
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,650
in this hall?

282
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,700
What underground place isn't damp?

283
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,890
You clearly don't get out much.

284
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,010
Seen enough?

285
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,610
Please wait a moment, My Lord.

286
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,370
I'd like to bow to the Dowager

287
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,370
and report something.

288
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,420
Zang Hai, humble commoner,

289
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,010
kneels before the Dowager.

290
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,490
Thank you, Your Grace,

291
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,060
for sparing my life in great peril.

292
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,890
You're bowing the wrong way.

293
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,890
If you disturb her peace,

294
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,940
can you bear the consequences?

295
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,460
I've passed on

296
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,490
your wish.

297
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,130
I didn't fail your trust.

298
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,100
That's enough.

299
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,250
Let's go.

300
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,220
Yes, My Lord.

301
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,250
Once the incense burns out,

302
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,250
noon will have passed.

303
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,410
If the Dowager still shows no sign,

304
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,020
you'll be buried with her.

305
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,100
Please rest assured, My Lord.

306
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,730
Dowager Noble Consort Li will show a sign.

307
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,010
My Lord!

308
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,450
The Dowager's coffin just caved forward!

309
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,260
Congratulations to His Majesty and Your Lordship!

310
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,340
Dowager Noble Consort Li

311
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,140
is kind and virtuous.

312
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,580
This is her way of fulfilling

313
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,010
the late Emperor and Empress Dowager's wish!

314
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,450
Thank you, Dowager, for making it happen!

315
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,620
Thank you, Dowager!

316
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,890
- Thank you, Dowager! - Thank you, Dowager!

317
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,450
You've helped me

318
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,290
settle one of His Majesty's concerns.

319
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,980
What reward do you want?

320
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,100
Helping Your Lordship

321
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,380
is my duty as a humble subject.

322
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,660
I dare not ask for a reward.

323
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,820
Since you don't want a reward,

324
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,140
then let me count

325
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,050
your crimes instead.

326
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,770
You do know

327
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,940
tampering with royal burial rites

328
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,580
is a capital offense?

329
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,140
My Lord,

330
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,700
I wouldn't dare!

331
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,210
How about this...

332
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,540
I'll show both kindness and authority:

333
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,420
kill you first,

334
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,210
then reward you

335
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,770
with a fine coffin and silver for burial.

336
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,100
My Lord!

337
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,010
I came here willingly,

338
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,050
not as a prisoner.

339
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,100
But does Your Lordship know

340
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,380
why I insisted on coming?

341
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,140
To show off how clever you are?

342
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,580
But clever men die young.

343
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,860
The brighter they are,

344
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,730
the shorter they live.

345
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,170
I came hoping Your Lordship

346
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,100
would spare me a meal.

347
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,420
I wish to follow Your Lordship

348
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,290
and serve faithfully!

349
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,380
Plenty want to serve me.

350
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,540
Why should I choose you?

351
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,770
Your eldest son

352
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,980
serves in the Ministry of Works and is swamped.

353
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm willing to dedicate my life

354
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,050
to the arts of architecture and geomancy,

355
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,330
to serve Your Lordship and your son

356
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,380
to the bitter end!

357
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,140
My Lord.

358
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,860
Speak.

359
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,100
We've looked into him.

360
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,610
Born in Wenzhou Prefecture.

361
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,290
Orphaned at eight.

362
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,330
Drifted to Qingquan Town in Jiangning.

363
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,540
Apprenticed to a carpenter.

364
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,260
A recent fire

365
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,450
left him homeless.

366
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,050
So he headed north to find work.

367
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,860
Arrived in the capital just a few days ago.

368
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,770
Keep him.

369
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,660
Much obliged, My Lord!

370
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,860
Report to the Marquis's residence without delay.

371
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,610
My Lord,

372
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,580
I have one more request.

373
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,820
The others who came with me

374
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,180
perished in the tomb.

375
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,850
If Your Lordship could offer them

376
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,820
a token of respect,

377
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,450
they would surely

378
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,090
be grateful in the afterlife!

00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,490
Please announce my arrival.

383
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,090
Hold on.

00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,620
You're Zang Hai?

386
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,090
Yes, that's me.

387
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,010
Here are your robes and badge.

388
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,490
Pack your things.

389
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,860
You'll report to the back gate's Scholar Hall tomorrow.

390
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,220
Understood.

391
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,700
[Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion]

392
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,060
[Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion]

393
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,770
My dear disciple!

394
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,090
With just one move,

395
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,700
you helped His Majesty solve a major dilemma.

396
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,620
It was Dowager Noble Consort Li

397
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,940
who willingly showed a sign and shifted her coffin.

398
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,860
That way,

399
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,860
His Majesty won the court's support

400
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,530
without losing the people's favor.

401
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,250
You had the royals light lamps in five directions,

402
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,420
which gave His Majesty an excuse

403
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,420
to keep the princes mourning in their own fiefdoms,

404
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,090
especially Prince of Linzi.

405
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,940
If he returned to the capital for the funeral,

406
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,290
he might've stirred up trouble.

407
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,490
But you've fundamentally eliminated

408
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,220
the risk of rebellion.

409
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,810
Even now, I can't figure out

410
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,090
how just one heavy rain

411
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,980
made the Dowager's coffin

412
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,140
collapse forward like that.

413
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,420
Tell me the trick.

414
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,860
It's not as complicated

415
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,420
as you think.

416
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,980
When I entered the tomb hall,

417
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:32,700
I noticed

418
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,220
severe groundwater seepage.

419
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,660
The Dragon Vein Shaft and the coffin

420
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,490
were already corroded.

421
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,530
And the coffin anchoring stones

422
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,570
weren't properly joined.

423
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,900
If just then,

424
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,860
a wedge of lightning-struck wood

425
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,250
was inserted underneath,

426
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,050
it would unbalance the coffin.

427
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,500
Plus, a heavy rain brought

428
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,770
rising ground moisture.

429
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,900
Under that weight,

430
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,580
the Dowager

431
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,050
showing a sign was only natural.

432
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,180
You really did inherit

433
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,490
Xing Dou's teachings.

434
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,700
What I didn't expect

435
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,620
was how deep corruption runs

436
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,730
in the court.

437
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,050
Even a royal tomb gets shortchanged with shoddy work.

438
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,420
Now that it's exposed,

439
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,660
they might finally fix it properly.

440
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,980
Even the Emperor's tomb gets embezzled.

441
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,530
Don't be fooled

442
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,180
by their bows and cheers before the throne.

443
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,940
They're all scheming

444
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,900
for personal gain.

445
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,420
If my father were still alive,

446
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,860
seeing today's

447
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,330
filthy, corrupted Astronomical Bureau,

448
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,700
it would break his heart.

449
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,140
In any case,

450
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,140
you made a brilliant first step.

451
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,900
You really impressed

452
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,180
the Marquis of Pingjin.

453
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,180
What's wrong?

454
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,330
Yesterday, the Marquis

455
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,660
put his hand on my shoulder,

456
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,860
and I couldn't even lift my arm.

457
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,660
Let me massage it for you.

458
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,660
Master, easy!

459
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,900
Come on, bear with it.

460
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,730
Now I finally get

461
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,460
why my benefactor

462
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,330
didn't want me learning martial arts.

463
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,900
For the Marquis

464
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,290
to let me get that close,

465
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,250
he must have absolute confidence

466
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,620
in his skills.

467
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,980
But he chose

468
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,980
to press hard on my shoulder.

469
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,490
It shows

470
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,140
just how cautious and suspicious he is.

471
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,250
He's surrounded by elite guards,

472
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,010
and wears

473
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,140
golden-threaded soft armor.

474
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,180
Even the top fighters in Yong

475
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,860
might not get close to him.

476
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,220
Even if you knew martial arts,

477
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,090
your sword would still be sheathed

478
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,050
before he struck you down.

479
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,810
Relying on brute force

480
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,380
would be the worst plan.

481
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,050
Forget it.

482
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,290
At least I've made it into the Marquis's household.

483
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,620
I'll take my time and think long-term.

484
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,490
Once I'm inside,

485
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,090
I'll study everything carefully

486
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,290
and wait for the right chance.

487
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,180
If you need me, come to the inn.

488
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,810
But stay out of sight.

489
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,730
Master,

490
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,940
when I'm not around,

491
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,290
what do you usually do?

492
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,010
If you weren't my master,

493
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,460
where would you be,

494
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,420
and what would you be doing?

495
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,220
Of course I've got my own life.

496
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,660
If I weren't helping you seek revenge,

497
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,380
I'd be living carefree!

498
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,940
Before I left,

499
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,980
Master Xing Dou told me.

500
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,290
You're the one to ask about my benefactor

501
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,420
and the other three masters.

502
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:28,860
Want to know?

503
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,330
Then this meal is on you.

504
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:31,900
I...

505
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,290
Master,

506
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,460
I'm still young and broke.

507
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,770
Well, I'm old

508
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,770
and still empty-handed.

509
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,700
Isn't that even sadder?

510
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,570
Hand it over.

511
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,420
You...

512
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,490
Fine.

513
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,860
Now can you tell me?

514
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,660
Of course I can.

515
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,220
But not just yet.

516
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,660
Hey!

517
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,730
You tricked me again!

518
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,940
Give my money back!

519
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,250
All's fair in war and strategy.

520
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,860
The older,

521
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,380
the craftier!

522
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:18,660
[Scholar Hall]

523
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,460
You're the new aide?

524
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,090
I'm Zang Hai.

525
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,770
I'm Huijian,

526
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,420
also an aide here.

527
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,770
I got here two years before you.

528
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,770
From now on,

529
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,730
we're colleagues.

530
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:01,900
Want some?

531
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,140
No, thanks.

532
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,730
I heard about you.

533
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,490
Quite impressive.

534
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,140
You made it out

535
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,460
of the royal tomb alive

536
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,330
and even got into our Scholar Hall.

537
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,730
I'll be relying on you, Huijian,

538
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,530
for guidance from here on.

539
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,010
No need to flatter me.

540
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,940
But I'll say this.

541
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,530
In our Scholar Hall,

542
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,620
being too capable

543
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,290
isn't always a good thing.

544
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,220
I won't be able

545
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,090
to look out for you for long.

546
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,570
You do love to joke.

547
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,140
Come on, follow me.

548
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,980
I'll show you how things work here.

549
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,570
That gate you came through

550
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,860
opens at sunrise, closes at night.

551
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,570
It's for the household staff

552
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,570
to go in and out.

553
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,900
The main gate is for the Marquis

554
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,140
and his family.

555
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,090
Other than that,

556
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,660
it only opens for an hour

557
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,420
on special occasions.

558
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,620
As for us aides,

559
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,330
from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.,

560
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,290
we write and record history.

561
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,730
From 1 to 7 p.m.,

562
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,770
we discuss state affairs.

563
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,660
During mealtime,

564
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,250
we eat in the east wing.

565
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,180
And by 9 p.m.,

566
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,290
we must finish evening lessons

567
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,420
before going to bed.

568
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,250
That's the basic routine.

569
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,250
Got it?

570
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,730
Got it.

571
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,570
All these rules

572
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,900
were set by the Marquis's senior secretary,

573
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,770
Mr. Yang.

574
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,860
Other times,

575
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,980
you're free to do

576
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,810
as you wish.

577
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,330
But honestly,

578
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,660
after I'm done

579
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,380
with all that each day,

580
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,290
I'm so tired

581
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,660
I just crash.

582
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,660
You'll be the same.

583
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,620
Mr. Yang

584
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,460
really thought this through.

585
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,980
Come on, I'll show you the study hall.

586
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,490
Much appreciated.

587
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,700
Chu,

588
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,490
a promising young man has joined.

589
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,730
That's a good thing.

590
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,940
Why so uneasy?

591
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,700
I saw this Zang Hai

592
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,010
[Clarity arises]
in the royal tomb.

593
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,770
He's smart and cautious.

594
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,810
Yang,

595
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,730
you mustn't

596
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,050
take him lightly.

597
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,140
You worry too much.

598
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,140
As long as he can ease the Marquis's burdens,

599
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,250
I would

600
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,660
be grateful beyond words.

601
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,980
What's there to worry about?

602
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,090
Neither of us could solve

603
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,250
the Empress Dowager's burial problem.

604
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,420
But this Zang Hai,

605
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,980
who popped up out of nowhere,

606
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,700
handled it.

607
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,010
If I were willing to take that risk,

608
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,900
I could've done it too.

609
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,330
But the outcome

610
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,490
is eight parts risk,

611
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,660
and only two parts gain.

612
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,860
Guys like us don't need to take that gamble.

613
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,180
But he's young.

614
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,770
Taking a gamble

615
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,270
[Pawn]

616
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,140
for future glory

617
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,570
is understandable.

618
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,290
In that case,

619
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,860
he does remind me

620
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,940
of a younger version of you, Mr. Yang.

621
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,220
I think this guy's got ambition.

622
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,180
One day,

623
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,090
he might not be content working under you.

624
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,700
If we really have someone

625
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,730
who can surpass us,

626
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,810
then I, Yang Zhen,

627
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,380
should step down and return home in peace.

628
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,570
But from what I heard,

629
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,380
what he's best at

630
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,860
is feng shui and geomancy.

631
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,620
You're not worried for me,

632
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,460
but for yourself, right?

633
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,380
[General]
Check!

634
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,380
Thanks for letting me win.

635
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,460
I'm not satisfied.

636
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,660
Let's play another round.

637
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,530
Qu,

638
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,940
a new aide just joined.

639
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,620
As the Scholar Hall supervisor,

640
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,700
it'd be rude of me

641
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,090
not to welcome him.

642
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,730
Excuse me.

643
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,420
Alright,

644
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,090
this is the study hall,

645
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,330
where the aides

646
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,140
write and compile texts.

647
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,140
Mr. Yang ordered

648
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,490
that the Marquis's achievements

649
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,050
be documented here.

650
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,220
Every so often,

651
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,010
he selects the best works

652
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,140
to present to the Marquis.

653
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,770
In the future,

654
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,090
you'll do the same as us.

655
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,330
We'll submit all our writings

656
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,770
through Mr. Yang?

657
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,380
Even if the Marquis wants

658
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,420
to discuss matters?

659
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,460
What are you thinking?

660
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,490
You expect him to face

661
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,460
dozens of people

662
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,530
all talking at once?

663
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,620
That'd drive anyone crazy.

664
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,620
Mr. Yang

665
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,900
will organize

666
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,140
the proposals,

667
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,420
then lets the aides

668
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,530
speak their minds.

669
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,900
He has someone record everything,

670
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,330
and submits the best ideas.

671
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,810
However...

672
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,380
none of us will ever know

673
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,530
whichever opinion the Marquis adopts

674
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,620
in the end.

675
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,010
Because they all become

676
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,380
Mr. Yang's ideas.

677
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,700
[Zhuang Clan Chronicle]

678
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,940
Nobles founded kingdoms,

679
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,530
and their heirs inherited them.

680
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,490
Thus, the term "clan of legacy."

681
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,770
So this family record of the Marquis

682
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,220
is titled "Zhuang Clan Chronicle."

683
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,570
Greetings, Mr. Yang.

684
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,730
Huijian,

685
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,140
you may go for now.

686
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,050
Yes, sir.

687
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,460
You're the one

688
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,010
who helped the Marquis

689
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,570
solve the Empress Dowager's

690
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,810
burial issue?

691
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,090
I'm Zang Hai.

692
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,810
Greetings, Mr. Yang.

693
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,700
You really are a talented young man.

694
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,940
For the Marquis's mansion

695
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,810
to have someone like you,

696
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,770
I, Yang Zhen, am truly fortunate.

697
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,900
Huijian must've

698
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,810
already explained

699
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,730
the rules here?

700
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,620
Yes.

701
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,730
The rules here

702
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,090
are even stricter than at the Imperial Academy or Court of Attendants.

703
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,570
But once you're used

704
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,810
to them,

705
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,290
you won't make mistakes

706
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,490
or embarrass the Marquis

707
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,180
when you step into court someday.

708
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,220
So, you mean

709
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,660
we aides even have a chance

710
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,770
to enter the court

711
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,810
and serve in office?

712
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,620
Of course.

713
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,090
The Marquis established the Scholar Hall

714
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,490
to scout talent

715
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,620
and future pillars

716
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,530
for the state.

717
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,420
You think you're just here

718
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,900
to waste time?

719
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,730
But do you scholars

720
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,810
even know

721
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,420
how to deal with the Marquis,

722
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,530
a military man?

723
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,090
One misstep, and it's martial punishment.

724
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,180
Forget about promotion,

725
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,420
you might not even survive.

726
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,290
If I don't protect you,

727
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,140
no one else will.

728
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,330
You're truly thoughtful, Mr. Yang.

729
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,010
You know why I had them

730
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,660
write the "Zhuang Clan Chronicle"?

731
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,530
It's so they can understand

732
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,770
the Marquis better,

733
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,530
understand what pleases him,

734
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,900
so they don't

735
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,140
offend him.

736
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,010
Once the time is right,

737
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,490
I'll personally recommend them

738
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,660
for the Marquis's favor.

739
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,570
I see.

740
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,140
Thank you for the guidance.

741
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,090
With your talent for grand design,

742
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,220
you'll surely make your mark

743
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,490
in the Marquis's household.

744
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,700
Mr. Yang!

745
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,290
The Marquis asked

746
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,140
if a new aide

747
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,620
named Zang Hai

748
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,490
has reported in today.

749
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,660
What does the Marquis want?

750
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,530
He said

751
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,180
he wants him to inspect the inner garden's feng shui.

752
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,570
I see.

753
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,690
Zang Hai is here.

754
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,010
Go at once!

755
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,490
Yes, sir.

756
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:15,900
Oh, right.

757
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,090
I almost forgot

758
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,130
something important.

759
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,900
There was a heavy rain yesterday.

760
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,420
The ancestral hall is leaking.

761
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,980
The Marquis ordered repairs,

762
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,780
but the eaves corbel brackets

763
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,170
are all in old style.

764
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,980
I searched high and low

765
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,980
and couldn't find

766
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,210
