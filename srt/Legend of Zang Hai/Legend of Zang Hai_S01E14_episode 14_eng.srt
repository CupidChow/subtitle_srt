1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:16,900



2
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:29,960
   

3
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,746
   

4
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,150
Our Lady is inside. Mr. Zang, please.

5
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,890
Thank you.

6
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,630
Miss Xiang.

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,180
Miss Xiang!

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,230
 Come on in. I'm in here. 

9
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,030
Miss...

10
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,480
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,380
Are you really that hung up on formalities, Mr. Zang?

12
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,930
I don't mind it. Why are you bothered?

13
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,110
I... I'll wait for you outside.

14
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,590
I bet you rushed here to see me for something urgent.

15
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,580
Let's hear it.

16
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,800
I need your help to kill someone.

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,740
Who is the reckless fool that offended you?

18
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,490
He didn't offend me, but I offended him.

19
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,400
He is the Supervisor of the Surveillance Office.

20
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,470
 Eunuch Cao's foster son, Lu Jin. 

21
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,120
What is your deal with Cao Jingxian?

22
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,870
 I met Eunuch Cao at the ground polo game, and that was it. 

23
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,120
But then he sent Lu Jin to kill me.

24
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,680
I think you're lying.

25
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,470
I'm telling the truth.

26
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,910
 That was the first time I met Eunuch Cao. 

27
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,300
I don't know why he has decided to kill me.

28
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,280
I'd really appreciate it if you can find out the reason.

29
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,530
Well. Cao Jingxian never needs a reason to kill someone.

30
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,680
But why seek my help

31
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,530
when you could have gone to the Marquis of Pingjin for protection?

32
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,310
The Marquis may value me, but he wouldn't offend Eunuch Cao because of me.

33
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,120
I believe you have countless acquaintances out there.

34
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,980
Any one of them can easily save me.

35
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,870
 Lu Jin has killed a lot of innocent people 

36
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,610
and always gives us a hard time.

37
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,910
He deserves to die.

38
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,680
 But don't you know Eunuch Cao? 

39
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,710
Not even the Marquis would risk crossing him.

40
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,000
If he found out that I helped you kill his foster son,

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,290
 we'd be out of business for sure. 

42
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,910
Rest assured, Miss Xiang.

43
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,490
I promise that Eunuch Cao won't suspect you.

44
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,910
Then how will you repay me?

45
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,740
Well...

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,870
I haven't thought about it.

47
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,160
 I don't have much to offer. 

48
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,330
I am loaded with riches.

49
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,310
I don't care about money or treasures.

50
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,470
Then what can I do for you?

51
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,350
Come here. Wash my hair for me.

52
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,390
You want my help but you won't show your sincerity.

53
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,540
In that case, you'd better go home.

54
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,130
You're surprisingly skilled.

55
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,640
I used to do it for my mother as a child.

56
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,000
Here in the capital,

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,680
you can mess with anyone except for Cao Jingxian.

58
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,500
Have you ever seen our storytellers talking about Eunuch Cao?

59
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,590
They've talked a lot about the late emperor and empress.

60
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,850
The officers of the Surveillance Office always pick on us.

61
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,070
If you can kill Cao Jingxian's foster son without getting caught,

62
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,310
that would make my day.

63
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,620
But if Lu Jin dies,

64
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,390
Cao Jingxian may resent you even more.

65
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,870
Rest assured. I've already made plans. It's just...

66
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,690
It's just that I don't know any martial arts to kill him on my own.

67
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,720
All right. If I manage to help you, then you owe me big time.

68
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,160
You can't repay me by simply washing my hair.

69
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,720
Then what else do you want me to do?

70
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,490
I haven't decided. But we accept credit here.

71
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,280
But when I collect my dues, you'd better pay up.

72
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,560
Deal.

73
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,720
But... I also need Lu Jin's letters to imitate his handwriting.

74
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,570
No problem.

75
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,375
   

76
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
Master,

77
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,380
our people lost track of Zang Hai after he left the wonton shop.

78
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,550
But later, our people saw him return

79
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,000
to the Marquis's mansion by carriage

80
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,380
and never came out again.

81
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,300
Useless. Get lost.

82
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,460
Any news from Lu Jin?

83
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,370
Not yet.

84
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,260
No news is the biggest news.

85
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,850
Perhaps something went wrong in Qingquan Town.

86
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,930
Give him one more day.

87
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,310
If we don't hear from him, kill Zang Hai immediately.

88
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,030
Understood.

89
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,954
   

90
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:33,970
   

91
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,452
   

92
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,080
   

93
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,730
 Who is it? 

94
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,860
Harmony between water and fire.

95
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,200
Sunshine over the river.

96
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,380
 Sir, please come in. 

97
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,662
   

98
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,550
This way, please.

99
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,050
Mr. Lu.

100
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,330
Sir, what brings you here?

101
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,200
Sir, you're injured?

102
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,750
Bring the medicine box.

103
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,450
All right.

104
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,270
Send a message to Eunuch Cao right now.

105
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,200
Something is wrong with Zang Hai. Make sure to kill him.

106
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,900
Understood.

107
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,200
- Who are you? 
 - Mr. Lu, save your breath.

108
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,010
Our master wants you dead.

109
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:25,550
Zang Hai. You actually infiltrated this place.

110
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,288
   

111
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,757
   

112
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,595
   

113
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,660
♪  My son. Don't be sad  ♪

114
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:42,730

117
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,530
Wasn't that Mr. Lu?

118
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,810
I think so.

119
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,400
How come he's in Zang Hai's carriage?

120
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,910
- Come on. 
 - Let's keep up.

121
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,130
Why are you silent, Mr. Zang?

122
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,170
Doesn't the corpse scare you?

123
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,930
It does.

124
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,160
You're such a polite gentleman but you're not afraid of corpses.

125
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,520
Why is that?

126
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,640
Compared to the corpse, you are more frightening to me.

127
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,820
I didn't expect you to do it in person.

128
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,270
This is the foolproof approach.

129
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:50,280
No one beats me in the art of disguise.

130
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,240
Impressive, right?

131
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,770
You have no idea how much effort I put into getting this...

132
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,010
We're here.

133
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,510
- All set? 
 - All set. Rest assured.

134
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,590
No one is on duty at the back door tonight.

135
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,180
Let's go.

136
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,030
What do we do now?

137
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,060
Tell Eunuch Cao that Mr. Lu and Zang Hai went into the Marquis's mansion.

138
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,200
My Lord.

139
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,450
It's all right.

140
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,400
What?

141
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,960
Lu Jin went to the Marquis's mansion?

142
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,920
That's right.

143
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,030
Did you see that clearly?

144
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,070
We saw Zang Hai getting into the carriage, and someone was in there.

145
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,880
We both saw him clearly.

146
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,070
It was Mr. Lu in the carriage.

147
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,030
We followed them to the back door of the mansion.

148
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,030
Then Zang Hai led Mr. Lu in.

149
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,930
Lu Jin. Zhuang Luyin.

150
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,760
Keep an eye on them. Find out what they are up to.

151
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,390
Understood.

152
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,660
Disguise may be easy. But I can't easily fake my height.

153
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,310
I will be watching those officers.

154
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,720
Don't come out until you hear my signal.

155
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,100
I'll leave you to work.

156
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,990
Xiao Hai. I'm off.

157
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,310
Take care of Miss Xiang.

158
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,760
I prefer your natural appearance.

159
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,640
What's so funny?

160
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,550
The fact that you're a paper tiger.

161
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,660
You look nothing like a majestic general.

162
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,360
As long as it fools them.

163
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,240
Give me your hand.

164
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,590
Why?

165
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,750
Lu Jin is meeting the Marquis in secret.

166
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,420
We must put on a good show.

167
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,250
Your marriage line is deep and long

168
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,000
and your lineage section is plump and rosy.

169
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,140
You will have plenty of offspring.

170
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,440
I had no idea that you knew palmistry.

171
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,950
You don't believe it? I'm very accurate.

172
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,690
What else do you see?

173
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,650
Your career line is straight without a fork.

174
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,270
I'm sure you will rise to the top in the imperial court.

175
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,160
But you may be put in prison.

176
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,210
So, how can I avoid that?

177
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,000
How about this? I'll show you a clear way out.

178
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,820
Get out of your residence and walk three li east.

179
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,200
Pass three streets up north.

180
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,760
The fifth shop from the west will be your lucky spot.

181
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,710
- The Zhen Tower? 
 - Of course.

182
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,000
If it weren't for me, you'd be in trouble now.

183
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,380
So, visit the Zhen Tower more often.

184
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,690
It keeps you safe.

185
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,350
Do you hear anything?

186
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,610
I don't hear the signal. We must keep the show running.

187
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,240
Why don't we talk about something interesting?

188
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,720
Like what?

189
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,720
You said Cao Jingxian sent Lu Jin to kill you for no reason.

190
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,610
But Lu Jin looked into your background outside the capital

191
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,540
and returned to report to Cao Jingxian.

192
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,150
You rushed to kill Lu Jin before he could see Cao Jingxian.

193
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:43,400
That means you can't let Cao Jingxian find out who you are.

194
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,730
Mr. Zang, what is the secret that you're hiding?

195
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,480
I knew you were hiding something.

196
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,880
If you don't tell me the truth, I'll go out and show my face.

197
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,780
Miss Xiang, please don't.

198
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,520
Show me your sincerity.

199
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:25,520
If we get exposed, we will be arrested and tortured by those officers.

200
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,030
The Surveillance Office is not a place

201
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,330
you can easily get out of.

202
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,580
Is that a threat?

203
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,200
You saved my life.

204
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,270
Even if we end up getting caught,

205
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:43,780
I'll shoulder the responsibility alone without implicating you.

206
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,000
But...

207
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,930
I really can't answer the question you asked me.

208
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:58,680
If I manage to complete my task one day,

209
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,630
you'll be the first to hear the answer.

210
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,830
You just don't want to tell me.

211
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,400
So self-righteous even when you ask for help.

212
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,930
What if the Marquis suddenly returns

213
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,920
or the officers out there see the real Marquis?

214
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,930
What will you do?

215
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,260
Don't you usually entertain yourself at the wine houses?

216
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,530
How come you asked to have a late-night drink with me?

217
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,200
I won the ground polo competition a few days ago

218
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,680
which calls for celebration.

219
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,280
But I contemplated and decided to celebrate with you alone.

220
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,040
Go ahead. What do you need?

221
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,140
You got me wrong. I just want to drink with you and talk.

222
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,660
If you want to reward me, drink with me for the whole night.

223
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:13,250
All right. You have my word.

224
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,530
I'm not going anywhere tonight.

225
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,380
I asked Zhuang Zhixing to keep the Marquis there.

226
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,880
As long as he doesn't show up anywhere else in the mansion,

227
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,730
we'll pass the first trial.

228
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,250
I see.

229
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:38,400
It turns out I'm also your pawn, just like Zhuang Zhixing.

230
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,160
You used me and won't tell me the truth.

231
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,210
I won't let you off easily.

232
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,830
Miss Xiang.

233
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,540
You're not my pawn.

234
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,860
You are my friend.

235
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,300
If you keep doing this, I'm afraid my marriage line,

236
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,460
career path, and even my fate will be rewritten.

237
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,450
 Father, let's try a different wine. 

238
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,480
 All right. 

239
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,680
 Where were we? 

240
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,630
 My Lord. 

241
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,790
My Lord, it's getting late.

242
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,350
Let me serve you to retire.

243
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:55,390
Not tonight. I want to have a good chat with Zhixing.

244
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,200
Why can't you talk tomorrow?

245
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,780
It's getting late. Over-drinking doesn't do you good.

246
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,810
Mother, Father and I haven't had a night chat for a long time.

247
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:14,750
He just promised that he wouldn't leave tonight.

248
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,110
I promise I won't let him over-drink.

249
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,000
You just don't know your father.

250
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,920
He always gets carried away once he starts drinking.

251
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,270
I have to look after him.

252
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:31,140
What were you talking about? You sounded happy.

253
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,140
We were talking about his childhood.

254
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,340
Zhixing is a grown man now.

255
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:42,790
He must be tired of listening to his childhood stories over and over again.

256
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,480
You haven't worn this outfit for a long time.

257
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,550
If I remember correctly, you wore it when you visited me at the border

258
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:56,070
after I defeated the Dongxia army. Right?

259
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:01,520
It was freezing cold. I was almost frozen in this outfit.

260
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,080
You had suffered a lot at the border back then.

261
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,110
I was leading troops.

262
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,060
A mere cold breeze couldn't bother me.

263
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,550
Why don't you share those memories with me?

264
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:18,710
It's my fault that I've never asked about those days.

265
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,550
My wife,

266
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,030
I thought you didn't like those army stories.

267
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,540
If you are willing to talk, of course, I would love to listen.

268
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,350
I was also curious

269
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,200
about how you led 800 people to take down the enemies that night.

270
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,310
You must let me drink if you want to hear the story.

271
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,720
You rarely talk about it.

272
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,980
Drink to your heart's content tonight.

273
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,250
Zhixing, sit down and join us.

274
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,670
I will leave you to talk...

275
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,260
and wait outside.

276
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,070
Come on, My Lord.

277
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,410
Let me toast to you.

278
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,330
Tell me the story.

279
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,780
 I can't talk about this battle 

280
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,420
 without mentioning the famous Dongxia general, Sepuli. 

281
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:31,260
 He was the most awe-inspiring general I have ever seen all those years. 

282
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,440
 Was he even better than you? 

283
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,200
 Of course not. 

284
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,550
 If he had been better than me, 

285
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:42,260
 how could I have killed him at Yanling Pass? 

286
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,600
- Eunuch. 
 - Where is Lu Jin?

287
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,540
He's still in the Marquis's mansion.

288
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,780
- Where is Zhuang Luyin? 
 - He's still in the study with Mr. Lu.

289
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,410
They talked all night long?

290
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,970
That's right.

291
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,730
All right, Zhuang Luyin.

292
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,800
I am really curious about what you've been saying to my foster son.

293
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,720
Prepare the carriage. To the Marquis's mansion.

294
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,420
Understood.

295
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,540
The officers left.

296
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,690
We can leave now.

297
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,000
Can you handle what's going to happen next?

298
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,160
Why don't you come with me?

299
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,920
This show hasn't ended yet.

300
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,250
For now, I can only express my deepest gratitude with words.

301
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,110
If I come through this alive,

302
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,330
you shall receive my most solemn gratitude.

303
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,050
All right. Make sure you come back alive.

304
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,000
You owe me.

305
00:34:00,673 --> 00:34:03,920
   

306
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,010
Second Young Master, a distinguished guest is here to see our Lord.

307
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,800
Who is it?

308
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,470
Eunuch Cao.

309
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,480
Father is still asleep from the hangover.

310
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,230
Maybe next time.

311
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,880
That won't do, Second Young Master.

312
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,520
Our Lord must deal with everything concerning Eunuch Cao in person.

313
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,660
I'd better wake him up. Or there will be trouble.

314
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,670
Do you remember that I am your young master?

315
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,660
You call me "Young Master"

316
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,000
but none of you see me as my father's son.

317
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,510
I used to let it slide.

318
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,780
But you don't know when to stop, and keep ignoring me.

319
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:52,230
Why don't you take another step forward and see what happens?

320
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,440
My father is resting and doesn't want to see anyone.

321
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,570
Do you know what to tell Eunuch Cao now?

322
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,920
Yes.

323
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,860
   

324
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,640
Greetings, Eunuch Cao.

325
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,960
How come it's you? Where is the Marquis of Pingjin?

326
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,850
Our Lord had a few drinks last night and he's still resting.

327
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,030
Who did he drink with?

328
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,710
Well... I have no idea.

329
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,410
You have no idea?

330
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:34,590
You know very well with whom he talked the whole night.

331
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,270
Eunuch Cao, what do you mean?

332
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,590
I don't understand.

333
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,050
Don't play dumb. I see right through your game.

334
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,910
Tell me. Where is Lu Jin?

335
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,900
I... don't know any Lu Jin.

336
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,260
My people saw you bringing Lu Jin here with their own eyes last night.

337
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,810
He stayed here all night.

338
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,380
You don't know him?

339
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,460
What are you plotting?

340
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,850
I swear I've never met anyone called Lu Jin.

341
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,840
Your people must have made a mistake.

342
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,730
Once I see the Marquis of Pingjin, we will see if I'm mistaken.

343
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,650
Eunuch Cao.

344
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,110
Our Lord is still asleep.

345
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,730
He should have woken up even if he had a hangover.

346
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:21,930
Please wait here.

347
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,620
Our Lord will get up soon.

348
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,660
Fine.

349
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,790
It seems that I have to wake him up in person.

350
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,690
Eunuch Cao.

351
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:40,180
Eunuch Cao, why would you give the steward a hard time?

352
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,410
We don't have a say about

353
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,280
when our Lord should sleep or get up.

354
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,090
You think I can't deal with you just because the Marquis of Pingjin likes you?

355
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,010
As an aide, you're overstepping and meddling with my business.

356
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:57,510
Even if I kill you, the Marquis can't say anything.

357
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,920
- Guards. 
 - Here!

358
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,090
This man is a spy.

359
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,860
I came here to arrest him in person.

360
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,960
He resisted and was killed in combat.

361
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,630
Eunuch!

362
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,180
We found Lu Jin.

363
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,450
Bring him here.

364
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,200
He drowned in the Guangji River.

365
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,210
- Take me there. 
 - Understood.

366
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,570
Tell Zhuang Luyin.

367
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:34,560
I'm taking his aide with me.

368
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,010
Go.

369
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,230
Father.

370
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,000
You stood here the whole night?

371
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,130
I dare not leave without your permission.

372
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,440
Who was making noise just now?

373
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,360
The steward ignored me and insisted on waking you up.

374
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,660
What happened?

375
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,160
It's said that Eunuch Cao is here.

376
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,480
Why didn't you tell me that Eunuch Cao is here?

377
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:30,020
I didn't want to disturb you and Mother.

378
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,400
My Lord.

379
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,700
Where is Eunuch Cao?

380
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,070
He just left.

381
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,800
He took Mr. Zang with him.

382
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,170
- Did he say why he came? 
 - No.

383
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,800
I just heard that someone drowned in the Guangji River.

384
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,450
Eunuch Cao heard that and left in a hurry.

385
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,170
Get my horse. I'll go to the Guangji River.

386
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,670
Understood.

387
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,110
Zhixing, come along.

388
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,590
Understood.

389
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,940
Eunuch, Mr. Lu didn't drown.

390
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,920
He died from a stab in the back of his neck.

391
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,300
Lu Yan, go take a look.

392
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,400
Open it.

393
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,490
Father.

394
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,090
My Lord.

395
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:41,400
Eunuch Cao, you came and left in a rush.

396
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,360
Did you need anything?

397
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,180
It was nothing serious.

398
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,780
I just wanted to talk to you.

399
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,760
Isn't this your foster son?

400
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,130
How did he die?

401
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,610
I don't know, either.

402
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:25,000
It was probably a retaliation.

403
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,190
I will get to the bottom of it.

404
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,560
My Lord, I shall take my leave.

405
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:16,070



406
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:22,200
