00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,940
[Imperial Astronomical Bureau]

4
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,820
[Decree]

5
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,540
It seems you have all read the decree.

6
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,770
I drafted it last night

7
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,820
and submitted it to the Cabinet this morning.

8
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,540
In case there's still any confusion among you,

9
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,460
let me reiterate it.

10
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,660
Effective immediately, three prohibitions apply to all personnel in the Bureau.

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,540
Every division must perform its duty with diligence and continuous improvement.

12
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,820
There must be no dereliction of duty.

13
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,220
That is the first prohibition.

14
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,170
As for all funeral arrangements involving officials,

15
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,060
site selection must comply with laws and regulations.

16
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,100
The unauthorized establishment of burial sites is strictly prohibited.

17
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,170
That is the second prohibition.

18
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,260
Private exhumations and ghost marriages are strictly banned.

19
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,010
Any indulgence will be severely punished.

20
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,260
That is the third prohibition.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,130
Mr. Zang, if you were going to issue a decree,

22
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,890
why didn't you inform us in advance?

23
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,060
Are we not worthy

24
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,130
of your trust?

25
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,820
Since we hold official positions here,

26
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,820
we must serve His Majesty loyally.

27
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,570
These are fundamental rules

28
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,410
that need no discussion.

29
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,570
It seems what you said

30
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,850
isn't groundless.

31
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,170
Indeed.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,410
I've heard rumors

33
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,220
that the Imperial Astronomical Bureau occupied farmers' land

34
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,980
to select burial sites for officials,

35
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,980
and even caused the deaths of common women

36
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,890
for the ghost marriages of officials and nobles.

37
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,060
I wonder if you've heard these things.

38
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,290
Mr. Zang,

39
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,820
we have carefully studied

40
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,610
the three prohibitions you decreed.

41
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,980
The first one makes good sense.

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,570
Everyone should fulfill their duties.

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,290
It's the foundation of our role as officials.

44
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,730
As for the second one, about ghost marriages,

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,940
the court has tried banning them many times.

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,130
However, it's deeply-rooted customs.

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,980
Forcing a ban on such life-and-death matters

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,820
will stir resentment.

49
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,540
That's why we have no choice

50
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,850
but to look the other way.

51
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,820
As for the farmers' land

52
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,660
you mentioned,

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,100
that was Mr. Chu's decision during his term.

54
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,930
We didn't...

55
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,780
So are you suggesting

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,930
I confront Chu Huaiming

57
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,580
to hold him accountable

58
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,730
or punish the people?

59
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,020
No...

60
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,900
That's not what I meant.

61
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,900
Please don't jest.

62
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,170
I am but a humble Calendar Manager.

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,610
I wouldn't dare suggest that.

64
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,930
I issued the decree

65
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,290
to put an end to such misconduct.

66
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,410
Gentlemen,

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,850
take it as a reminder if you're not involved.

68
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,610
But if anyone is,

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,540
I will

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,850
handle it impartially.

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,730
What is with this new Imperial Astronomer?

72
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,980
Is he seriously making this a clean, no-profit office?

73
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,250
What now?

74
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,850
Are we all going to starve?

75
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,850
New officials always pretend to be upright.

76
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,100
Look at how he's playing the impartial one now.

77
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,170
He's just fishing for bribes from us.

78
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,610
Once we give him gifts, he won't act like that anymore.

79
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,220
It'll be all about personal ties.

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,540
What if he plans to make an example of us?

81
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,100
If the files

82
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,050
contain records involving us

83
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,410
and he really digs something up...

84
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,290
Why worry?

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,460
Let him.

86
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,460
I've cleaned everything long ago.

87
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,170
If he dares come after us,

88
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,700
I don't care who's backing him.

89
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,660
If this Astronomer doesn't know how things work,

90
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,660
someone who does will take his place.

91
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,170
Who are you burning these for?

92
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:02,780
Mr. Zang,

93
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,980
Chu Huaiming died while being banished.

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,170
You're quite well-informed.

95
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,490
We at the Mortuary Division deal with the dead every day.

96
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,610
Anything related to death

97
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,250
reaches us first.

98
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,850
I reviewed records at the Bureau.

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,020
Chu Huaiming didn't treat you well.

100
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,340
Why are you mourning him?

101
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,580
We studied together in our youth.

102
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,900
Yet our paths diverged drastically.

103
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,340
He was more adept at managing relationships

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,050
and quickly latched onto the Marquis of Pingjin's support.

105
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,850
He was in his prime,

106
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,290
just like you now.

107
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,700
But at that time,

108
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,580
I had hit rock bottom.

109
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,610
I was going to return to my hometown.

110
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,780
He asked me to stay,

111
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,810
saying he needed people.

112
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,850
But I didn't expect

113
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,020
he only kept me to assist in his corruption.

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,170
He was competent.

115
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,290
If he'd put his abilities to proper use,

116
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,050
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

117
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,490
But Chu Huaiming

118
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,340
didn't value your bond.

119
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,730
He marginalized you

120
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,730
and gave you

121
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,410
the toughest work.

122
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,250
That was after he realized

123
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,580
I wouldn't join him in corruption.

124
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,810
So he stopped seeing me as one of his own.

125
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,730
Still,

126
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,580
when he rose to power,

127
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,540
I was the first person he thought of.

128
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,930
And despite how much he disapproved of me,

129
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,050
he never drove me away.

130
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,980
I still appreciate him for that.

131
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,580
[To Mr. Chu]

132
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,980
May I take a look

133
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,810
at these letters?

134
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,700
Sure, they are going to be burned anyway.

135
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,180
[To Mr. Chu]

136
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,020
[Mr. Chu, corruption and favoritism within the Bureau are increasing rapidly.]

137
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,630
[I have reported the guilty officials]

138
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,940
[to the court to set a warning.]

139
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,130
This is a sincere letter.

140
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,100
Your letter contains valuable suggestions.

141
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,490
You flatter me.

142
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,580
Advice that no one bothers to listen to

143
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,940
can hardly be called valuable.

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,730
Everyone knows how to improve the Bureau.

145
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,060
So did Chu Huaiming.

146
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,820
They just didn't want to do it.

147
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,300
No one was willing to sacrifice their interests.

148
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,010
Huaiming,

149
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,580
I'm burning the letters for you.

150
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,530
You can read them down there.

151
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,370
Then are you willing

152
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,370
to help me reform the Bureau

153
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,770
following what you wrote in the letters?

154
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,010
If I hadn't seen you issue the decree today,

155
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,250
I wouldn't know

156
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,530
if you truly meant it.

157
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,940
I am not Chu Huaiming.

158
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,100
If I fail to do my duty,

159
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,850
please write me

160
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,490
just as many letters.

161
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,730
I will.

162
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,820
Mr. Zang,

163
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,940
if you truly want to change things,

164
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,180
there's a place you should visit.

165
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,980
You will gain something from there.

166
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,730
Where?

167
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,850
West of the city.

168
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,300
Tai'an Alley.

169
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,300
Mr. Chang,

170
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,010
how is my sister?

171
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,460
Wensheng,

172
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,300
let's talk outside.

173
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,890
It's okay.

174
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:04,980
Mr. Chang,

175
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,530
is there still hope for my sister?

176
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,890
Wensheng,

177
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,060
I will be honest with you.

178
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,890
The illness has seeped into her marrow.

179
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,700
She may only have

180
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,460
about a month left.

181
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,580
It's time

182
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,530
to make early arrangements.

183
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,490
For families like ours,

184
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,580
there's little we can afford to do.

185
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,420
We've spent all our savings

186
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,850
on my sister's treatment.

187
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,250
I understand.

188
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,490
I've prepared everything for you.

189
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,180
Here.

190
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:39,890
Mr. Chang,

191
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,060
what do you mean by this?

192
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,370
Just the other day,

193
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,820
I paid respects at Marquis of Dingyi's Mansion.

194
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,420
That's when I learned

195
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,850
their third son had died before his time

196
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,730
of an incurable illness.

197
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,250
He hadn't married yet.

198
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,650
The Dowager Marchioness

199
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,940
wants to match him with a girl in the afterlife.

200
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,580
I thought it over,

201
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,250
and your sister seems the best fit.

202
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,490
You mean to match her with the deceased?

203
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,460
Your sister is lucky.

204
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,530
A girl from a humble family

205
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,820
rarely gets to be matched to a marquis' son after death.

206
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,460
It's an honor.

207
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,250
They said

208
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,700
this is just a deposit.

209
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,850
Once the ritual is complete,

210
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,180
they'll take care of the coffin and burial.

211
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,300
And after that,

212
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,130
you will receive more silver.

213
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,060
As long as it does no harm to her,

214
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,530
it should be fine.

215
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,530
Here, Wensheng.

216
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,060
Take the silver.

217
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,890
But

218
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,890
they have one condition.

219
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,340
Their third son

220
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,610
is to be buried at dusk tomorrow.

221
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,770
So your sister

222
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,820
should match that timing.

223
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,730
But...

224
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,180
But she isn't dead yet!

225
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,490
Wait, sir,

226
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,580
I thought you said

227
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,370
she had a month left.

228
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,060
I meant a month at most.

229
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,130
Besides, she is suffering so much.

230
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,580
She...

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,490
Wensheng,

232
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,460
this is a special concoction from the Bureau.

233
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,300
She won't feel anything.

234
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,980
You...

235
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,370
You...

236
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,340
You want me to kill my own sister?

237
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,300
Wensheng, calm down.

238
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,340
Your sister's been sick for years.

239
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,770
You've nearly used up

240
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,250
all your savings.

241
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,250
You're already 28, aren't you?

242
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,340
And you're still unmarried.

243
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,770
Are you planning to stay poor like this?

244
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,820
I will never

245
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,370
trade my sister's life for money!

246
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,100
Liang Wensheng.

247
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,250
Must you be so stubborn?

248
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,770
If not for my kindness,

249
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,980
your sister would be dead already.

250
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,610
If it weren't for her,

251
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,530
you would have starved to death.

252
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,420
What do you think the clinic

253
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,770
is keeping her alive for?

254
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,180
Everything you have today is thanks to your sister.

255
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,730
So this was your plan all along.

256
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,700
You've been plotting to offer her for a ghost marriage.

257
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,820
Have you ever tried to cure her?

258
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,730
Let go!

259
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,300
I came today

260
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,100
for this exact reason.

261
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,180
If you don't do it, I will.

262
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,890
You...!

263
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,850
Liang Wensheng!

264
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,250
The Marquis' family choosing Liang Xiaoyan

265
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,300
is a huge honor for you!

266
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,650
You're too blind to appreciate it!

267
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,340
You...

268
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,250
You insolent peasant!

269
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,700
- Stop it... - Wrench!

270
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,730
Please...

271
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,300
Wretch!

272
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,100
Stop it.

273
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:45,890
Peasant.

274
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,420
Please let my brother go.

275
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,130
Ungrateful brute.

276
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,700
You won't get a single copper from me!

277
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,700
Who...

278
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,370
Who are you?

279
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,420
Who are you?

280
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,540
[Imperial Astronomical Bureau]

281
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,580
Calling us out in the middle of the night...

282
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,340
Couldn't it wait until morning?

283
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,890
I was asleep

284
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,300
and woken up by the servant.

285
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,490
What a bother.

286
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,100
Mr. Zang.

287
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,130
You're all here.

288
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,730
Take your seat.

289
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,060
Gentlemen,

290
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,770
do you know this lady?

291
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,730
Her name is Liang Xiaoyan.

292
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,220
Miss Liang suffers from a stubborn illness,

293
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,420
but she is not beyond medical help.

294
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,650
Yet someone tried to force poison down her throat.

295
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,060
Why?

296
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,580
Liang Xiaoyan

297
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,460
had no say in her life,

298
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,730
but for those with evil intent,

299
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,530
even a day's difference

300
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,250
is critical.

301
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,300
Shilei,

302
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,770
bring him in.

303
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,220
Stay put.

304
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,340
These are Chang Wuyi's dirty dealings all these years.

305
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,530
Using the clinic as his cover

306
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,370
and claiming to treat the sick,

307
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,890
he secretly sought out dying women

308
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,460
and forced them

309
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,580
into marrying dead noble sons,

310
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,090
causing their deaths.

311
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,010
If His Lordship hadn't arrived in time,

312
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,900
my sister and I

313
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,490
would both be dead now.

314
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,010
You plan to arrange ghost marriages and even demand auspicious burial dates.

315
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,660
Did you think you could get away with it?

316
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,730
Min Shining,

317
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,050
Chang Wuyi has admitted it all.

318
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,860
What do you say?

319
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,250
Mr. Zang,

320
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,010
I was wrong.

321
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,980
I was wrong...

322
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,420
Min Shining, Chang Wuyi,

323
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,980
your hearts are wicked and your crimes are monstrous.

324
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,900
Effective immediately, you are dismissed and will be investigated!

325
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,140
- Mr. Zang! - Mr. Zang!

326
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,460
He made me do it!

327
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,420
Mr. Zang, it was him.

328
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,660
Chang Wuyi made me do it.

329
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,220
It was his idea!

330
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,380
Mr. Zang, it was him!

331
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,660
Have mercy, Mr. Zang!

332
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,420
Mr. Zang!

333
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,860
- Have mercy! - Have mercy!

334
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,290
- Have mercy! - Have mercy!

335
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,700
- Mr. Zang... - Have mercy...

336
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,620
I have another name list here.

337
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,420
It involves quite a few people

338
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,860
who followed them in corruption and favoritism.

339
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,660
I will be staying here tonight,

340
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,770
waiting for people to come and confess their crimes.

341
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,380
Those who confess early will be treated with leniency.

342
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,940
But if I uncover something myself,

343
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,620
this won't just be about a few individuals.

344
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,730
It will implicate the entire bureau.

345
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,050
Mr. Zang,

346
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,940
I have something to report.

347
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,050
Please judge with discernment.

348
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,050
Mr. Zang,

349
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,290
I also have something to report.

350
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,490
Please let me speak first.

351
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,250
Mr. Zang,

352
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,810
I also have something to say.

353
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,730
Mr. Zang, I have matters to report, too.

354
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,700
Mr. Zang.

355
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,020
[Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion]

356
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,250
Mr. Zhuang.

357
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,090
Mr. Zang.

358
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,570
I just met with the Marquis.

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,290
I meant to congratulate you in person

360
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,940
but didn't expect to run into you here.

361
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,980
Perfect timing. Here's for you.

362
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,460
Thank you, Mr. Zhuang.

363
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,290
My father trusts you more and more these days.

364
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,140
And you've been granted an official post.

365
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,730
I fear the gap between us

366
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,860
will only grow wider.

367
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,900
Mr. Zang,

368
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,420
what should I do next?

369
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,180
I came today

370
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,010
to discuss this with you.

371
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,620
The Ministry of War has issued the conscription order.

372
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,490
I want you to join the army.

373
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,330
Join the army?

374
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,420
That's right.

375
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,090
If you want to surpass Zhuang Zhifu,

376
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,290
you must forge a new path

377
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,940
and do what he cannot.

378
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,220
You must temper yourself in the military.

379
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,730
Only then can your future truly change.

380
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,180
But even if I choose to go,

381
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,730
I doubt my father will approve of it.

382
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,180
Then you must ask him.

383
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,220
If once isn't enough, ask him again.

384
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,810
If that fails, another time.

385
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,940
Keep asking until he agrees.

386
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,290
The key is to show him your resolve.

387
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,180
Understood.

388
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,570
Come on.

389
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,570
Put it here.

390
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,940
Here. Put it here.

391
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,900
Here?

392
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,770
Okay.

393
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,330
Yes, that one goes here.

394
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,900
Good.

395
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,730
Mr. Zang.

396
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,250
Shilei,

397
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,290
give us a minute.

398
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,770
Yes, sir.

399
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,090
It took you long.

400
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,090
Have you taken care of those obstacles?

401
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,700
Congratulations, My lord.

402
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,330
Master.

403
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,980
Stop calling me that.

404
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,530
I'm not used to it.

405
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,530
Well, you have to.

406
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,620
From now on,

407
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,980
watch your words and actions.

408
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,380
Never give yourself away.

409
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,810
Understood,

410
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,420
Steward Gao.

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,940
Well, Mr. Zang,

412
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,460
how about a raise in my monthly salary?

413
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,380
Do you need to ask me that?

414
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,620
You're in charge of everything here now.

415
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,180
Then tell me,

416
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,770
am I doing a great job?

417
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,770
Hai,

418
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,220
this is your home.

419
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,900
I should at least make sure

420
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,220
you live here with peace of mind.

421
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,770
Thank you, Master.

422
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,940
But...

423
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,660
this isn't my home.

424
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,420
All right.

425
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,860
Think of it as my home.

426
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,420
A place where you can rest.

427
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,010
Okay?

428
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,140
Hai,

429
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,730
as long as you're with family and friends,

430
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,380
anywhere can be home.

431
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,700
Come on.

432
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,010
Let's have a good drink tonight.

433
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,250
Let's go.

434
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,380
Tastes good?

435
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,250
Good.

436
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,530
I had the chef make it for you.

437
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,090
Getting Shilei some meat

438
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,700
to help boost his brain.

439
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,050
Then you'd better eat more.

440
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,420
I'll eat more.

441
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,050
These shrimp are good.

442
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,530
Right?

443
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,290
Have more.

444
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,940
With Hai here,

445
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:09,980
I believe

446
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,330
the Bureau will become what it used to be.

447
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,420
Here.

448
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,090
Here's to your promotion.

449
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,140
Wishing you

450
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,290
more to come!

451
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,140
- Come on. - Thank you.

452
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,700
Come on.

453
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,730
Congratulations!

454
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,090
So can we draft memorials

455
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,290
to impeach the Marquis of Pingjin

456
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,460
and Cao Jingxian

457
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,980
to let His Majesty know all their wicked deeds?

458
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,180
Insane.

459
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,730
Enough.

460
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,290
It's useless.

461
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,860
Those memorials will never reach His Majesty.

462
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,460
They'll only expose me.

463
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,730
Did you hear that?

464
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,490
From now on, we need to be more careful.

465
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,050
Never run your mouth. Understand?

466
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,050
You got that?

467
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,570
I've arranged everything properly in the house.

468
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,700
From now on, Shilei will be the household guard.

469
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,620
Guanfeng will be the physician.

470
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,330
All the servants have clean records.

471
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,180
No need to worry.

472
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,490
Steward Gao, your arrangements are excellent.

473
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,900
It's all thanks to Mr. Zang.

474
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,530
Come on.

475
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,380
- Thank you, Mr. Zang. - Thank you, Mr. Zang.

476
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,090
Oh, you lot.

477
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,570
Now you're all making fun of me, huh?

478
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,050
Here.

479
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,420
Eat up while the food's still warm.

480
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:16,980
Try this.

481
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,700
Mr. Zang.

482
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,460
This looks...

483
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,620
A Miss Xiang from Zhen Tower sent in her visiting card.

484
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,660
She's waiting at the gate

485
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,810
with many gifts.

486
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,330
Gifts!

487
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,050
What is it?

488
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,220
You've just moved in,

489
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,860
and Miss Xiang is paying a personal visit.

490
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,290
That's quite something.

491
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,140
Hai,

492
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,220
so is Miss Xiang one of us now?

493
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,660
What has she brought?

494
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,090
Hurry up

495
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,980
and let her in.

496
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,570
Miss...

497
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,050
Xiang is not someone to trifle with.

498
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,490
Don't keep her waiting.

499
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,010
Fine.

500
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,290
I'll bring her in.

501
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,140
Remember,

502
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,330
don't say anything

503
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,250
you shouldn't say.

504
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,090
You stay quiet.

505
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,530
You aren't the same as when you first arrived in the capital.

506
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,250
I nearly couldn't get in.

507
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,860
Miss Xiang, your visit honors me.

508
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,770
My apologies for not receiving you sooner.

509
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,290
Look at that tone.

510
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,010
Should I give you a formal bow?

511
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,290
My humble...

512
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:19,860
Miss Xiang,

513
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,180
please don't do that.

514
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,570
You helped me.

515
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,290
If anyone should be bowing, it's me.

516
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,860
Leave the things here and wait outside.

517
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,530
Aren't you going to show me your new mansion?

518
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,180
Please.

519
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,730
Mr. Zang,

520
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,290
you've got quite a place.

521
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,490
The Marquis of Pingjin must really favor you.

522
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,380
It's nothing compared to your Zhen Tower.

523
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,940
The courtyard may be smaller than mine,

524
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,380
but it's quite elegant.

525
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,250
A pity though

526
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,330
that there are no stars tonight.

527
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,770
Why does it feel like

528
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,010
she's at her own home?

529
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,050
I haven't really looked around

530
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,860
yet.

531
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:24,940
Have you not

532
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,730
noticed anything?

533
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,700
Like what?

534
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,770
Stop the guessing game.

535
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,810
Check what she brought as gifts.

536
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,700
And see if we can accept them.

537
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,140
Hurry up.

538
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,730
Hurry up.

539
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:44,980
It's happening.

540
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,140
This is big.

541
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,660
You fought Chu Huaiming in astronomy.

542
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,010
Now that I think about it,

543
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,010
the night you showed me stargazing on the boat,

544
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,180
you weren't just making things up.

545
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,490
You really can foresight.

546
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,220
It's nothing more than ancient wisdom passed down.

547
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,620
If Chu Huaiming, besides staring at the sky,

548
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,180
had taken a look at what was on the ground

549
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,140
and shown humility and respect,

550
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,490
he wouldn't have fallen so hard.

551
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,290
His skills weren't empty talk.

552
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,490
He just couldn't hold onto his integrity.

553
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,380
You're truly a good person.

554
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,730
Then with your geomantic skills,

555
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,700
can't you just turn every misfortune into fortune?

556
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,530
As the old saying goes,

557
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,620
"Knowing fate is easy; resisting it is not."

558
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,140
Most of the time,

559
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,530
even if we know what lies ahead,

560
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,570
we cannot stop it.

561
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,570
But everything that's happened to you has been good.

562
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,810
I used to marvel

563
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,730
at how you became the Marquis' chief aide

564
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,810
in just a few months.

565
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,700
And just a little while later,

566
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,620
you've become a fifth-rank official.

567
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,460
Without your help,

568
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,940
my fate

569
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,570
would've been entirely different.

570
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,460
That night on the boat,

571
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,700
you said nothing good ever happened when we met.

572
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,770
So do you still want

573
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,180
to see me often?

574
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,700
Of course.

575
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,490
I'd love for you to visit Zhen Tower and spend your silver.

576

a fifth-rank official,

578
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,980
but I'm still as broke as ever.

579
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,490
In the Capital,

580
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,460
officials are the people I dislike most.

581
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,810
The higher the rank, the more I dislike them.

582
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,380
Don't become one of them.

583
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,620
What?

584
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,050
Going to throw your weight around?

585
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,140
What you said

586
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,010
reminds me of something I heard.

587
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,050
What was it?

588
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,570
Someone told me

589
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,530
that once you're an official and get to ride in a carriage,

590
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,900
you'll be too lazy to walk again

591
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,980
and will never step down from it.

592
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,980
Makes sense.

593
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,860
Don't tell me you said that.

594
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,140
Thank you for the reminder.

595
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,980
I will keep it in mind.

596
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,010
Well, aren't you good to talk to.

597
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,140
I wasn't expecting your visit today.

598
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,940
Sorry for not being more welcoming.

599
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,770
Would you like to go to the garden

600
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,900
and share a drink with them?

601
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,660
Drinking with them is boring.

602
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,660
If you ever want a drink,

603
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,140
come find me at Bazheng Pavilion.

604
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,570
I didn't just come to congratulate you on your promotion.

605
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,220
I have a question for you.

606
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,770
Please go ahead.

607
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,180
That day on the boat,

608
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,860
was there something you wanted to tell me?

609
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,290
Your brows are like slender willows

610
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,330
and your eyes, a river of stars.

611
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,860
Few women can compare.

612
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,420
Then tell me,

613
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,700
do you want to see me often?

614
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,620
You can't answer that?

615
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,090
If none, never mind.

616
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,140
Take care.

617
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,490
Miss Xiang,

618
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,730
please give me some time.

619
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,940
For now,

620
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,810
I don't have an answer.

621
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,660
How much would this all cost?

622
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,730
Look at this radish. It's got a long root!

623
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,770
What radish?

624
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,570
It's ginseng.

625

And the wine.

632
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,180
It's top-quality.

633
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,660
We'll make medicinal wine out of it.

634
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,700
It's good for your body.

635
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,460
Hai,

636
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,090

637
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,290
with nothing that could be used against you.

638
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,220
She's really thinking ahead for you.

639
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,570
She's gone already?

640
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,620
What did you talk about?

641
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,140
She reminded me

642
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,050
not to lose myself in officialdom.

643
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,980
That's it?

644
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,530
Nothing else?

645
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,900
Yeah.

646
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,180
We're doomed.

647
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,810
We came to the Capital

648
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,940

649
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,090

650
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,330
what do you mean?

651
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,050
Nothing.

652
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,900
Forget about that.

654

why are you still awake?

656

My disciple is troubled.

657
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,730
As the master,

658
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,330
how could I sleep soundly?

I didn't tell you everything today.

About Miss Xiang, right?

667
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,530
She asked me a question

668

that I didn't know how to answer.

669
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,620
So she left.

670
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,050
Is it that you didn't know the answer

671
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,180
or you didn't dare say it?

672

What is it?

680

I have something urgent

681
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,420
to discuss with you.

682
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,940
If it's about money,

683

talk to your mother.

684

I dreamed of Mother.

688
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,860
She kept crying in the dream.

689
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,250
I asked her why.

690
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,090
She didn't say a word

691
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,250
and just hit me.

692
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,380
She must be very disappointed in me.

693
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,700
That all these years,

694
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,380
I've been living in luxury, contributing nothing to the family.

00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,490

So you want to join the army?

Long ago,

00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,940
Mother once told me

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,860
she hoped I would become someone like you.

701
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,900
But I've been lost all these years.

702
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,940
After I woke from that dream,

703
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,300
I thought a long time.

704
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,860
