00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 39]

3
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,570
What is the other big celebration?

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,690
The queen is planning a marriage in Haidong Tribes.

5
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,180
The princess is getting married.

6
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,620
It's a great opportunity for her to break away from the Great Yong.

7
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,290
What did you just say?

8
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,180
The princess is getting married in Haidong Tribes?

9
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,900
Why are you anxious?

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,820
Do you

11
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,460
want the princess to marry you?

12
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,770
Come on. Let's drink.

13
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,850
It's time to eat.

14
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,950
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

15
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,860
Your Highness.

16
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,690
Antu.

17
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,980
Her Majesty has ordered it.

18
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,340
You can only meet him from afar.

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,690
Leave us alone.

20
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,060
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

21
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,820
Zang Hai.

22
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,290
I'm leaving.

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,220
Are you really going to get married?

24
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,730
Why are you obeying her?

25
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,730
Don't ask.

26
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,540
Anyway,

27
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,060
my sister agreed

28
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,130
that I come to see you one last time.

29
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,450
If you have anything to say,

30
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,500
say it now.

31
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,820
That's all they said?

32
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,260
Nothing else?

33
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,220
Yes.

34
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,380
They just talked

35
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,660
about what happened to them at the Great Yong

36
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,890
and some goodbyes.

37
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,260
Nothing else.

38
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,890
Go.

39
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,130
Aye.

40
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,170
I spent ten years in the Great Yong

41
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,820
looking forward

42
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,060
to the day when I could return home

43
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,540
and to my family,

44
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,850
but now, my mother is gone,

45
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,700
and my sister

46
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,700
seems to be a different person.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,730
I suddenly feel so strange here.

48
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,250
Madam.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,850
I know

50
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,100
you've been thinking about my mother.

51
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,540
Listening to you talk

52
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,020
about the past these days

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,100
makes me feel like

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,290
I've been home.

55
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,490
Thank you.

56
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,050
Your Highness.

57
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,460
You're finally back

58
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,460
but about to go

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,100
to another strange place.

60
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,980
I should have gone

61
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,810
with you,

62
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,460
but Her Majesty

63
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,700
doesn't want you

64
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,780
to think of anything else.

65
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,490
You're getting married tomorrow,

66
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,100
so why so glum?

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,980
It's not me

68
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,290
Moersa is marrying.

69
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,930
Whether I cry or laugh,

70
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,100
he won't care.

71
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,020
An emissary from Haidong Tribes

72
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,900
will meet you

73
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,980
at 30 li outside the city.

74
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,700
When the time comes,

75
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,900
I will ask an auxiliary

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,730
to act as your marriage messenger

77
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,660
and deliver you safely to them.

78
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,100
Your Majesty.

79
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,170
I want Zang Hai to accompany me.

80
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,610
I fear

81
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,340
you will kill him

82
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,340
as soon as I am married in Haidong Tribes,

83
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,850
so I want him

84
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,050
to follow my marriage team

85
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,340
to Haidong Tribes.

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,490
After my marriage,

87
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,050
set him free.

88
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,850
Yinzhu.

89
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,540
This is the only thing I ask of you.

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,220
Promise me,

91
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,660
will you?

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,900
You are getting married tomorrow,

93
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,610
so how can I,

94
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,490
as your sister, refuse you?

95
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,580
Mother has always loved you the most,

96
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,980
but she

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,140
can't personally comb your hair

98
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,900
or watch you get married.

99
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,980
In fact, even if you hadn't said anything, I would know

100
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,930
that you were afraid that I'd compete

101
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,020
with you for the throne when I came back this time,

102
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,370
but you don't have to worry.

103
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,660
I have already promised my mother

104
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,930
that my last duty to Dongxia

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,290
is to fulfill her last wish.

106
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,900
Her last wish?

107
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,290
What's that?

108
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,370
To retrieve the Gui Seal.

109
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,490
The Gui Seal is already in the hands

110
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,250
of the Great Yong's Chief Secretary, Zhao Bingwen.

111
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,660
The Great Yong's Emperor is gone,

112
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,340
so Zhao Bingwen will do something about it.

113
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,020
He had said

114
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,140
that he would use the Gui Seal

115
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,460
to build an army in Dongxia.

116
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,770
At that point,

117
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,580
Haidong Tribes

118
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,220
and its political marriage to Dongxia

119
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,980
won't matter.

120
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,700
So do you have a way

121
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,810
to take back the Gui Seal

122
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,050
from him?

123
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,700
I'm no match for him,

124
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,020
but you're different.

125
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,100
Yinzhu.

126
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,780
You are the Queen of Dongxia.

127
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,900
If you are willing to help me...

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,050
Stop imagining.

129
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,490
Prepare to get married.

130
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,610
This will be the last time

131
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,700
we see each other, right?

132
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,930
I won't be coming back.

133
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,250
Princess, please depart.

134
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,220
That's Haidong Tribes' greeting party.

135
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,890
We've traveled thirty li.

136
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,060
That's right.

137
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,980
Are you Haidong Tribes' emissaries?

138
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,250
Yes.

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,890
I have been ordered by Khan

140
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,650
to welcome the Princess of Dongxia.

141
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,460
[May we be friends with Haidong Tribes forever]

142
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,940
Are you really going to get married?

143
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,730
Why are you obeying her?

144
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,610
Don't ask.

145
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,370
Anyway,

146
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,940
my sister agreed

147
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,980
that I come to see you one last time.

148
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,060
If you have anything to say,

149
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,300
say it now.

150
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,770
If I'd known this was going to happen,

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,650
I'd have preferred

152
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,060
to stay at Zhen Tower,

153
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,700
but how will Zhen Tower be run

154
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,770
without you?

155
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,300
How are you going to pay back

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,700
the debt you owe?

157
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,060
I can't go back anyway,

158
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,940
so I'll just have to

159
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,610
trouble you to pay those debts for me.

160
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,490
The other debts are fine,

161
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,530
but

162
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,220
you had been begging me

163
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,700
to ask Mr. Eight

164
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,890
to give storytelling to the champion of the ground polo,

165
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,220
which not only

166
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,420
spoiled his plan

167
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,300
but also made them come to you

168
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,820
and forcibly escort you

169
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,250
to his residence.

170
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,730
I'll forget about it if you don't tell me.

171
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,130
What happened then?

172
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,180
Then?

173
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,460
Then,

174
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,300
I sold the house

175
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,010
for some money as ransom to save you.

176
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,250
Miss Xiang.

177
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,250
This is the money you owe me,

178
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,180
so do you want me

179
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,130
to pay myself back?

180
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,100
I'm getting married anyway,

181
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,650
so consider it

182
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,490
your wedding gift for me.

183
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,980
Let's write it off.

184
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,940
No way.

185
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,300
You owe me money,

186
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,530
so you can't leave me here alone,

187
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,300
right?

188
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,300
Madam.

189
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,010
You're the only one I can trust

190
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,460
in this palace,

191
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,890
so I'd like to ask you a favor.

192
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,530
Go to a general of the Great Yong

193
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,850
named Zhuang Zhixing.

194
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,610
Everything is in order.

195
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,820
All the princess's dowry

196
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,580
is on the carriage.

197
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,340
Please take care of our princess.

198
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,250
Don't worry.

199
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,940
We will make the marriage of the princess and Khan

200
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,850
go very well.

201
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,650
Your Highness, please follow the procession

202
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,770
to Haidong Tribes.

203
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,580
Take care.

204
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,060
Thank you.

205
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,850
Let's go back.

206
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,850
Your Highness.

207
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,530
You can come out now.

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,940
Go back now.

209
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,650
I'll go to Haidong Tribes with them.

210
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,340
Mr. Zang.

211
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,850
I've been ordered by General Zhuang

212
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,100
to meet you here.

213
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,220
Xiang Hong.

214
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,460
Thank you very much.

215
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,250
Take the stuff in the car with you.

216
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,730
Where is the General?

217
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,770
The General is in his tent

218
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,370
discussing military matters.

219
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,180
They are friends of the General.

220
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,300
Now, prepare

221
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,220
a clean tent.

222
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:52,820
Yes, sir.

223
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,820
Mr. Zang.

224
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,890
Have some rest first.

225
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,100
I'll let you know

226
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,420
when the General is finished.

227
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,700
Thank you very much.

228
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,250
Thank you

229
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,420
for your help.

230
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,130
Long time no see.

231
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,420
Zang Hai.

232
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,820
You've really changed a lot

233
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,010
in just one year.

234
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,980
Only a year?

235
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,980
I always feel like

236
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,220
it's been five or six years.

237
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,650
When I was indulging,

238
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,370
I only felt that time passed too quickly,

239
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,370
but when I really suffered,

240
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,250
I realized how slowly time was passing.

241
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,700
It's been hard

242
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,460
for you to get this far

243
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,730
at the border.

244
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,610
The commander-in-chief here

245
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,130
was originally the State-Settling General.

246
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,770
Before that,

247
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,370
he had been at odds with my father,

248
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,980
so he gave me a hard time.

249
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,010
Later, I fought to the death

250
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,980
and made some military achievements

251
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,890
to get myself established at last.

252
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,130
In the Capital,

253
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,130
why did I

254
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,220
never hear anything about you?

255
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,580
When I left,

256
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,850
I was just an insignificant commander.

257
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,650
If I had died in battle,

258
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,060
I wouldn't even deserve a tombstone,

259
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,460
so how could you hear anything about me?

260
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,010
Not long ago,

261
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,940
the State-Settling General died of illness,

262
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,980
so the court made me General of Exemplary Fortitude

263
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,490
to hold this place

264
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,250
in his position.

265
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,530
I didn't let you down, did I?

266
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,820
You've grown up so much faster

267
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,940
than I thought you would

268
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,060
that you've become such a leader.

269
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,770
You're right.

270
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,850
What I have

271
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,700
is the blood of the Zhuang family's generals.

272
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,580
Only after I've fought

273
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,610
and killed

274
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,850
have I realized how many men

275
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,420
need to be sacrificed for a victory.

276
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,370
What about you?

277
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,340
What have you been through?

278
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,940
I was thrown into prison by Zhao Bingwen and about to be executed,

279
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,220
but luckily, I escaped death

280
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,460
and came to Dongxia.

281
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,220
Mr. Zhao has no grudge against you,

282
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,530
but why did he do this to you?

283
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,300
Because he

284
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,180
is my third enemy.

285
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,340
I didn't realize

286
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,220
my father lied to me.

287
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,340
Zhao Bingwen killed Shi Yiping,

288
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,060
became Chief Secretary,

289
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,770
framed the Emperor,

290
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,890
and planted the evidence on me.

291
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,580
Since then,

292
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,980
he has taken over the power.

293
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,810
He's got the Gui Seal

294
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,050
from the Emperor,

295
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,980
so no one else in the court can stand up to him.

296
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,810
The court is so far away from me,

297
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,220
and I'm at the border,

298
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,290
so why are we talking about this?

299
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,570
Zang Hai.

300
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,530
It's hard for us to meet again.

301
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,490
Let's drink some today.

302
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,730
Antu is still waiting for me in the tent,

303
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,420
and I'm feeling a bit tired.

304
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,700
You're busy in the army,

305
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,900
so rest early.

306
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,770
Tomorrow morning,

307
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,140
I will come to you.

308
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,050
OK.

309
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,140
I've asked someone to send some food over.

310
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,530
Go back and eat.

311
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,010
You don't have to rush.

312
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,810
We have plenty of time.

313
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,860
What did you talk about?

314
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,570
Why do you have such a ghastly face?

315
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,180
I expected Huang Zhixing

316
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,180
to grow up quickly in the barracks

317
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,010
but not

318
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,530
that in just one year's time,

319
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,900
he'd become the General

320
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,860
of Exemplary Fortitude.

321
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,770
I told him

322
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,010
about Zhao Bingwen's true colors,

323
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,940
but he didn't do anything about it,

324
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,570
so I'm afraid

325
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,980
that Zhuang Zhixing

326
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,250
has been secretly colluding with Zhao Bingwen.

327
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,530
It seems

328
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,810
that Zhao Bingwen's action

329
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,770
started earlier than I thought.

330
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,810
Would he have other plans

331
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,250
to save us this time?

332
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,180
I don't think so.

333
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,140
Otherwise, how could we have the chance

334
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,770
to talk like this?

335
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,770
However, Huang Zhixing

336
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,660
could pass the news about us to Zhao Bingwen

337
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,620
at any time,

338
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,810
so we will be in danger

339
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,770
sooner or later if we stay here.

340
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,940
I just heard

341
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,460
the soldiers outside talking.

342
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,940
They're going around

343
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,490
commandeering laborers from Dongxia

344
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,980
and even forcibly arresting them

345
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,770
to repair the Fengshan Altar.

346
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,660
Fengshan Altar

347
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,010
has been collapsed for years,

348
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,730
so why are they

349
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,770
rebuilding it now?

350
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,460
Zhao Bingwen

351
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,250
would never do this

352
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,010
for no reason.

353
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,660
It must have something to do with Gui Seal.

354
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,730
We have to stop him.

355
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,220
Now Zhao Bingwen has the Gui Seal

356
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,570
and is in charge of the court

357
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,980
with the help of Zhuang Zhixing.

358
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,530
What should we do?

359
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,700
For now,

360
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,250
we must find a way

361
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,330
to destroy the Gui Seal.

362
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,700
The Gui Seal was taken

363
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,460
by my father from the bowels of Fengshan Altar.

364
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,330
I've asked around royal court

365
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,420
about the Gui Seal

366
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,010
and even asked my sister,

367
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,490
but she knew nothing.

368
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,900
My mother died in the Great Yong,

369
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,180
so she didn't get to tell my sister much

370
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,570
about the Gui Seal,

371
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,250
but I had a matron with me

372
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,220
who had followed my mother

373
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,180
for many years.

374
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,330
She told me a legend

375
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,180
about Gui Seal.

376
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,730
It is rumored that there is another world

377
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,220
beneath the earth of Dongxia.

378
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,770
There is a dome-like sky there,

379
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,810
but that sky

380
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,810
is different from the blue sky we see.

381
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,940
It was a turquoise river of stars,

382
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,620
which

383
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,770
was the world of ghost soldiers.

384
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,530
Zang Hai.

385
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,050
There is one thing I forgot to tell you.

386
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,530
You are new here

387
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,460
and not easy to move around,

388
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,250
so I asked Zhan Hao to protect you.

389
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,490
You can ask him

390
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,460
if you need anything from me.

391
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,460
Thank you, General.

392
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,700
Take good care of him

393
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,980
and Miss Xiang.

394
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:55,860
Yes.

395
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,900
Mr. Zang.

396
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,420
I'll be right outside.

397
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,940
If there's anything, ask me anytime.

398
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,730
Does Zhuang Zhixing

399
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,770
know about this?

400
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,940
Don't tell him.

401
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,140
Keep your voice down.

402
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,180
Listen to me.

403
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,530
Let's go.

404
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,420
Where are you going?

405
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,770
It's not easy for us to see each other,

406
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,050
so how can you leave

407
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,220
without saying goodbye?

408
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,290
I asked Antu to write to you

409
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,570
so that I could destroy the Gui Seal

410
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,940
with your help

411
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,900
after I left Dongxiaroyal court,

412
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,330
but I didn't realize

413
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,420
you'd defected to Zhao Bingwen.

414
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,220
So what?

415
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,050
No matter what kind of man he is,

416
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,460
all I know is

417
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,420
that he can give me what I want.

418
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,220
His order for you to rebuild the Fengshan Altar

419
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,180
is just a cover.

420
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,420
His real goal

421
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,490
is to bring the Dongxia laborers

422
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,570
together

423
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,290
and turn them

424
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,250
into ghost soldiers with the Gui Seal.

425
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,090
Do you really want to join him?

426
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,330
I'll judge by myself

427
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,330
if what he's trying to do

428
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,380
is right or wrong.

429
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,810
Then judge

430
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,900
this matter seriously.

431
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,660
You only know

432
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,090
that he's the murderer of my family

433
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,570
and the third enemy

434
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,570
I've been searching for

435
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,980
but not the other side of him.

436
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,620
Zhao Bingwen

437
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,420
was my benefactor

438
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,860
and the one who rescued me

439
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,140
after my family was killed.

440
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,810
After he trained me for ten years,

441
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,730
the first thing he did

442
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,010
was ask me

443
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,570
to go to your father.

444
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,490
He was helping you get revenge?

445
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,090
Zhao Bingwen

446
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,140
was a close friend of Zhuang Luyin

447
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,660
and Cao Jingxian for decades

448
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,530
yet trained me for the Gui Seal

449
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,620
in order to take revenge on these two.

450
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,250
After getting the Gui Seal,

451
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,180
he tried to silence me,

452
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,980
not even letting Master Gao Ming,

453
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,730
who had followed him

454
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,490
for years, go.

455
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,010
You're still useful to him now,

456
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,980
but once you're no longer valuable,

457
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,090
he won't hesitate

458
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,050
to throw you away.

459
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,140
Anyone who has merit will be gotten rid of by him.

460
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,770
When you walk up to him,

461
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,180
you'll be the first one

462
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,570
he suspects

463
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,460
and wants

464
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,730
to silence.

465
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,660
Is that all you wanted to tell me?

466
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,620
I promised to help you

467
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,860
regain the recognition of the Marquis of Pingjin

468
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,770
and become the glory

469
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,490
of the Zhuang family one day,

470
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,420
but I did not expect you

471
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,900
to follow the exact same path

472
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,980
as your father.

473
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,140
Zang Hai.

474
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,620
I have allied myself with you

475
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,250
and considered you a teacher.

476
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,530
Now I

477
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,700
can give you a new name

478
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,980
and a new identity

479
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,090
to hide the fact that you are still alive.

480
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,700
Will you

481
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,730
follow me as you followed

482
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,700
my father?

483
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,420
What I will do now

484
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,940
is destroy the Gui Seal.

485
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,570
What to do now?

486
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,620
Wait.

487
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,180
Okay.

488
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,050
Then let's destroy the Gui Seal.

489
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,050
Let's go.

490
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,530
We've been searching

491
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,380
for so many days

492
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,940
but still haven't found any sign

493
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,140
of the entrance.

494
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,570
Even if Zhuang Zhixing

495
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,980
had told me the location of Fengshan Altar,

496
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,660
the path that my father

497
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,770
had entered back then

498
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,460
no longer existed,

499
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,420
so we could only think of another way,

500
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:15,940
but

501
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,460
since that was the place where the Gui Seal was sealed,

502
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,220
it was bound to follow

503
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,810
certain laws of feng shui and geomancy.

504
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,090
However, Mount Dansui

505
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,290
stretches on forever.

506
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,180
If it could be found easily,

507
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,660
it wouldn't have remained a secret.

508
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,050
If even you can't do anything about it,

509
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,250
then we really can't find it.

510
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,620
The legend you told me about

511
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,380
also mentioned

512
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,770
that the Mount Dansui vein

513
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,620
is where many of Dongxia's rivers

514
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,420
originate,

515
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,250
so perhaps we can look for it

516
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,860
by looking in the direction where the rivers converge.

517
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,330
That way, maybe we'll get a clue.

518
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,530
I've looked through the geography record of Dongxia.

519
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,090
It

520
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,490
used to be a big and deep river,

521
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,660
but now,

522
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,810
it's a creek.

523
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,090
Back then, the collapse of Fengshan Altar

524
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,330
must have done some damage to the mountain,

525
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,220
which caused such a change.

526
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,940
The water of these rivers

527
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,290
probably flowed through some crevice

528
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,420
into one

529
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,220
of the underground caves,

530
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,380
so

531
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,730
if we find

532
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,980
where the water disappeared,

533
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,490
we might be able

534
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,180
to find a way in.

535
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,460
There's no way in.

536
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,090
Could the entrance be here?

537
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,250
The turquoise river of stars

538
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,330
is the world of ghost soldiers.

539
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,420
This sanctuary

540
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,490
was probably

541
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,770
built by the order of Minglv Huda,

542
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,530
the ninth queen of Dongxia.

543
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,570
She was my maternal grandmother,

544
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,530
yet I never met her.

545
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,420
Dongxia relied on Gui Seal

546
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,770
to defeat enemies stronger than them.

547
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,620
In the end,

548
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,660
the Gui Seal disappeared,

549
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,940
and we lost to Zhuang Luyin.

550
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,530
Legend has it

551
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,380
that Queen Minglv Huda

552
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,220
sacrificed her life

553
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,380
and used the Gui Seal to bring forth ghost soldiers.

554
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:09,980
Do you think

555
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,250
ghost soldiers really exist?

556
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,940
I don't believe there are ghosts

557
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,380
in this world.

558
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,660
Legends about ghosts

559
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,250
are just a way for people

560
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,290
to express their anger at the injustices of the world

561
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,050
and their desire for the right results of being good or evil,

562
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,090
but I don't understand

563
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,050
what ghost soldiers are

564
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,090
and how they were summoned

565
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,980
by the Gui Seal.

566
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,010
Zang Hai.

567
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,730
Someone did come here.

568
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,940
It must have been my father.

569
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,980
Now, it is us who have come here,

570
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,250
where it all began.

571
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,220
Now that I've made

572
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,140
the same choice

573
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,010
as my father,

574
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,380
it's time

575
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,050
to finish

576
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,940
what he didn't.

577
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,860
What are those?

578
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,490
Zang Hai.

579
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,770
Those are...

580
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,250
Watch out.

581
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,210
Antu.

582
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,300
Look at that.

583
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,940
This is Dongxia's uniform.

584
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,380
That's right.

585
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,650
They're Dongxia's soldiers.

586
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,300
Why are they here?

587
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,690
Did they go through something

588
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,900
before they died?

589
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,780
Maybe the truth

590
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:46,860
is out there.

591
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,420
Light the lamp.

592
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,050
Zang Hai.

593
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,460
Someone died here.

594
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,740
Who could he be?

595
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,940
[Ghost soldiers have fallen from the sky]

596
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,210
What is written in this booklet

597
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,380
seems to be what happened in that year.

598
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,770
In the 35th year of Wuhe,

599
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,950
the Great Yong's army crushed Dongxia.

600
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,300
Dongxia's army was defeated

601
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,720
and lost many of its strongholds.

602
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,530
The capital city was about to fall.

603
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,900
At the time when Queen Minglv Huda

604
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,090
was in danger and at a loss,

605
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,800
a strategist named Zhang Mie

606
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,640
advised her

607
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,340
that she might follow the example

608
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,460
of the first Queen

609
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,340
of Dongxia

610
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,610
and use the Gui Seal

611
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,480
to repel the enemy army.

612
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,740
At this point, Dongxia was at the end of its rope.

613
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,760
After much hesitation,

614
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,680
the Queen sent Zhang Mie to enter Mount Dansui.

615
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,770
Zhang Mie, who was well versed in geomancy,

616
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,420
successfully took out the Gui Seal

617
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,450
from the relics

618
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,490
left behind by the Queen of Fuxian.

619
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,800
This was the battle

620
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,090
that decided the survival of Dongxia.

621
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,130
The Queen

622
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,650
summoned 30,000 soldiers to the front line

623
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,000
and held a sacrificial ceremony

624
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,220
in front of the army.

625
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,030
As she gave wine, she told the crowd

626
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,570
that she had prayed to the heavens

627
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,810
to give them the ghost soldiers for vengeance.

628
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,350
On the battlefield,

629
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,370
the soldiers beat their drums and shouted,

630
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,960
“Ghost soldiers will come. The Great Yong will be defeated.”

631
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,200
But the ghost soldiers did not come.

632
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,350
It turned out

633
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,800
that the Gui Seal

634
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,320
contained a kind of poison

635
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,660
that was rare in the world.

636
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,820
Zhang Mie soaked the Gui Seal

637
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,890
with his own blood

638
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,440
and poured the poison from the Gui Seal

639
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,240
into the wine.

640
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,540
The soldiers who drank the poisoned wine

641
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,510
realized that they

642
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,780
could no longer feel pain

643
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,850
and that their wounds would continue to heal.

644
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,100
The army was invincible

645
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,090
and won every battle

646
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,060
after that.

647
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,010
Swifter than the beacons

648
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:28,710
were the rumors.

649
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,740
Everyone believed

650
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,880
that these soldiers, who didn't need

651
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,440
to be fed or bandaged,

652
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,490
were ghost soldiers who fell from the sky.

653
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,120
Dongxia's army continued to move south

654
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,340
and captured several cities of the Great Yong.

655
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,840
They were about to capture Dancheng,

656
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,680
which

657
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,360
was an important gateway to the Capital region.

658
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,690
Once it was captured,

659
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,400
Dongxia would be able to rush

660
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,380
right into the Capital,

661
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,680
but Queen Minglv Huda realized

662
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,630
that the soldiers who had been turned into ghost soldiers

663
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,940
would gradually become delirious

664
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,420
and unable to distinguish between enemies and friends.

665
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,560
They could only kill brutally.

666
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,330
As a descendant of Saint Mother Xiling,

667
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,850
in order to stop them

668
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,010
from wreaking more havoc,

669
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,470
the Queen used her royal blood

670
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,850
to cure Gui Seal's poison.

671
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,560
After exhausting her life,

672
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,370
she finally stopped Gui Seal.

673
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,760
From Dongxia came the sad news

674
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,330
of the Queen's death,

675
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,200
and the army fell with her.

676
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,640
Before her death,

677
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,640
the Queen left her will

678
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,760
and ordered Zhang Mie to build a sacred place

679
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,640
to seal the Gui Seal

680
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,200
and ghost soldiers forever.

681
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,620
No one would ever be able to open it.

682
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:52,440
So

683
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,630
this is the truth about ghost soldiers.

684
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,840
Dongxia's royal blood

685
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,750
was not used to open the Gui Seal

686
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,040
but to stop it.

687
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,750
This booklet proves that.

688
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,360
There's movement over there.

689
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,270
How can...

690
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,310
Be careful.

691
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,400
There's no wind when they swing the sword.

692
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,110
Antu.

693
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,110
It's all an illusion.

694
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,080
These ghost soldiers are fake.

695
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,000
So what we just saw was...

696
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,840
The murals here are brightly colored

697
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,360
and have a special smell.

698
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,000
Maybe Zhang Mie

699
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,440
added something to the paint

700
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,040
to prevent the Gui Seal from being taken

701
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,480
and make us hallucinate.

702
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,590
We can't stay here any longer.

703
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,520
Let's go now.

704
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,190
Let's go.

705
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,000
What did you find here?

706
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,310
Is it something to do with the Gui Seal?

707
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,920
Have you been following us?

708
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,150
Do you really think

709
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,360
I'll let you guys go

710
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,310
and stop it?

711
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,040
I can tell you

712
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:38,880
everything.

713
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,400
There's something you've been misunderstanding.

714
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,440
I'm not like my father.

715
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,950
I'm not the least bit interested

716
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,130
in the Gui Seal.

717
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,910
Tell Mr. Zhao

718
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,760
