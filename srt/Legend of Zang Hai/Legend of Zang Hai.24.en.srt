00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,030
Cheers, Mr. Zang.

7
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,550
Today is

8
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,130
[Longevity]
my birthday.

9
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,170
Thank you all for coming to celebrate.

10
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,890
Let me toast you all.

11
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,690
- Marquis, - Marquis,

12
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,450
- wishing you joy - wishing you joy

13
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,340
- year after year! - year after year!

14
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,540
Please, everyone, be seated.

15
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,450
Why the long face, Marquis?

16
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,610
Isn't today a joyous occasion?

17
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,690
You may not have heard, Mr. Qi.

18
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,940
Word is, the young master was taken by Mr. Cao to the Surveillance Office.

19
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,660
He's always been upright and decent.

20
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,340
I never thought something like this could happen.

21
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,540
Of course I believe Zhifu is innocent.

22
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,850
But the longer he's held by Cao Jingxian,

23
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,570
the more I worry.

24
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,850
That place,

25
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,290
even the innocent are forced to confess.

26
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,290
Marquis, you should report this to the court.

27
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,380
Your family has served the throne

28
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,780
and the nation for generations.

29
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,060
His Majesty won't turn a blind eye.

30
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,610
But now Cao Jingxian wields power in the Emperor's name.

31
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,820
Even our petitions land in his hands.

32
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,690
Should I go straight to the palace and plead in person?

33
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,130
All of you here watched Zhifu grow up.

34
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,010
Now that he's in trouble,

35
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,980
surely you won't sit back and do nothing?

36
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,010
Of course not.

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,610
Your troubles are ours too.

38
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,730
Marquis,

39
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,520
if you ask me,

40
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,220
this might all be a misunderstanding.

41
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,490
Why not talk to Mr. Cao directly

42
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,900
and clear things up?

43
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,540
That's naive, Mr, Lv.

44
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,050
Mr. Cao's been arrogant for a long time.

45
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,610
He's never cared about the Marquis's dignity.

46
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,850
Backing down now will only embolden him.

47
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,580
And Zhifu is a Vice Minister of Works.

48
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,900
Cao is detaining a court official without cause.

49
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,980
That's already a crime.

50
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,610
Why should the Marquis lower himself

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,900
and beg a eunuch for mercy?

52
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,460
No, I didn't mean that!

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,580
Plenty have already bowed to Cao Jingxian.

54
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,850
If I remember right,

55
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,490
didn't Mr. Lv offend Mr. Cao once too?

56
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,220
Have you regained the title you lost?

57
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,730
Mr. Lv, you used to be a Vice Minister, right?

58
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,540
How much silver did you send to beg forgiveness?

59
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,540
Yet you were still demoted.

60
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,290
Already forgotten?

61
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,220
All of you sitting here,

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,020
how much have you suffered under Cao Jingxian?

63
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,370
How many times has the Surveillance Office wronged you?

64
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,410
Don't you

65
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,290
want to strike back?

66
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,850
Cao is a tyrant and a traitor!

67
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,610
Shall we let him

68
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,610
ruin our Great Yong?

69
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,730
I will never stand with such a villain!

70
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,340
Nor will I!

71
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,380
Say the word, Marquis. What do you need us to do?

72
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,340
Good!

73
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,460
Zhuang Shan.

74
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,780
Here.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,810
At tomorrow's morning court,

76
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,900
I will present a formal impeachment to His Majesty.

77
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,980
Gentlemen, it's time we stand for Great Yong.

78
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,780
Join me in exposing Cao Jingxian!

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,250
I've already signed my name.

80
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,340
Everyone,

81
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,700
your turns.

82
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,220
I'm the Deputy Censor-in-Chief of the Censorate.

83
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,980
I'll go first!

84
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:20,930
Count me in too!

85
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,050
Mr. Lv.

86
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,370
Mr. Lv.

87
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,900
Your turn.

88
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,620
[Qi Ming, Xu Daishan]

89
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,490
Such a grand banquet, Marquis.

90
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,460
Why wasn't I invited?

91
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,490
Am I not worthy?

92
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,370
Mr. Cao? What brings you here?

93
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,780
I came to wish you a happy birthday.

94
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,930
I searched the land

95
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,980
and found this legendary ancient blade.

96
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,700
Even after a thousand years, it's still razor-sharp.

97
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,290
No beast can withstand it.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,490
You may not consider me a friend,

99
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,850
but I've always cared about you.

100
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,490
We went through a lot together back then.

101
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,490
Thank you, Mr. Cao.

102
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,020
Please, sit.

103
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,930
Let's have a drink.

104
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,850
Then I'll find myself a seat.

105
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,250
This banquet of yours

106
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,460
isn't just for your birthday, is it?

107
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,530
Am I right, Mr. Lv?

108
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,890
So you've been building your own faction

109
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,490
to impeach me?

110
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,460
Such nasty things written between the lines...

111
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,130
I've been so wrongly accused!

112
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,420
So, are you all here to impeach me too?

113
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,890
It's getting late.

114
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,370
I just remembered

115
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,530
my elderly mother is home alone.

116
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,850
So I'll take my leave now.

117
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,730
Marquis.

118
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,420
Mr. Cao.

119
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,580
I have pressing matters too. I'll take my leave.

120
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,580
- I'll take my leave. - Farewell.

121
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,300
Excuse me.

122
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,340
Let's see who dares walk out!

123
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,940
Cao Jingxian, not only did you detain my son,

124
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,370
now you show up uninvited and cause a scene!

125
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,100
What exactly are you after?

126
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,250
I come tonight to return him to you.

127
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,820
Bring him in!

128
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,650
They beat him this badly?

129
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,730
Zhifu!

130
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,340
Zhifu!

131
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,700
What did you do to him?

132
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,340
Guards!

133
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,180
I had both his knees carved out.

134
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,610
Zhuang Zhifu embezzled state funds for years.

135
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,010
The Emperor was furious and ordered a full investigation.

136
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,890
He wouldn't talk, so I had to use force.

137
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,530
And plenty came to light.

138
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,460
These are all signed confessions,

139
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,850
in black and white, clear as day.

140
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,370
And that's not even the whole story.

141
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,770
Zhifu...

142
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,770
I watched you rise

143
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,180
through the Ministry of Works.

144
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,820
You don't have the guts to steal that much.

145
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,060
So tell me,

146
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,980
was it your father pulling the strings?

147
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,060
Is he building an army?

148
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,940
Forging weapons and armor?

149
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,010
Enough!

150
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,300
Zhuang Luyin, kneel and confess,

151
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,420
and your son will be spared.

152
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,460
Father, please save me!

153
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,820
Dear...

154
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,010
Surround them!

155
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,070
You've harmed a government official

156
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,660
and now you dare frame me?

157
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,770
I'll arrest you myself and take you to the Emperor!

158
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,730
Marquis of Pingjin!

159
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,700
You...

160
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,530
you actually dared to stab me!

161
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,530
Guards! Help!

162
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,580
The Marquis of Pingjin is trying to kill me!

163
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,460
Murder!

164
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,890
Zhuang Luyin is trying to kill me!

165
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,610
The Marquis of Pingjin is trying to kill me!

166
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,940
Help!

167
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,770
Murder!

168
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,940
Murder!

169
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,100
Murder!

170
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,130
The Marquis is trying to murder me!

171
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,820
Zhifu...

172
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,530
You've suffered so much.

173
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,700
How did it come to this?

174
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,180
Zhuang Luyin

175
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,340
plotted rebellion,

176
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,180
and I caught him red-handed.

177
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,460
He tried to silence us with murder!

178
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,580
Every official here saw it happen!

179
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,340
By tomorrow, the whole Capital will know.

180
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,980
And the Emperor will hear too.

181
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,890
Zhuang Luyin,

182
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,180
how will you explain this to His Majesty?

183
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,820
Cao Jingxian, you filthy rat!

184
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,370
Marquis,

185
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,060
there may still be room to fix this.

186
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,610
Whether your son embezzled,

187
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,490
or you've raised a private army,

188
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,060
that's for the Surveillance Office to say.

189
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,220
It all depends on whether you want this settled peacefully.

190
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,060
Hand over the Gui Seal.

191
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,530
As for tonight's events,

192
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,530
I can smooth them over

193
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,890
before the Emperor.

194
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,100
We'll call it a misunderstanding.

195
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,730
The Gui Seal?

196
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,250
Why would I have the Gui Seal?

197
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,370
Zhuang Luyin,

198
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,770
don't play dumb with me.

199
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,890
You've been after the Gui Seal all along.

200
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,850
Weren't you searching too?

201
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,610
One last time,

202
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,610
will you hand it over or not?

203
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,220
Even if I have it,

204
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,220
a eunuch like you will never get it!

205
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,010
Guards!

206
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,100
Search the place!

207
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,340
Turn it upside down!

208
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,180
Anyone who resists, kill them!

209
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,940
Let's see if you've got what it takes!

210
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,580
Search!

211
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,420
Lu Yan has gone ahead.

212
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,730
Keep the Marquis occupied.

213
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,700
Who's there?

214
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,980
Mr. Cao sent me to help Your Highness.

215
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,420
I have to clean even such mess up?

216
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,850
You clearly couldn't come yourself.

217
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,700
Why did you promise her, then?

218
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,730
That terrifying woman's on her way.

219
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,370
How am I supposed to explain this?

220
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,460
Can I hold her off?

221
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,490
I'll be lucky if she doesn't beat me up.

222
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,820
Mr. Zang.

223
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,050
Who... who are you?

224
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,860
Who are you?

225
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,490
Your Highness, this way.

226
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,730
What are you looking for?

227
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,330
Don't make a move.

228
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,460
That's not water on the floor.

229
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,460
It's oil.

230
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,810
They say Dongxia's hostage hasn't left the palace for years.

231
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,980
And now here you are, in the Marquis's cellar.

232
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,420
You must be after something important.

233
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,490
Ever since the previous Queen of Dongxia passed away,

234
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,860
your kingdom lost a precious heirloom,

235
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,570
the Gui Seal.

236
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,530
Ten years ago,

237
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,660
the Imperial Astronomer Kuai Duo

238
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,490
brought the Gui Seal back to Yong.

239
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,660
You knew he had it,

240
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,250
so you joined forces with Cao Jingxian and Zhuang Luyin

241
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,420
to wipe out his entire family.

242
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,810
But the seal

243
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,900
still vanished without a trace.

244
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,730
All these years,

245
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,700
you've never stopped searching for it.

246
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,460
Am I wrong?

247
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,570
But you were tricked.

248
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,660
There's no Gui Seal here.

249
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,770
Zhuang Luyin never had it.

250
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,810
All of this

251
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,730
was a trap I set to draw you out.

252
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,940
You're already infected with my arrow's toxin.

253
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,530
Don't move another inch.

254
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,770
Or this arrow

255
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,290
will go straight through your skull.

256
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,770
Why...

257
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,380
why is it you?

258
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,250
Zang Hai,

259
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,770
you shouldn't have come here today.

260
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,290
So...

261
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,900
you're the hostage.

262
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,010
The one I've been searching for

263
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,620
was by my side all along?

264
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,250
What are you talking about?

265
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,860
You came to Yong

266
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,770
as a political hostage,

267
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,180
but you've been looking for the Gui Seal, haven't you?

268
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,420
The Gui Seal is Dongxia's greatest treasure.

269
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,050
Of course I must reclaim it.

270
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,900
So you and Cao Jingxian made a deal

271
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,290
to find it together,

272
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,250
isn't that right?

273
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,530
Yes, I had a deal with him.

274
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,090
But what does that have to do with you?

275
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,090
Haven't you always wanted to know

276
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,810
what secret I've been hiding?

277
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,660
Well, here it is.

278
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,140
I carry the blood debt of the Kuai family.

279
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,380
Because I am Kuai Duo's son!

280
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,460
Kuai Duo...

281
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,490
You hid behind Cao Jingxian and Zhuang Luyin,

282
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,380
joined them in destroying my family.

283
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,730
You never thought I'd survive, did you?

284
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,730
Zang Hai,

285
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,570
it's not what you think...

286
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,180
You...

287
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,770
Xiang Antu,

288
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,010
do you know what this is?

289
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,770
Beneath that robe

290
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,140
is the flayed skin of my parents.

291
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,180
After they were killed,

292
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,140
they weren't even given whole bodies.

293
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,900
I swore before their remains,

294
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,660
I'd kill their murderers

295
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,810
and avenge them.

296
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,220
She won't be waking up any time soon.

297
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,570
Use the chaos and slip out the back.

298
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,620
Why... why is it her?

299
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,660
She's the hostage.

300
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,290
Stick to the plan. Move!

301
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,730
Princess!

302
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,700
Hurry!

303
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,770
Zhuang Luyin!

304
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,330
Zhuang Luyin, what do you think?

305
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,250
This scene

306
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,090
looks familiar, doesn't it?

307
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,420
If you don't hand it over,

308
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,010
I'll kill them one by one!

309
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,730
Dear,

310
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,660
just give him what he wants!

311
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,810
So it all comes full circle.

312
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,620
Now I see.

313
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,250
Zhuang Luyin, you really are heartless.

314
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,730
Then I'll take my time and make them suffer,

315
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,420
piece by piece.

316
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,490
No!

317
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,250
You think a eunuch like you deserves the Gui Seal?

318
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:04,900
Dream on!

319
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,570
Zhan Hao, Xiang Hong!

320
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,050
You're in charge here. Go!

321
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,220
Father, forgive me for being late!

322
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,730
Good son!

323
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,620
Take the madam away!

324
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,810
Zhixing!

325
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,090
Were is the Gui Seal?

326
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,900
The hostage broke our deal. We didn't get it.

327
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,050
Retreat!

328
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,980
Fall back!

329
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,660
Father, I'm all right.

330
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,700
Get the doctor!

331
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,490
Hurry, get the doctor!

332
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,250
My Lord.

333
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,660
My Lord.

334
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,380
The Second Young Master's bleeding has stopped.

335
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,290
The doctor says the wound missed any vital spots.

336
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,140
You're hurt too.

337
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,570
It's nothing.

338
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,980
My Lord.

339
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,860
We've cleared most of the mess.

340
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,490
As for what happened last night,

341
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,860
make sure

342
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,140
every mouth stays shut.

343
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,900
Understood.

344
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,490
Come here.

345
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,940
Do you know why Cao Jingxian came with soldiers?

346
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,730
That whole show in front of the others

347
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,000
wasn't just because he knew

348
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,220
you planned to impeach him.

349
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,530
Last night, the Imperial guards clashed with ours in the front courtyard.

350
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,620
And in the treasury,

351
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,770
they even left some corpses behind.

352
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,380
There was a fire downstairs too!

353
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,050
This is bad, My Lord,

354
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,490
your bronze fish...

355
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:52,660
Don't panic.

356
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,690
I'm not that easy to trick.

357
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,380
But that eunuch

358
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,010
wasn't here for the bronze fish.

359
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,900
He came for the Gui Seal.

360
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:25,940
The Gui Seal?

361
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,420
He's certain the Gui Seal is hidden here.

362
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,010
My Lord,

363
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,780
it just occurred to me.

364
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,980
What if the Eldest Young Master learned

365
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,780
about the seal and the bronze fish

366
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,820
and spilled everything under pressure?

367
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,650
I never mentioned any of that to Zhifu.

368
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,170
How would he know?

369
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,690
Forgive me, My Lord.

370
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,340
But he started visiting me more often lately.

371
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,260
After his last visit to my home,

372
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,690
some sketches and notes related to the Gui Seal

373
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,530
went missing.

374
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,130
What?

375
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,460
It involves the Young Master.

376
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,650
I didn't dare jump to conclusions.

377
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,780
But what happened yesterday was so strange.

378
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,820
Looking back, something feels off.

379
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,900
Why did he suddenly get so close to me?

380
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,090
And...

381
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,690
what does he want with those sketches?

382
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,530
You and I both know

383
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,980
the Gui Seal isn't here.

384
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,010
So why won't Cao Jingxian believe it?

385
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,900
Get up.

386
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,050
Tell me,

387
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,780
why would Zhifu betray me

388
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,610
while Zhixing rushed back from the military

389
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,380
to save us at the brink?

390
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,300
All of this,

391
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,460
weren't you pulling strings

392
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:03,900
behind the scenes?

393
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,530
My Lord,

394
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,490
the Second Young Master was badly hurt yesterday.

395
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,900
The blade nearly struck his heart.

396
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,170
He risked his life to come save you.

397
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,130
That wasn't something I could control.

398
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,300
Zhixing keeps rising

399
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,610
while Zhifu's become useless.

400
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,260
Isn't that what you wanted?

401
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,170
My Lord,

402
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,530
Zhixing is your son too.

403
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,130
He's the future of this household.

404
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,380
As for why Mr. Zhifu was in Cao Jingxian's hands.

405
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,090
I honestly don't know.

406
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,650
Things between me and Cao have gone too far.

407
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,610
The Emperor must be aware by now.

408
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,530
The most urgent matter

409
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,780
is how to explain this to His Majesty.

410
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,460
He surely doesn't want this brought up.

411
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,690
And Cao Jingxian

412
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,210
won't tell the truth either.

413
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,820
He'll be hard to deal with.

414
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,940
Do you think

415
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,900
the Emperor

416
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,940
still believes me

417
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,690
or only him?

418
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,340
Zhifu signed a confession to Cao Jingxian.

419
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,820
It's hard to clear his name now.

420
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,490
Given the situation,

421
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,050
I think

422
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,780
your best option is to take the blame yourself,

423
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,420
plead guilty to protect yourself.

424
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,340
My Lord,

425
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,690
you also need to show

426
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,490
honest regret to the Emperor.

427
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,860
Only then will His Majesty be reassured.

428
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,690
You're right.

429
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,260
I need to ease His Majesty's doubts.

430
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,130
Hurry! Faster!

431
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,940
Zhifu...

432
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,380
Zhifu...

433
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,090
Zhifu, don't scare me like this!

434
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:13,940
What's wrong?

435
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,260
My Lord.

436
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,130
Dear...

437
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,780
I'm going to kill him!

438
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:18,780
Look at Zhifu...

439
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,420
I'm going to kill him!

440
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,340
I'll kill him...

441
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,860
Doctor!

442
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,530
Here, My Lord.

443
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,490
What's happening?

444
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:29,780
Speak up!

445
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:31,940
My Lord,

446
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,530
the Young Master's wound was too large.

447
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,570
It festered and caused a fever.

448
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,210
After last night's shock, his fever hasn't broken.

449
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,210
So, his mind's not clear anymore.

450
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,780
Say that again!

451
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,780
Father...

452
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,650
Father...

453
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,740
Father...

454
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,050
Dear...

455
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,340
Father...

456
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,610
Please save him!

457
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,090
Father, save me...

458
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,570
Save me...

459
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,010
Can he still be cured?

460
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,130
No matter what,

461
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,340
you must keep him alive!

462
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,900
Yes, My Lord!

463
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,260
Father...

464
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,610
Father...

465
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,740
Father...

466
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,090
Father...

467
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,610
Don't leave me, Father...

468
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,260
Zhifu...

469
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,980
- Father... - Zhifu!

470
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,940
Don't leave me,

471
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,570
Father...

472
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,380
My dear...

473
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,460
I'm here!

474
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,740
I am here with you!

475
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,340
My dear...

476
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,010
It hurts...

477
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,780
Mother...

478
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,610
What do we do now?

479
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,380
Father...

480
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,690
You're wounded. Lie down.

481
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,130
Zhixing...

482
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,780
The weight of the Zhuang family

483
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,650
will now fall to you.

484
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,090
How can I be worthy of that?

485
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,010
Yesterday,

486
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,300
you saved the entire family.

487
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,210
You're not just a good son,

488
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,820
you'll make a great general one day.

489
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,420
Father...

490
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,490
there's something I need to ask you.

491
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,900
Last night,

492
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,740
why did Cao Jingxian

493
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,740
suddenly attack you?

494
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,300
Don't ask.

495
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,420
One day,

496
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,690
I'll tell you everything.

497
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,650
