1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:16,050



2
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,860
   

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,350
Thinking about Zang Hai?

5
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,440
Forgive me, sir.

6
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,840
For this day, 
    

7
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,660
you should've been ready long ago.

8
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,490
Sir...

9
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,200
is this really how it ends?

10
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,310
I gave him a choice.

11
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,750
This is what he chose.

12
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,120
You're right, sir.

13
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,500
I failed to see it clearly.

14
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,800
Can you give him some dignity?

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
Don't worry.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,500
I'll keep his body intact.

17
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,710
Do you want to see him again?

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,780
At this point...

19
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,280
there's nothing left to say.

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,980
He likely doesn't want to see me either.

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,980
Sir...

22
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,260
I'd like to cook one last meal for Xiao Hai.

23
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,760
Let him eat before he goes.

24
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,710
Of course.

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,180
Time to eat.

26
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,944
   

27
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,830
It's time.

28
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,270
Any last words?

29
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,460
Proceed.

30
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,680
Mr. Zang, this method's called "Face Plastering."

31
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,270
We soak the mulberry paper in water,

32
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,390
then paste it layer by layer on your face.

33
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,040
That way, your corpse stays intact.

34
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,120
It must be done silently.

35
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,900
Sir, one more layer and he won't survive it.

36
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,240
Add two more!

37
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,960
Yes, sir.

38
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,240
Sir, he shows no pulse. Death confirmed.

39
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,360
Sir, Prince Yong Rong gathered the royals at his manor.

40
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,720
They're demanding to see you.

41
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,580
Even locked up, they won't quiet down.

42
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,630
Gao Ming.

43
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,270
Sir.

44
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,790
It's all done.

45
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,980
Take care of the body.

46
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,530
Thank you, sir.

47
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,040
Sir, I'm sorry.

48
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,000
Yuenu!

49
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,200
Who... Who are you?

50
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,180
I... I'm...

51
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,700
Yuenu! Come here!

52
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,270
Mother!

53
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,030
You scattered the wooden dragonfly again.

54
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,960
If you can't find it later, you'll be crying again.

55
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,270
Your father made this for you.

56
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,830
Keep it safe, all right?

57
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,990
Mother...

58
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,720
Mother!

59
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,630
Zhi... Zhinu?

60
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,220
Big Brother?

61
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,160
You're... Zhinu?

62
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,120
Is it really you?

63
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,240
Is it really Zhinu?

64
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,290
Good boy, don't cry.

65
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,360
But... why are you here?

66
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,970
Why...

67
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,080
Why are you here?

68
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,830
Mother, I missed you so much.

69
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,910
Big Brother, you've grown so tall.

70
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,100
I almost didn't recognize you.

71
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,240
You're really Zhinu?

72
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,730
I thought you'd never find your way home.

73
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,700
No!

74
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,150
You're not supposed to be here.

75
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,930
Who let you come back?

76
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,870
Go back!

77
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,840
- Don't ever come here! 
 - Mother, I'm not leaving.

78
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm not going anywhere. Mother!

79
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,360
- Listen to me! 
 - No!

80
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,550
Go back!

81
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,900
- Mother... 
 - Big Brother, you should go back!

82
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,660
Big Brother...

83
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,480
Zhinu...

84
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,130
Go back.

85
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,630
Let's go!

86
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,200
Let's go!

87
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,290
Why does everyone want me gone?

88
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,030
I don't want to go back!

89
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,450
I don't want to go back!

90
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,150
I don't want to go back...

91
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,770
I don't want to go back...

92
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,670
Zhinu.

93
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,080
Father!

94
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,030
Don't go any farther.

95
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,220
You don't belong here.

96
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,540
Father...

97
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,210
I want to go home.

98
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,790
No matter how hard or painful,

99
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,360
you have to keep going.

100
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,730
Your life is just beginning.

101
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,380
You'll come here one day,

102
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,280
but not today.

103
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,500
You're a great heir of the Kuai family.

104
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,690
Live and die with no shame before heaven and earth.

105
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,560
♫  The memories never stop, they keep recurring  ♫

106
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:59,180
♫  Fate is like a strong wine, burning through the intestines  ♫

107
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:06,800
♫  The light in the dark night, I want so much to collect it for you  ♫

108
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,880
♫  Fate plays a trick on me, how absurd it is  ♫

109
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,980
♫  I smile fearlessly, I sigh at the impermanence in life  ♫

110
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,060
♫  A human's heart is deep like the sea, this life is full of storms  ♫

111
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,350
I really wish

112
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,460
I could watch you grow up...

113
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:47,600

116
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:10,600
♫  It's hard to let go of love, it's hard to hide love  ♫

117

119
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,410
 Zang Hai! 

120
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,070
 - Zang Hai! 
 - Wake up! 

121
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,350
 - Mr. Zang. 
 - Mr. Zang. 

122
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,870
 - Xiao Hai! 
 - Mr. Zang! 

123
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,030
 - Mr. Zang! 
 - Xiao Hai! 

124
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,350
 - Physician... 
 - Mr. Zang, wake up! 

125
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,690
 Didn't you say he'd revive if treated in time? 

126
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,240
 Even though treating him with acupuncture, it still depends on fate. 

127
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,900
 I'll do everything I can. 

128
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,540
 I already needled the philtrum. 

129
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,580
 Now, I'll needle Neiguan and Yongquan. 

130
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,250
 Sir! 

131
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,960
Zang Hai!

132
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,800
Master Gao Ming!

133
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,920
Xiao Hai!

134
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,000
- You're awake! 
 - Xiao Hai!

135
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,380
- Thank goodness! 
 - Xiao Hai!

136
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,550
You're finally awake!

137
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,140
Zang Hai...

138
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,750
Zang Hai,

139
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,760
you owe your life to Master Gao Ming.

140
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,550
Miss Xiang had Miss Tong Er ask me

141
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,830
to help figure out a plan to save you.

142
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,830
But Mr. Zhao is so cautious and suspicious.

143
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,700
He had to see you die for real before anything could change.

144
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,290
Did you put something in the food...

145
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:06,370
that made me dizzy and weak all over?

146
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,270
I added a secret herb.

147
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:15,610
It helped you pass out in advance, with no pulse.

148
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,400
Pig liver with pork tripe,

149
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,790
pan-fried chicken, fish in vinegar sauce,

150
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,780
and grilled oysters.

151
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,910
The second I saw those dishes, I knew you had a plan.

152
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,590
I knew it.

153
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,200
You'd catch on when you saw those dishes.

154
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,140
If you were conscious during the execution,

155
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,540
you'd keep resisting until your final breath.

156
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,630
Only by doing this could we fool the executioners.

157
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,700
Thank you.

158
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,540
You should thank someone else, too.

159
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,860
If he hadn't distracted Mr. Zhao at the critical moment,

160
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,470
you might not have made it.

161
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,120
Mr. Zang.

162
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,600
Mr. Shen.

163
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,210
The Prince couldn't come in person.

164
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,750
He asked me to pass on a message.

165
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,920
Go ahead.

166
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,740
Before the Emperor passed away, he kept calling your name.

167
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,030
His Majesty also said you were right.

168
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,790
How's the Prince now?

169
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,640
No need to worry, Mr. Zang.

170
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,880
He's the Emperor's brother, after all.

171
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,100
Zhao Bingwen wouldn't dare act rashly.

172
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,690
It's not safe to linger here.

173
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,820
I must take my leave.

174
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,760
Take care, Mr. Zang.

175
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,520
You, too.

176
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,380
Sit.

177
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,940
Zang Hai, what's your next move?

178
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,270
I'm going to Dongxia.

179
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,680
Dongxia?

180
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,540
Zhao Bingwen told me he's taking the Gui Seal there

181
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,750
to raise an army of his own.

182
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,960
I have to stop him.

183
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,200
Then I'm going with you.

184
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,510
I can't let him get his way.

185
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,410
Besides, you've never been to Dongxia.

186
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,320
I know the place better.

187
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,070
But right now, aside from me and Xiao Hai, the rest are all wanted.

188
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,400
It won't be easy to get out of the capital.

189
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,210
Guan Feng, Shi Lei, Feng Liu, and Ying Qi will all stay behind.

190
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,920
I'll find my own way to meet up with you.

191
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,320
Master, we're taking Antu with us.

192
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,950
No time to waste. We'll leave as soon as we're ready.

193
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,930
Xiao Hai, once you're out of the city,

194
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,590
the carriage will take you to a safe spot.

195
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,960
There's a merchant convoy heading to Dongxia.

196
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,440
You can leave Great Yong with them.

197
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,790
Once you get to Dongxia,

198
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,190
Miss Xiang will take the lead.

199
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:02,070
Master, you're not coming with us?

200
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,960
I can't.

201
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,960
I have to stay by Mr. Zhao's side and keep an eye on him for you.

202
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,080
Xiao Hai's brush with death really shook me!

203
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,350
Master, it turns out, when you're near death,

204
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,430
you really can dream of your family.

205
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,030
They looked just like I remembered.

206
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,790
And what did they say?

207
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,220
They said they missed me...

208
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,880
but told me to hurry back here.

209
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,780
Xiao Hai, remember the day you left Xing Dou's manor?

210
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,660
The day you left without a word?

211
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,970
Actually, Xing Dou and I had a fight.

212
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,750
He always believed Zhinu shouldn't become Zang Hai.

213
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:03,880
He thought only by letting go of hatred could you start a new life.

214
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,490
But I believed only by settling that hatred

215
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,820
could you truly move on

216
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,730
and find a future of your own.

217
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,240
Don't worry.

218
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,620
I'm not the same Zhinu I was ten years ago.

219
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,680
Ten years together,

220
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,280
I'll walk with you one last stretch today.

221
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,700
Remember,

222
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,580
do what must be done,

223
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,750
but more importantly, live well.

224
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,060
We've still got a long road ahead.

225
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,490
Be careful out there.

226
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,820
We're almost at the city gate.

227
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,490
Lie down, quickly.

228
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,640
Come on, lie down.

229
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,180
Take care.

230
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,400
Don't blow your cover later.

231
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,100
If anyone finds out, we're in real trouble.

232
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,620
Here.

233
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,020
   

234
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,042
   

235
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,850
   

236
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,240
Stop! Inspection! 
    

237
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,040
Whoa, stop!

238
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,300
Sirs.

239
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,720
By order of the court: Wanted men are on the run in the capital.

240
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,310
No wagons or carts can pass without inspection!

241
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,720
This cart's carrying corpses.

242
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,650
They died coughing blood due to plague.

243
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:03,200
We need to burn them outside the city right away.

244
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,000
Even plague wagons must be checked.

245
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,960
Sir, I just work at a clinic to earn a living.

246
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,930
If this thing spreads, I won't survive the blame.

247
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,830
Cut the nonsense!

248
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,740
- Check it thoroughly! 
 - Hey, sir!

249
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,240
- Sir... 
 - Out of the way!

250
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,330
Sir...

251
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,950
These... These are all bodies.

252
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,670
Check it carefully!

253
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,960
Oh no! He's infected, too!

254
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,720
Back up! Let them pass!

255
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,090
Clear!

256
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,950
Go...

257
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,330
Hurry!

258
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,790
Move!

259
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,440
- Go! 
 - Hurry!

260
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,910
Go!

261
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,150
Antu...

262
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,470
Take care.

263
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,510
   

264
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,340
Stop the cart...

265
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,190
Xiao Hai, we made it out!

266
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,100
Master, are you okay?

267
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,960
Xiao Hai.

268
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,420
Not bad for an old-timer, right?

269
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,550
Luckily, I had a backup plan.

270
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,050
Or we never would've fooled them.

271
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,030
No big deal.

272
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,620
Xiao Hai.

273
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,270
Keep this.

274
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:24,430
Didn't you always ask why I saved so much?

275
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,180
I was saving it for you.

276
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,920
All farewells come to an end.

277
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,970
Once you pass this gate,

278
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,010
the road ahead...

279
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,790
You'll be walking it without me.

280
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,320
Take care.

281
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,690
Wait for me to come back.

282
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,390
Enough!

283
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,480
Go already!

284
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,150
Stop the cart...

285
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,640
- Stop! 
 - Zang Hai, what's wrong?

286
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,350
Stop the cart!

287
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,040
Zang Hai!

288
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,100
   

289
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,140
 Xiao Hai, 

290
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,810
 I drank Mr. Zhao's tea. I won't survive it. 

291
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,410
 I've lied to you for ten years, 

292
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,290
 and I still owe you an apology. 

293
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,110
 I envy Liu Chu. 

294
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,070
 She doesn't know Zhao is your enemy. 

295
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,150
 She never had to carry that weight. 

296
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,830
 I envy Xing Dou, too. 

297
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,030
 He passed away before I did. 

298
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:40,430
 Because he understood better that this day would come. 

299
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,160
 But I got to spend more time with you. 

300
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,840
 He might envy me for that. 

301
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,970
 I didn't raise you for nothing! 

302
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,200
 In this world, it's never right for a master 

303
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,520
 to outlive his disciple! 

304
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,550
 But if the intention is sincere, 

305
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,150
 sometimes a lie isn't such a bad thing. 

306
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,050
You liar...

307
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,010
Big liar...

308
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,390
Master...

309
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:16,450
Master, Gao Ming was found dead by the city gate.

310
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,030
What are you thinking about?

311
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,900
I'm thinking about the years before we entered the capital.

312
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,730
The days I spent with my masters.

313
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,430
From now on,

314
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,510
I'll walk this road without them.

315
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,220
I often dream of my mother, too,

316
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:33,400
of the past, of those carefree days.

317
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,170
Turns out in this life, joy is fleeting,

318
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,280
but sorrow lasts forever.

319
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,540
I have to return to the Dongxia royal court to find my sister.

320
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,550
Only the queens of past generations

321
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,330
are allowed to know Dongxia's ultimate secret.

322
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,070
But it's been years since you returned,

323
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,630
and your sister only just became queen.

324
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:14,480
If you go back now, she might not take it well.

325
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,590
Someone else must've witnessed the battle

326
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,010
when the Gui Seal surfaced.

327
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,000
We can settle near the palace first.

328
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,790
Maybe gather some intelligence.

329
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,640
♫  The building is lit up, the fog and clouds have dissipated  ♫

330
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,580
♫  I kissed the frost and also embraced the cold  ♫

331
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,100
♫  Hugging myself  ♫

332
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,000
♫  is like adding a thin layer of clothing  ♫

333
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,180
♫  In the crevice, I gathered some warmth  ♫

334
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,620
♫  Although the light boat has yet to pass the mountain  ♫

335
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:25,100
♫  The sky is dark, why not rest for the night?  ♫

336
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,100
♫  I want to rush before the long journey starts  ♫

337
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,480
♫  And bring along the fleeting moonlight from those years  ♫

338
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,140
♫  Every step from yesterday rang firm and clear  ♫

339
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,120
♫  Stirring up many dreams in my heart  ♫

340
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,200
♫  Let me hide in a safe harbor. Tidal waves...  ♫

341
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,150
That's Mount Yuren.

342
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,740
We're not far from Dongxia's capital now.

343
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,300
Is Mount Dansui there, too?

344
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,710
Mount Yuren is part of Dansui's range.

345
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,580
That taller one behind it is the sacred Mount Dansui.

346
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,710
Legend says if the people of Dongxia pray sincerely,

347
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,910
Mount Dansui's spirit will protect them.

348
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,280
Guess what I wished for.

349
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,760
What?

350
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,960
That we'll never be lost again,

351
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,860
and never be separated again.

352
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,580
Greetings, Princess!

353
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,400
Young Sister, it's been ten years.

354
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,370
How have you been?

355
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,110
So, he's the Zang Hai Mother mentioned?

356
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,900
You're a Princess of Dongxia.

357
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,990
How can you be with someone from Great Yong?

358
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,210
No one move!

359
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,190
Didn't you already strip me of my title?

360
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,440
I'm the new Queen of Dongxia and your elder sister.

361
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,960
Whenever I say you're not a princess, then you're not.

362
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,190
Whenever I say you are, then you are.

363
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,250
How did you know I was here?

364
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,880
I got a letter from Great Yong.

365
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,010
They said you were wanted by the court.

366
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,000
They figured you must've run back to Dongxia.

367
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,280
I never imagined, my sister, once a noble hostage,

368
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,610
nearly ended up in chains.

369
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,000
Why have you returned?

370
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,320
What are you really after?

371
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:34,230
If you won't say, don't blame me.

372
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,840
Take them away!

373
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,640
   

374
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,670
Your Highness, please eat something.

375
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,230
You haven't eaten at all.

376
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,920
You'll hurt yourself like this.

377
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,800
I know you're upset.

378
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,070
But if the late queen can see you now,

379
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,840
she may be heartbroken.

380
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,490
Get up.

381
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,280
You're a subject of Dongxia.

382
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,880
I don't want to make things hard for you.

383
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

384
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,190
Have you ever served my mother?

385
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:48,150
The late queen often told us stories of your childhood.

386
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,060
Truth is, she always held you close to her heart.

387
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,590
What happened to the man from Great Yong?

388
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,670
Do you know anything?

389
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,350
- I heard they put him in... 
  - Here comes the Queen! 

390
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,060
Sister, is the palace comfortable?

391
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,320
Where are you holding Zang Hai?

392
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,670
In the Sky Prison.

393
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,670
You've captured both of us and kept us locked away.

394
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,290
You clearly want something from me.

395
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,450
Antu, you're still as clever as ever.

396
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,670
Leave us.

397
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

398
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,670
What is this about?

399
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:40,520
The Eighteen Tribes of Haidong have long clashed with Dongxia.

400
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,160
Ten days before your return, they finally submitted to us.

401
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,360
Still, I'm not fully at ease.

402
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,920
A royal of Dongxia must go assist the Haidong King.

403
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,880
Their khan, Moersa, just lost one of his consorts.

404
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,190
I want you to marry him.

405
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,190
He's over sixty!

406
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,800
And you want me to marry him?

407
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:09,590
Moersa is indeed old, but his son is quite young.

408
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,880
Do you really think your little schemes

409
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,190
can fool the Great Yong emperor?

410
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:21,910
He'll find out soon enough that you've taken over Haidong Tribes.

411
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,710
Dongxia will face war at any moment.

412
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,960
The Great Yong emperor?

413
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
He's dead.

414
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,670
They can't even manage their own mess,

415
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,110
let alone deal with the Haidong tribes.

416
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,800
You're marrying him, whether you like it or not.

417
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,000
I won't. Unless you plan to marry off my corpse.

418
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,880
How dare you!

419
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,630
I was a hostage for ten years.

420
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,400
I owe Dongxia nothing.

421
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,190
And I've never betrayed Dongxia.

422
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,880
Even if I die and face our mother,

423
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,200
I don't think she'll blame me.

424
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,740
Is it because of Zang Hai?

425
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,540
You really love him that much?

426
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,630
Guards!

427
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,230
Cut off a finger from that Great Yong man now!

428
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,100
- Yes, Your Majesty. 
 - Wait!

429
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,510
Each day you refuse, I'll take one more of his fingers.

430
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,800
By the time you agree to marry, he'll already be a cripple.

431
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,930
And what cripple will dare dream of marrying a Dongxia princess?

432
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,230
What are you waiting for? Go!

433
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

434
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,540
I'll do it.

435
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,890
You're still too softhearted.

436
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:50,740
You don't deserve to be Queen of Dongxia.

437
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:17,030



438
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:22,220
