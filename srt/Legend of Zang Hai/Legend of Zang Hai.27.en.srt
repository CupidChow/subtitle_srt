00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,430
[Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion]

4
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,380
By Imperial decree,

5
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,850
all the Marquis of Pingjin's assets are seized by the state.

6
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,380
All servants are to be sent to the army,

7
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,570
and the family is detained in the manor awaiting punishment.

8
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,410
Take them all away!

9
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,620
- My Lady, save us! - Move!

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,330
My Lady!

11
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:50,980
- Move! - My Lady!

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,820
Help us!

13
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,490
My Lady, please save us!

14
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,600
- Hurry! - Help us!

15
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,540
My Lady!

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,570
- My Lady, please! - Keep moving!

17
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,460
My Lady!

18
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,150
Help!

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,730
Mother...

20
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,780
I'm hungry.

21
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,890
Hungry again?

22
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,100
Mother,

23
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,570
the ginger tea is ready.

24
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,890
Drink some to warm up.

25
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,380
Zhifu is hungry.

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,220
Please feed him something.

27
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,820
More!

28
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,730
I want more!

29
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,060
Yuerou.

30
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,060
Come here.

31
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,960
Take this bowl of ginger tea

32
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,290
to Zhixing.

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,340
Go on.

34
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,540
Okay.

35
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,020
It's getting cold.

36
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,850
There are no servants left in the house,

37
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,050
so I made this myself.

38
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,220
Please, drink it while it's warm.

39
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,100
Thanks.

40
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,020
Mother,

41
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,340
I want more milk cake.

42
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,730
Drink this tea first.

43
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,220
It's medicine.

44
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,850
But Mother, I'm not sick.

45
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,020
Why do I have to take medicine?

46
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,290
It's not just you,

47
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,700
everyone is sick.

48
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,410
Even Father?

49
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,290
And you?

50
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,580
Your father...

51
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,290
He cast us aside.

52
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,410
That made me very angry,

53
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,980
so I made him sick.

54
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,730
And now,

55
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,700
the whole family has fallen ill.

56
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,540
But I don't regret it at all.

57
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,050
Because now,

58
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,250
everything feels easier,

59
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,170
simpler.

60
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,580
All right,

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,460
Mother.

62
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,900
I'll drink it.

63
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,980
Mother,

64
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,900
I finished it.

65
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,220
You should drink too.

66
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,050
Once we drink it,

67
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,900
we'll all feel better.

68
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,580
I'll drink too.

69
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,100
I'll drink too!

70
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,540
Yuerou.

71
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,780
Did you bring the tea over?

72
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,100
I did.

73
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,660
I saved you a bowl too.

74
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,050
Hurry up,

75
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,290
drink it while it's warm.

76
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,660
Okay.

77
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,700
Guards!

78
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,050
Report this immediately!

79
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,170
Lady Jiang Xiang, Zhuang Zhifu, and the others are dead!

80
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:30,980
Yes, sir!

81
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,100
Your Majesty,

82
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,770
Lady Jiang Xiang and Zhuang Zhifu

83
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,480
[Govern with Virtue]

84
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,340
took poison and ended their lives.

85
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,460
Does Zhuang Luyin know?

86
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,700
Your Majesty,

87
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,420
not yet.

88
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,370
Many have advised me to execute Zhuang Luyin.

89
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,580
What do you all think?

90
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,610
Your Majesty,

91
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,730
Zhuang Luyin cheated in the imperial exams

92
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,820
and manipulated the border forces.

93
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,460
He deserves death.

94
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,220
Your Majesty,

95
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,490
the Zhuang family has served the nation for generations.

96
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,530
If you execute Zhuang Luyin,

97
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,700
it may dishearten the troops.

98
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,370
So what if he's done well?

99
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,710
That's what breeds arrogance.

100
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,340
Your Majesty,

101
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,850
if you don't punish him now,

102
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,100
it'll spiral out of control.

103
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,150
[The Great Prison]

104
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,770
By the Emperor's command:

105
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,460
Zhuang Luyin has embezzled national funds

106
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,130
and stolen from the people, abused power

107
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,340
and sold positions, manipulated the system

108
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,770
and deceived the throne, betrayed imperial trust

109
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,700
and shown disloyalty to the state.

110
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,370
His crimes are grave and undeniable.

111
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,100
He is hereby stripped of his title, reduced to commoner status,

112
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,890
and his hereditary nobility abolished.

113
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,820
By Imperial decree.

114
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,340
Where is my family?

115
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,820
Commoner Jiang Xiang and her son Zhuang Zhifu

116
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,650
took poison yesterday.

117
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,100
They passed away this morning...

118
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,820
What about Zhixing?

119
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,940
He's under house arrest, awaiting judgment.

120
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,180
My Lord, I'm sorry for your loss.

121
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,940
It's mealtime.

122
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,300
Zhuang Luyin!

123
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,100
What are you doing?

124
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,250
Dear, Zhifu...

125
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,730
I've failed you.

126
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,100
I'll join you soon.

127
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,860
You've lost your mind!

128
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,340
My Lord...

129
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,460
even if you kill me, you won't get out.

130
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,580
You know it.

131
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,580
I'm not going to kill you.

132
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,490
In fact, I can reward you handsomely.

133
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,980
Help me send a letter out.

134
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,700
That's punishable by death.

135
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,650
Then I'll kill you right now.

136
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,650
I'll do it!

137
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,130
I'll send it, I swear!

138
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,460
Deliver this letter

139
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,650
to the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director, Mr. Cao.

140
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,890
If you fail,

141
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,130
I'll make sure

142
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,060
no one in your family survives.

143
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,300
Got it!

144
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,660
[Cao's Mansion]

145
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,580
Where are you going?

146
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,730
That's none of your business.

147
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,250
You're sneaking around outside Mr. Cao's house.

148
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,280
You really think it's none of our business?

149
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,100
Sirs, I'm sorry.

150
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,850
I didn't realize

151
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,980
you served Mr. Cao.

152
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,770
Enough nonsense.

153
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,100
Tell us the truth. Why are you here?

154
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,180
Sir...

155
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,530
I'm the jailer watching over the Marquis of Pingjin.

156
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,770
He wanted me to deliver a letter to Mr. Cao.

157
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:23,850
A letter?

158
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,060
Where is it?

159
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,530
Right here.

160
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,820
Hand it over.

161
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,580
Well...

162
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,130
You've got a death wish?

163
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,060
Please, sir...

164
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,420
Sir...

165
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,220
A blood-written letter?

166
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,130
Fine. You can go.

167
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,300
We'll deliver it to Mr. Cao.

168
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,970
Get going.

169
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,510
- Sir! - Leave.

170
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,530
- Just go! - Please forgive me.

171
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,820
I must deliver it myself.

172
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,820
I really have no choice.

173
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,580
Since it's for Mr. Cao,

174
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,130
we won't stop you.

175
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,890
Thank you, sirs.

176
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,220
Move along now.

177
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,530
Hurry up!

178
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,730
Done.

179
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,130
"We were both fooled by Zang Hai.

180
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,820
He's the last of the Kuai family.

181
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,300
Come to me immediately."

182
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,940
Just as Hai predicted.

183
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,530
"Clear my name, restore my title,

184
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,580
or the truth about the Kuai family

185
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,890
will reach His Majesty."

186
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,530
Where did this letter come from?

187
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,060
Someone showed up at our door,

188
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,100
said he was the guard watching over Zhuang Luyin,

189
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,610
and sent to deliver the letter on Zhuang's behalf.

190
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,220
A prison guard?

191
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:54,770
Yes.

192
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,700

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,180
You need to leave the city now.

381
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,900
Don't get caught up in this mess.

382
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,530
What's going on?

383
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,420
Those men were from Muji Camp, right?

384
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,530
They must be here to rescue your father.

385
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,980
There's going to be a fierce battle tonight.

386
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,570
And your showing up now

387
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,050
is no coincidence.

388
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,220
Someone tried to kill me at the Mansion.

389
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,220
I chased him out,

390
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,330
and the fireworks led me here.

391
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,460
It was someone from Cao Jingxian's side.

392
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,380
He wants you and your father

393
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,770
to die in tonight's chaos.

394
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,090
Leave the Capital now while you can.

395
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,770
Don't come back

396
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,900
until this is over.

397
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,940
Here, take this.

398
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,980
This money

399
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,770
should be enough to get by for a while.

400
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,730
Go, now!

401
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,940
What about my father?

402
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,980
He's beyond saving.

403
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,700
Your only chance is to get out now.

404
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,180
Stay here, and you're dead.

405
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,290
Move now!

406
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,490
My Lord!

407
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,770
Forgive my delay!

408
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,290
You're right on time!

409
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,490
Everyone,

410
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,330
the court is ruled by traitors.

411
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,010
I was framed and betrayed.

412
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,770
I owe you my life today.

413
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:19,980
All of you,

414
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,570
follow me into the palace!

415
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,660
Clear the Emperor's side!

416
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,420
Clear the Emperor's side...

417
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,570
Father.

418
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,620
How's it going with the Imperial Guards?

419
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,940
We sent a prison guard in disguise to warn them.

420
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,490
Zhuang Luyin...

421
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,330
you'd better get ready to die.

422
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,140
Tonight, I'll make sure

423
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,860

Zhuang Luyin!

441
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,980
You've got some nerve!

442
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,610
I'm coming to the palace

443
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,840
to clear my name!

444
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,570
And you bring troops with you

445
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,120
to meet the Emperor?

446
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,820
This is rebellion!

447
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,690
Everyone, stand by!

448
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,980
Take the gate!

449
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,340
Clear the Emperor's side!

450
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,530
Clear the Emperor's side!

451
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,210
Kill!

452
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,050
Release the arrows!

453
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,260
Your Majesty!

454
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,740
Your Majesty!

455
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,340
Zhuang Luyin has been broken out of prison.

456
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,570
He's leading troops toward the palace!

457
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,340
Your Majesty!

458
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,900
Close the gate!

459
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,940
Hurry!

460
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,260
Fire!

461
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,940
Raise the shields!

462
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,820
Archers!

463
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,090
Report!

464
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,300
Commander Xue!

465
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,420
Muji Camp's assault is too fierce!

466
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,650
We can't hold them much longer!

467
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,460
Have everyone hold the line!

468
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,690
Storm the palace!

469
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,980
Break it down!

470
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,680
Zhuang Luyin!

471
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,820
Zang Hai!

472
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,340
I told you,

473
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,860
if I saw you again, I'd kill you!

474
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,170
And now, you walk right into my blade!

475
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,530
Stop!

476
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,170
Everyone, stop!

477
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,940
Stop!

478
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,010
Young Master?

479
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,940
Lan Yongji's...

480
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,530
Why are you doing this?

481
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,650
Father...

482
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,170
Surrender.

483
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,460
What did you say?

484
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,490
Do you realize what surrender means?

485
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,940
You'll have the Zhuang family

486
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,530
branded as traitors!

487
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,260
I had no choice.

488
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,130
Once we're inside the palace,

489
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,060
I'll explain everything to His Majesty!

490
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,680
But how is this not rebellion?

491
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,440
The Zhuang family has always been loyal.

492
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,640
You're bringing shame upon the family,

493
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,540
reducing our honor to rubble!

494
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,780
I really misjudged you.

495
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,940
You're still the same coward.

496
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,610
Either fight with me

497
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,300
or get out of my way!

498
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:32,570
Father,

499
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,460
you're forcing the Emperor's hand!

500
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,900
His Majesty will never forgive you!

501
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,900
To break into the palace,

502
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,090
you'll have to go through me first!

503
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:41,940
You ungrateful son!

504
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,090
You think I won't?

505
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,490
