00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,733
   

4
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,840
Zang Hai, the Emperor has spoken.

5
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,490
Zang Hai, Assistant Supervisor of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

6
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,300
is hereby honored for reinforcing the royal tomb, delivering hard work and high achievement.

7
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,840
As he is a man of great talent and a compatible birth date by astrology,

8
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,130
he is authorized to send the Empress Dowager's coffin for burial

9
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,160
and reside in the royal tomb permanently...

10
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,270
as a token of gratitude to the late emperor, Empress Dowager, and the court.

11
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,300
Official.

12
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,900
Zang Hai is so young. How can he be buried?

13
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,510
He'll do well in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

14
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,710
- Yes, Official. 
 - Official, please think twice.

15
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,330
Official Zang shouldn't be buried.

16
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,460
This is the intention of the leaders.

17
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,480
It also pains me to say so.

18
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,450
Given the conflicts of recent years,

19
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,050
the many flooding rivers, and earthquakes everywhere,

20
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,430
are all because the world is not at peace.

21
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,370
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau has had its fortune told.

22
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,980
For the stability of the world and peace everywhere,

23
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,180
Zang Hai is the most suitable choice.

24
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,640
It's an honor others couldn't receive, even if they wanted it.

25
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,770
- Official. 
 - Official.

26
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,460
- Official. 
 - Duly noted.

27
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,840
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for the Empress Dowager.

28
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,340
Very good.

29
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,930
Congratulations, Zang Hai.

30
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,830
It's a great honor.

31
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,300
Official Zang.

32
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Official Zang.

33
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,980
Why would you want to be buried alive with us?

34
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,330
Why did you agree so readily?

35
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,920
- That's right. 
 - That's right.

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,000
That's right, Official.

37
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,790
A man who is too talented will become a thorn in the side of others

38
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,610
and need to endure their scorn.

39
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,070
Thus, they deliberately arranged for you to build the tomb.

40
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,800
But it looks like you'd already guessed that.

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,430
Chu Huaiming's intentions are not hard to guess,

42
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,580
but I didn't expect...

43
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,050
that you all volunteered to be martyred?

44
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,090
Don't you want to think twice?

45
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,770
If we didn't agree to,

46
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,300
they'd ask again and again until we agreed.

47
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,430
In the end, we still wouldn't be able to escape

48
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,930
being forced to volunteer with our limbs destroyed.

49
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,070
The climate among the imperial court has already come to such a level?

50
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,800
Although the Great Yong Dynasty's founding emperors

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,170
had long ago placed a ban on live burials,

52
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,500
but that didn't stop some of those from doing it forcibly.

53
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,650
Everyone should be loyal, so who would dare to refuse?

54
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,330
Of course, they were forced, but it got framed as volunteering.

55
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,020
As for Chu Huaiming, he was even more blatant.

56
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,800
He could use it to claim credit and enrich himself.

57
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,730
Enrich himself?

58
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,620
The court spends a lot of money

59
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,460
to honor those who will be buried.

60
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,770
We are all going to die,

61
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,720
so we can exchange our lives for some money

62
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,430
to help our families and children survive.

63
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,530
Although the money will be stolen by Chu Huaiming and the others,

64
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,190
and in the end, there won't be much left,

65
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,850
this money is still life-saving for our families.

66
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,220
However, Zang Hai,

67
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,820
you are so young and talented.

68
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,340
Why are you willing to die?

69
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,680
I'm as miserable as everyone else.

70
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,140
Heaven and hell are all similar,

71
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,040
so we'll treat it as wandering to a foreign land.

72
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,940
Come on.

73
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,650
Let's drink.

74
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,820
Let's get heavily drunk today and die calmly tomorrow.

75
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,090
Drink!

76
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,780
Drink!

77
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,580
- Come on. 
 - Come on.

78
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,190
- Come on. 
 - Come on.

79
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,630
Fill it up.

80
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,500
Come on.

81
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,800
Come on.

82
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,870
Together.

83
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,170
Come on. Let's drink.

84
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,820
- Come on. 
 - Let's drink.

85
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,900
Come on.

86
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:38,520
   

87
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,150
The Emperor doesn't come even when the Empress Dowager is buried?

88
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,970
I heard from a protocol officer

89
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,400
that the Emperor got sick from grief while keeping vigil,

90
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,020
so he now only prays for the Empress Dowager in the palace

91
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,910
and can't come.

92
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,500
You were an officer, so do you know these people?

93
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,390
Over there.

94
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,460
The head of civil officers, Minister of Personnel,

95
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,410
Grand Secretary of Zhongji Hall, Shi Yiping.

96
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,670
He is prudent. He can be considered the official with the most integrity.

97
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,260
Next to him is the Minister of Revenue,

98
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,900
Grand Secretary of Jianji Hall, Zhao Bingwen.

99
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,370
He is the Deputy Chief Grand Secretary, prideful and noble.

100
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,260
At the head of the military officers

101
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,480
is Zhuang Luyin, the Marquis of Pingjin,

102
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,340
the Defender General of the Nation back then

103
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,260
and current Grand Master for Glorious Happiness.

104
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,500
Vice Minister of Works, Zhuang Zhifu, is his son.

105
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,980
Chu Huaiming is their lackey.

106
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,420
Kneel!

107
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,320
Send the Empress Dowager's casket for burial.

108
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,050
Final step.

109
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,200
Check the paint on the coffin.

110
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,200
Official,

111
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,160
the Empress Dowager's casket has the Big Dipper on it.

112
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,140
What does that mean?

113
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,290
The emperor's residence is called Zichen.

114
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,450
After their deaths,

115
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,420
the emperors wanted to reside in Zichen, which is guarded by the Big Dipper.

116
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,290
They not only carved this design into their coffins

117
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,670
but also, I believe, placed the Empress Dowager's body

118
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,810
in this position for burial.

119
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:53,320
Do you think we can live in Zichen after we die?

120
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,840
Let's go.

121
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,240
Gentlemen, I'm here to send you off.

122
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,750
Come with me.

123
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,390
Here's some good wine and food prepared for you.

124
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,150
You should know they are poisoned.

125
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,220
You won't feel any pain after eating them.

126
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,180
After three days, you will die peacefully.

127
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,020
Just a death.

128
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,590
Why speak so much?

129
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,560
Live out these three days well and go to heaven in peace.

130
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,100
This is Magu Wine from Jianchang Prefecture.

131
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,830
I heard it's about 300 wen per liang.

132
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,710
Open it.

133
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,170
Good wine really is different.

134
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,510
It smells so good.

135
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,200
Kneel!

136
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,850
Bow!

137
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,190
Straighten up!

138
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,140
The mechanism has been turned on.

139
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:20,770
Then he'll soon see the surprise we've prepared for him.

140
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,420
I really want to see what Zang Hai's face will look like then.

141
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,140
Do you know what this is?

142
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,440
Venison.

143
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,860
Have you ever eaten it?

144
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,200
I used to hunt it, but in the end, they were taken by the town's security unit,

145
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,920
so I've never tried it either.

146
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,770
Numbing ourselves can be a way of life.

147
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,030
An old friend of mine once told me that someday,

148
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,750
he was going to put an end to the system of burial sacrifices,

149
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,200
but he couldn't achieve it, and I failed even more.

150
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,550
Maybe our descendants will be able to someday.

151
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,830
If we expect our descendants to do everything for us,

152
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,910
their lives will only get worse.

153
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,600
How can we live in this world with dignity?

154
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,730
The second bow!

155
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,600
Are you thirsty?

156
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,120
How about I taste it for you first?

157
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,000
Good point. We all die sooner or later,

158
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,780
it would be better to become a well-fed ghost.

159
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,900
Come on. We can't get out anyway.

160
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,100
I'll drink first.

161
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,670
- Let me quench my thirst. 
 - Don't drink.

162
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,520
If you drink, you really can't get out.

163
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,430
What do you mean?

164
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,900
Do you mean you still want to get out?

165
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,030
Don't think about it anymore, and don't try to persuade us.

166
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,150
Just let us get drunk till our deaths.

167
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,740
I have a way out.

168
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,460
A way out?

169
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,490
The third bow!

170
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,280
What's your idea?

171
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,980
Did you secretly dig an escape well?

172
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,340
That's not allowed!

173
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,220
Secretly digging an escape well in the royal tomb

174
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,820
is a cardinal sin that will get all our families executed.

175
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,850
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

176
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,530
No.

177
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,960
We'll leave through the gate.

178
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,290
That great entrance of the tomb.

179
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,840
We'll walk out gloriously in the open.

180
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,860
You're going to lead us out in the open?

181
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,030
The fourth bow!

182
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,060
Straighten up!

183
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,920
The ceremony won't be over until the Dragon-Cracking Stone falls,

184
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,210
and the officials are all there.

185
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,100
If we go out at that time, they'll see us.

186
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,690
- That's right. 
 - That's what I want them to see.

187
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,540
We're going to walk out in plain sight.

188
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,340
How is that possible?

189
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,670
If we go out in front of all those people, they'll beat us to death with sticks.

190
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,510
- That's right. 
 - And that would involve our families.

191
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,360
If we don't fight, others will continue to be buried alive.

192
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,630
Your families might even be next.

193
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,160
How can we fight?

194
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,140
Just us?

195
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,380
That's right.

196
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,110
What is your plan?

197
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,990
If we can make it to the entrance of the tomb

198
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,530
before the Dragon-Cracking Stone falls,

199
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,990
I have the confidence to put an end to this burial and get them to let us out.

200
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,380
You really think you can do it?

201
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,160
I believe you.

202
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,490
Tell us what to do.

203
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,410
Finish!

204
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,040
Drop the Dragon-Cracking Stone!

205
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,400
This door is not the Dragon-Cracking Stone.

206
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,820
It can be opened.

207
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,200
The mechanism is outside.

208
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,190
True, but there must be a pull-wire switch connected to the tomb door.

209
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,950
All we need to do is find that pull-wire switch to manipulate the outside mechanism.

210
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,300
I know.

211
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,680
The pull-wire switch that connects to the tomb door mechanism is up there.

212
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,780
It's this brick. Guys, come and help.

213
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,090
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

214
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,410
Bring up the stools.

215
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,230
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

216
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,140
Get down.

217
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,290
Chu Huaiming!

218
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,820
He thought after the Dragon-Cracking Stone fell, he'd still be able to live for three days.

219
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,700
Right now, they still have a hope of survival, but after three days, that will be gone.

220
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,510
They can only die then.

221
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,510
But once the mechanism is turned on...

222
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,750
Getting killed now will be the most painful.

223
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,860
Turns out they already set up a trap for us to die right here.

224
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,930
Didn't we all volunteer to be buried?

225
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,090
Why are they still doing this to us?

226
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,180
We have to trigger the switch to open the door and get out.

227
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
Be careful.

228
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll pull it.

229
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
Come and help.

230
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,250
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

231
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,840
Be careful.

232
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,120
Let's go.

233
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,480
- Come on. 
 - Go.

234
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,680
Go.

235
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,890
Go.

236
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,580
Put the shield up.

237
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,250
What do we do?

238
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,510
We're the only ones left.

239
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,090
We can't block them.

240
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,170
Don't give up.

241
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,190
Try again.

242
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,170
Zang Hai.

243
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,340
Get on my shoulder.

244
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,010
Come up!

245
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,670
Go.

246
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,490
Hold on.

247
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,970
Almost there.

248
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,700
Again.

249
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,900
It's open! Higher!

250
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,940
Let's go.

251
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,140
Come on. Get up.

252
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,720
The door is open. We're going home.

253
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
- Get up. 
 - We're going home. Get up!

254
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,150
Get up!

255
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,660
Let's go.

256
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,340
Let's go.

257
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,540
Get up. Get up.

258
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,060
Get up. We're going home. Get up.

259
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,820
Let's go. Come on.

260
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,540
We're going home!

261
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,680
Let's go.

262
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,050
Let's go.

263
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,870
Let's go.

264
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,630
Zang Hai.

265
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,390
Come on. Move!

266
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,100
 What's going on? 

267
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,330
 Why did Dragon-Cracking Stone stop? 

268
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,060
Come on. I'll hold it.

269
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,160
Get over.

270
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,310
You go first. It's too late.

271
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,140
Now.

272
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,060
My Lord.

273
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,170
What's going on here?

274
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,380
I'm not sure.

275
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,750
Go and see.

276
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,290
Yes.

277
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,020
Why isn't it coming down?

278
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,820
I've got it.

279
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,710
Now get out.

280
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,010
Now go.

281
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,030
Leave me alone!

282
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,930
No!

283
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,980
No!

284
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,590
I'm not leaving you!

285
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,240
Go now!

286
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,010
Go now!

287
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,210
I'll get you out of here!

288
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,150
Uncle Ji.

289
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,140
I'm Zhinu.

290
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,690
Uncle Ji. I'm Zhinu.

291
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,480
- Uncle Ji. 
 - Zhinu?

292
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,760
You're alive?

293
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,530
I'm incompetent,

294
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,550
so I can't go out with you.

295
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:49,050
You must live well.

296
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,910
Your father's...

297
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,900
spirit in heaven will bless you.

298
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,190
Uncle... Uncle Ji.

299
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,480
Uncle Ji.

300
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,740
Uncle Ji!

301
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,300
Official, I don't know what's wrong either, but it won't come down.

302
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,790
- It seems to be stuck. 
 - Stuck?

303
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,920
Open it and fix it.

304
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,830
It can't be opened. The mechanism is closed.

305
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,300
There's nothing we can do except blow the gate up.

306
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,840
Blow it up?

307
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,960
There's someone there.

308
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,590
Official, someone is there.

309
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,960
Come out.

310
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,060
 I've been thinking about how to defuse danger. 

311
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,730
 When a disaster strikes, do not get close. 

312
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,580
 I'm about to die, but I'm not yet dead. There is room for reversal. 

313
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,440
 A lucky star falls from the sky and comes to your aid. 

314
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,700
 The stick indicates that there is already a lucky person 

315
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,210
 who will reveal himself when he is about to die. 

316
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,610
 You will know when it happens. 

317
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,900
Official.

318
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,240
Zang Hai?

319
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,620
How did you get out?

320
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,730
The Dragon-Cracking Stone stopped falling.

321
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,560
What trick did you pull?

322
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,050
I didn't pull any trick.

323
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,460
I just wasn't fated to die today!

324
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,660
As long as I walk out alive, it'll fall on its own!

325
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,380
Let's go.

326
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,180
Official.

327
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,210
It's all Zang Hai's fault.

328
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,490
He removed Dowager Noble Consort Li's coffin.

329
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,060
Now, the Dragon-Cracking Stone can't fall

330
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,500
just because the late emperor is in a rage.

331
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,880
And the Imperial Astronomical Bureau has finished fortune-telling.

332
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,400
We must bury a person whose Four Pillars of Destiny are fully Yin

333
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,210
to calm the storm.

334
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:18,310
Now, Zang Hai is unwilling to be buried and is walking out in style.

335
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:22,580
That's... That's a massive crime.

336
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,370
Let me venture a guess that once Zang Hai is dead,

337
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,870
the Dragon-Cracking Stone will fall.

338
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,150
Assistant Supervisor of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

339
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,580
Previously, you were specially authorized to send the Empress Dowager's coffin

340
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,110
to the tomb because of your loyalty,

341
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,140
but today, why do you go back on your word?

342
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,840
The recent incidents in the cemetery are all because of you.

343
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,630
Now go back in there immediately!

344
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,210
If you persist,

345
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,570
you will suffer the pain of arrows through your heart.

346
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,490
Why are you laughing?

347
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,640
I'm laughing because you, Marquis, believed in the words of these scumbags.

348
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,820
I'm laughing because the court of officials was duped by evil.

349
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,550
Even entrusting the Great Yong Dynasty's fortunes

350
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,310
to an insignificant Assistant Supervisor like me.

351
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,410
If this can appease the spirit of the late emperor,

352
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,390
I will die a worthy death,

353
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,490
but I feel so sorry for it.

354
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,650
I want to cry for all the hundreds of officials present,

355
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,700
as well as for the Vice Minister of Works.

356
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,780
Why do you want to cry for me?

357
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:59,040
If I die, but the Dragon-Cracking Stone still cannot fall, what can you do?

358
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,810
If the Dragon-Cracking Stone doesn't fall after you die,

359
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,430
there are craftsmen who will repair it.

360
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,550
How long will it take to fix it?

361
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,610
Three months or a year?

362
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,360
Wouldn't that leave the bodies of the late emperor and Empress Dowager

363
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,700
exposed to the wilderness for over a year?

364
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,190
National mourning stems from a nation's morals and laws.

365
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:25,030
Morals are the foundation of a nation, and the law is the keystone of a nation.

366
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,980
An act of such great disrespect, even if my death is of no consequence,

367
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,030
will implicate all the officers for nothing.

368
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
My Lord.

369
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,440
Grand Secretary Shi, it's almost time.

370
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,150
It will become inauspicious if it is past quarter to 10:00 in the morning.

371
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,900
Let me ask you.

372
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,930
What if you come out and the Dragon-Cracking Stone doesn't fall?

373
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:09,880
If it doesn't fall, I'll only live a few seconds longer,

374
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,660
but what you want is for the Dragon-Cracking Stone to fall, isn't that so?

375
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,630
Let him out.

376
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,600
Official Chu once told me that to appease the spirit of the late emperor,

377
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,420
we need someone whose Four Pillars of Destiny match that of the late emperor's

378
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,620
to stay in the tomb forever.

379
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,320
That's true,

380
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,550
but it's not me.

381
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,220
Who is it then?

382
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,970
Yang Zhen.

383
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,320
Nonsense.

384
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,970
Previously, Official Yang just celebrated his 36th birthday.

385
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,940
I deduced Official Yang's Four Pillars of Destiny from his biography.

386
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,180
Official Yang's Four Pillars are all Yin,

387
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,740
so he is the rare person with the Four Pillars of Yin.

388
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,960
If his life is used to activate the feng shui of the royal tomb,

389
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,730
the Dragon-Cracking Stone will surely fall.

390
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,990
You...

391
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,150
Official Chu was also present on the day of his birth feast.

392
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,570
If you don't believe me, you can ask Official Chu.

393
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,810
- Chu Huaiming. Is he telling the truth? 
 - Yes.

394
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,440
Wait no.

395
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,940
- No. 
 - Yes or no?

396
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,810
Yes. But...

397
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,410
Officials. My Lord.

398
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,400
The time has almost passed.

399
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,540
My Lord, don't interfere with this national mourning.

400
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,150
My Lord!

401
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,960
When the time is over, my death will be insignificant,

402
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,320
but if this affects all of you officers, even death will not rid me of my pain.

403
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,080
My Lord, please make a decision.

404
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,480
You.

405
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,040
Go in.

406
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,530
Absolutely not.

407
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,570
He's... He's deliberately excusing himself.

408
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,400
Please don't believe him.

409
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,550
Don't you see?

410
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,200
He's been unafraid of death since a long time ago.

411
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,780
My Lord.

412
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,610
He wants me to die with him.

413
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,660
Don't worry.

414
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,630
As long as the Dragon-Cracking Stone moves after you go in,

415
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,700
I'll execute Zang Hai and get you out,

416
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,860
but if you don't go in, that means you don't trust me.

417
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,590
I believe you.

418
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,050
Don't fall.

419
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,030
Don't fall.

420
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,940
Don't fall.

421
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,740
It's not moving.

422
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,820
My Lord, he's lying.

423
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,650
He's lying.

424
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,210
- It's moving. 
 - It's moving.

425
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,010
How could it be?

426
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,150
No.

427
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,190
The Dragon-Cracking Stone is falling.

428
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,140
It's really falling.

429
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,260
It's really falling.

430
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,510
No.

431
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,130
It's not me, My Lord.

432
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,490
It's Zang Hai's trick.

433
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,500
I don't want to die.

434
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,780
Let me out.

435
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,710
My Lord.

436
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,290
My Lord, you said you'd get me out.

437
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,000
My Lord. I'm loyal to you.

438
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,490
My Lord, you can't just watch Zang Hai frame me to death! My Lord!

439
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,850
My Lord.

440
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,070
Zhuang Luyin.

441
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,980
Are you going to abandon...

442
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,320
all these years of our friendship for Zang Hai?

443
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,850
How many people have I framed

444
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,860
and how many dirty deeds have I done for you?

445
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,780
How much can Zang Hai do for you?

446
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,110
Do you remember what happened

447
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,670
in the ninth year of the Zhenshun era?

448
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:08,610
Could that have been solved so neatly without me?

449
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,920
I'm going to tell everyone now

450
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,790
that in order to get the Gui Seal...
