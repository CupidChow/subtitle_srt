00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,930
Everyone experiences pain and confusion.

4
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,740
Knowing is easy, and doing is hard.

5
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,050
Even the Marquis of Pingjin is no exception.

6
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,380
If you want him to rely on you,

7
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,900
then help ease his burdens.

8
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,290
So, what haunts the Marquis?

9
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,410
It's tied to someone

10
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,330
who has long vanished from the Zhuang family.

11
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,290
Shen Wan was the daughter of Zhuang Luyin's father's old comrade.

12
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,770
She and Zhuang Luyin grew up together.

13
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,330
But to revive the Zhuang name,

14
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,260
he gave up on Shen Wan

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,380
and married Jiang Xiang, daughter of Minister Jiang Jin.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,730
From then on, his career soared.

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,730
In the 35th year of Wuhe,

18
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,850
he suffered a major defeat in Dongxia.

19
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,290
The Emperor ordered him to guard the border.

20
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,100
Jiang Xiang refused the hardship

21
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,100
and stayed in the Capital with Zhuang Zhifu.

22
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,780
Stop!

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,010
Life at the border was tough,

24
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,500
yet someone appeared

25
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,690
in his desolate life.

26
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,730
That was Shen Wan.

27
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,290
She never married.

28
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,100
She came to the border to care for her wounded father.

29
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,500
There, she reunited with Zhuang Luyin.

30
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,290
They stayed together at the frontier,

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,660
and had a son, Zhuang Zhixing.

32
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,660
When Zhuang Zhixing was five,

33
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,010
the court decided to wage war on Dongxia again.

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,820
Zhuang Luyin was named the vanguard.

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,940
This time, he crushed Dongxia and redeemed his past defeat.

36
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,220
But just as his fame soared

37
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,980
and he earned unparalleled glory,

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,610
an unexpected visitor arrived at the border.

39
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,410
Jiang Xiang came with Zhuang Zhifu.

40
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,220
She wanted to rekindle their marriage.

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,570
Zhuang Luyin was torn.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,980
He dreamed of surpassing his father's legacy.

43
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,060
But slighting Jiang Xiang

44
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,500
would offend her father,

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,130
a man of immense power.

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,940
Yet how could he betray Shen Wan again?

47
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,660
While he wavered,

48
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,660
Shen Wan stepped forward.

49
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,370
She willingly gave up her place

50
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,460
to make way for Jiang Xiang.

51
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,540
And Zhuang Luyin didn't refuse.

52
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,490
After that, he got everything he wanted: title and command.

53
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,610
He became a powerful figure in court.

54
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,290
Three!

55
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,290
He thought he could treat them equally,

56
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,410
and let Shen Wan suffer nothing.

57
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,050
But he underestimated Jiang Xiang's ambition and cunning.

58
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,540
Since you hold high office,

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,370
you should focus on your career.

60
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,980
Leave household matters

61
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,730
to Jiang Xiang.

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,250
Jiang Xiang drove a wedge

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,700
between him and Shen Wan,

64
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,700
until at last,

65
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,850
Zhuang Luyin believed Shen Wan was unfaithful.

66
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,980
With his silent consent,

67
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,700
Jiang Xiang poisoned her.

68
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,220
Mother!

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,290
Mother!

70
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,540
Mother!

71
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,580
Don't leave me!

72
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,100
Please!

73
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,140
I'm begging you!

74
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,250
Mother!

75
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,930
Mother!

76
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,250
Mother!

77
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,340
A great debt is like a deep grudge.

78
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,020
No one wants to carry it for life.

79
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,900
A debt that can't be repaid over time

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,340
turns either into indifference,

81
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,730
or resentment.

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,730
The selfish usually live the happiest

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,900
in this world.

84
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,700
Why can't he let go

85
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,050
of this one thing?

86
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,930
Is he hung up on Shen Wan of the past,

87
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,020
or ashamed of the man he once was?

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,580
No one can say for sure.

89
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,660
And so he refuses

90
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,220
to give even a shred of fatherly love to Zhuang Zhixing.

91
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,340
Because every time he sees him,

92
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,700
he's reminded of the disgrace he used to be.

93
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,540
The more you bury pain like that,

94
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,610
the deeper it takes root.

95
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,370
What kind of strong man wants to admit

96
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,580
to such a weakness inside?

97
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,780
My Lord,

98
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,790
you were looking for me?

99
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,460
Do you know why I asked you to come here?

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,460
I believe this place

101
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,780
is where the second young master lived as a child.

102
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,460
My Lord summoned me here

103
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,100
because of what I said earlier

104
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,780
about the second young master?

105
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,780
Zhixing

106
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,980
was once dearly loved

107
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,340
by me.

108
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,170
But over time, we grew distant.

109
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,850
And I've treated him far worse than Zhifu

110
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,370
in recent years.

111
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,580
He's become the disappointing son.

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,540
Could it be

113
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,250
that I am also to blame?

114
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,810
You are the head of the family.

115
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,610
How could you be at fault?

116
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,900
I was just thinking,

117
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,220
the garden is full of blooming peonies,

118
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,290
so why did you come here alone?

119
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,290
I once knew a poor gardener.

120
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,900
He made a living growing plum blossoms.

121
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,250
But they were cheap,

122
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,490
and over time,

123
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,410
he became poorer and poorer,

124
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,930
barely able to support himself.

125
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,850
Then he realized people adored peonies.

126
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,220
They sold for far more.

127
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,940
So he switched to growing peonies,

128
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,980
and finally lived a life of comfort.

129
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,820
But he told me

130
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,370
that deep down,

131
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,850
he still loved

132
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,180
the plum blossoms more.

133
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,420
But it was too late.

134
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,820
The plums in his garden,

135
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,300
left untended,

136
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,460
all withered away.

137
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,940
That he chose plums when he was poor

138
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,610
shows how deeply he loved them.

139
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,700
But since he sold flowers for a living,

140
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,530
he had no choice but to grow peonies.

141
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,490
His beloved plums

142
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,890
faded and died.

143
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,820
Perhaps he blamed himself for that.

144
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,580
But I don't think he was wrong.

145
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,980
Why not?

146
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,730
Plum blossoms bloom in winter.

147
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,580
They endure snow and frost, never chasing spring.

148
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,130
It's not that the gardener heartlessly chose peonies.

149
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,250
It's that the plum chose to bloom in hardship,

150
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,250
and fall into the mud.

151
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,180
Had he not turned to peonies,

152
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,060
the whole garden

153
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,700
might not have survived the winter.

154
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,770
It reminds me of a poem:

155
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,420
"Petals fall dry, already heartbreaking.

156
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,650
How cruel, the storm that follows.

157
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,730
How can such grief be soothed?

158
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,940
Hope lies in fresh buds on new branches."

159
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,250
The poet mourned the blossoms lost in the storm,

160
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,730
but didn't dwell in sorrow.

161
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,730
Because he believed,

162
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,700
as long as new branches grow,

163
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,890
the plums will bloom again.

164
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,300
The gardener mourned what he lost,

165
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,730
unaware a single young plum still lingered in a quiet corner.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,850
It may go unnoticed in the warmth of spring,

167
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,700
but if nurtured with care,

168
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,340
one day, in snow and frost again,

169
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,730
it might stand proud and bloom anew.

170
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,850
What did he say to my father earlier?

171
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,010
My father actually asked about my studies.

172
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,650
That means the Marquis intends to groom you.

173
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,980
His care for you now may even surpass

174
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,890
what he gives to Zhuang Zhifu.

175
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,730
He's only nice to me because of you.

176
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,610
What I said doesn't matter.

177
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,220
What matters is,

178
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,980
what kind of son he sees you as.

179
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,610
So from now on, study harder,

180
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,180
and never let your guard down.

181
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,650
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:31,980
Who is it?

183
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,370
Sir,

184
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,130
it's me,

185
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,850
Zhuang Shan.

186
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,130
The Marquis has asked for you.

187
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,770
Understood.

188
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,220
He's inside.

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,180
This way, sir.

190
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,650
My Lord.

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,980
Whenever I'm troubled,

192
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,940
I come here to sit for a while.

193
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,490
This place

194
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,700
helps clear my mind,

195
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,010
lets me think things through.

196
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,700
I'd be honored to share your burden.

197
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,610
Do you believe

198
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,250
General Fu Zhisong's death

199
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,300
was truly an accident?

200
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,370
I have no idea.

201
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,700
Loyal dogs are often killed

202
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,980
when the chase ends.

203
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,010
No matter how great your deeds,

204
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,060
they can never outweigh

205
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,250
the heartlessness of an emperor.

206
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,100
But I believe

207
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,650
you're not like General Fu.

208
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,530
He was the late Empress Dowager's nephew,

209
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,100
a royal in-law.

210
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,100
But you led the charge that took Dongxia's gate

211
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,850
and secured a legendary victory.

212
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,130
Surely His Majesty remembers your merit.

213
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,460
With Fu Zhisong dead,

214
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,250
the post of Commander of Zhongzhou Forces is now vacant.

215
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,940
In court,

216
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,700
no one is more qualified than me.

217
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,890
Many officials have already recommended me to the Emperor.

218
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:09,980
So tell me,

219
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,850
should I fight for it?

220
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,340
Many current generals

221
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,460
once served under your command.

222
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,940
Even your former deputy

223
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,370
now leads the Muji Camp outside the Capital.

224
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,700
If you fight for the position now,

225
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,610
I'm afraid the Emperor won't be able

226
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,850
to hide his growing unease about you.

227
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,180
So I should just sit by

228
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,850
and let the title go to someone else?

229
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,940
My Lord,

230
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,490
this matter

231
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,220
isn't just a contest with others.

232
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,370
It's a contest with the Emperor himself.

233
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,580
I believe His Majesty

234
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,340
already has his plan in mind.

235
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,250
So perhaps it's best to wait a few days

236
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,530
and see who he ultimately chooses.

237
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,580
And in my opinion, not fighting for it

238
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,890
might actually work in your favor.

239
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,730
If you truly wish to command again,

240
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,180
there may be another way.

241
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,420
I want you to do something for me.

242
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,850
Please give your order, My Lord.

243
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,340
Once you hear this,

244
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,340
there will be no turning back.

245
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,580
Think it through.

246
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,010
I would die a thousand deaths for your cause.

247
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,700
In all my years,

248
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,420
I've only lost one battle.

249
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,370
And the one who beat me

250
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,530
wasn't a man,

251
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,460
but a thing called the Gui Seal.

252
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,180
The Gui Seal?

253
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,610
In the 35th year of Wuhe,

254
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,730
the late Emperor led a massive campaign against Dongxia.

255
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,300
I served as the vanguard then.

256
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,820
We stormed city after city,

257
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,770
nearly conquering the entire land.

258
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,460
But just as we were about

259
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,820
to take the capital,

260
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,610
something strange happened.

261
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,490
Go report to the General.

262
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,850
Yes, sir!

263
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,090
Are those even human?

264
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,770
Prepare to fight!

265
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,090
Kill them!

266
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:34,860
- Kill! - Kill!

267
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,530
The Queen of Dongxia

268
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,980
summoned a sacred relic,

269
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,290
the Gui Seal.

270
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,490
It unleashed an army of ghost soldiers.

271
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,810
They're monsters that could not be killed.

272
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,490
No matter how strong our forces,

273
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,140
they were helpless before them.

274
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,330
Retreat!

275
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,900
From that day on, I swore I would find the Gui Seal!

276
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,010
Six years later, the Great Yong regrouped its troops

277
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,620
and launched another campaign.

278
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,250
I marched out, ready to die if I must.

279
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,380
But this time,

280
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,860
Dongxia had lost the protection of the Gui Seal,

281
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,180
and was swiftly crushed into submission.

282
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,420
Yet even after stationing Dongxia

283
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,180
for three years,

284
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,980
I still couldn't find that cursed artifact.

285
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,770
A geomancer found this bronze fish.

286
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,050
He discovered the Gui Seal in Dongxia

287
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,900
and tried to keep it for himself.

288
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,180
I attempted to take it from him, but failed.

289
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,420
And I suspect this bronze fish

290
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,460
is somehow linked to the Gui Seal.

291
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,700
Perhaps

292
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,010
they're parts of a whole.

293
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,980
So the Gui Seal is still on him?

294
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,140
No.

295
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,090
Not on him.

296
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,050
He's already dead.

297
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,490
That was his fate.

298
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,980
He dared to take what belongs to you.

299
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,980
He must die.

300
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,980
It's been ten years.

301
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,420
I searched everywhere,

302
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,900
but still couldn't find it.

303
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,980
I'd nearly lost hope.

304
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,530
But now that you're here,

305
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,250
it's different.

306
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,010
My Lord,

307
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,940
you want me to help you find the Gui Seal?

308
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,700
That's right.

309
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,620
My Lord,

310
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,900
I'll do whatever it takes for you.

311
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,810
Then this task

312
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,330
is yours now.

313
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,900
Yes, My Lord.

314
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,420
May I ask,

315
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,090
is there only one

316
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,940
of these bronze fish?

317
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,180
What do you mean?

318
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,380
When I was young,

319
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,940
I studied geomancy under my master.

320
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,420
I learned a bit about Dongxia culture.

321
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,380
Dongxia's early days relied on fishing and hunting,

322
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,940
so the fish became their totem.

323
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,700
I've never seen this bronze fish before,

324
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,770
but I've seen many

325
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,290
of their fish symbols.

326
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,530
In their paintings, fish always appear in groups.

327
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,290
They're symbols of abundance and prosperity.

328
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,940
That's why I asked.

329
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,330
Impressive, sharp mind and keen insight.

330
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,730
You're right.

331
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,860
This isn't the only bronze fish.

332
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,770
I knew it.

333
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,220
You really are the perfect man for the job.

334
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,250
Then should I search

335
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,250
for the other bronze fish as well?

336
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,810
No need to worry about the others.

337
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,250
I know where they are.

338
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,770
Just remember,

339
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,290
once you find the Gui Seal,

340
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,980
I'll make sure you're well rewarded.

341
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,250
I'll brave fire and death

342
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,700
to fulfill your wish.

343
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,620
The Gui Seal?

344
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,980
I've heard a few tales about it

345
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,660
that have been passed down in Dongxia.

346
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,140
They called it a gift from the Lady of Kunlun,

347
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,460
the sacred treasure of their kings.

348
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,180
But it always sounded so far-fetched.

349
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,810
I thought it only existed in myths.

350
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,490
No one in the Great Yong even knew it was real.

351
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,730
Yet your father actually found it

352
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,980
and brought it back.

353
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,330
I never thought

354
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,730
I'd help the Marquis search for it.

355
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,900
Do you still remember the bronze fish

356
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,050
in the Marquis's secret chamber?

357
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,900
Last night, I took the chance

358
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,250
to ask about the other two.

359
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,140
He said he knows exactly where they are.

360
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,010
Looks like I was right.

361
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,180
They're with the other two enemies.

362
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,900
But even with all the trust he's shown me,

363
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,770
the Marquis still refuses

364
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,810
to tell me anything about the third person.

365
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,490
One step at a time.

366
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,530
We've already taken a big step forward.

367
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,700
At least you now have the Marquis's approval.

368
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,330
From now on, whatever we do,

369
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,900
we no longer need to hide.

370
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,810
Master.

371
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,770
Do you think the Gui Seal really exists?

372
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,620
I don't know either.

373
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,250
But there's one thing I'm sure of.

374
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,420
Your enemies

375

is to collect timber for construction projects.

we've supplied the palace with rare woods

The most delicate mortuary skill

is stitching and patching.

For stitching,

597
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,380
we use mulberry bark fiber

00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,340

As for patching, usually we use dough.

601
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,530
But General Fu held great rank,

602
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,420
so we'll use sandalwood to restore his body.

00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,010

His Majesty ordered a grand burial for General Fu.

624

00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,050
Even a few hours' difference

628
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,570
can make a big impact.

Mr. Chu said mortuary work isn't demanding,

so he cut our division's staff to save costs.

634

00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,980
I just have the apprentices help out.

They're from civilian families,

637
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,170

639
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,690
I didn't expect you to be this skilled.

640

I learned this as a child,

641
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,420
but never got the hang of it.

00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,740
To be good at this,

643
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,900
you need more than talent.

644
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,130
It takes a lot of patience.

or just to climb the ranks?

654
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,530
I don't really care.

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,380

690
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,690
is nothing like

691
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,210
when my father was in charge.

692
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,900
Back then, everyone had their role,

693
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,090
and got along well.

694
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,170
If my father could help,

695
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,740
he always would.

696
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,050
But now, everyone wears a mask.

697
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,490
There's no sincerity left.

698
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,490
What nonsense!

699
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,010
Your father

700
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,380
was just a man who ran funeral business.

701
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,380
He had nothing to do with the Bureau.

702
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,820
Now that you hold office,

703
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,460
you're not just an aide from the Marquis's Mansion anymore.

704
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,210
More eyes are on you.

705
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,610
Back at the Marquis's Mansion,

706
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,900
as long as he trusted you, it was enough.

707
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,610
But in court,

708
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,260
daggers come from every direction.

709
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,170
You'll need to be more careful.

710
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:17,820
You're right, Master.

711
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,690
The Bureau today

712
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,820
is full of opportunists and spies.

713
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,690
I'm afraid the road ahead won't be smooth.

714
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,530
When Chu Huaiming was in charge,

715
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,780
the Bureau served the wicked many times.

716
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,900
I've heard of those stories.

717
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,130
Ever hear about the missing daughter of the Lin family?

718
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,340
That was three years ago.

719
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,460
The Lin family's girl had just turned thirteen.

720
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,490
But Duke E's eldest son fancied her.

721
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,780
He insisted on making her his concubine.

722
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,380
But he

723
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,210
was thirty years older than her.

724
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,260
The Lin family flatly refused.

725
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,980
Strangely enough,

726
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,690
that young master died

727
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,650
from overdosing.

728
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,570
The Lin family thought it was over,

729
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,380
until three days after his death,

730
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,210
their daughter suddenly vanished.

731
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,380
Guess where they found her?

732
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,780
Where?

733
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,170
In the tomb of Duke E's son.

734
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,650
She'd been strangled,

735
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,380
wearing a bridal gown.

736
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,210
Her poor parents went mad with grief.

737
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,860
But the Great Yong law clearly forbids ghost marriages!

738
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,570
That rule only applies to commoners.

739
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,650
The court turns a blind eye when it's nobles.

740
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,460
That ghost marriage

741
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,380
might've been arranged

742
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,010
by the Astronomical Bureau!

743
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,210
And not just that.

744
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,340
Last October,

745
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,090
under the guise of aiding nobles,

746
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,460
the Bureau took over every orchard in Wang Village.

747
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,980
Left with nowhere to appeal,

748
