1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:16,870



2
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:30,040
   

3
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,780
   

4
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,393
I didn't think you'd still be alive.

5
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:55,326
I really did underestimate you and Gao Ming.

6
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:57,060
Come back with me.

7
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,260
We'll have plenty of time...

8
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,510
to talk things over.

9
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,750
Take him away!

10
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,320
Grand Secretary Zhao.

11
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,130
General Zhuang, you're truly loyal and capable.

12
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,060
You wasted no time catching one of the court's most wanted.

13
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,090
I was only following your instructions, Grand Secretary.

14
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,450
- I dare not take the credit. 
 - No need to be so modest.

15
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,930
I've come bearing good news.

16
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,110
The eldest son of the Prince of Linzi has ascended the throne.

17
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,570
I spoke highly of your strict command to His Majesty.

18
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,180
To award you in recognition of your service at the border,

19
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,550
he has granted you the title of General of Agile Cavalry.

20
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,580
I thank His Majesty for his grace!

21
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,690
Back when your father was appointed Defender General of the Nation,

22
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,470
he was older than you are now.

23
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,440
You've already surpassed him.

24
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,020
It was only thanks to your guidance, Grand Secretary.

25
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,220
I will always be grateful.

26
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,080
But your father's greatest regret

27
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,980
was failing to press the advantage after defeating Dongxia.

28
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,800
That let them survive to this day.

29
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,780
Of course, the late emperor's mercy also played a part.

30
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,500
But now, your chance has come.

31
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
You should carry out your father's unfinished mission

32
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,410
and complete what he could not.

33
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,580
Are you saying we should strike Dongxia once and for all

34
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,090
to crush any future ambitions they may harbor?

35
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,850
Exactly. Now is the perfect time.

36
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,410
The problem is that my troops alone aren't enough.

37
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,780
To conquer Dongxia,

38
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,780
we'll need reinforcements from the court.

39
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,390
I'm here precisely to deliver those reinforcements.

40
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,050
 Reporting! 

41
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
Sir, we found this on him.

42
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,910
He hid it in his robe.

43
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,680
Zhuang Zhixing, is this what you wanted?

44
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,850
You'll end up just like your father did!

45
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,780
Wasn't it you who got my father killed?

46
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,510
How dare you say that to me?

47
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,300
If it hadn't been for you, would my family have ended up like this?

48
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,100
You're already General of Exemplary Fortitude.

49
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,870
Why side with him?

50
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,370
Why become a traitor to Great Yong?

51
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,880
Without Grand Secretary Zhao, how could I have achieved such honor today?

52
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,980
I told you long ago

53
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,020
that what I wanted was to restore the Zhuang family to glory!

54
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,830
- You... 
 - All right, enough.

55
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,760
You two have a past friendship.

56
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,490
No need to make this ugly.

57
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,850
You're acting like children.

58
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,540
Zang Hai.

59
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,270
You actually managed to find Minglv Huda's shrine.

60
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,950
You're every bit as capable as your father.

61
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,750
I spent a long time trying to figure out

62
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,900
how to use the Gui Seal to summon the ghost soldiers.

63
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,440
Now I see. This is how it works.

64
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,590
The Queen of Dongxia once had such a treasure,

65
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,420
yet she still lost to Great Yong?

66
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,810
This time, let me show Dongxia how to use it properly.

67
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,050
Sir, I...

68
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:33,140
Bring 1,000 laborers from the Fengshan Altar to the camp.

69
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,560
Yes, sir.

70
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,840
 Someone, help! Help! 

71
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,560
 Something's gone wrong! 

72
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,960
Sir.

73
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,140
Burn the body.

74
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,640
Yes, sir.

75
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,410
Our scouts report that after the failed marriage alliance,

76
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,970
Dongxia is growing restless.

77
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,040
Patrol the surrounding ten li carefully.

78
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,680
Keep Grand Secretary Zhao safe at all costs!

79
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,420
- Yes, sir! 
 - Yes, sir!

80
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,460
You saw this coming, didn't you?

81
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,400
Even though you didn't say anything,

82
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,060
I could tell you were hiding something.

83
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,000
Everything you want to know is in Zhang Mie's manuscript.

84
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,420
You already know how to summon the ghost soldiers.

85
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,580
What more do you want?

86
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,920
I want to know why the ghost soldiers became what they are now,

87
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,480
completely out of control.

88
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,560
You tampered with the manuscript.

89
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,180
You tore something out, didn't you?

90
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,920
The manuscript says Minglv Huda took Zhang Mie's advice

91
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,990
and activated the Gui Seal.

92
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,920
The ghost soldiers crushed the Great Yong army at the gates,

93
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,020
reversing the tide in a single battle.

94
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,960
But not long after,

95
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,400
Minglv Huda died.

96
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,220
Before her death, she ordered Zhang Mie to seal the Gui Seal

97
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,710
and never let it be used again.

98
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,030
Doesn't it feel...

99
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,710
like something's missing in between?

100
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,350
I did tear out one page,

101
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,870
but even if you read it,

102
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,920
it wouldn't be of any help.

103
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,250
What did it say?

104
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,230
Zhang Mie wrote that the soldiers of Dongxia,

105
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,560
turned into ghost soldiers by the Gui Seal,

106
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,800
gained immense strength and became immune to blades.

107
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,590
But over time, they lost all sense of self

108
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,350
and became mindless monsters, unable to tell friends from foes.

109
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,320
Minglv Huda, to prevent them from causing greater disaster,

110
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,110
used her own life to shut down the Gui Seal.

111
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,800
They say the ghost soldiers

112
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,110
crushed cities and fortresses for Dongxia

113
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,590
and were invincible.

114
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,260
If what you say is true,

115
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,400
then why did you tear out that page

116
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,680
and hide it from me?

117
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,470
Those tales are nothing but myths

118
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,680
and rumors repeated until believed.

119
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,980
The ghost soldiers are exactly what you saw.

120
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,100
They cannot be controlled,

121
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,200
nor will they follow commands or fight for you.

122
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,920
They cannot be controlled?

123
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,250
The more you deny something,

124
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,970
the more obvious it becomes that you're hiding something.

125
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:02,530
That missing page probably explained how to control them.

126
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,580
You didn't want anyone to learn the truth,

127
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,510
so you took the manuscript,

128
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,480
but you still miscalculated.

129
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,350
Even if you think I'm lying, what can you do?

130
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,680
Force the truth out of me,

131
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,630
or kill me?

132
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,560
I don't need to do either.

133
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,200
Since you brought the manuscript from the shrine,

134
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,990
the real secret must still be buried there.

135
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,010
There's nothing valuable there.

136
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,640
If you go, you'll be wasting your time.

137
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,610
Why are you so nervous?

138
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,370
I used to think that with the Gui Seal in my hands,

139
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,560
the shrine was meaningless.

140
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,190
But now it seems I really must pay it a visit.

141
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,800
We depart now.

142
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,280
Grand Secretary Zhao.

143
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,110
If we leave at night,

144
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,920
we must be wary of a Dongxia ambush.

145
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,730
Let me escort you.

146
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,960
Very well.

147
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,800
Your Majesty, you haven't been resting well lately.

148
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,920
It's bad for your health. 
    

149
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,510
The Princess left you this medicine before she left.

150
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,230
It's very effective for colds.

151
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,180
You should drink it while it's hot.

152
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,260
Don't mention her.

153
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,870
Bring her up now.

154
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,260
You ruined Dongxia's marriage alliance with the Haidong tribes,

155
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,510
and you still dare to show your face?

156
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,270
I'm here to save you.

157
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,950
What are you talking about?

158
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,590
Zhao Bingwen, Chief Grand Secretary of Great Yong, is already in Dongxia.

159
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,480
He'll make his move against Dongxia soon.

160
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,290
You came back dressed like this just to tell me this?

161
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,600
He was the one who wrote to warn me last time

162
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,600
that you might return to Dongxia with ill intentions.

163
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,400
No wonder you found Zang Hai and me so quickly.

164
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Zhao Bingwen is using you to do his dirty work.

165
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,550
I'll be honest.

166
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,160
Zhao Bingwen came to Dongxia this time specifically to meet with me.

167
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,400
The newly enthroned Emperor of Great Yong

168
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,640
sent Zhao Bingwen, the Chief Grand Secretary,

169
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,510
to Dongxia to speak with me

170
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,630
about improving relations between our nations.

171
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,540
He brought the Gui Seal with him.

172
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,600
He's planning to use it here.

173
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,070
He didn't come for peace.

174
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,510
He wants to meet you so he can take you hostage,

175
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,480
preventing Dongxia from fighting back.

176
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,840
Mingxiang Antu,

177
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,630
you must hope to see me fall out with Great Yong's Chief Grand Secretary

178
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,120
so that I become the one to blame for ruining Dongxia's relations with Great Yong

179
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,990
and you can ascend the throne yourself!

180
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,960
I told you long ago, I have no interest in the throne.

181
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,550
If you don't believe me, lock me up.

182
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,990
But you can't just sit back and let Zhao Bingwen destroy Dongxia.

183
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,400
You think you're so noble, don't you?

184
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,530
I can't stand that righteous look of yours.

185
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,120
You have no idea how terrifying the Gui Seal and the ghost soldiers are.

186
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,160
They can bring disaster

187
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,640
and wipe Dongxia out completely.

188
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,710
If our homeland is gone,

189
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,450
what's the point of the throne?

190
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,360
I found the shrine where the Gui Seal was sealed.

191
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,470
I now understand why Queen Minglv Huda hid it away.

192
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,410
Mother wanted it back

193
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,240
because she also didn't want anyone else to use it.

194
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,270
Sister, you are the Queen of Dongxia.

195
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,310
The people here are your people.

196
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,730
You have to save them.

197
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,550
You can't go in.

198
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,690
If you do, there's no coming back.

199
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,100
Stop trying to scare me.

200
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,680
You made it out just fine.

201
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,970
Why wouldn't I?

202
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,400
All of you, stay here.

203
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,940
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

204
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,510
So, this is where Kuai Duo took the Gui Seal.

205
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,240
Then this must be where the ghost soldiers had come from.

206
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,870
Sir...

207
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,390
Bring it out.

208
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,010
How incredible.

209
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,050
Why do you look so scared?

210
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,440
Take it to him.

211
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,580
Drink it.

212
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,030
You want to know what was on the page I tore out, right?

213
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,920
Do you think this is how it works?

214
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,040
The truth is right there on the murals.

215
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,020
Didn't you teach me to fool others by telling the truth?

216
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:01,140
What Zhang Mie wrote on that page was exactly what I told you.

217
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,710
Ghost soldiers cannot be controlled.

218
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,920
They will only bring disaster.

219
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Shut up!

220
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,950
You'll never be able to use the Gui Seal to achieve your goal.

221
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,100
Zang Hai, the Gui Seal...

222
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,400
is in my hands.

223
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,920
Don't tell me you're trying to kill me with words.

224
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,420
You're not that naive, are you?

225
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,510
Should we head down to check on Grand Secretary Zhao?

226
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,580
He told us to stay here.

227
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,760
We shouldn't act on our own.

228
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,210
Still, I feel worried.

229
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,110
Are you worried about Official Zhao or about Zang Hai?

230
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,200
How dare you attack a court officer?

231
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,230
So what if I did?

232
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,650
We'll blame it on Dongxia.

233
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,790
Do you really think Official Zhao didn't know you let their princess go?

234
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,460
Today, none of you are leaving here alive.

235
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,720
I was about to say the same.

236
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,030
You always thought I was too obsessed with revenge.

237
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,740
But aren't you the same with the Gui Seal?

238
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,310
Even if I told you the truth, you would never believe it.

239
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,330
That's why you came to this cursed place.

240
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,030
You want to know how to control ghost soldiers, right?

241
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:02,910
Then watch closely how they obey my command!

242
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,210
Protect Official Zhao!

243
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,150
Farewell, my "benefactor."

244
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,470
You're finally here.

245
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,410
Where is Zang Hai?

246
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,850
He and Zhao Bingwen are still down there.

247
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,240
Go!

248
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,660
Are you all right?

249
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,640
I'm fine.

250
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,060
My mother wanted it back so no one could ever use it again.

251
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,670
Even the late emperor believed you were right.

252
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,090
I'll tell my sister the Gui Seal has been destroyed

253
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,730
and that Zhao Bingwen died because he used it.

254
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,230
The Gui Seal still holds too many secrets.

255
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,090
We don't yet know what kind of power lies within it.

256
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,680
But as long as it exists,

257
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,500
it remains a threat to the world.

258
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,360
I need to uncover everything about it

259
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,190
and then make sure it vanishes for good.

260
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,250
I thought I'd never set foot in the capital again.

261
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,840
You've served your country well, General.

262
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,160
Now that the new emperor has summoned you back,

263
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,900
I think your wish has finally come true.

264
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,120
Zhao Bingwen's crimes are out in the open now.

265
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,680
His Majesty has reinstated your post as well.

266
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,350
Official Zang, I'll be counting on your support in the days ahead.

267
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,400
Zang Hai, how about a horse race?

268
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,050
Let's see who's faster.

269
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,600
You're a general and a master rider.

270
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,370
Isn't that a little unfair?

271
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,660
You're no amateur on a horse either.

272
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,600
   

273
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,310
Your Majesty, you've won.

274
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,050
Your Majesty.

275
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,120
Zang Hai?

276
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,920
Why didn't you let me know you were here?

277
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,680
I didn't want to disturb Your Majesty.

278
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,960
Since you're here, join me for a round of weiqi.

279
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,750
I'm afraid I'm not skilled enough to play against Your Majesty.

280
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,970
It doesn't matter. I'm no expert myself.

281
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,920
Even before I entered the palace,

282
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,310
I'd already heard of your breadth of knowledge,

283
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,570
your skill in architecture, and your talent for governance.

284
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,880
I'm flattered, Your Majesty.

285
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,650
I come from humble origins

286
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,360
and know only a few petty tricks.

287
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,200
No need to be so modest.

288
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,220
I've heard the late emperor held you in high regard.

289
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,200
What is all this?

290
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,880
Your Majesty, these were made by the late emperor.

291
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,800
We just finished sorting them.

292
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,710
Zang Hai, what do you think I should do with them?

293
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,100
Everything in the palace is at Your Majesty's discretion.

294
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,550
The late emperor loved carpentry.

295
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,900
Since these were dear to him,

296
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,920
have them burned at his tomb.

297
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

298
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,550
Zang Hai, you eliminated traitors for me.

299
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,400
What reward would you like?

300
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,350
Your Majesty, there is one thing I would ask.

301
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,270
The former Imperial Astronomer, Kuai Duo, was loyal to the court.

302
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,960
He was framed by Zhao Bingwen.

303
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,840
I hope Your Majesty can announce the truth to the world.

304
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,880
That's only proper.

305
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,400
It hardly counts as a reward.

306
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,380
Is there anything else you wish for?

307
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:51,190
Your Majesty, I wish to retire and return home.

308
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,150
Zang Hai, I have just ascended the throne,

309
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,850
and I need capable people.

310
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,130
I had hoped you'd return to the Cabinet

311
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,630
to help me oversee officials and administration.

312
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,970
Is that not what you want?

313
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,730
Since I took office, I've lived each day with unease,

314
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,470
burdened by paperwork.

315
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,550
I have come to realize my heart is not in this work,

316
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,070
and that I find no joy in this life.

317
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,950
Even during the late emperor's reign,

318
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,680
I had already longed to resign and live in seclusion.

319
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,860
I ask for Your Majesty's approval.

320
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,530
Are you sure about this?

321
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,070
Very well.

322
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,200
Since your mind is made up, I will not keep you.

323
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Come.

324
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,410
Finish this game with me.

325
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,190
Xiao Hai has returned safely from Dongxia. 
    

326
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,070
Not only did he defeat Zhao Bingwen,

327
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,360
but he also recovered the Gui Seal.

328
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,010
With a student like that,

329
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,860
you truly were an extraordinary master.

330
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,819
   

331
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,493
   

332
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:44,500
You lived as Gao Ming for over a decade.

333
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,790
Now you're buried here by the mountains and streams.

334
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,460
I'd say it's a good resting place.

335
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,990
   

336
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,430
It's too sweet.

337
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,670
I still can't get used to it. 
    

338
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,710
Let's go.

339
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,974
   

340
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,210
Miss, I've got the finest Bamboo Leaf Green wine.

341
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,290
Have a sniff. See if you like it.

342
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,920
Antu.

343
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,220
So, you really resigned?

344
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,380
What? Were you worried I might change my mind?

345
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,650
While you were seeing the Emperor, I went to visit Eighth Young Master.

346
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,090
Eighth Young Master?

347
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,090
Don't tell me she's telling stories again.

348
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,740
No, she's teaching now.

349
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,320
Tong'er is now a teacher at the Academy of Great Yong.

350
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,160
She was so busy with her students

351
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,480
that she barely had time to talk to me.

352
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,570
Let's go.

353
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,850
Xiao Hai!

354
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,720
He said in the letter he'd be here around this time.

355
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,380
Xiao Hai!

356
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,580
Xiao Hai!

357
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,480
Official Zang?

358
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,935
   

359
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:37,350
Did Official Zang leave all this to us? 
    

360
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,580
Where did he go?

361
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,650
Xiao Hai left.

362
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,020
I wonder when we will see him again.

363
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,610
Then let's go find him.

364
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,300
We can't do that.

365
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,300
You see, Xiao Hai left us instructions in his letter.

366
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,100
We've got work to do, too.

367
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:05,090
   

368
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,027
   

369
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,590
My Lord, this way.

370
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,780
   

371
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,700
 - Welcome back, My Lord. 
 - Welcome back, My Lord. 

372

 "It's Me" - Sun Nan 

392
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,720
♫  I conceal the ambition in my eyes  ♫

393
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:41,440
♫  In my palm, I hold a dangerous desire  ♫

394
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,900
♫  Turbulent waves hide in my sleeves  ♫

395
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,400
♫  Silent like the clap of thunder  ♫

396
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,040
♫  The depth of shrewdness   ♫

397
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,220
♫  Can't escape  ♫

398
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,560
♫  My sharp eyes  ♫

399
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:09,720
♫  Conspiracies are my amor  ♫

400
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,710
♫  Overt plans are my sword and spear  ♫

401
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,220
♫  With stoic madness  ♫

402
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,900
♫  I cleanse the filth of the world  ♫

403
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,520
♫  The night is not dark  ♫

404
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,620
♫  Because  ♫

405
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:34,700
♫  My heart is burning bright  ♫

406
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,480
♫  I'm the turning clouds  ♫

407
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,200
♫  I'm the falling rain  ♫

408
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,680
♫  The compass of the human soul is unpredictable  ♫

409
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,060
♫  There will always be people who rise and fall  ♫

410
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,580
♫  I am life and death  ♫

411
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,200
♫  I grant and I deprive  ♫

412
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,760
♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

413
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,460
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫

414
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,720
♫  I am the sowing season  ♫

415
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,440
♫  I am the autumn harvest  ♫

416
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,800
♫  I am the kingdom  ♫

417
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,560
♫  I am the commoner  ♫

418
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,040
♫  You are also me  ♫
