1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:17,100



2
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,510
 This... This is... 

3
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,900
 - Go get help. Now! 
 - Yes, sir! 

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,530
 Hurry! 

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,970
You two, come with me.

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,600
Hurry up!

7
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,780
Hurry!

8
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,690
 In the sixth year of the Zhenshun* era,  
  (*Circa 699 to 738) 

9
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,850
 Great Yong dispatched an army of 200,000 men to conquer Dongxia. 

10
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,530
 The Dongxia army was utterly defeated and surrendered. 

11
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,180
 Great Yong stationed its troops along the border of Dongxia, 

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,270
 and built a Fengshan Altar at the southern foot of Mount Dansui 

13
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,760
 to display its mightiness across the land. 

14
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,256
   

15
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,520
Sir, the Fengshan Altar will be completed in three months.

16
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,610
What's the underground situation?

17
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,870
They dug over a thousand feet deep.

18
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,600
It's almost done.

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,610
Tell them to stop now.

20
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,400
Sir, bad news.

21
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,490
Something has gone wrong underground.

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,980
Lower it!

23
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,310
What happened?

24
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,160
What's wrong with them?

25
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,160
They're still alive. They merely passed out.

26
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,020
Sir, it's too dangerous ahead.

27
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,160
Don't go any farther.

28
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,180
Sir.

29
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,420
- Go and get the rope. 
 - Yes, sir.

30
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,290
Sir, what are those?

31
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,030
Don't go over there.

32
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,310
 Could these be the noises we just heard? 

33
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,270
Li Zheng, don't tell anyone what happened here.

34
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,200
Stay where you are.

35
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,670
Get lost!

36
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,690
Hurry!

37
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,300
Watch out!

38
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,270
Li Zheng!

39
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:06,140
   

40
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,736
   

41
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,800
Senior Brother, I brought the wood.

42
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,790
Come with me.

43
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,110
Watch where you're going!

44
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,150
Zhinu!

45
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,850
Zhinu! Come out now!

46
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,100
Where is he?

47
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm over here. What is it?

48
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,059
Zhinu, they...

49
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,270
- They returned from Dongxia. 
 - What?

50
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,740
 The Marquis is mighty! 

51
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,670
 Great Yong is invincible in the kingdom! 

52
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,150
 The Marquis is mighty! 

53
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,520
 Great Yong is invincible in the kingdom! 

54
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,250
 The Marquis is mighty! 

55
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,340
 The Marquis is mighty! 

56
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,440
 Great Yong is invincible in the kingdom! 

57
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,280
 The Marquis is mighty! 

58
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
 The Marquis is mighty! 

59
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,000
 Great Yong is invincible in the kingdom! 

60
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,450
 The Marquis is mighty! 

61
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,270
 Great Yong is invincible in the kingdom! 

62
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,180
 The Marquis of Pingjin. 

63
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,580
Whose troop is this?

64
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,030
It's the Marquis of Pingjin's.

65
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,910
He guarded the border for ten years. 
    

66
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,870
After his great victory in Dongxia,

67
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,330
he's returning to the capital today in triumph.

68
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,390
This is great!

69
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,960
What about those from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau?

70
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,260
What Imperial Astronomical Bureau?

71
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,970
I don't know much about that.

72
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,500
- The Marquis is mighty! 
  - The Marquis is mighty! 

73
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,120
Let's go.

74
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,100
Let's check if my father is in that carriage.

75
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,370
Please make way.

76
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,790
Please let us through.

77
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,390
 The Marquis is mighty! 

78
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,300
 Great Yong is invincible in the kingdom! 

79
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,480
That's the Marquis of Pingjin's second son.

80
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,670
He's quite handsome.

81
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,610
Yes, this kid's really good-looking.

82
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,890
 The Marquis is mighty! 

83
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,480
 The Marquis is mighty! 

84
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,080
Let's go.

85
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,720
What are you doing? You can't go in.

86
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,850
Step back!

87
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,520
Zhinu! Zhinu!

88
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,000
Why isn't it this the one, too?

89
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,050
Who are you?

90
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,500
How dare you lift my carriage curtain?

91
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,050
I merely took a look at you.

92
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,970
What's the big deal? I didn't do you any harm.

93
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,110
 The Marquis is mighty! 

94
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,600
 The Marquis is mighty! 

95
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,720
 Great Yong is invincible in the kingdom! 

96
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,740
 The Marquis is mighty! 

97
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,490
 Great Yong is invincible in the kingdom! 

98
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,740
Why did you hit me?

99
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,170
How dare you speak to me like that?

100
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,280
You're asking for a beating.

101
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,920
Hurry, run!

102
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,510
- Out of the way! 
 - Hurry!

103
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,320
Out of the way! Out of the way!

104
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,880
Help me!

105
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,510
Move aside! Quick!

106
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,140
Help! Help!

107
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,610
Help...

108
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,100
Help...

109
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,430
Help...

110
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,650
Help...

111
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,260
Be gentle, Little Senior Brother.

112
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,450
Your skin has been lacerated.

113
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,130
Of course, it will hurt.

114
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,900
Master's not here.

115
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,140
With my limited medical skills,

116
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,390
I can only apply ointment for now.

117
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,350
That crazy girl was really ruthless.

118
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,730
Look at these two gashes, one horizontal and one vertical.

119
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,860
It's like your back was carved by a sword.

120
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,290
What did you do to offend her?

121
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,600
I swear to Heaven that I didn't offend her.

122
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,450
I merely wanted to see if my father was inside the carriage.

123
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,080
Who knew she would fly into such a rage?

124
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,530
Who is she to act so high and mighty?

125
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,020
So noisy.

126
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,630
What a bunch of clueless bumpkins.

127
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,660
You don't even know the Commandery Princess of Dongxia?

128
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,100
What did you say? That girl was the Commandery Princess of Dongxia?

129
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,600
What is she doing here in Great Yong?

130
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,510
The Commandery Princess of Dongxia is an honored guest of His Majesty.

131
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,980
She has never been slighted by anyone.

132
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,730
What a rotten savage.

133
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,020
Let me ask you.

134
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
Did my father return with you?

135
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,450
Who is your father?

136
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,050
My father is Kuai Duo, Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

137
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,120
You tied me up and brought me here to ask me this question?

138
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,680
I am thirsty. I want a cup of water.

139
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,690
Seriously...

140
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,500
What kind of lousy water is this?

141
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,840
It's so murky and has a foul taste.

142
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,080
Don't drink it then.

143
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,450
What's with the crap talk?

144
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,340
- Eat shit! 
 - Tell me.

145
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,620
Have you seen my father?

146
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,860
I'm not telling you.

147
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,110
What can you do to me?

148
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,100
You won't tell us? Beat him up!

149
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,510
Are you going to talk or not?

150
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,000
- Are you going to talk or not? 
 - Enough. Stop beating him.

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,290
- No, I refuse to talk. 
 - You refuse to talk?

152
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,480
- Stop it! 
 - I won't tell you!

153
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,750
Are you going to talk or not?

154
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,960
I won't tell you!

155
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,510
It's three against one.

156
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,900
How despicable!

157
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,680
When I become a general in the future, I'll kill you all!

158
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,800
 The Marquis of Pingjin has returned. 

159
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,050
 - Why isn't our master back yet? 
 - He'll be back soon. 

160
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,550
The senior brothers should be returning.

161
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,550
Zhinu, I'll go out to stall them.

162
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,750
Gou Sheng, take care of things here.

163
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,700
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

164
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,440
My mother made this.

165
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,990
Eat up.

166
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,120
You definitely haven't eaten something this delicious.

167
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,630
I won't...

168
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,100
What do you think?

169
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,610
The ingredients are crude and unrefined but...

170
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,630
the taste is acceptable.

171
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,270
I don't know you and I don't want to bully you.

172
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,200
I only have some questions.

173
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,360
Answer me, and I'll let you go.

174
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,590
Apply medicine on my wounds first.

175
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,500
On our way back to the capital,

176
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,100
I heard people say that the Fengshan Altar collapsed.

177
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,200
The Fengshan Altar collapsed?

178
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,100
Yes. Your father won't be coming back.

179
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,360
When the Fengshan Altar collapsed,

180
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,260
everyone from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau was buried underground.

181
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,340
You're lying.

182
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,510
My father built the Fengshan Altar. It would never collapse.

183
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,290
He's the best geomancer in Great Yong.

184
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,900
Geomancers are also humans.

185
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,390
The Fengshan Altar did collapse.

186
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,670
According to my father's subordinates,

187
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,550
those construction workers were buried underground and died.

188
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,720
Nonsense!

189
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,990
My father didn't die.

190
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
He definitely didn't die!

191
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,690
 It's a little tiger. 

192
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,500
 Did you think I would really forget? 

193
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,770
 I always keep my promises to you. 

194
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,340
 What did you see while stargazing tonight? 

195
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,510
 My senior brothers told me 

196
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,340
 there will be meteors in the Seven Mansions of the Eastern Azure Dragon, 

197
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,920
 but when I got here, I didn't see a single one. 

198
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,200
 It's fine. 

199
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,000
 Those are meteors from the Scorpio Mansion. 

200
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,800
 Just wait until next year. 

201
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,100
 If you're patient, you'll definitely get to see them. 

202
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,620
 But when I stargaze next year, 

203
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,350
 you won't be here with me. 

204
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,480
 When I'm not home, listen to your mother, 

205
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,690
 and look after your younger sister. When I return, 

206
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,160
 I'll make you a bigger one. 

207
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,630
 All right? 

208
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,140
 Besides practicing what I've taught you 

209
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,620
 about geomancy and construction, 

210
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,160
 be diligent in your studies. 

211
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,680
 Read regularly, work hard on your calligraphy, 

212
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,270
 and ask your mother if there's anything you don't understand. 

213
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,960
 Since you're leaving tomorrow, 

214
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,400
 why not come with me to check my big project? 

215
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,870
 Let's go. 

216
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,190
 Father, look. 

217
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,380
 When did you dig up such a huge cellar? 

218
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,380
 It didn't take long. 

219
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,110
 I used the techniques you taught me and completed it quickly. 

220
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,030
 I even dug a tunnel from here to the kitchen. 

221
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,780
 It's right behind the water bucket. 

222
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,790
 So, that's why food kept disappearing from the kitchen lately. 

223
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,550
 It was you all along. 

224
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,730
 Don't tell Mother about this. 

225
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,880
 I want to dig lots of secret tunnels to different places. 

226
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,860
 I'll stash food and water in the cellar, 

227
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,410
 When Mother wants to beat me up, 

228
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,280
 I'll hide down there for three days and nights. 

229
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,200
 This is really a massive project. 

230
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,510
 By the time you return, it'll be completed. 

231
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,020
 By then, you can check if I'm 

232
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,880
 qualified to be a Calendrical Official in the Five Offices. 

233
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,070
 You still have a long way to go. 

234
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,330
 Promise me first that the house won't collapse from your digging. 

235
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,550
 Help... 

236
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,760
Mother! Mother!

237
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,880
No wonder people from the Marquis residence are looking for him in the streets.

238
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,980
Turns out you were hiding him here.

239
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,680
Mother, I didn't suffocate him.

240
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,820
- How did he end up like this? 
 - Shut up.

241
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,060
He's badly injured and you still confined him here.

242
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,350
You don't know the severity.

243
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,900
This kid is lucky to survive today.

244
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,140
I'll take him home and apologize to his family.

245
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,060
But his father is the Marquis of Pingjin.

246
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,000
He'll complain to his father.

247
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,550
Only cowards will complain to adults.

248
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,440
Once I've recovered, I'll be back to beat you up.

249
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,930
Come, I'll take you home.

250
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,560
Come here.

251
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,300
You three committed a big mistake.

252
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,830
You won't be spared that easily.

253
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,240
Guan Feng, go to the back mountain and chop ten days' worth of firewood.

254
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,030
Don't leave the mountain until the work is done.

255
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,690
Gou Sheng, you're punished to clean the latrines for a month.

256
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,040
No slacking off.

257
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,620
As for you, seal off all those tunnels.

258
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,070
You're not allowed to play there in the future.

259
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,200
Mother, you can punish me however you want,

260
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,410
but don't make me seal off the tunnels.

261
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,000
They are for Father to see.

262
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,350
He said Father was buried underground. That's why I…

263
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,880
You're spouting utter nonsense.

264
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,290
Let's go.

265
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,970
Older Brother, what are you doing?

266
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,070
- Go away! 
 - Have some candies, Older Brother.

267
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,290
I'm not eating your stuff, you little tattletale!

268
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,580
I'm sorry, Older Brother.

269
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,760
Father!

270
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,990
Zhinu.

271
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,310
Father, you are back.

272
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,480
I thought you were dead.

273
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,190
It's all right.

274
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,770
I'm back, aren't I?

275
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,270
It's good that you're back.

276
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,140
It's good that you're back.

277
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,200
Pack up the belongings immediately.

278
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
Tell everyone that

279
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,960
we're leaving the capital tonight.

280
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,040
Leaving tonight?

281
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,720
What happened?

282
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,000
No time to explain now.

283
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,110
I'll tell you everything on the way.

284
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,390
Go and wake up Yuenu first.

285
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,400
All right.

286
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,470
Hurry, Zhinu.

287
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,640
Wake everyone up.

288
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,390
Go now. Be quick.

289
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,400
Yuenu, wake up.

290
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,790
Come here.

291
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,420
I will carry you.

292
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,030
Mother, what's wrong?

293
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,030
Your father is back.

294
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,720
Father is back?

295
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,760
Wake up!

296
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,830
Wake up!

297
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,240
My father is back!

298
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,210
Gou Sheng! Gou Sheng, wake up now!

299
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,200
Master?

300
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,270
- Get up! 
 - Master is back.

301
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,170
- What's going on? 
 - Get up.

302
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,030
It's the middle of the night.

303
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,250
Gou Sheng, my father...

304
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,920
My father has returned.

305
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,970
- Master. 
 - Master.

306
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,730
- Master. 
 - You are back.

307
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,480
- Master. 
 - Everyone's up?

308
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,400
Everyone, pack up quickly.

309
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,830
We need to leave here tonight.

310
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,700
Where are we going?

311
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,490
Who's up there?

312
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,660
Run!

313
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,920
Take your sister to the haystack in the back courtyard and hide there.

314
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,160
Don't come out unless I say so.

315
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,750
Mother, is it because of me?

316
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,680
I made the mistake, I'll own up to it.

317
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,200
Be good, it's not your fault.

318
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,470
Go now. Hurry and go!

319
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,250
Hurry.

320
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,010
Let's go.

321
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,680
Yuenu, hide inside.

322
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,030
Stay put and don't make a sound.

323
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,440
I'll check what's going on.

324
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,860
Wait for me.

325
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,610
   

326
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,040
Sir Kuai, it's been a long time.

327
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,920
Marquis, you came too suddenly.

328
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,550
Forgive me for not receiving you properly.

329
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,400
You're appointed by the imperial court

330
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,830
to oversee the construction of Fengshan Altar.

331
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,060
Why did you privately return to the capital?

332
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,010
I am guilty.

333
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:01,960
Are you guilty of the Fengshan Altar's collapse

334
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,480
or of taking something that you shouldn't have taken?

335
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,270
I...

336
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,560
don't understand what you're saying, Marquis.

337
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,200
I heard you've a son and a daughter.

338
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,830
Qu Jiao, go find them now.

339
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,900
Once the children are here,

340
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,270
Sir Kuai will perhaps understand.

341
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,820
Yes, My Lord.

342
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,350
I'm guilty. It's for the imperial court to punish me.

343
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,220
I'm the imperial court.

344
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:41,140
Hand over the item and I'll spare your life.

345
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,760
I don't understand what the item is that you want.

346
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,400
Don't blame me for not being polite with you, then.

347
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,040
Qu Jiao!

348
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,020
No!

349
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,180
Run!

350
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,030
Where did you hide it?

351
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,830
Take my life if you want.

352
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,640
Spare these kids.

353
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,810
They're innocent.

354
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,160
So brave of you to face death head-on.

355
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,530
I won't kill you...

356
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,040
but can you bear to watch them die, one by one, because of you?

357
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,810
Zhuang Luyin!

358
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,630
Hurry up and hide!

359
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,250
Are you Kuai Duo's daughter?

360
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,160
Come here.

361
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,350
I'll take you to see your parents.

362
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,430
Marquis.

363
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,530
- Yuenu. 
 - Father. Mother.

364
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,420
Yuenu.

365
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,060
Kuai Duo, what's the point?

366
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,240
The Fengshan Altar incident has sealed your fate.

367
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,160
What I want is the item you took from Dongxia.

368
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,880
Hand it over,

369
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,120
and I'll plead for your mercy before His Majesty.

370
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,510
If you really meant that,

371
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,550
why would you kill so many people?

372
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,720
Their lives are worthless anyway.

373
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,780
You can always recruit new ones.

374
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,190
But if you keep resisting...

375
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,320
Mother.

376
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,040
It won't just be the disciples who end up dead.

377
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,310
If you still don't talk, I'll kill your son first,

378
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,630
followed by your daughter.

379
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,880
Don't kill him. He's only my disciple.

380
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,880
We know you have a ten-year-old son.

381
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,480
Kid, is he your father?

382
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,660
Father. Mother. I'm not afraid of death.

383
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,150
No!

384
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,900
No!

385
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,620
No!

386
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,850
No!

387
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,050
Father!

388
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,490
Don't kill him.

389
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,610
You now only have one daughter left.

390
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,450
Kuai Duo.

391
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,700
Father. Mother.

392
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,220
Yuenu.

393
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,090
Yuenu, be good.

394
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,570
Don't be afraid.

395
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,030
Yuenu, I'm here.

396
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,220
I'm so sorry.

397
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,350
Yuenu!

398
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,660
Yuenu, my daughter!

399
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,500
Yue...Yue...

400
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,330
Yue...

401
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,760
The only one left now is your wife.

402
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:14,840
I will take her back and cut off her fingers one by one.

403
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:20,320
When that happens, can you still be able to stay silent?

404
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,480
Shangxian!

405
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,070
My wife,

406
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,570
Shangxian.

407
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:57,920
Don't let them succeed.

408
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,290
Shangxian.

409
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,680
Mother.

410
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,010
I took what you're looking for.

411
00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:00,310
But even if you turn this place upside down,

412
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,240
you won't find it.

413
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,370
Zhuang Luyin,

414
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,920
you will never get it!

415
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,460
Don't let him…

416
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,890
Father.

417
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,180
(Stay alive.)

418
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,190
Marquis, we kept watch on this place the whole night.

419
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,630
Since Kuai Duo returned,

420
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,510
he didn't have the time to hide anything.

421
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,670
Search his body.

422
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,210
Yes, Marquis.

423
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,440
Marquis, dawn is approaching.

424
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,710
You know what to do.

425
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,330
Yes, Marquis.

426
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:12,000
Find all the valuables and take them away.

427
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,490
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

428
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,230
Set the place on fire.

429
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:16,940



430
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,270
