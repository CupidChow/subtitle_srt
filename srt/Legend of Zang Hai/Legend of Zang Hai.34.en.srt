1
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,100
A state's deadly weapon

4
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,050
must not be revealed.

5
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,640
A ruler's weakness

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,550
must not be exposed.

7
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,960
But Kuai Duo,

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,020
you truly know

9
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,500
a lot of my weaknesses.

10
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,450
Kuai Duo.

11
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,580
You've been tremendously helpful.

12
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,090
Your kindness won't go unrewarded.

13
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,700
Judging from your intelligence and talent,

14
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,450
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

15
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,140
doesn't deserve you.

16
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,100
Let me find a way

17
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,930
to get you into the Cabinet.

18
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,820
Then,

19
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,540
you can work for me with all your heart.

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,730
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,610
May I ask for a favor?

22
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,300
I'm listening.

23
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,820
Those years

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,170
in the mausoleum left me with

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,980
blood deficiency.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,610
Then,

27
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,650
I spent another three years in Dongxia,

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,380
drained by the extreme cold.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,610
I'm afraid I won't be able to serve Your Majesty anymore.

30
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,330
I'd like to

31
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,650
resign from work and return to my hometown.

32
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,540
You want to leave?

33
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,330
I'd like to relocate my family

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,820
to Zhenning

35
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,330
and settle into our ancestral property.

36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,020
Zhenning is not far from the capital.

37
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,420
If Your Majesty misses me,

38
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,450
you can summon me at any time.

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,490
On your way back from the north,

40
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,540
was there anything strange?

41
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,330
No.

42
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,580
Does anyone know you came to the palace?

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,730
I

44
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,260
took the secret passage.

45
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,300
What about your family?

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,700
I haven't gone home yet.

47
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,100
Kuai Duo.

48
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,420
You didn't lie to me, right?

49
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,820
I

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,170
dare not.

51
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,450
Good.

52
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,210
I will grant your wish.

53
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,720
Take your family

54
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,540
and leave tonight.

55
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

56
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,180
I humbly

57
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,820
take my leave.

58
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,970
Your Majesty.

59
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,650
The Kuai family's house caught fire last night.

60
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,700
This morning, the Ministry of Justice reported

61
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,650
that the whole family was killed by bandits.

62
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,850
What about Kuai Duo?

63
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,090
No one survived.

64
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,770
Everyone was burned

65
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,140
out of recognition.

66
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,020
Your Majesty.

67
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,020
Should I send someone to double-check it?

68
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,620
No need.

69
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,330
I didn't expect

70
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,890
that your father would die.

71
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,930
I failed to protect

72
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,740
my most loyal minister.

73
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,820
Tell me.

74
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,020
What did you see that night?

75
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,330
Your Majesty

76
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,180
really wants to know?

77
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,290
Tell me.

78
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,090
They threatened to kill my fellow disciples

79
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,580
to find out where the Gui Seal was.

80
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,410
My father remained silent.

81
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,940
They killed my fellow disciples

82
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,780
and threatened my father with the life

83
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,700
of my sister Yuenu.

84
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,620
Still, my father remained silent.

85
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,410
They killed my sister and my mother.

86
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,890
My father killed himself

87
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,940
out of devastation.

88
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,770
Now I see

89
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,820
why my father chose that as his ending.

90
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,180
Kuai Duo

91
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,380
took my secret to the grave.

92
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,180
I

93
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,360
failed him.

94
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,180
Your Majesty.

95
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,740
[Cao's Mansion]

96
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,530
Your Majesty.

97
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,020
Cao Jingxian is dead.

98
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,220
Your Majesty.

99
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,620
Preliminary examination shows

100
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,340
that Mr. Cao's body is badly decomposed.

101
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,620
I did a rough calculation.

102
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,620
He's been dead for at least five days.

103
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,930
But the officers in the mansion died just now.

104
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,530
Some corpses are still warm.

105
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,460
How did they die?

106
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,220
From poisoning.

107
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,220
There are no traces of fighting.

108
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,980
Have you found the item?

109
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,100
Not yet.

110
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,690
I'll keep looking for it.

111
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,650
You may leave.

112
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,770
The Surveillance Office has been reporting to me

113
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,260
just as usual

114
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,650
in the past few days.

115
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,220
Your Majesty.

116
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,140
Someone discovered Cao Jingxian's secret

117
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,260
and hid the fact that he died.

118
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,220
This person took over the Surveillance Office

119
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,410
and killed everyone in Cao's Mansion.

120
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,460
It was such an elaborate plan.

121
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,770
I am afraid

122
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,140
that my third enemy has shown up.

123
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,260
If Cao Jingxian had died from serious injury,

124
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,740
then the officers would have known.

125
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,140
It would have been hard

126
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,260
to mobilize them.

127
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,340
There was only one way

128
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,690
to avoid that.

129
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,770
Cao Jingxian concealed the fact that he was dying

130
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,290
and asked his confidants

131
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,260
to work for someone else

132
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,440
and keep mobilizing

133
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,500
the officers with his secret token.

134
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,500
In that case,

135
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,810
your third enemy has the Gui Seal now.

136
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,220
You came here today

137
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,140
to look for your third enemy.

138
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,100
Without my help,

139
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,620
you can't fight him or even find him.

140
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,220
I've told you

141
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,770
the truth you wanted.

142
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,770
Now,

143
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,740
you should bring the Gui Seal back.

144
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,100
I will not let you down,

145
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,340
Your Majesty.

146
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,220
But I need another favor from you.

147
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,410
I'm listening.

148
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,770
At the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

149
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,770
if it weren't for the Queen of Dongxia and the royal hostage,

150
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,690
Cao Jingxian could have killed me.

151
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,020
The Queen of Dongxia died to save the royal hostage.

152
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,690
The royal hostage wasn't the culprit.

153
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,460
I implore Your Majesty

154
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,260
to release the hostage.

155
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:06,930
Alright.

156
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,980
I will release the hostage as you wish.

157
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

158
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,770
This is the Sword of Justice.

159
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,980
He who wields this sword acts with my authority.

160
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,500
I'm giving this sword to you.

161
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,050
Find out the truth.

162
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,340
Move fast.

163
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,770
Otherwise,

164
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,770
what awaits us is a bloody storm.

165
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,050
Let's go.

166
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,810
I'll take you home.

167
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,900
[The Great Prison]

168
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,340
Sir.

169
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,460
Sir.

170
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,170
Hai.

171
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,800
W-We've been waiting for you all night.

172
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,140
Mr. Gao said you would come.

173
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,770
Master.

174
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,930
Miss.

175
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,220
You've suffered in there.

176
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,620
I hope they didn't torture you.

177
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,860
I'm fine.

178
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,340
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

179
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,570
Stop wasting time.

180
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,740
Let's go.

181
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,860
Sir, get in the carriage with Miss Xiang first.

182
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,770
Master, I...

183
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,980
What are you waiting for?

184
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,460
Do you want to stay more?

185
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,500
Master, I...

186
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,620
Let's go home.

187
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,100
Let's go.

188
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,380
Let's go home.

189
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,460
Come on.

190
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,980
The Zhen Tower is shut down.

191
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,740
I'm looking for the right person to take over.

192
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,020
The servants and maids

193
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,650
of Zhen Tower are quick-handed.

194
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,740
We'll find a way to keep them around.

195
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,930
I bet it won't be easy.

196
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,940
Thank you for your effort.

197
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,570
I'm grateful that they get to stay.

198
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,180
[Zang Residence]

199
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,660
Antu.

200
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,980
Make yourself at home here.

201
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,830
I'll ask someone to change the bedding.

202
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,220
This is your room from now on.

203
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,610
Isn't this your bedroom?

204
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,980
Where will you stay?

205
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,180
I'm sure I can find a room

206
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,610
in this huge residence.

207
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,900
So don't worry.

208
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,420
You must be tired.

209
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,020
I prepared hot water and clothes.

210
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,700
Have a good rest.

211
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,740
Don't go.

212
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,770
I don't want to be alone.

213
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,980
Alright.

214
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,810
I'll keep you company.

215
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,460
You fool.

216
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,130
You risked everything

217
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,370
just to save me.

218
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,530
Didn't I tell you

219
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,660
that I wouldn't let you go?

220
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,130
From now on,

221
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,420
you are my family.

222
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,130
Did Cao Jingxian

223
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,290
do anything when I was in jail?

224
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,660
He's dead.

225
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,130
You killed him?

226
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,290
When His Majesty's people found him,

227
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,810
he was already dead.

228
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,940
It's a pity that I didn't kill him in person

229
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,700
to avenge my mother.

230
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,740
It's over.

231
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,570
His Majesty has demoted me to a commoner.

232
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,880
Dongxia no longer recognizes me as a princess.

233
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,330
From now on,

234
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,260
I'm nobody.

235
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,420
Look.

236
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,530
I used to be broke.

237
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,900
And you're an ordinary lady now.

238
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,570
We don't get to

239
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,230
look down on each other anymore.

240
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,370
You're always

241
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,050
such a smooth talker.

242
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,900
I'm actually

243
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,130
terrible with words when I'm with you.

244
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,900
Antu.

245
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,290
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

246
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,980
This is great.

247
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,700
You're finally back.

248
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,810
That's enough.

249
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,020
I'm alright.

250
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,220
It's over.

251
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,810
Why are you standing there?

252
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,900
I thought that you might be overwhelmed.

253
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,770
So I came to help you.

254
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,770
You'll just stand there?

255
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,290
What are you cooking,

256
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,700
Master?

257
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,610
You'll see when they're ready.

258
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,130
I've never seen you cook.

259
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,810
I swear I will eat more.

260
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Don't flatter yourself.

261
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,670
These are not for you.

262
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,980
Not this one.

263
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,660
Master.

264
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,610
Forgive me.

265
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,810
You're always right.

266
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,260
What did you do wrong?

267
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,020
I shouldn't have left without telling you

268
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,520
in advance.

269
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,870
You did well by not telling me.

270
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,500
I would have caused you trouble.

271
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,330
No, Master.

272
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,310
I made a mistake.

273
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,740
You once told me

274
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,130
the most important thing in revenge is staying alive.

275
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,740
You did what you did to save Miss Xiang.

276
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,900
I believe you did that

277
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,130
with absolute confidence.

278
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,940
But you never know.

279
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,180
Even the tightest plan

280
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,660
may have gaps.

281
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,180
I can't put you in danger.

282
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,740
Master.

283
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,610
Let me see.

284
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,500
Tell me.

285
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,180
What binds a master to their disciple?

286
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,160
You said

287
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,940
that a master should

288
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,980
protect his disciple

289
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,610
and the disciple

290
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,610
should follow the master's lead.

291
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,290
So you remember

292
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,460
that the master should protect his disciple.

293
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,260
No true master

294
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,220
would ever let his disciple take a blow

295
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,740
while he stood aside.

296
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:32,900
Master.

297
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,770
Ten years ago,

298
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,850
Master Xing Dou and you looked after me and taught me everything you knew.

299
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,220
That was how I survived to this day.

300
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,570
I've long since

301
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,810
seen you as my father.

302
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,980
As your son,

303
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,740
I want you to stay safe and sound.

304
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,700
So I'll do the same

305
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,100
if it happens again.

306
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,460
Parents

307
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,570
would rather die for their children

308
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,810
than to live alone.

309
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,900
To take revenge, you must first survive.

310
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,900
To save lives, survive harder.

311
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,980
You made it this time.

312
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,900
And here you are, apologizing to me.

313
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,260
But what if you lost?

314
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,770
Then I'd lose my only disciple.

315
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,530
I've aged.

316
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,760
You're my only disciple.

317
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,090
If you're killed,

318
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,180
who's going to take care of me till I die?

319
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,610
Master.

320
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,700
I swear I'll...

321
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,220
You must stay alive

322
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,850
and take care of me.

323
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,770
Enough. Tell me everything.

324
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,020
What trick did you pull

325
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,260
to deceive His Majesty?

326
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,370
Actually,

327
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,980
I just told His Majesty

328
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,290
the truth.

329
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,570
You deceived him with the truth?

330
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,090
If there is going to be a "Fraud Gang",

331
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,250
I bet you'll be

332
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,500
the gang leader.

333
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,460
Tell me.

334
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,770
How did you deceive him?

335
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,570
Master.

336
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,420
Your hand...

337
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,740
Let me get some medicine.

338
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,130
Stop there.

339
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,570
Don't divert the subject

340
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,740
or keep me curious.

341
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,370
Do you know what I regret most

342
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,740
after slapping you?

343
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,050
I don't feel sorry for you.

344
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,570
But I can't bring myself

345
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,980
to ask you what happened last night.

346
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,770
You're lying again.

347
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,900
You don't easily feel awkward.

348
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,220
You obviously feel sorry for me.

349
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,370
You...

350
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,260
Want another slap?

351
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,370
Just say it.

352
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,020
Fine.

353
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,130
I didn't lie to His Majesty.

354
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,700
I just...

355
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,740
I...

356
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,460
Master.

357
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,370
The soup.

358
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,700
My soup.

359
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,050
- Be careful. - It's burning.

360
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,610
Remove the lid.

361
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,100
[Open-minded and Humble]

362
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,460
Come on, food is ready.

363
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,130
Mr. Gao made all these.

364
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,500
Really?

365
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,850
Where did

366
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,740
Miss Fengliu go?

367
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,740
She went to pack at the Hostage's Mansion.

368
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,330
So,

369
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,940
are they moving here?

370
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,810
A-Aren't you silly?

371
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,880
Miss Xiang has moved here.

372
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,720
Of course, they will

373
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,740
move here.

374
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,610
Okay, smartypants.

375
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,370
Why did you hit me?

376
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,850
- Shut up. - A gentleman shouldn't...

377
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,850
I heard that Mr. Gao made

378
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,090
all these dishes in person

379
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,660
with Mr. Zang's assistance.

380
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,220
Mr. Gao.

381
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,370
Tell us.

382
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,330
Why did you choose

383
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,460
to make these dishes?

384
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,050
Let me tell you about these dishes.

385
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,980
This is stir-fried pork liver and tripe,

386
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,260
which is nourishing,

387
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,500
but it's "heartless."

388
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,660
That is fried chicken.

389
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,810
That chicken was ungrateful

390
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,610
and ran around without crowing.

391
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,130
So I cooked it.

392
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,260
This is fish with vinegar.

393
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,180
This fish has no spines, no bones, and "no shame."

394
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,850
Feel free to dig in.

395
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,540
Fish is brain food.

396
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,770
These are grilled oysters.

397
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,810
Like an oyster, someone only opens up under fire...

398
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,460
Master.

399
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,720
I'll punish myself with three drinks.

400
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,900
Mr. Gao.

401
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,090
He did it to save me.

402
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,150
Let me drink on his behalf.

403
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,220
Miss Antu.

404
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,740
Take it slow.

405
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,090
It has nothing to do with you.

406
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,020
This rascal tricked me.

407
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,570
I can't get over it.

408
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,180
What's your problem?

409
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,220
You have a great disciple.

410
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,740
Shouldn't you be happy about it?

411
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,850
Master Liuchu.

412
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,180
Am I late

413
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,420
for the Survivor's Feast?

414
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,510
Please stop teasing us.

415
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,850
As the saying goes,

416
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,050
"What doesn't kill you makes you luckier."

417
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,940
This should be

418
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,810
the Fortune Feast.

419
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,220
Liuchu.

420
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,480
I didn't expect

421
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,130
that a beauty like you would become so pale

422
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,360
in such a short time.

423
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,460
I brought you

424
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,220
some rouge and powder.

425
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,330
Antu.

426
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,660
Those things are over.

427
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,130
Pull yourself together.

428
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,180
We have to live on

429
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,160
and live well.

430
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,740
Thank you, Liuchu.

431
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,770
Don't stand around.

432
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,260
Be seated.

433
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,810
Master Liuchu, come and sit here.

434
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,360
Everybody's happy.

435
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,570
Why are you pulling a long face?

436
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,570
Look at me.

437
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,050
Look at me.

438
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,180
Smile.

439
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,570
Smile.

440
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,770
Forget it.

441
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,940
It's worse than crying.

442
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,460
Get lost.

443
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,090
Hai,

444
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,130
you did well by rescuing Antu.

445
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,460
Caring and loyal.

446
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,150
Yeah, caring and loyal.

447
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,220
Everyone is here.

448
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,280
Let's drink to celebrate our reunion.

449
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,860
Yeah, let's have a drink.

450
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,420
- Come on. - Come on.

451
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,090
- Cheers. - To our reunion.

452
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,420
To our reunion.

453
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,740
Come on.

454
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,570
The moon hangs

455
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,940
nearly whole tonight, but not quite.

456
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,290
But it will be complete.

457
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,530
What's wrong?

458
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,940
Although Cao Jingxian is dead,

459
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,740
I don't feel relieved.

460
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,090
The third enemy has surfaced.

461
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,130
Your mind is occupied.

462
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,500
From the moment I knew he existed,

463
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,050
only two thoughts remained:

464
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,090
Who is he?

465
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,570
And how will I kill him?

466
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,180
But as I was having food with you,

467
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,290
for a fleeting moment,

468
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,420
my attention

469
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,500
seemed to have shifted.

470
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,180
Because you are no longer

471
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,740
who you used to be when we first met.

472
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,290
Although I stay with Hai

473
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,610
all day long,

474
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,090
you are the one who knows him the best.

475
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,380
I'm also his master,

476
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,650
although I didn't teach him anything.

477
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,740
Be tender like water.

478
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,900
Water can carry a boat, but it can also overturn it.

479
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,740
In the end, he has to learn it himself.

480
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,370
Looks like

481
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,660
your "miracle in desperation" prediction

482
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,940
was spot-on.

483
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,500
If love is true and steadfast through the years,

484
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,130
need we cling to day and night together...?

485
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,220
Stop drinking.

486
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,740
You're right.

487
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,420
I drank too much.

488
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,940
Now, both my third enemy and I are deploying our pawns

489
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,090
as if playing chess.

490
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,130
I may seem to have the upper hand,

491
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,050
but my enemy is lurking in the dark

492
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,770
and may fight back at any time.

493
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,460
I have to be extra careful

494
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,020
and keep the bronze fish safe.

495
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,500
Even the slightest mistake...

496
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,690
I used to witness

497
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,720
the hustle and bustle of the capital in the Zhen Tower.

498
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,120
Sometimes, I would think,

499
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,500
"If only I were nobody but the owner

500
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,860
of the Zhen Tower."

501
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,440
But deep down,

502
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,900
I knew it was impossible.

503
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,980
That was my fate.

504
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,980
Meanwhile,

505
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,420
you're bound by fate to avenge.

506
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,610
Don't overthink.

507
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,200
Don't worry about us, either.

508
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,650
We chose to stand by you.

509
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,610
I,

510
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:04,900
Mr. Gao,

511
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,760
Guanfeng, Shilei,

512
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,060
and Liuchu

513
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,400
are willing to embark on

514
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,610
this dangerous journey with you.

515
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,690
No.

516
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,350
I don't want you to be in danger

517
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,610
because of me.

518
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,250
Go talk to Mr. Gao.

519
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,050
You're halfway through your revenge.

520
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,570
Ask him if he will

521
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,050
let you finish it by yourself.

522
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,610
I can't disobey my master.

523
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,570
But

524
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,460
I really don't want to implicate you.

525
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,730
You have your way

526
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,020
of protecting your family.

527
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,380
I have my way, too.

528
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,800
Deal with the trickery and treachery

529
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,980
in the court.

530
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,610
But leave the fights and combats

531
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,020
of the martial world to me.

532
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,300
Alright.

533
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,900
Stop frowning.

534
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,650
Tell me

535
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,420
about your plan.

536
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,720
Judging from the tacit understanding between Cao Jingxian and this person,

537
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,460
my third enemy must be close enough to the core of the court

538
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,570
to be able to handle everything

539
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,940
so casually.

540
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,780
Now,

541
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,210
I can only utilize the power granted by His Majesty

542
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,730
to look into Cao Jingxian's case as a start.

543
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,780
I don't believe that person outsmarts you.

544
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,530
And you're backed by His Majesty.

545
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,500
I'm sure you'll find your enemy soon.

546
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,460
I hope so.

547
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,690
Once you find your third enemy

548
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,530
and take revenge,

549
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,820
let's leave this place.

550
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,900
We will go wherever

551
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,050
you want to go.

552
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,050
Alright.

553
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,690
Once I get my revenge,

554
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,730
we will leave this place.

555
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,780
Mr. Zang.

556
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,690
You have inspected all the bodies.

557
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,420
Any findings?

558
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,980
As the coroners said,

559
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,300
there were no external injuries.

560
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,020
They died from poisoning

561
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,380
with fish skin and flesh left in their stomachs.

562
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,500
They must have had the highly toxic fish soup.

563
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,820
Those officers were truly loyal.

564
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,380
They actually killed themselves for Cao Jingxian.

565
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,050
Are you saying

566
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,020
that they did it voluntarily?

567
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,420
All the officers died from poisoning

568
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,210
in Cao's Mansion.

569
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,570
It does look like a suicide.

570
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,340
But they died with twisted,

571
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,570
agonized expressions as if they were murdered.

572
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,300
Suicide by taking poison is agonizing, anyway.

573
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,980
I carefully inspected the fingers

574
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,250
of all the corpses.

575
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,340
Several corpses had soil in their nails.

576
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,530
Even if they were in pain,

577
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,170
where did they find soil

578
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,860
in Mr. Cao's room?

579
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,300
Are you saying

580
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,020
that they were moved to the room after they died

581
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,940
and disguised as poisoned?

582
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,650
Mr. Zuo.

583
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,780
I'm afraid the clue we're looking for

584
00:37:59,270 --> 00:37:59,940
isn't here.

585
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,650
It's with Lu Yan.

586
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,780
Lu Yan?

587
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,810
There were 30 officers in Cao's Mansion.

588
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,570
But there are only 29 corpses here.

589
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,380
The missing person

590
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,090
is Lu Yan.

591
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,170
But we've searched

592
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,090
every corner of Cao's Mansion

593
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,690
and didn't find her body.

594
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,530
I'm afraid that Lu Yan is still alive.

595
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,860
If this was a targeted poisoning,

596
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,550
there'd be no survivors left.

597
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,370
Perhaps Lu Yan

598
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,900
noticed something in advance and escaped.

599
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,980
Or she was the one who poisoned them.

600
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,090
We will only

601
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,780
find the answer after we talk to her.

602
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,300
I'll ask His Majesty

603
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,530
to search for her.

604
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,570
By the way.

605
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,650
Someone else

606
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,860
is involved in this case,

607
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,250
though not an officer.

608
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,250
Who is it?

609
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,570
Shi Quan, Deputy Inspector of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

610
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,650
Lu Yan and Lu Fen are missing.

611
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,020
We need another lead and stop wasting time

612
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,860
on this one.

613
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,680
Now, the third enemy has obtained the Gui Seal

614
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,780
and is only one step away from gathering

615
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,020
all three bronze fishes.

616
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,570
He will definitely take action.

617
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,420
In fact, we've narrowed it down quite a lot.

618
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,780
This person ran the Surveillance Office

619
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,650
for quite a while after Cao Jingxian died

620
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,050
and almost made Miss Xiang the scapegoat.

621
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,250
Not many people

622
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,860
are capable of that.

623
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,420
Master.

624
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,690
His Majesty allowed me to investigate all officials.

625
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,500
I want to go from top to bottom,

626
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,210
starting from the Cabinet.

627
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,380
Hai.

628
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,210
In that case,

629
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,500
there is someone you should meet.

630
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,630
[Open-minded and Humble]

631
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,530
Zang Hai.

632
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,980
What you said

633
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,300
answered a question that had bothered me for a long time.

634
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,500
What was that question?

635
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,650
Why weren't there any consequences after your father

636
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,720
stood up for me back then?

637
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,020
Put it aside for now.

638
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,610
Let's talk business.

639
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,820
You've progressed a lot these days.

640
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,940
It seems that we are getting closer to the third enemy.

641
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,900
You also think I should look into the Cabinet?

642
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,380
Zhuang Luyin was the head of the military officers.

643
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,420
Cao Jingxian ran the Directorate of Ceremonial and the Surveillance Office.

644
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,090
This third enemy is in the Cabinet.

645
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,420
They were of similar status.

646
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,300
Tell me.

647
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,650
Who do you want to start with?

648
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,690
The Cabinet is full of high-ranking and powerful ministers.

649
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,130
Even the slightest mistake

650
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,300
would alert them.

651
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,300
Moreover, it won't be easy

652
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,020
to remain an official once you offend someone.

653
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,570
Naturally, I want to start

654
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,090
with the highest-ranking minister.

655
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,090
Shi Yiping, the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

656
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,860
Shi Yiping

657
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,610
has always been domineering and arrogant

658
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,530
in the Cabinet and the Ministry of Personnel.

659
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,130
But after Cao Jingxian died,

660
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,170
rather than expanding his power,

661
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,780
Mr. Shi claimed illness

662
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,820
and stayed at home as if he had no more political ambitions.

663
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,460
If the third enemy

664
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,050
had obtained the Gui Seal,

665
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,050
he would no longer care about the officialdom.

666
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,050
Sir.

667
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,980
It seems that you know Mr. Shi quite well.

668
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,650
That's why I came to see you.
