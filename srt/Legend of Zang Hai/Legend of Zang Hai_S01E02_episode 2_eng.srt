1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:20,010


2
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,516
   

4
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,000
Mayflies live for a day from dawn to dusk. 
  (Poem by Wang Anshi) 

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,080
Cicadas mistake a single season for eternity.

6
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,740
The ancient past recedes into mist.

7
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,640
How many times has the wheel of time turned to reach the present?

8
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,670
You're awake.

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,190
Have some water.

10
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,590
Who are you?

11
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,900
I am your father's old friend.

12
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,560
Why should I trust you?

13
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,910
If I wanted to kill you,

14
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,360
would I need to wait for you to wake up?

15
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,470
Misfortune befell your household last night.

16
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,400
You were the only one I managed to save.

17
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,880
The others all died.

18
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,910
Cry if you need to.

19
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,760
Once you've cried everything out, we'll talk.

20
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,670
We've arrived.

21
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,980
You've cried everything out.

22
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,860
You should be feeling a bit better now.

23
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,090
Do you have many questions for me?

24
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,650
Before your father returned,

25
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,500
he and I exchanged letters and agreed

26
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,060
that I would help you to leave the capital.

27
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,110
But I arrived a step too late.

28
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,700
I will avenge them.

29
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,650
Do you know who your enemy is?

30
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,170
My father mentioned his name.

31
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,340
The one in charge is Zhuang Luyin.

32
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,700
No wonder he's so capable.

33
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,880
So, it's the Marquis of Pingjin.

34
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,330
But your father doesn't have any feud with him.

35
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,380
Why did he do that?

36
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,040
He came to my father to ask for something.

37
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,460
What was it?

38
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,990
I don't know. My father didn't say anything.

39
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,060
When your father returned to the capital from Dongxia,

40
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,990
he brought something back with him.

41
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,340
The Marquis of Pingjin

42
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,480
even annihilated your entire household over it.

43
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,510
Should he discover that you are still alive,

44
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,620
grave danger will follow.

45
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,000
You can't change what happened last night.

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,910
Are you certain you want to pursue vengeance?

47
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,980
If I can't take revenge, I'd rather be dead.

48
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,020
If you're willing to do what I say,

49
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,140
I have a way to help you.

50
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,410
Please tell me what to do.

51
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,940
The Marquis of Pingjin is a man of great status and authority.

52
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,750
If you want revenge, it will take time.

53
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,500
You must lie low and hone your skills.

54
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,970
How long will it take?

55
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,850
At least ten years.

56
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,360
I'll send you to a place where you can hone your skills.

57
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,790
Everything relies on you after that.

58
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,800
Move it. Master is coming.

59
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,190
- Who is your master? 
 - Hurry up.

60
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,070
The same person who will be teaching you.

61
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,910
The one who will be teaching me?

62
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,530
So, you're Kuai Duo's child?

63
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,670
Come here and let me take a look at you.

64
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,940
I'll say this upfront.

65
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,720
You'll get no special treatment here.

66
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,870
If you can't handle the hardship, you're free to leave.

67
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,380
I won't stop you.

68
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,870
I want to learn martial arts.

69
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,780
Your muscles and bones are weak, and your talent is mediocre.

70
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,160
You're simply not cut out for martial arts.

71
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,250
He has already devised a revenge plan for you.

72
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,380
Just follow that path,

73
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,580
and you will surely achieve your goal.

74
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,600
I want to kill my enemy with my own hands.

75
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,210
If it's not a powerful martial art,

76
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,550
I won't bother learning it.

77
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,260
Must revenge rely on violence?

78
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,380
What else can I rely on?

79
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,970
Conviction.

80
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,720
If you hold onto this belief,

81
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,080
any skill in the world can be deadly.

82
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,950
Lu Cun.

83
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,020
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,530
His right sleeve is an inch shorter than the left.

85
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,850
Your work lacks precision.

86
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,370
No one in this room is allowed to eat for the next three days.

87
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,500
If it happens again, your little finger will be snapped,

88
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,680
you'll be banished from the mansion and never allowed to return.

89
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,960
 Please forgive us, Master. 

90
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,500
Why are you so mean?

91
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,330
These are just trivial issues.

92
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,940
You're doubting things before you've even learned them.

93
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,060
It seems your parents didn't discipline you properly.

94
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,310
Don't you dare speak ill of my parents!

95
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,130
Lu Cun.

96
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,076
   

97
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,450
   

98
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,460
Mom...

99
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,360
What happened to my face?

100
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,530
Don't panic, kid.

101
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,200
I only made minor adjustments to your eyebrows, eyes, and facial structure

102
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,290
along with some skin repairs.

103
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,480
Now, you look quite different from before.

104
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,670
In a few years, as you grow older,

105
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,870
you'll lose all resemblance to your parents,

106
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,950
and your enemy won't be able to recognize you.

107
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:40,520
So, in a few years, I won't look like my parents at all?

108
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,910
Tell me.

109
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,050
When did you get that wound on your back?

110
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,960
Just a few days ago.

111
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,000
Has your enemy seen it?

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,460
No.

113
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,980
That's good.

114
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,400
The wound on your back is really deep.

115
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,900
All Xing Dou can do is help it heal faster

116
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,980
and minimize the scarring.

117
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,680
Who is Xing Dou?

118
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,350
He is the cranky fellow.

119
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,140
Who might you be, then?

120
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,230
My name is Gao Ming. I'm your other master.

121
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,140
What could you possibly teach me?

122
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,100
You little brat, don't underestimate me.

123
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,900
If you think you know everything,

124
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,450
try getting out of here first.

125
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,740
Your master Xing Dou is merciless.

126
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,970
If you can't get out, you might starve to death.

127
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,260
Let me eat first.

128
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,990
Once I've regained my strength, I'll come back to work on the mortise and tenon joints.

129
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,810
You were born into a family of constructors.

130
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,750
If you can't even unlock the simplest mortise and tenon joints,

131
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,690
I'd say your father's reputation is undeserved.

132
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,550
You're not allowed to speak ill of my father.

133
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,170
You promised my benefactor you'd teach me the way of vengeance.

134
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,930
I don't think you'd actually let me starve to death.

135
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,930
I did promise him I'd teach you the way of vengeance.

136
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,500
But you look different now.

137
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,440
If necessary, I'll just find another kid to take your place.

138
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,820
You!

139
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,860
You want to test me?

140
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,810
My father has already taught me everything.

141
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,820
I'll get out and prove it to you right now.

142
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,220
The kid has just undergone facial transformation surgery.

143
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,870
If he actually dies, how will you explain that to his benefactor?

144
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,900
If he can't even endure hunger and pain,

145
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,400
maybe it's better if he doesn't seek revenge at all.

146
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,220
At such a young age, his resilience is remarkable.

147
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,920
He's got great potential.

148
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,650
Let's leave.

149
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,080
If you don't come out today, you'll starve to death.

150
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,140
You dislike me because you resent my father.

151
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,760
My father is an expert in the study of the Yijing

152
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,970
and the finest geomancer in the world.

153
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,960
Your skills don't measure up, and you're bitter about it.

154
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,140
You claim your father is an expert in the study of Yijing.

155
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,410
There was a great master of Yijing in the previous dynasty

156
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,440
named He Menggui.

157
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,860
Have you heard of him?

158
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,050
Of course, I have.

159
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,080
Then recite his poem "To Yin Xunzhai on the Numerology of Yijing."

160
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,340
 There is no need to consult Guan Lu’s divinations 

161
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,250
 or seek answers from Yang Xiong’s Taixuan. 

162
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,740
 Guan Lu loved studying the stars from a young age. 

163
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,030
 Yang Xiong was a devoted learner in his youth 

164
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,930
 and wrote the classic Taixuan. 

165
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,870
 Yijing holds profound insights into the universe. 

166
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:37,690
 Master it, and you could become just as extraordinary. 

167
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,290
 Now, let us continue reciting. 

168
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,380
 Where does the rising wind come from? 

169
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,570
Master Xun of Yijing has the answer.

170
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,343
The storm begins with the softest stir atop the green duckweed.

171
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:53,760
A man of wisdom seizes the moment and moves with the tide.

172
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,050
If you seek revenge, first learn the wind's ways.

173
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,940
   

174
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,340
 All things grow and flourish, hidden within primordial chaos. 

175
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,620
 Who was it that unlocked the secret gate and unveiled the mysteries of creation? 

176
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,920
He's quite good.

177
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,980
 Yijing preserves the wisdom of the great sages. 

178
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,990
 It embodies the three cosmic principles of transformation. 

179
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,640
 There is no need to consult Guan Lu’s divinations 

180
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,150
 or seek answers from Yang Xiong’s Taixuan. 

181
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,140
 Where does the rising wind come from? 

182
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,160
 Master Xun of Yijing has the answer. 

183
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,140
Let's go.

184
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,800
Go.

185
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,850
Come here.

186
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,700
Half a month from now,

187
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,620
you will study geomancy and construction with me in the mornings,

188
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,100
and learn strategy and diplomacy from Gao Ming in the afternoons.

189
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,420
You are to rise at the hour of Mao (5:00 a.m.) and rest at the hour of Hai (9:00 p.m.).

190
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,220
No slacking off.

191
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,170
Kid, you must be hungry.

192
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,320
Let's go and eat.

193
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,080
Careful.

194
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,170
By day, they toil in the fields. By night, they spin the flax at home.

195
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,050
In the village, every man and woman tends to their own household work.

196
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,070
Though the young ones have yet to learn farming or weaving,

197
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,570
they still sit beneath the mulberry shade, learning to sow seeds.

198
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,909
Geomancy studies the way of Heaven and Earth.

199
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:11,010
We observe the stars above and examine the land below.

200
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,830
This is the essence of geomancy. 
    

201
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,650
Mountains wind and coil like dragons upon the earth.

202
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,860
To choose the right site, you must know the direction of the wind,

203
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,570
the flow of water, and the state of the soil.

204
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,860
Hold out your hand.

205
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,350
Master, may I ask where I erred?

206
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,750
The dougong is off by one li.

207
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,210
It's merely one li.

208
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,100
A tiny slip can lead to a massive mistake.

209
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,386
That little error could cost you your life someday.

210
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:53,715
   

211
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,560
Master, you have a beard now.

212
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,900
Today, I'll show you what I'm truly capable of.

213
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,490
What are you all doing? Clear the way! Move aside!

214
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,970
Are you blind? How dare you block the county magistrate's path?

215
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,570
Write it down.

216
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,440
You can't even manage a small county properly.

217
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,490
Look at the mess you've made to this place.

218
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,620
Officials like you only know how to grease palms and line pockets.

219
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,294
- Sooner or later, you'll be smothered by the very silver you took.  
 - Yes, sir.

220
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:32,070
If I hadn't arrived before the Imperial Censor,

221
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,350
and your misdeeds had been reported,

222
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,170
you'd have lost your head several times over by now.

223
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,980
- Yes, sir. 
 - Come here.

224
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,870
I'll give you a chance to make things right.

225
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,730
Return everything you've embezzled.

226
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,830
As for those beyond saving,

227
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,240
whether they're to be arrested or executed, you know exactly what to do.

228
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,410
Don't be afraid.

229
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,350
You've got support.

230
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,540
Yes, sir.

231
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,010
You weren't wearing an official's robe, nor did you arrive in a carriage.

232
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,490
Why would he believe you?

233
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,730
Didn't you also address me as an official just now?

234
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,490
What you must do is make others believe what you want them to believe.

235
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,990
What matters most is not how well you act,

236
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,810
nor how convincing your costume is,

237
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:19,460
but knowing what the other party fears most, and what they most desire.

238
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,100
The art of strategy and diplomacy encompasses the knowledge of the world.

239
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,000
You must be well-versed in every field.

240
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,490
With but a silver tongue,

241
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,200
one may prove stronger than an army of millions.

242
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,190
Master.

243
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,870
   

244
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,920
This kid's got the construction skills to work independently now.

245
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,970
Your apprentice is about to outshine you.

246
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,740
- Doesn't that bother you? 
 - Master.

247
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,820
Master.

248
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,580
This is the pigeon post I just received.

249
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,780
Good job.

250
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,380
We'll have a celebration for you tonight.

251
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,520
Heat up a pot of fine liquor. 
    

252
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,860
Master, what does this note say?

253
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,820
Your new master is about to arrive.

254
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,010
There's a new master for me?

255
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,480
Now that you're twenty, it's time for her to come.

256
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,970
There's something strange about you two today.

257
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,450
Is this new master that impressive?

258
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,860
You'll know once you two meet.

259
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,290
Tonight, the two of us will enter seclusion and not return until tomorrow.

260
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,460
You should stay at the mansion.

261
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,280
Yes, Master.

262
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,250
You should go to town and buy a jar of fine liquor

263
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,600
for your new master.

264
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,620
Preferably, osmanthus liquor.

265
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,660
All right, got it.

266
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,730
Well, I'm still worried.

267
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,160
- Maybe I should stay with you? 
 - Gao Ming.

268
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,590
I...

269
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,730
All right.

270
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,450
I'm leaving.

271
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,850
Don't worry.

272
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,430
No need to worry.

273
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,330
A new master.

274
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,160
   

275
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,210
Close the door.

276
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,630
So, you are my third master?

277
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,000
Why?

278
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,040
You didn't expect your new master to be a woman?

279
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,070
I'm Liu Chu.

280
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,750
Greetings, Master Liu Chu.

281
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,580
By the way, Master Gao Ming asked me to bring this to you.

282
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,050
Set it aside for now.

283
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,480
What are you going to teach me?

284
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,640
Oh?

285
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,380
They didn't tell you?

286
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,900
They seemed a bit strange when speaking of you.

287
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,970
I thought...

288
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,430
maybe you were really scary.

289
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,980
So, do I seem...

290
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,050
scary to you now?

291
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,750
I'm here to teach you about the matters between men and women.

292
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,970
Today, there's only one thing you need to learn:

293
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,440
how to resist a woman's sweet affection

294
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,220
and tender allure.

295
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,040
I'm talking to you.

296
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:11,450
But if you fail to learn it today, that's all right.

297
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,180
After all, few are granted a glimpse of me like this.

298
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,330
I'm sorry.

299
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,420
What's the matter?

300
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I thought you were here to teach me how to take revenge.

301
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,280
You know how to use pain to suppress desire.

302
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,700
Not bad.

303
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:57,000
Though you resisted temptation this time by staying true to yourself,

304
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,540
next time,

305
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:04,390
if you truly fall for a woman, it may not be so easy like today.

306
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,720
In the future, you'll meet many people:

307
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,480
men, women, enemies, and friends.

308
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,730
Men are like stone, strong and unyielding, bound by duty.

309
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,550
Women are like water, gentle yet resilient,

310
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,070
with love as deep as the sea.

311
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,810
There's much to learn from the words "duty" and "love".

312
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,210
But...

313
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,950
the hardest thing to guard against in this world...

314
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,720
is genuine sincerity.

315
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,680
Genuine sincerity?

316
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,940
Even genuine sincerity needs to be guarded against?

317
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,940
The last time you saw your parents was ten years ago, right?

318
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,690
Do you still remember what they looked like?

319
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,900
Actually, I'm the same as you.

320
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,900
I was an orphan from a very young age.

321
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,510
Though I remember the day they passed vividly,

322
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:14,540
I just can't seem to recall their faces clearly.

323
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,390
Tell me.

324
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,010
Does that make me unfilial?

325
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,830
No, not at all.

326
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,310
You...

327
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,770
You just can't bear to remember.

328
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,010
I remember...

329
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,300
as a child, I loved pomegranates.

330
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,980
So, my father planted a pomegranate tree in the yard.

331
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,830
He'd pick the fruit,

332
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,690
my mother would peel it,

333
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,770
and I'd eat it.

334
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,700
Those were...

335
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,460
such happy times.

336
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,830
I'm the same.

337
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,650
I loved eating roast duck.

338
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,250
Whenever my father received his salary,

339
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,590
he would go into town to buy some for me.

340
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,040
Yet, little did I expect...

341
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,220
that those would be my final moments of happiness.

342
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,830
If I had the chance,

343
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,620
I would truly want to see my parents once more,

344
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,990
so I could remember their faces more clearly.

345
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,590
I guess...

346
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,380
you feel the same way, don't you?

347
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,630
If I were your enemy, you would be dead by now.

348
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,580
Resisting the temptation of desire is not hard.

349
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:08,300
What's truly difficult is resisting the temptation of emotions.

350
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,050
This... This isn't fair.

351
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,000
This world is hardly fair,

352
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,940
and second chances are few and far between.

353
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,490
I understand now.

354
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,720
I have to lock my heart up tight, letting nothing in,

355
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,380
and never revealing my true feelings to anyone.

356
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,120
But that's not enough.

357
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,170
You have to not only mask yourself

358
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,790
but also control your emotions so well

359
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,900
that people believe your tears are real

360
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,680
and your smiles are genuine.

361
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,130
That way, no one will notice that I'm hiding my true feelings,

362
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,460
and there won't be any slip-ups to give me away.

363
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,820
That's the theory.

364
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,400
But can you actually do it?

365
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,250
I'm certain I can do it.

366
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,250
You're still young.

367
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,930
Though smart, you're a person

368
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,140
ruled by your emotions at heart.

369
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,460
This might become your biggest obstacle on the path of revenge,

370
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,630
but it could also be the key to your victory.

371
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,140
I'll leave now.

372
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,070
Master Liu Chu!

373
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,800
Have I passed today's test?

374
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,430
What I teach is different from that of your other two masters.

375
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,070
When it comes to feelings, some are born knowing them,

376
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,460
while others just can't figure them out even in a lifetime.

377
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,400
Remember, you've only passed half the test today.

378
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,860
Be vigilant in the future

379
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,430
and don't fall for someone easily.

380
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,380
Master, you tricked me again.

381
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,350
Master Liu Chu didn't drink it at all.

382
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,240
I bet it was you craving the drink.

383
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,590
Master Liu Chu has seen a lot in the capital.

384
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,140
It's no surprise she's not impressed by our local liquor.

385
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,160
Shouldn't you be worried about me?

386
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,460
I only passed half of Master Liu Chu's test.

387
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,060
It takes talent to master one's emotions.

388
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,100
You've passed half of Liu Chu's test,

389
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,440
which makes you second only to me.

390
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,350
Look at your Master Xing Dou.

391
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,440
His heart is like stone.

392
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,650
Otherwise, why would he hide away in these remote mountains?

393
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,070
I wonder if he ever gets bored.

394
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,690
No one can fool a man like him.

395
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,440
But you, on the other hand,

396
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,980
value your bond with others, which makes you easy to deceive.

397
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,590
When will I be able to complete my training?

398
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,410
You silly kid,

399
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:12,060
in our line of work, you never stop learning.

400
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,810
It seems that I'll never catch up to you...

401
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,720
since you're older than me.

402
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,510
You little brat, who are you calling old?

403
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,490
- Stop right there! 
 - I wouldn't dare, Master.

404
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,460
I just want to learn your skills as soon as possible.

405
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,420
Please, Master.

406
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,610
You know what they say:

407
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,450
"Haste makes waste."

408
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,990
One day, you'll understand that the most powerful skill in this world

409
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,660
is to deceive others with truth and honesty.

410
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:49,700
When I was your age, I also found this principle very deep.

411
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,250
It was only after suffering many losses

412
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,620
that I came to comprehend it.

413
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,310
What you mean is that I still need more training?

414
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:04,590
What I mean is, you got fooled again.

415
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,090
I am exceptionally gifted and innately skilled in deception.

416
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:12,160
How could anyone ever make me suffer losses?

417
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,180
You're still too naive.

418
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,410
Come here.

419
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,590
This is for you.

420
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,980
Benefactor.

421
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,390
Sir.

422
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,960
It's been years since I last came to see you.

423
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,220
You've grown so much.

424
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,090
See if you can unlock it.

425
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,630
General's Lock?

426
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,010
I see that you've been doing pretty well these past years.

427
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,380
My masters have treated me well.

428
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,640
They say you've learned a lot.

429
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,230
I rise at the hour of Mao (5:00 a.m.) and rest at the hour of Hai (9:00 p.m.) each day,

430
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,070
always maintaining my discipline.

431
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,530
Don't you find it suffocating and boring?

432
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,150
When I'm bored, I just count the bricks and tiles in the pavilion.

433
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,430
So, how many bricks are laid on the ground?

434
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,800
3381 bricks.

435
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,440
How many tiles are on the roof?

436
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,320
48,300 tiles.

437
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,410
How many people in your household died that night?

438
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,010
My household had ten disciples,

439
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,190
all killed by those men in black.

440
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,610
I saw my senior, Gou Sheng's neck being snapped.

441
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,920
My sister and mother were both slain by the sword.

442
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,230
That night, 14 lives were lost in total.

443
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,470
It's been 3,325 days since then.

444
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,510
I didn't expect that after all these years,

445
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,840
your resolve would stay unshaken.

446
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,480
Your hatred hasn't faded one bit.

447
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,820
Since you lead a carefree life here,

448
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,030
I thought that one day you'd eventually let it go.

449
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,000
My master taught me

450
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,710
there's no need to show hatred on your face.

451
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,230
Keep it in your heart

452
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,870
as your heart is yours alone, unseen by others.

453
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,120
But your face is out in the open, and everyone can see it.

454
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,710
This is your birthday gift this year.

455
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,360
See if you like it.

456
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,840
This...

457
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:56,110
He is your enemy, Marquis of Pingjin, Zhuang Luyin.

458
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,280
That's right. It's him.

459
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,440
I'd remember him even if he turned to ashes.

460
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,440
   

461
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,700
The Marquis of Pingjin has fought in countless battles,

462
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,180
his hands stained with blood.

463
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,550
Not only is he a formidable warrior,

464
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,480
but he is also cautious and suspicious.

465
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,820
He always wears 
    

466
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,560
a piece of golden-threaded soft armor,

467
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,440
and his guards are impenetrable.

468
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,920
Killing him is nearly impossible.

469
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,380
You'll have to rely on your wits.

470
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,170
Then, how can I get close to him?

471
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:39,150
You must find a chance to serve as his aide.

472
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,320
That's why Master has been teaching me the art of strategy and diplomacy.

473
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,300
There are three individuals by the Marquis of Pingjin's side

474
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,760
who stand between you and him.

475
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,400
If you truly wish to approach the Marquis of Pingjin,

476
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,920
you must first overcome these three challenges.

477
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,070
This person is named Qu Jiao. 
    

478
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,930
He is the personal bodyguard of the Marquis of Pingjin

479
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,410
and also the commander of his household troops.

480
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,670
He is the Marquis's executioner,

481
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,550
known for his savage cruelty.

482
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,420
He's the one who killed my family.

483
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,960
   

484
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,630
Chu Huaiming?

485
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,590
He used to work under your father.

486
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,480
Because of his mediocre abilities,

487
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,630
he had little chance of being promoted in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

488
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,600
So, he betrayed your father and joined the Marquis of Pingjin.

489
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,590
After your father died, the Marquis of Pingjin

490
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,840
helped him rise to the position of Imperial Astronomer.

491
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,490
This man is two-faced and despicable.

492
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,660
Given your knowledge of geomancy,

493
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:56,110
he will inevitably see you as a thorn in his side.

494
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,230
   

495
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,280
This man is named Yang Zhen.

496
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,640
He is the chief aide to the Marquis of Pingjin.

497
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,670
Back then, he was the one

498
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,610
who made the massacre look like a random bandit attack,

499
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,550
a clever cover-up for the Marquis.

500
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,670
He is quite cunning and is highly valued by the Marquis of Pingjin.

501
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,060
He's also got the other aides in the Marquis's mansion under his thumb.

502
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,020
If you enter the Marquis's mansion and start to stand out,

503
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,230
you will certainly face his suppression.

504
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,230
This is the list of everyone in the Marquis's mansion,

505
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,320
Everyone there is sharp and calculating.

506
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,043
The place is a complex web of power dynamics. 
    

507
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:55,220
You must proceed with utmost caution. 
    

508
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,320
   

509
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,076
   

510
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,390
   

511
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,960
Sir, since you've shown me these,

512
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,980
does that mean it's time for me...

513
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,310
to return to the capital?

514
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,700
Zhinu hasn't completed his training yet.

515
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,150
Isn't it a bit too soon for him to return to the capital?

516
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,590
Something significant has happened in the capital.

517
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,670
The Empress Dowager passed away three days ago.

518
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,980
The court and the people are in deep mourning.

519
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,570
I see.

520
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,590
This opportunity is fleeting

521
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,400
and might not come again.

522
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,110
Zhinu, the hidden dragon, must dive deep now.

523
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,400
Tomorrow, you shall depart.

524
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,660
I've spent years honing my craft, waiting for this very moment.

525
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,020
Beyond fully mastering and integrating

526
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,320
all that you've learned over the years,

527
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,230
you must also remain exceptionally vigilant

528
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,510
and strike only when the time is right.

529
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,710
Only then can you survive in the capital,

530
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,180
a place of ever-shifting intrigue,

531
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,360
and slowly lay the foundation for your revenge.

532
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,890
I've prepared a new identity for you.

533
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,480
Etch it into your heart.

534
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,590
From this day on, you have only one name:

535
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,810
Zang Hai.

536
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,070
   

537
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,989
   

538
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,320
Are you wondering what your benefactor and Old Man Xing Dou are discussing

539
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,250
and why the Empress Dowager's passing is considered a perfect opportunity?

540
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,000
Master, will you go to the capital with me?

541
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,760
Certainly.

542
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,260
Really?

543
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,480
Just the thought of having to be with you all the time

544
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,380
really annoys me.

545
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,840
I'm not annoyed.

546
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,580
Master, have some ribs.

547
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,480
That's more like it.

548
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,560
Now, you are showing some real respect.

549
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,310
   

550
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,510
Master.

551
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,820
Have you finished packing?

552
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,580
We need to leave now.

553
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,090
Master Xing Dou, where is Master Gao Ming?

554
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:25,010
He's already left with your benefactor.

555
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,460
He asked me to tell you

556
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,030
not to trust others just because of your feelings.

557
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,490
Otherwise, you'll only end up disappointed.

558
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,540
Zhinu.

559
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,030
Master, who are you calling?

560
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,510
My name is Zang Hai.

561
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:47,130
From this moment on, there is no more Zhinu in this world.

562
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:16,980


563
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:22,260
