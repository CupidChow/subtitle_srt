00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:30,020
   

3
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,900
   

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
Lord Zang. 
    

5
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:50,147
   

6
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,920
Lord Zang.

7
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,050
Greetings, Lord Zhao.

8
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,520
Step back.

9
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,760
Don't be startled.

10
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,100
His Majesty rewarded me with this mansion many years ago.

11
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,030
It's now a bit run-down.

12
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,380
If you even need to trouble yourself with this matter,

13
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,060
the Construction and Maintenance Directorate has neglected its duties.

14
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,060
I didn't report this to the imperial court.

15
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,380
How did they neglect their duties?

16
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,190
Old Master, be careful.

17
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,020
I heard you're quite knowledgeable about architecture.

18
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,230
I guess I've been showing off before an expert.

19
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,920
Sir, you even personally fix your rooftop.

20
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,360
I can still be taught.

21
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,050
Come with me.

22
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,500
Lord Zhao.

23
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,070
I don't need to look at this. 
    

24
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,500
I know you didn't cause these accounting problems.

25
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,350
A pity that Chu Huaiming is dead.

26
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,920
No matter how we examine the ledger,

27
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,510
we can't find and retrieve the embezzled money.

28
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,990
Sir, you are very observant.

29
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,700
It's necessary to be observant.

30
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,700
If an official only looks at the ground,

31
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,280
and doesn't lift up his head to look at the sky,

32
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,360
he doesn't know when he bumps into the wall. 
  (Focus on work without looking at the big picture) 

33
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,520
What do you mean, sir?

34
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,060
The Cabinet received many memorials about you over the past few days.

35
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,110
Do you know how many people you've unintentionally offended?

36
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,160
That many people wanted to impeach me,

37
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
but I'm not affected at all.

38
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,840
I believe that those memorials were just groundless insults.

39
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
It doesn't matter whether they have a point.

40
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,500
If an official is always impeached by others,

41
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,160
once the memorials pile up, even the innocent will become guilty.

42
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,520
You are right, sir.

43
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,620
May I be bold enough to seek your opinion?

44
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,000
Do you think officials should turn a blind eye

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,700
to what is obviously unfair?

46
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,790
If the water is too clean, the fish won't survive.

47
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,400
If you're strict with others, you won't have any followers.

48
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,200
If you're just seeking a momentary thrill,

49
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,450
and want to establish prestige in the imperial court,

50
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,160
it's considered a good tactic.

51
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,240
But if you long for reformation from the bottom of your heart,

52
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,650
you're doing it the wrong way.

53
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,480
I don't understand.

54
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,000
Please enlighten me.

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,300
You were recommended...

56
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
by the Marquis of Pingjin

57
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,750
to be the fifth-rank Imperial Astronomer at such a young age.

58
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,890
There are many things you don't understand.

59
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,200
You want to improve the Imperial Astronomical Bureau; it's a good idea.

60
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,700
But don't forget that this bureau used to serve

61
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,170
the interests of the royal family.

62
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,110
No matter who they are or how high-ranking the officials are,

63
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,160
as long as they violate the laws of Great Yong,

64
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,960
I'm not afraid of offending them.

65
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,400
I will continue with the investigation.

66
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,900
Please help me to punish each and every one.

67
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,290
The list that you've submitted to the Cabinet...

68
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,630
has created a storm.

69
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,500
Who we should investigate first and later,

70
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,900
who's to be executed and exiled,

71
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,400
certain things may seem like nothing is happening yet.

72
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,410
But in fact, several forces are competing to take control.

73
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,160
You stirred up this mess on a whim.

74
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,800
Has it crossed your mind how many people are out to cause trouble?

75
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,050
That's exactly what I want.

76
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,430
If those imperial court officials are good at protecting themselves,

77
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,060
the list won't attract and create any movements.

78
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,040
But what if they believe they can use the list to make it an issue

79
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,930
and attack each other?

80
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,700
If this list is impeccable,

81
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,400
who will step forward to eliminate evil from the imperial court?

82
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,080
If you can figure out their alliance,

83
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,400
and join forces with others,

84
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,460
you can turn them against each other and take them down.

85
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:54,090
It's understandable for you to use this strategy in your position.

86
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,110
This is not the Marquis of Pingjin's intention, right?

87
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,700
Otherwise, he would have done it when Chu Huaiming was around.

88
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,950
You took refuge with him...

89
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,970
just for this very day?

90
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,260
Here's another piece of advice.

91
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,470
Officialdom is sinister.

92
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,100
Establish yourself first before doing anything.

93
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,920
Protect yourself first if you want to rectify the administration

94
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,870
because the higher your position is, you can do more things.

95
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,520
Unless you are sure you can achieve your goal,

96
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,390
find that position first.

97
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,760
Thank you for your advice.

98
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,790
Think of this ledger...

99
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,150
as a warning and learn from it.

100
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,420
Master, it's about time.

101
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,520
You have to attend the Cabinet meeting.

102
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,150
- Help me to get changed. 
 - Understood.

103
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,000
Zang Hai,

104
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,670
I'm used to living in this old mansion for many years.

105
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,240
Since you're here, please help me fix the tiles.

106
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,460
Will you?

107
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,700
Rest assured, sir.

108
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,770
Old Master.

109
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,900
This mortar trowel is a bit blunt.

110
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,700
Please bring a new one for me.

111
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,810
By the way, bring some new tiles and mortar as well.

112
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,390
Understood.

113
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,550
Did you bring the consultation papers from the Provincial Administrative Bureau?

114
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,970
I didn't know you'd need them and left them in the study.

115
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,450
Let's go back.

116
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,180
Old Master, be careful.

117
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,280
Where is Zang Hai?

118
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,410
Old Master, Official Zang sent me to get some tools.

119
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,340
He was here just now.

120
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:28,508
   

121
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,980
What are you doing here?

122
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,530
Lord Zhao.

123
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,790
I asked you a question.

124
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,380
Shouldn't you be repairing the tiles in the front courtyard?

125
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,640
Sir,

126
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,140
when I was in the front courtyard,

127
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,790
a servant told me that the study is always cold.

128
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,510
He doesn't know the reason and wanted me to come here to check.

129
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,040
Really?

130
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,880
Is that so? Did you see the problem?

131
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,470
I've checked thoroughly.

132
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,710
There are some leaks because there haven't been any repairs for a long time.

133
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,260
The damaged area wasn't noticeable as it was blocked by the shelves.

134
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,760
Like what you said,

135
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,310
I know a few things about construction work.

136
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,570
Since I'm right here, I thought I could fix it.

137
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,930
I should have asked for your approval first.

138
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,950
Thank you for the effort.

139
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,240
But the study room is full of highly confidential files.

140
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,500
You went in on your own.

141
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,460
It's hard to tell what you have seen and done.

142
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,160
You said that a servant brought you here.

143
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,860
Where is he?

144
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,950
- He was right outside when I went in... 
 - Zhao Geng.

145
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,480
I'm here.

146
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,520
Gather all the servants here for Lord Zang to identify.

147
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,810
Let's see who brought him to the study.

148
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,920
That person shall be punished without mercy.

149
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,510
Understood.

150
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,590
Old Master, everyone is here.

151
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,670
Lord Zang,

152
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,910
look carefully. Who is that servant?

153
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,270
Did you find him?

154
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,390
Lord Zhao, I met him for the first time.

155
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,740
I really can't remember clearly.

156
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,430
It's fine.

157
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,920
You don't remember him,

158
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,290
but he'll definitely remember you.

159
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,710
Who spoke with Lord Zang today?

160
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,400
Who told him the study was cold

161
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,700
and asked him to check it?

162
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,550
Since no one wants to admit,

163
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,190
you'll all be punished together.

164
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,240
 - Old Master, we've been accused wrongly. 
 - We're innocent, Old Master. 

165
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,430
 Old Master, we've been accused wrongly. 

166
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,250
Lord Zhao, that servant was also kind-hearted.

167
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,520
If you put it that way, whoever he is,

168
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,290
I won't punish him as long as he confesses.

169
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,360
But talking about this,

170
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,070
these people have served me for years

171
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,330
and know the rules.

172
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:32,830
But if you lied to me and there's no such person,

173
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,670
why did you go in there?

174
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,880
If you can't explain it,

175
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,420
I'm afraid we'll have to talk somewhere else.

176
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,380
Father.

177
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,070
I asked him to come here.

178
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,520
Father, your study is really old.

179
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,470
I find it cold in there, and it often gives you headaches.

180
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,880
Since Lord Zang is the Imperial Astronomer,

181
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,070
I asked him to take a look.

182
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,820
I had barely left when I heard you scolding the servants.

183
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,190
What's the big fuss?

184
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,250
You asked him to come here?

185
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,990
He said a servant brought him here.

186
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,640
Father,

187
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,450
I just came back from outside, dressed like a man.

188
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,800
But he actually mistook me as a servant.

189
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,230
That calls for punishment.

190
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,560
Please forgive me, Miss.

191
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,140
I failed to discern. I apologize.

192
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,800
It was really you who called him to come here?

193
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,510
I don't even know him.

194
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,010
Why would I lie for him?

195
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,970
So, it's just a misunderstanding.

196
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,400
In that case, go ahead and repair the study.

197
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,420
- Zhao Geng. 
 - Old Master.

198
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,430
Keep Lord Zang company.

199
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,070
Understood.

200
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,975
   

201
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,270
On the 20th day of the 8th month in the 6th year of the Zhenshun era,

202
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,640
that is, before my family was massacred,

203
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,880
the Ministry of Revenue sent Vice Director Zhao Bingwen

204
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,880
to coordinate the disaster relief in Yuezhou.

205
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,600
So, Zhao Bingwen wasn't even in the capital

206
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,030
the night your family was massacred.

207
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,430
That's right.

208
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,400
Yuezhou is far away from the capital.

209
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,110
It takes about 20 days for a round trip.

210
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,160
Let's be cautious.

211
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,470
I'll check the county chronicles back then.

212
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,950
If there's a record,

213
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,170
Zhao Bingwen can't be the third person.

214
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,000
We've come to a dead end again.

215
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,920
Our efforts weren't in vain.

216
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,670
You found out that the Eighth Young Master who has been working for Miss Xiang

217
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,110
is the daughter of the Minister of Revenue.

218
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,920
Children from wealthy families are truly different.

219
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,850
Instead of staying at home, she tells stories at Zhen Tower.

220
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,710
If my father were the Minister of Revenue,

221
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,120
I wouldn't do anything apart from collecting taxes all day.

222
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,650
I wonder how it feels to collect money from people daily.

223
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,540
Master, wake up. Stop daydreaming.

224
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,770
I actually need a favor.

225
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,780
Did you come across any rare novels while you were running the bookstore?

226
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,860
I want to get some for her as a thank-you gift.

227
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,660
Novels?

228
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,170
Some old friends of mine have a huge collection of those.

229
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,880
But aren't you thanking the wrong person?

230
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,080
You and Eighth Young Master don't interact much.

231
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,730
Why did she help you?

232
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,050
Think about it carefully.

233
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,270
   

234
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,670
This is impressive, Lord Zang.

235
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,670
Legend of Han Qinhu. 
    

236
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,940
I looked for this for a long time and couldn't find it.

237
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,080
Thank you for helping me in front of Lord Zhao.

238
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,470
I brought you these novels to show my gratitude.

239
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,340
You are too kind, Lord Zang.

240
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,920
I really didn't expect

241
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,430
Eighth Young Master of Zhen Tower is the daughter of Lord Zhao.

242
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,520
What's wrong?

243
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,050
Can't the daughter of Lord Zhao secretly run Moonview Pavilion?

244
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,670
That's not what I mean.

245
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,800
It's just that you could disguise yourself as a storyteller

246
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,640
and tell the people what's happening in the kingdom.

247
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,430
I find it truly admirable.

248
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,560
All right.

249
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,320
Thank you for the novels.

250
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,810
I'll tell these stories tonight.

251
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,160
I have to memorize them.

252
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,370
Lord Zang, let's talk about official business.

253
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,030
Owner Xiang.

254
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,560
You're here, Lord Zang.

255
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,040
After we parted that night, I haven't managed...

256
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,650
Come upstairs and talk.

257
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,550
Owner Xiang.

258
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,640
You drank all the Fall of Mulberry Leaves wine.

259
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,650
Just make do with this cup of ordinary tea.

260
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,320
We met several times at Moonview Pavilion.

261
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,510
At first, you couldn't even afford the tea.

262
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,750
You're now the honorable guest of the Prince of Yongrong.

263
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,560
I believe it won't take long

264
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,140
for you to light the lantern for the Vermilion Seat.

265
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,720
I'm not there yet.

266
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,560
Thank you for your help that night.

267
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,870
Consider that we're even with the ancient coin.

268
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,120
But I've always been curious.

269
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,320
Why did you look for Prince of Yongrong when he was drunk that night?

270
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,400
It's only natural for me to get my ancient coin back.

271
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,640
If you just wanted your ancient coin back,

272
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,410
why did you ask Prince of Yongrong several questions?

273
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,240
What did Prince of Yongrong say?

274
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,080
He said a woman asked him some questions

275
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,480
but he didn't remember what she asked.

276
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,710
If you only wanted your ancient coin back,

277
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,440
you wouldn't have just talked to him.

278
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,800
Owner Xiang, you must have many secrets.

279
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,140
You can have secrets, but I can't?

280
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,830
Do you want to know?

281
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,390
Use yourself as an exchange.

282
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,930
To be honest, my best quality is that...

283
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,730
I don't pry into things that aren't my business.

284
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,380
Whatever.

285
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,470
What did you just give to Eighth Young Master?

286
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,920
Do you want to know?

287
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,800
Trade with your secret.

288
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,210
You...

289
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,480
Just some novels.

290
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,270
I didn't expect her to like them.

291
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,200
She even said she would tell these stories tonight.

292
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,950
That's really rare.

293
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,930
I'd like to see how well she tells the stories tonight.

294
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,960
Want to join me?

295
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,600
I might be busy for a while.

296
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,470
I'll bother you again when I'm done.

297
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,750
Whatever.

298
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,930
Lord Zang, don't overexhaust yourself.

299
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,733
   

300
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,342
   

301
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,490
Imperial court is in session.

302
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,990
His Majesty is reviewing the memorials in Hanzhang Hall today

303
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,080
and won't attend the imperial court session.

304
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,160
Does anyone have anything to report?

305
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,560
I have something to report.

306
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,840
What's new from the Ministry of Rites?

307
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,120
It's less than six months away from the Spring Examination.

308
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,430
We have determined

309
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,270
that we need 100,000 taels of silver from the imperial court.

310
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,950
We handed in our application a month ago,

311
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,600
but it still hasn't been approved.

312
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,800
Lord Huang, you may not know.

313
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,400
Your application has been sitting on His Majesty's table in Hanzhang Hall.

314
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,270
He has nothing against you.

315
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,320
But this year, the Ministry of Works built bridges and roads,

316
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,160
the Ministry of Revenue distributed disaster relief supplies.

317
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,560
The Treasury is currently in deficit.

318
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,950
All Six Ministries are asking for money.

319
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,470
If it really takes 100,000 taels of silver to hold the exam,

320
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,320
why not change it to every five years instead of three years

321
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,630
to ease the burden of the imperial court?

322
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,030
If we postpone the imperial examination for two years,

323
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:30,030
it may affect the selection of officials.

324
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,800
Lord Shi, you are overly worried.

325
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,120
The Ministry of Personnel can offer recommendations.

326
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,270
For example, Lord Zang, who just took office recently,

327
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,970
was also recommended by the Marquis.

328
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,990
Thank you for your praise, Eunuch Cao.

329
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,430
The Imperial Astronomer must be talented in geomancy.

330
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,360
This topic is not optional in the imperial exam.

331
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,920
Talents abound, but true recognition is rare.

332
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,870
Lord Shi is a good judge for finding talents for the Six Ministries.

333
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:03,670
If you put it that way, what do you think, Lord Shi?

334
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,360
The Ministry of Rites is in charge of the imperial examination.

335
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,160
The Ministry of Personnel will not interfere.

336
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,470
The Cabinet will discuss this later.

337
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,840
Lord Huang, please draw up a new proposal

338
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,580
and see if you can lower the expense.

339
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,490
Dear Lords, is there anything else to report?

340
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,880
If there is nothing else,

341
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,800
I shall convey His Majesty's decree.

342
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,120
General Fu Zhisong passed away while guarding the land and the people.

343
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,950
Taking into consideration his great contributions,

344
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,840
His Majesty grants him the honor of being buried

345
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,040
in the late emperor's mausoleum.

346
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,750
His Majesty was quite pleased

347
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,920
with Zang Hai's work on the renovation.

348
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,600
In my opinion, General Fu's burial

349
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,600
shall be entrusted to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

350
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,830
Two months should be more than enough, right?

351
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,210
I'll abide.

352
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,530
His Majesty has decreed

353
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:19,170
the Ministry of Revenue to issue 30,000 taels of silver for the construction.

354
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,420
The Ministry of Revenue will abide.

355
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,920
Thank you for your hard work.

356
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,510
The imperial court is dismissed.

357
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:00,800
Ordinary generals are only allowed Chinese fir as coffins and earth fir as outer coffins.

358
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,710
But General Fu died for a great cause.

359
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,120
His Majesty is allowing him to have a coffin made of Golden Silk Chinese Wood.

360
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,160
Understood, Lord.

361
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,080
I'll note this.

362
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,190
Shi Quan, other divisions of the bureau have been busy lately.

363
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,670
You're the only one who's available to help me.

364
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,430
I'll hand over this task to you today.

365
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,600
Be extra careful.

366
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,390
Rest assured, sir.

367
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,990
Why are these craftsmen so young?

368
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,470
Carving and repairing monuments rely on experience, not strength.

369
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,510
Veteran craftsmen are more skilled.

370
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,990
These people are too young.

371
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,320
If this is the case, the construction may not be completed on time.

372
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,100
You are right, sir.

373
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,760
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau used to get the most skilled craftsmen

374
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:58,420
paid by the Ministry of Works to build tombs for the burials.

375
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,760
But for some reason, they only sent inexperienced young craftsmen this time.

376
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,660
- What happened? 
 - What...

377
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,670
- Sir. 
 - Sir.

378
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,190
How can you be so careless?

379
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,670
It's the last batch of carved tiles in the Ministry of Works.

380
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,130
- Please forgive us. 
 - We didn't mean to break them.

381
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,310
- Please spare us. 
 - Please spare us.

382
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,930
These are broken beyond repair.

383
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,160
Lord Zang.

384
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,640
- Wait... 
 - Lord.

385
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,480
- Sir. 
 - Yesterday...

386
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,190
Sir, I couldn't stop him.

387
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,760
Understood.

388
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,640
Eldest Young Master, I handed in a note yesterday...

389
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,070
Address me as "Lord" when you're here.

390
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,840
Understood.

391
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Lord Zhuang,

392
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,820
I'm here to request more craftsmen for the construction of the tomb.

393
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,400
I've been here arranging construction work for some time.

394
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,840
No one has ever objected to the assignment of craftsmen.

395
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,800
What is your problem?

396
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:19,120
Lord Zhuang, the schedule is very tight.

397
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,020
We need experienced workers to carve the general's tombstone.

398
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,660
Otherwise, we may not finish the work in time.

399
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,230
Lord Zhuang, fortunately, you work here.

400
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,640
We always take care of our own people.

401
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,750
That's why I came here.

402
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,390
Our own people?

403
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,360
I'm afraid I'm not considered part of your circle.

404
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,640
You are asking me for a favor,

405
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,120
but you submitted an official note first.

406
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,400
I don't think you're showing me any respect.

407
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,180
Do you really see me as one of your own?

408
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,470
Since you don't,

409
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,950
let's keep this strictly professional.

410
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,790
You want some extra manpower?

411
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,800
What a pity.

412
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,400
It's getting cold.

413
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,320
All the workers were sent to repair the palace halls.

414
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,270
I don't have the funds or workers.

415
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,470
What can I do?

416
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,930
Lord Zhuang, here's the thing.

417
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,920
General Fu's burial

418
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,160
is an important task assigned to me by your father.

419
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,970
If I don't do well, I'm afraid it will hinder his plans.

420
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,080
My father?

421
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,230
What does it have to do with my father?

422
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,710
Lord Zhuang,

423
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:48,750
your father told me not to tell anyone about this.

424
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,230
If you've doubts, please feel free to ask him in person.

425
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,920
But if I fail this job,

426
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,550
neither of us can bear the consequences.

427
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,200
Since it's a family business,

428
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,860
let me see what I can do.

429
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,710
Gentlemen.

430
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,400
Leave us alone.

431
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,370
- Understood. 
 - Understood.

432
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,080
Well, there is room to maneuver.

433
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,140
Tell me how many people you need.

434
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,990
40.

435
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,600
40?

436
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,360
I doubt it's enough.

437
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,270
His Majesty attaches great importance to it.

438
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,000
We must build the tomb fast and properly.

439
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,270
How about this?

440
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,260
I'll assign you 80 workers.

441
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,490
Sir, I don't need so many workers.

442
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,950
Request for 80 people.

443
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,450
I'll give you 40.

444
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,070
You'll finish the job in time.

445
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,950
I will keep the budget for the other 40 workers.

446
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:22,330
We can use the extra money to make friends and grease the wheels.

447
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,270
What do you think?

448
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,430
Lord, this is embezzlement.

449
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,720
It's forbidden.

450
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,550
If Eunuch Cao finds out, how will we explain?

451
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,990
Eunuch Cao won't pursue this.

452
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,590
Who hasn't done something like this in the imperial court?

453
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,430
This is inappropriate. We can't do it.

454
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,720
Not helping me? You used my father to pressure me.

455
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,510
I thought of this solution, but you give me a hard time.

456
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,080
Tell you what.

457
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,990
This is the current situation of the Ministry of Works.

458
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,950
It's the only solution I can offer.

459
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,950
Show some appreciation.

460
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,590
Lord, your words are too harsh.

461
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,110
Let's do this.

462
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,240
I will think of a solution myself.

463
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,580
So ungrateful.

464
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,290
Shi Quan.

465
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,840
You're back, Lord Zang.

466
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,200
Take a look.

467
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,240
The Ministry of Works didn't send us any experienced craftsmen.

468
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,320
They even deployed the young craftsmen.

469
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,550
What happened?

470
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,630
They said some parts of the palace halls are leaking

471
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,150
and require fixing.

472
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,570
The craftsmen won't be back until they've fixed the palace halls.

473
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,820
I'm Lu Ran, a junior official from the Imperial Surveillance Office.

474
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,400
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau is working hard on General Fu Zhisong's burial.

475
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,920
Eunuch Cao sent me to inquire with you, Lord.

476
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,280
Here are some snacks.

477
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,140
Please enjoy.

478
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,070
Thank you, Sir Lu.

479
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,760
If it's convenient for you, please show me around.

480
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,260
This way.

481
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,740
This is the chamber where the coffin will rest.

482
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,950
It turns out that a person ends up buried in such a small place.

483
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,240
It's not small.

484
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,800
Many people are buried wrapped in straw mats.

485
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,260
Lord Zang, you've barely started work on the carvings

486
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,770
and the stone tablet as well.

487
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,200
This is a big project.

488
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,460
Aren't two people too few for this job?

489
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,550
You're right.

490
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,950
I am having a hard time.

491
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,960
But with winter approaching, many places in the palace are leaking.

492
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,360
The craftsmen were sent there to repair them.

493
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,760
I heard about it.

494
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
Repairing the palace needs manpower.

495
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,570
Of course, they must send the workers there.

496
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,880
After all, His Majesty is the first priority.

497
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,910
It's not an easy job for you.

498
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,150
Many officials who encounter difficulties think

499
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,690
they are being bullied by their superiors.

500
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,680
They were so infuriated that

501
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,030
they even submitted memorials and wanted to kill themselves in front of His Majesty.

502
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,460
Eunuch Cao is trying to tell you that,

503
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,360
if you are driven into a corner,

504
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,590
don't blame it on the wrong person.

505
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,400
Otherwise, you may die for no reason by banging your head against the wall.

506
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,200
But then again, when there is a will, there is a way.

507
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,850
If you really can't do it,

508
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,280
you can try another approach.

509
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,110
Well, I am a bit confused.

510
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,720
Could you please enlighten me more, Sir Lu?

511
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,800
I will get straight to the point.

512
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,200
Eunuch Cao sent me here because he didn't want you to misunderstand his good intentions.

513
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,760
He overrode public opinions to let you take charge of General Fu's burial

514
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,050
because he values you and knows you can get the job done.

515
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,030
That's why he gave you the opportunity to impress His Majesty.

516
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,110
Others don't get such a great opportunity.

517
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,680
I'm truly grateful to Eunuch Cao for his appreciation.

518
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,290
Eunuch Cao is inviting some colleagues to a family feast the day after next.

519
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,610
If you're not busy, you can attend and join the fun.

520
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,400
If you can please Eunuch Cao and make him happy,

521
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,410
many things in the future will be easier for you.

522
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,950
All right.

523
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,840
I have done my job here.

524
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,240
I'm leaving.

525
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,110
By the way, I almost forgot

526
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,030
to give you the invitation.

527
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,900
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to enter.

528
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,540
   

529
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,950
   

530
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,640
Cao Jingxian is a eunuch.

531
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,400
Why would he hold a family feast?

532
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,530
He has no parents.

533
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,700
It's even less likely that he has children.

534
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,690
He invited you there to put on a show with his filial offspring?

535
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,180
He gave me a hard time and sent someone to give me advice.

536
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,930
He wants me to betray the Marquis and join forces with him.

537
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,570
Of course, it's for the Gui Seal.

538
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,720
What do you think of Lu Ran?

539
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,840
He should also be Cao Jingxian's foster son.

540
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,400
He speaks with precision and doesn't make mistakes.

541
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,280
It's not easy to deal with him.

542
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,100
It's easier to dodge the King of Hell than his petty demons.

543
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,950
If I can't build the tomb as scheduled,

544
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,080
Cao Jingxian will accuse me of deceiving His Majesty.

545
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,930
By then, I will really meet the King of Hell.

546
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:51,310
Xiao Hai, why don't you give in and ask Eunuch Cao for protection?

547
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,550
Master, you want me to join those filthy people

548
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,380
of the Imperial Surveillance Office?

549
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,830
At least, the Marquis of Pingjin doesn't tell me how to do my job.

550
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,360
But if I work for Cao Jingxian,

551
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,410
he won't let me remain righteous.

552
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,550
I warned you about the dangers in the imperial court.

553
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,550
Although it's easier to carry out investigations as an official,

554
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,720
but you'll encounter even more difficulties.

555
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,320
You've learned a lot.

556
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,360
It's impossible that you can't do it.

557
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,090
But I've never wanted to be an official.

558
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,160
I just want revenge.

559
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,150
Then tell me.

560
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,280
What is the most important thing for taking revenge?

561
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,680
To find the third person.

562
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,800
Wrong!

563
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,840
It's to survive.

564
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,400
Many things happened after you took office as the Imperial Astronomer.

565
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,200
You even need to face the civil and military officials in the imperial court,

566
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,630
and the Seal-Holding Grand Eunuch. There must not be any mistakes.

567
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:57,440
Hence, you must be both a good and a bad official.

568
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,280
Master,

569
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,720
these high-ranking officials are my enemies.

570
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,470
So, is the third person.

571
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:11,550
I must take revenge.

572
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,990
But no matter what, I can't become like them.

573
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,800
So stubborn.

574
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,110
Remain righteous then.

575
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,680
Good and bad luck are intertwined.

576
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,160
It won't be all bad.

577
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,990
Deal with the crisis with Cao Jingxian first.

578
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,490
I have tons of solutions.

579
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:41,140
- Like what? 
 - One of the solutions is to...

580
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,800
It's torn.

581
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,430
Don't bother about this. Go ahead. I'm listening.

582
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,880
One of the solutions is...

583
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,900
to think of another solution again.

584
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,470
You...

585
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:17,020
