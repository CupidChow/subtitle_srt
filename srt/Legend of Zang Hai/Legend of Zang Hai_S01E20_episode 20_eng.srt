1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:16,920



2
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,836
   

4
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,970
   

5
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,030
Should any guest arrive, direct them to the side entrance.

6
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,800
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,373
   

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,510
I am Zang Hai, the Imperial Astronomer. I have come to greet His Highness.

9
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,260
My visiting card was presented yesterday.

10
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,410
Official Zang, please come with me.

11
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,740
His Highness said today that fortune comes from the west,

12
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,190
so only the west gate will be opened.

13
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,150
His Highness is so particular about feng shui as well?

14
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,660
Yes.

15
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,370
Official Zang, this way, please.

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,630
Please wait here for now.

17
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,260
You will be summoned in due order.

18
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,840
Official Zang, please write down your birth characters.

19
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,890
His Highness will review them shortly.

20
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,117
   

21
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,670
This Zang Hai...

22
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,180
is rather interesting.

23
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,420
May I have your name, sir?

24
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,960
Zhang Huai. That's "Zhang" with the "li" and "zao" radicals.

25
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,630
May I ask which of you is Official Zang?

26
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,140
That would be me.

27
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,120
I am Shen Yong, Assistant Minister of the Court of Imperial Entertainments.

28
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,000
His Highness wishes to speak with you in the front hall.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,860
Please come with me.

30
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,650
Your Highness.

31
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,100
I am Zang Hai, Imperial Astronomer, here to pay my respects to Your Highness.

32
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,500
Zang Hai, so we meet at last.

33
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,920
The imperial mausoleum incident

34
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,190
once led me to believe your fate was clouded by misfortune,

35
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,750
with your Four Pillars governed by yin and your father's life cut short.

36
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,430
But upon seeing your birth characters,

37
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,260
I was surprised to find that you are blessed

38
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,680
with the fate of a Heavenly Noble, one who turns adversity into fortune,

39
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,630
with helping hands in hardship and salvation in danger.

40
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,610
Remarkable.

41
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,650
No wonder you have risen so quickly.

42
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,330
I have heard you made bold changes upon taking up your new post.

43
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,460
It seems you are at the height of your powers.

44
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,680
I am deeply humbled, Your Highness.

45
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,560
You are of imperial blood.

46
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,240
How could I, a mere official, presume to be called "noble" by you?

47
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,690
Still, you pique my curiosity.

48
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,310
You seem a man born under a cursed fate,

49
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,220
yet your destiny tells a different story.

50
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,440
Let me guess.

51
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,450
Has your fate been altered?

52
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,390
I indeed lost both my parents

53
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,430
at a young age, left lonely and helpless.

54
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,410
Yet my fate is not governed solely by yin.

55
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,500
At the imperial mausoleum, I was truly set up by others.

56
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,680
He dared to deceive His Majesty over a matter of national mourning.

57
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,190
Chu Huaiming's death was well deserved.

58
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,390
Thank you, Your Highness.

59
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,630
This humble gift is but a token of my respect.

60
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,950
May Your Highness kindly accept it.

61
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,150
Collecting a full set of Zhenyou Tongbao is uncommon as it stands,

62
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,080
let alone finding one in such excellent condition.

63
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,950
Where did you obtain them?

64
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,920
This set of Zhenyou Tongbao is indeed rare.

65
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,070
I acquired it by chance from a well-traveled merchant.

66
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,930
I now offer it to Your Highness.

67
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800
Well-informed, aren't you?

68
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,140
But I like that.

69
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,920
Now tell me.

70
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,720
What is it you're after?

71
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,270
I dare not presume too much, Your Highness.

72
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,560
I've heard much of Your Highness's refined taste and noble character,

73
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
and have long admired you.

74
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,630
I only hoped for the honor of meeting you

75
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,740
and perhaps receiving a few words of your guidance.

76
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,260
Guidance, you say?

77
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,040
You serve the Marquis of Pingjin.

78
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,320
Surely you know that's a big taboo in the official circles.

79
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,430
Say something.

80
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,000
Weren't you known for your silver tongue?

81
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,780
Why have you suddenly gone mute in front of me?

82
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,310
Your Highness stands second only to His Majesty.

83
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,120
While I waited earlier, I saw others leave disheartened,

84
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,940
and feared that the humble gift I brought might not catch your eye.

85
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,930
Now that Your Highness finds it pleasing, I consider myself most fortunate.

86
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,240
I dare not harbor any further presumptuous thoughts.

87
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,930
I spoke out of turn earlier. Please forgive me, Your Highness.

88
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,970
 Forgive! 

89
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,650
 Forgive! 

90
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,550
 Forgive! 

91
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,390
This creature actually knows how to plead.

92
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,160
It's surprisingly clever.

93
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,480
Many come to my mansion with presents.

94
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,560
If I accepted them all, my household would be in chaos.

95
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,720
Usually, those whose gifts are accepted

96
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,650
are eager to ask for something in return.

97
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,190
Yet you seem to be holding back.

98
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,720
What is it?

99
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,920
Are you planning to secure something big with a long-term strategy?

100
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,160
I wouldn't dare.

101
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,270
Truth be told, ever since I joined the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

102
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,240
I have come to realize how perilous an official's path truly is.

103
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,550
I fear that someday I might share the same tragic end as Chu Huaiming.

104
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,600
I hope to meet wise mentors and trustworthy friends

105
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,560
and broaden my horizons.

106
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,180
Why didn't you just say that earlier?

107
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,670
Most officials in the capital come to me

108
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,220
with the same intentions as you.

109
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,000
Why are you still on your knees?

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,960
Shen Yong, help Official Zang up.

111
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,490
Yes, Your Highness.

112
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,320
Official Zang.

113
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,150
Let me ask you this.

114
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,030
You say I have refined taste,

115
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,350
but the things I love most reek of money.

116
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,790
Where's the refinement in that?

117
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,440
As I made my way here,

118
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,840
I couldn't help but notice the elegance in every flower, tree,

119
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,200
and blade of grass in Your Highness's courtyard.

120
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,010
That gnarled and vigorous desert poplar,

121
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,240
twisting like a coiled dragon,

122
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,630
has stood for over a thousand years.

123
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,000
I daresay that single tree alone is worth ten years of my humble salary.

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,150
You've got quite the discerning eye.

125
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,600
I had that tree brought back alive from the desert.

126
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,480
It took quite an effort.

127
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,670
Yet others come by and wonder why I've placed

128
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,270
a withered, lifeless tree in my courtyard.

129
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,870
Few recognize its worth, as you do.

130
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,150
Having assumed the role of Imperial Astronomer,

131
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,240
I've devoted myself to advancing my expertise in geomancy and object appraisal.

132
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,550
I once fancied myself knowledgeable,

133
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,970
but after visiting Your Highness's mansion today,

134
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,700
I see how much remains beyond my grasp.

135
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,100
You're certainly well-spoken.

136
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,720
I do like the gift you've brought,

137
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,440
but giving gifts in official circles requires a bit of finesse.

138
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,040
I can show you the proper way.

139
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,550
- Shen Yong. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

140
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:48,010
Today, Official Zang is gifting you this Zhenyou Tongbao collection.

141
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,440
Yes, Your Highness.

142
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,510
Shen Yong, that's a fine collection you have there.

143
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,630
Your Highness, this set of Zhenyou Tongbao was gifted

144
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,870
by Official Zang of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

145
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,870
He says it is an exceedingly rare treasure.

146
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,630
As you know, I lack the expertise to fully appreciate it.

147
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,030
Perhaps you could give me something from your collection

148
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,050
so we can exchange and appreciate each other's treasures.

149
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,440
Look at you, so greedy.

150
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,710
I won't take it from you for free.

151
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,080
See?

152
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,120
Now you're not simply here to present me with treasures.

153
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,180
You and Official Shen are friends, after all.

154
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,150
It brings me great joy to have received such a precious set today.

155
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,720
I'll surely have a few more drinks tonight.

156
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,350
Shen Yong,

157
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,070
since this new friend of yours is eager to broaden his horizons,

158
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,030
why not invite him to join the banquet tonight?

159
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,300
Your Highness is absolutely right.

160
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,390
Official Zang, would you be willing to accompany us?

161
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,960
It would be my utmost pleasure.

162
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,830
Thank you, Your Highness.

163
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,740
However, that outfit of yours is somewhat modest.

164
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,810
Shen Yong, get Official Zang something more suitable to wear.

165
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,420
Yes, Your Highness.

166
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,120
Congratulations, Official Zang.

167
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,870
This is no ordinary banquet.

168
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,940
After tonight, you won't be the same as before.

169
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,840
His Highness's night banquets occur once every three years

170
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,810
and are never held at the same venue twice.

171
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,510
If it weren't for His Highness's banquet,

172
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,030
who else in the capital could book the entire Zhen Tower?

173
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,910
You probably don't know many people here today.

174
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,620
Shall I tell you who's here?

175
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,610
Much obliged, Official Shen.

176
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,770
The gentleman seated to the left of the main seat

177
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,910
is Minister of Rites, Official Huang Shen.

178
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,840
Apart from His Highness, he is the next highest-ranking official present today.

179
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,080
Next to Official Huang is Han Lun,

180
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,910
the Right Administration Vice Commissioner of the Huguang Region.

181
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,550
Being from the same area,

182
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,750
they are likely reminiscing about old times.

183
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,320
The gentleman seated to the right of the main seat

184
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,840
is Wang Shiqi, Vice Minister of Personnel.

185
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,160
Next to him is Li Fu,

186
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,150
the Left Administration Vice Commissioner of Dingzhou.

187
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,720
What do you suppose they are discussing?

188
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,330
Perhaps Li Fu is asking Official Wang to have him transferred back to the capital?

189
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,750
As the saying goes, "The sky is high and the emperor is far away."

190
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,000
With so many influential officials in the capital,

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,200
why would a local official, the highest authority in his own domain,

192
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,710
choose to return to the capital and serve under others?

193
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,320
It is better to be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish in a big pond.

194
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,500
Official Zang, you sound anything but a newcomer to official circles.

195
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,390
No wonder His Highness holds you in such high regard.

196
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,440
You flatter me, Official Shen.

197
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,790
His Highness is here.

198
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,120
- Your Highness. 
 - His Highness is here.

199
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,450
Greetings, Your Highness.

200
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,760
You're all here.

201
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,720
Official Wang.

202
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,000
The one who arrived with His Highness

203
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,840
is Zhang Keshu, Grand Coordinator of Luzhou.

204
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,030
Official Huang.

205
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,750
Your Highness.

206
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,280
Thank you all for waiting.

207
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,870
Allow me to introduce a new face to you:

208
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,500
Zang Hai, Imperial Astronomer, a man of exceptional talent.

209
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,510
I am Zang Hai.

210
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,840
Thanks to His Highness's gracious favor,

211
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,840
I have the privilege of meeting all of you today.

212
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,150
I've read Official Zang's memorials.

213
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,250
He certainly has a bold and decisive style.

214
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,580
In that case, you'd better be careful today

215
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,720
and not offend Official Zang.

216
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,200
I wouldn't dare.

217
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,960
In terms of drafting memorials,

218
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,660
I must admit I am but a novice compared to all of you.

219
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,040
Zang Hai, we are all officials serving the same court,

220
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,440
and they are quite close to me.

221
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,080
You're new to official circles,

222
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,320
instead of coming to me all the time,

223
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,850
you should be asking them for help more.

224
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,870
Many thanks, Your Highness.

225
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,910
All right.

226
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,750
There's no need for formalities at my banquet.

227
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,320
Just enjoy yourselves to the fullest.

228
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,890
Now, if you please.

229
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,840
I'm sure you've all met His Majesty.

230
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,670
So, let's raise the first cup to him

231
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,670
and wish him good health.

232
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,310
May you all join forces to support my imperial brother in his duties.

233
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,980
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

234
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,030
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

235
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,550
Official Zang, His Highness kept praising you earlier.

236
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,750
Your talent in deciphering astronomical phenomena is truly remarkable.

237
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,270
You even outshone Chu Huaiming.

238
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,200
Chu Huaiming has only himself to blame.

239
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,960
He failed in his own duties

240
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,120
and even schemed against others.

241
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,630
Had he chosen to serve under me back then,

242
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,080
he might not have been exiled.

243
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,000
Then again, I doubt I would've taken him in.

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,040
Your Highness, might there be a curse upon the post of Imperial Astronomer?

245
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,320
Just look at how things ended for Chu Huaiming.

246
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,230
Perhaps Official Zang should consider stepping away before misfortune strikes?

247
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,270
Official Zhang does have a point.

248
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,910
Have you all forgotten

249
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,200
who held the post before Chu Huaiming?

250
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,630
Kuai Duo was a man of great talent,

251
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,700
yet he died all the same.

252
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,120
Zang Hai, don't panic.

253
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,170
Perhaps you should consider Official Zhang's suggestion

254
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,590
and take a different post.

255
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,830
I'll pick one for you.

256
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,050
Many thanks, Your Highness.

257
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,150
However, I remain devoted to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

258
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,000
I heard you mention Official Kuai just now,

259
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,410
a name unfamiliar to me.

260
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,390
Might Your Highness kindly tell me more about him?

261
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,720
Do you truly wish to hear about what happened to Official Kuai?

262
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,450
I need to find a way to make the most of opportunities

263
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,510
and steer clear of trouble.

264
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,820
Unlike Chu Huaiming,

265
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,450
the issue wasn't within the bureaucracy.

266
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,340
What happened was that his entire family was massacred.

267
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,440
Such a thing really happened?

268
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,110
How come no one from the bureau ever mentioned it to me?

269
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,110
You just became the Imperial Astronomer.

270
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,980
Who would be foolish enough to talk about that with you?

271
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:20,110
Kuai Duo was supposedly overseeing the construction of Dongxia's Fengshan Altar.

272
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,030
But before it was finished, the altar collapsed.

273
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,790
He secretly fled back to his home in the capital,

274
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,440
only to be mysteriously attacked and killed by bandits.

275
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,680
His whole family was burned beyond recognition,

276
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,030
and not a single soul survived.

277
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,450
I did not expect such a fate for Official Kuai.

278
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,100
In Your Highness's opinion,

279
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,800
could his enemies have been responsible for his death?

280
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,060
You are indeed clever, Official Zang.

281
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,270
I thought the same

282
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,350
and even personally investigated the case.

283
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,610
Kuai Duo's house was completely looted.

284
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,410
The robbers were later caught

285
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,270
and, under severe punishment, confessed.

286
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,920
Only then was the case closed.

287
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,470
So, what happened to those bandits in the end?

288
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,160
Generally speaking,

289
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,240
some of the culprits might not have warranted execution.

290
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,970
However, Official Kuai was a fifth-rank Imperial Astronomer,

291
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,920
and the incident stirred outrage among many court officials.

292
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,000
At the time, Official Zhao, Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

293
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,170
submitted a petition urging His Majesty to punish the offenders severely.

294
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,460
In the end, none were exiled and all were executed.

295
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,000
Your Highness, there is one thing I do not understand.

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,030
If the bodies of the entire Kuai family were burned beyond recognition,

297
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:53,240
how could anyone be certain that Official Kuai had truly returned from Dongxia?

298
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,440
Zang Hai,

299
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,510
you seem quite interested in Kuai Duo's death.

300
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,070
Your Highness, I fear for my life, too.

301
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,160
I have to find a way to protect myself.

302
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,690
What if there really is something wrong with the bureau's feng shui?

303
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,640
Why bring this up on such a fine day?

304
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Who started it?

305
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,450
Your Highness, if you didn't mention Kuai Duo, who else would dare to talk about it?

306
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,960
Look at me, so forgetful.

307
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,550
I'll drink as an apology.

308
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,240
I'll drink it now.

309
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,880
Come, let's fill our cups, too.

310
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,850
Come now, fill them all up.

311
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,270
- To Your Highness. 
 - To Your Highness.

312
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,710
- To Your Highness. 
 - To Your Highness.

313
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,310
Shen Yong.

314
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,500
Your Highness.

315
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,440
Didn't you say you invited the capital's top courtesan today?

316
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,980
Why hasn't she arrived yet?

317
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,160
Today isn't like any other day.

318
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,200
Since she's here to meet Your Highness,

319
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,340
she must be taking her time to get ready.

320
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,350
Then I shall wait a bit longer,

321
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:12,050
in case the courtesan ruins her makeup when she's rushed.

322
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,030
- Bravo. 
 - Bravo.

323
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,770
Bravo.

324
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,340
Your Highness, my master was unable to come today,

325
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,110
so I've been sent to present

326
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,960
this top-grade liquor of Zhen Tower as a sign of goodwill.

327
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,070
What liquor is this?

328
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,350
This liquor is called

329
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,030
- the Fall of Mulberry Leaves. 
 - This Zhen Tower's liquor tastes really good.

330
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,670
Such fine liquor.

331
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,760
Your Highness, may I ask what liquor this is?

332
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,940
Fragrant.

333
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,920
Your Highness, may I have a sip of it?

334
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,160
Don't even think about it.

335
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,290
There's not enough of this liquor for each of you to have a sip.

336
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,680
Well then, our idle talk ends here today.

337
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,160
Bring out the treasures you've prepared.

338
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,930
If I find anything I like,

339
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:10,550
I'll gladly trade a sip of this Fall of Mulberry Leaves for it.

340
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,390
Official Zang, His Highness always has the habit of appraising treasures

341
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,180
whenever he holds a banquet.

342
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,300
Should there be an item that catches His Highness's eye,

343
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,160
it can be exchanged for something else from him.

344
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,880
What's gained in return goes beyond mere valuables.

345
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,100
Jade pig-dragon.

346
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,070
Your Highness has such a keen eye.

347
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,630
Go ahead.

348
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,900
You shall be rewarded.

349
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,510
Your Highness, I have recently obtained a rare treasure.

350
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,510
Open it and show me.

351
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,940
Yes, Your Highness.

352
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,570
Your Highness, please have a look.

353
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,760
What's so special about this item?

354
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,510
It is said to be an item worn by ghost soldiers.

355
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,310
- Ghost soldiers? 
 - That's right.

356
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,000
Aren't ghost soldiers just legends?

357
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,160
How could they possibly use this?

358
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,030
I obtained this item by chance

359
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,140
and don't have much knowledge about it.

360
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,980
Your Highness,

361
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,190
I know a thing or two about this.

362
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,690
I once heard from an old soldier returning from the frontier

363
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,640
that these ghost soldiers have flesh but no blood.

364
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,990
Even if cut by swords or blades, their wounds heal swiftly.

365
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,030
When an army marches through, corpses are left everywhere.

366
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:45,620
It's said they are summoned by a certain treasure.

367
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,650
A treasure?

368
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:59,470
Zang Hai, the treasure you're talking about is the Gui Seal, isn't it?

369
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,500
The Gui Seal?

370
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,610
So, this treasure is called the Gui Seal.

371
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,610
The old soldier said he'd never seen it

372
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,560
and that those who had are already dead.

373
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,480
But, Your Highness, how do you know about it?

374
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,700
My father died because of the Gui Seal.

375
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,200
Why are you all so anxious?

376
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,350
The late emperor did not die at the hands of the ghost soldiers.

377
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,790
He passed away out of sorrow and frustration

378
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,260
due to the urgent warfare on the front lines.

379
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,100
Even I have never seen the Gui Seal myself.

380
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,270
I, too, am very curious about it.

381
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,160
- Li Fu. 
 - Your Highness.

382
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,650
In my opinion,

383
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:16,340
this thing is hardly different from the helmets worn by the Dongxia soldiers.

384
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,750
What Official Zang said is far more interesting.

385
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,520
Yes, Your Highness.

386
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,490
All right, I've seen everything you brought over,

387
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:38,840
but none has pleased me quite like this treasure.

388
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,350
Look here.

389
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:47,480
One of these Zhesan coins appeared at an auction not long ago.

390
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,310
I sent someone to buy it, but it was snatched away.

391
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,030
I heard it fetched a hefty price.

392
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,030
I was quite upset about that.

393
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,400
But today, I've managed to get the whole set.

394
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,820
Tell me. Am I not a lucky man?

395
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,180
You are most lucky. You certainly are.

396
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,130
- You are indeed lucky. 
 - You are indeed lucky.

397
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,530
Speaking of these ancient coins,

398
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,720
it's all thanks to Official Zang.

399
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,610
Official Zang, you shall be rewarded!

400
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,430
Thank you, Your Highness.

401
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,890
Official Zang, may your rise through the ranks be swift and smooth.

402
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,570
Thank you, Miss.

403
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,400
Zang Hai, what do you think of the liquor?

404
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,000
Y-Your Highness, this liquor is richly aromatic,

405
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,120
but it's far too spicy for me to drink.

406
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,290
This stuff's wasted on you, young man.

407
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,850
Your Highness, that hardly seems fair.

408
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,200
Everyone knows you're most fond of ancient coins.

409
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,780
We should bet on something else with this liquor.

410
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,713
   

411
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,690
This liquor… I drank a lot without realizing it today.

412
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,350
I can't keep going.

413
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,720
Shen Yong.

414
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,450
Come here.

415
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,850
Help me to the back room to rest.

416
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,350
Careful, Your Highness.

417
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,960
Wait.

418
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,660
I can't leave my treasure behind.

419
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,510
Be careful.

420
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,480
Don't you all even think about stealing my liquor.

421
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,280
- We wouldn't dare. 
 - Come.

422
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,380
- Take care, Your Highness. 
 - Let's go.

423
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,690
- Take care, Your Highness. 
 - Take care, Your Highness.

424
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,460
 Take care, Your Highness. 

425
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,850
- Miss Xiang. 
 - Official Zang, have a drink.

426
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,550
- Miss Xiang, why are you... 
 - What is it?

427
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,070
Are you implying the liquor I poured

428
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,410
isn't as fragrant as the one His Highness poured?

429
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,020
- That's not what I meant. 
 - Will you drink it or not?

430
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,480
You've made quite the impression at the banquet tonight.

431
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,850
That ancient coin of mine really came in handy.

432
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,040
Thank you for your help, Miss Xiang.

433
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,790
I must be clear about one thing.

434
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,480
About this ancient coin, I neither sold it to you,

435
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,150
nor gave it to you as a gift.

436
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,550
Now that you have won His Highness's favor,

437
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,260
it should be returned to its rightful owner.

438
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,120
Miss...

439
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,060
- Official Zang. 
 - Official Shen.

440
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,070
Official Zang, this won't do.

441
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,490
Why is there still some liquor left in the cup?

442
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,070
Official Shen, I... I honestly can't drink another drop.

443
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,390
Official Zang, His Highness wants you to enjoy yourself today.

444
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,110
So, don't hold yourself back.

445
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,150
Cheers.

446
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,610
Cheers.

447
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,010
Your Highness.

448
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,790
Your Highness.

449
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,310
Please wake up.

450
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,590
Let's keep drinking.

451
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,200
I...

452
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,130
I can't drink anymore.

453
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,070
Your Highness, you've returned to the mansion.

454
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,590
Let me help you to bed to rest.

455
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,390
No need.

456
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,410
Here is fine.

457
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:11,090
Your Highness, your Gui Seal is missing.

458
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,750
The Gui Seal?

459
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,830
Where is it?

460
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,560
Where is it?

461
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,920
But Official Zang, His Highness truly likes you,

462
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,290
He even granted you some liquor to drink.

463
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,550
This wine is indeed top-grade.

464
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,240
I've never seen His Highness get drunk so quickly before.

465
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,790
So, how is His Highness now?

466
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,110
Don't worry.

467
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,000
I just gave him a special hangover cure powder.

468
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,320
He'll sober up in no time.

469
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,470
Have you really never seen the Gui Seal?

470
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,060
Stop right there.

471
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,570
Who are you?

472
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,040
I am here to serve Your Highness.

473
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,370
Were you talking to me just now?

474
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,070
Tell me.

475
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,390
What did you just do?

476
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,570
Your Highness.

477
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,430
Look what I found here.

478
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,210
You left the Zhesan coin on the couch outside.

479
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,790
If it gets lost,

480
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,080
where am I supposed to find another one?

481
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,080
I really drank too much today.

482
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,520
Why are you still standing there?

483
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,680
Go fetch another spittoon for His Highness.

484
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,090
Go now!

485
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,110
Well done, Zang Hai.

486
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:48,600
You've brought me another one of these Zhesan coins.

487
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:56,880
Your Highness, how about granting me another cup of your fine liquor?

488
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,520
I was mocked when I drank the first cup.

489
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,950
I've got to keep my pride intact, haven't I?

490
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,770
- Your wish is granted. 
 - Thank you, Your Highness.

491
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,900
I'll go and get the liquor now.

492
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,020
Wait.

493
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:28,880
Someone just whispered something in my ear.

494
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,360
I saw Shen Yong leave your side not long ago.

495
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,450
Could it be that Official Shen said something to you?

496
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,150
No. It was a woman.

497
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,800
A woman?

498
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,440
What was she saying?

499
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,740
- Your Highness. You've had too much to drink. 
 - Go away!

500
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,320
 Your Highness, I'm coming in. 

501
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,800
Your Highness sure knows how to make an escape,

502
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,520
sneaking off here to avoid drinking,

503
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,940
and on top of that, you forgot all about me.

504
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,740
I was wondering which courtesan was putting on such airs.

505
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,650
Turns out it's you, Liu Chu.

506
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,070
Your Highness is hosting a banquet at Zhen Tower today.

507
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,710
How could I not come to join the fun?

508
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,940
Your Highness, I asked you just now what outfit you liked on me,

509
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,960
and which dance you wanted to see.

510
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,420
But you didn't even say a word.

511
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,820
Is that so?

512
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,920
I came today without letting you know in advance.

513
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,530
You're not upset with me, are you?

514
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,050
You gave me such a pleasant surprise.

515
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,720
How could I possibly be upset with you?

516
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,150
Liu Chu, come and meet someone.

517
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,190
This is a new friend of mine.

518
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,000
He is...

519
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,270
I am the Imperial Astronomer,

520
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,380
- Zang Hai. 
 - Yes, that's right.

521
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,090
You are quite good-looking.

522
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,000
Greetings, Miss Liu Chu.

523
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,950
Miss?

524
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,710
It's been ages since anyone's called me that. How refreshing.

525
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,750
Your Highness, I've prepared a special dance for the occasion.

526
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,970
Would you care to come take a look?

527
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,640
Sure, Miss Liu Chu.

528
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,940
 Might Your Highness kindly tell me more about Official Kuai? 

529
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,190
 Kuai Duo was a man of great talent, 

530
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,520
 yet he died all the same. 

531
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,920
 His whole family was burned beyond recognition, 

532
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,320
 and not a single soul survived. 

533
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,650
 You seem quite interested in Kuai Duo's death. 

534
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,150
 The treasure you're talking about is the Gui Seal, isn't it? 

535
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:11,070
 My father died because of the Gui Seal. 

536
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:14,440
 Even I have never seen the Gui Seal myself. 

537
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,780
 I, too, am very curious about it. 

538
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,540
You are awake.

539
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,480
Master Liu Chu.

540
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,860
You drank so much.

541
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,770
You probably don't even remember how you got into the carriage.

542
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,650
It's a shame that after all that talking,

543
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,520
I still can't be sure if the Prince of Yongrong is the third person.

544
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,370
It's not him. You don't need to investigate anymore.

545
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,190
When misfortune befell your family,

546
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,440
His Highness was attending a night banquet.

547
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,890
Was it the very night my family was wiped out?

548
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,880
So many years have passed,

549
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,860
yet I still remember the fire that night.

550
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,110
The banquet was held on a luxurious boat,

551
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,780
and I was there as well.

552
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,510
At dusk, everyone boarded the boat,

553
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:08,940
which sailed northeast along the Guangji River.

554
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,780
We only docked at dawn,

555
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:16,760
and it was His Highness who first noticed the distant sky glowing red.

556
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,020
Only then did everyone step outside to take a look.

557
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,150
That means none of the guests at the banquet that night

558
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,700
could have been involved in the massacre of my family.

559
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,940
Yes.

560
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,590
As soon as Gao Ming told me you were going to visit His Highness,

561
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:38,350
I rushed over so you wouldn't waste your effort.

562
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,440
Thank you, Master, for coming to help me today.

563
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,710
This helps with hangovers.

564
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,670
Dissolve it and have him drink it.

565
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,330
All right.

566
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,750
Good thing you informed me;

567
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,630
otherwise, he might not have made it through today.

568
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,170
He set out before completing his training,

569
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,670
so he's not exactly fully prepared.

570
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,910
Right. So, if he were like you, he'd manage just fine?

571
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,610
Of course. I'm his master, after all.

572
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,090
I'm leaving.

573
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,060
You're leaving already?

574
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,780
 Xiao Hai? 

575
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,250
Master, please come in.

576
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,620
You're up.

577
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,990
I made you some congee. Come.

578
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,350
Thank you, Master.

579
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:15,100
Here. Have some.

580
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,900
How do you feel? Are you sober now?

581
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,920
You came back last night and said nothing.

582
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,600
I was worried you'd wake up and forget everything.

583
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,580
Did you find any leads?

584
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,550
Throughout last night, I was suspicious of the Prince of Yongrong,

585
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:38,450
but Master Liu Chu's words made me completely dismiss those doubts.

586
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:52,860
That said, a person brought up during the night banquet caught my attention.

587
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,190
Who is it?

588
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:58,600
Official Zhao Bingwen, Minister of Revenue.

589
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,120
Is there a problem with Official Zhao?

590
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,880
He's not directly related to my family's massacre,

591
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,380
but after the incident,

592
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,440
he did petition His Majesty to punish the culprits harshly,

593
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,650
resulting in the execution of all those bandits.

594
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,920
Those bandits were either bought off or tortured into confessing.

595
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,670
Either way, if even one of them had lived,

596
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,760
the truth would have inevitably been exposed.

597
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,060
However, what Official Zhao did is understandable.

598
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,780
My father was an upright man,

599
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,150
and it's natural that some court officials

600
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,590
were filled with righteous indignation.

601
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,200
But as long as there's even a slight chance

602
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,570
that a third party is covering up the truth,

603
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,870
I won't let it go.

604
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:53,220
Yes. After all, this is the only lead we have now.

605
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,100
It seems I must find a way to meet him.

606
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:14,890



607
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:22,200
