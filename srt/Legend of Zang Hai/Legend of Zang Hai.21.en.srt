[Episode 21]

3
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,330
Mr. Zang.

[Zhao's Mansion]

00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,820
Mr. Zang.

7
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,850
May you be well, Mr. Zhao.

8
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,420
Step back.

9
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,460
Don't be surprised.

10
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,770
His Majesty rewarded me

11
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,580
with this mansion many years ago.

12
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,530
It has turned a bit shabby.

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,700
The Construction Bureau has failed in its duty

14
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,580
if you have to fix the rooftop in person.

15
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,860
I didn't report it to the court.

16
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,180
It's not their fault.

17
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,090
Master, be careful.

18
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,580
I understand you're quite knowledgeable about architecture.

19
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,780
I guess I've been showing off before an expert.

20
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,900
You even fix your rooftop in person, sir.

21
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,860
I am inspired.

22
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,050
Come with me.

23
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,860
Mr. Zhao.

24
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,860
[Ledger of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau]
You can put it away.

25
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,700
I know

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,300
you're not the one who caused these accounting problems.

27
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,930
Unfortunately, Chu Huaiming is dead.

28
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,020
No matter how well we examine the ledger,

29
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,860
we can't get the embezzled money back.

30
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,810
You are truly insightful.

31
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,420
It's necessary to be insightful.

32
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,180
If an official only focuses on his work

33
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,170
without being perceptive,

34
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,260
he may end up in huge trouble.

35
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,020
What do you mean, sir?

36
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,820
The Cabinet has received

37
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,970
many complaints about you these days.

38
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,170
Do you know how many people you have unintentionally offended?

39
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,500
So many people complained about me

40
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,770
but I was not affected at all.

41
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,020
I believe

42
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,090
it's because those complaints

43
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,620
are nothing more than whining.

44
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,210
It doesn't matter whether they have a point.

45
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,770
If an official gets complaints every day,

46
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,730
once the complaints pile up,

47
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,060
even the innocent will become guilty.

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,020
You are right, sir.

49
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,620
But please allow me

50
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,100
to ask you a question.

51
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,330
Do you think

52
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,060
the officials have to turn a blind eye

53
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,580
to what is obviously unfair?

54
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,210
Water too clear breeds no fish.

55
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,020
A man too critical finds no followers.

56
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,380
If you're just trying to seek momentary pleasure

57
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,620
and establish yourself in the court,

58
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,060
then it might be a good approach.

59
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,850
But if you long for reformation from the bottom of your heart,

60
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,700
then you're doing it the wrong way.

61
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,460
I do not understand.

62
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,410
Please enlighten me.

63
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,140
You were recommended

64
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,290
by the Marquis of Pingjin

65
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,060
to be the fifth-rank Imperial Astronomer at such a young age.

66
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,410
There are many things you don't understand.

67
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,820
To make the Imperial Astronomical Bureau better

68
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,960
is not a bad idea.

69
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,060
But don't forget

70
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,460
that this bureau used to serve

71
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,770
the interest of the royal family.

72
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,410
No matter how distinguished

73
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,410
those people are,

74
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,260
as long as they violate the law of the Great Yong,

75
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,530
I'm not afraid of going after them.

76
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,210
I will continue the investigation.

77
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,620
Please help me

78
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,770
put them to justice one by one.

79
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,090
The list you handed in has already

80
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,530
put the Cabinet in chaos.

81
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,460
Who to investigate first?

82
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,260
Who is to be executed? Who is to be exiled?

83
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,970
It may seem like nothing is happening yet,

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,410
but in fact, several forces are competing to take control.

85
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,460
You stirred up this mess on a whim.

86
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,700
Has it crossed your mind how many people might be looking for trouble?

87
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,850
That's exactly what I want.

88
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,730
If the court officials merely try to stay out of trouble,

89
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,730
then the list

90
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,820
won't do anything.

91
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,900
But what if they believe they can make a big fuss about it

92
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,730
and use it against their rivalries?

93
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,080
If this list is impeccable,

94
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,970
who will step forward

95
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,290
to eliminate evil from the imperial court?

96
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,500
If you figure out their network

97
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,700
and join forces with someone,

98
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,260
you can turn them against each other and take them down.

99
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,580
It's understandable for you to resort to this approach

100
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,060
in your position.

101
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,940
The Marquis of Pingjin didn't want that, did he?

102
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,210
Otherwise, he would have done it

103
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,580
when Chu Huaiming was there.

104
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,650
You became his aide

105
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,770
for this very day?

106
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,260
Then here's another piece of advice.

107
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,690
The world of politics is vicious.

108
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,340
Establish yourself before doing anything.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,290
Protect yourself if you want to rectify the administration.

110
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,810
Because the greater power you hold,

111
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,450
the more things you can do.

112
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,770
Unless you are sure you can

113
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,320
achieve your goal,

114
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,290
get ahold of power first.

115
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,860
Thank you for your advice.

116
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,690
Think of this ledger

117
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,050
as a warning.

118
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,690
Master.

119
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,220
It's about time.

120
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,900
You have to attend the Cabinet meeting.

121
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,140
Help me get changed.

122
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,050

124
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,650
I'm quite used to

this old mansion.

126
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,650
Since you're here,

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,930
please help me fix the tiles.

128
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,860
Will you?

129
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,530
Rest assured, sir.

130
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,570
Master.

131
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,650
This mortar trowel is a bit blunt.

132
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,170
Please bring a new one.

133
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,140
By the way.

134
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,620
Bring some new tiles and mortar.

Understood.

136
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,380
Have you brought the consultation letters from the Provincial Revenue Office?

137
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,170
I didn't know you'd need them and left them in the study.

138
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,650
Let's go back.

139
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,380
Master, be careful.

140
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,690
Where is Zang Hai?

141
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,860
Master.

142
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,290
Mr. Zang sent me to get some tools.

143
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,340
He was here just now.

[Mobilize Zhao Bingwen for Yuezhou relief operations]

145
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,980
What are you doing here?

146

Mr. Zhao.

147
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,620
Answer my question.

148
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,500
Shouldn't you be repairing tiles in the front yard?

149
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,810
Sir.

150
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,980
When I was in the front yard,

151
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,500
a servant told me

152
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,220
to inspect the study

153
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,170
because it often felt cold in there

154
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,450
for no apparent reason.

155
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,140
Really?

156
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,340
So what is the problem?

157
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,100
I have looked around.

158
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,860
It just has some crevices

159
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,930
after all these years

160
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,050
and they happen to be unnoticeable

161
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,260
behind the shelves.

162
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,340
Like you said,

163
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,620
I know a few things about construction work.

164
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,690
Since I'm right here,

165
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,570
I thought I could fix it.

166
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,500
I should have asked you

167
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,930
for approval.

168
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,050
Thank you for the effort.

169
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,340
But

170
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,780
the study room is full of top-class confidential files.

171
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,500
You went in on your own.

172
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,690
It's hard to tell what you have seen

173
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,260
and done.

174
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,770
You said

175
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,530
that a servant brought you here.

176
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,860
Where is he?

177
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,140
He was right outside

178
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,530

179

180

Get all the servants here

181
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,450
for Mr. Zang to identify.

182
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,810
Let's see who brought him to the study.

183
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,140
That person shall be

184
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,050
punished without mercy.

185

189

191
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,860
I just met him for the first time.

192
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,740
I really can't remember.

193
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,170
It's alright.

194
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,520
You don't remember him.

195
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,290
But he definitely remembers you.

196
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,690
Who spoke with Mr. Zang today?

197
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,650
Who asked him to take a look at the study room

198
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,500
because it was cold?

199
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,650
Since no one admits it,

200
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,050
be punished together.

201
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,380
Master, we're wronged.

202
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,170
We're wronged, Master.

203
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,050
Master, we're wronged.

204
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,050
Mr. Zhao.

205
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,860
That servant meant well.

206
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,770
If you put it that way,

207
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,650
then I promise

208
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,290
I won't punish him as long as he confesses.

209
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,260
But then again,

210
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,900
these people have served me for years

211
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,530
and know the rules.

212
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,050
If you lied to me about being brought

213
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,100
to my study room,

214
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,050
then why exactly did you go in there?

215
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,980
If you can't explain it,

216
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,220
I'm afraid we'll have to talk somewhere else.

217
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,380
Father.

218
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,900
I asked him to come.

219
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,620
Father.

220
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,260
Your study is really old.

221
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,140
I find it chilly in there,

222
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,690
and it gives you headaches.

223
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,900
Since Mr. Zang

224
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,380
is the Imperial Astronomer,

225
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,220
I asked him to take a look.

226
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,650
I had barely left

227
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,780
when I heard you scolding the servants.

228
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,300
What's the big fuss?

229
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,250
You asked him to come?

230
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,690
He said a servant brought him here.

231
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,140
Father.

232
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,210
I just came back from outside,

233
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,450
dressed like a man.

234
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,930
But he actually

235
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,410
mistook me as a servant.

236
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,060
That calls for punishment.

237
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,300
Please forgive me, Miss.

238
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,140
I failed to discern it. I apologize.

239
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,170
It was really you?

240
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,170
I don't even know him.

241
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,010
Why would I cover for him?

242
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,970
So it's just a misunderstanding.

243
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,120
In that case,

244
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,300
go ahead and renovate the study room.

245
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,540
Zhao Geng.

246
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,280
Master.

247
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,210
Keep Mr. Zang company.

248
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,970
Understood.

249
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,860
[Zang Residence]

250
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,380
On the 20th day of the 8th month in the 6th year of the Zhenshun era,

251
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,780
that is, before my family was killed,

252
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,140
the Ministry of Revenue sent Vice Director Zhao Bingwen

253
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,140
to coordinate disaster relief efforts in Yuezhou.

254
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,300
So Zhao Bingwen wasn't even in the Capital

255
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,900
the night your family was murdered.

256
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,580
That's right.

257
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,490
Yuezhou is far away from the Capital.

258
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,410
It takes about 20 days

259
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,210
to go there and come back.

260
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,730
Let's be cautious.

261
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,930
I'll check the local gazetteer.

262
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,580
If it has a record of it,

263
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,170
then Zhao Bingwen can't be the third culprit.

264
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,910
We've come to

265
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,100
a dead end again.

266
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,900
Our effort wasn't in vain.

267
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,060
You found out

268
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,620
that Mr. Eight working for Miss Xiang

269
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,210
is the daughter of the Minister of Revenue.

270
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,060
Children from wealthy families are truly different.

271
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,170
Instead of staying at home,

272
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,820
she tells stories at the Zhen Tower.

273
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,170
If my father were the Minister of Revenue,

274
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,060
I wouldn't do anything

275
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,340
apart from collecting taxes all day.

276
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,730
How would it feel to get money

277
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,250
from people every day?

278
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,410
Master.

279
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,490
Wake up. Stop daydreaming.

280
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,970
I actually need a favor.

281
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,490
Have you come across any rare novels

282
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,820
while you were running the bookstore?

283
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,060
I want to get some for her as a thank-you gift.

284
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,860
Novels.

285
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,170
Some old friends of mine have a huge collection of those.

286
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,650
But won't you be thanking the wrong person?

287
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,900
Mr. Eight doesn't even know you.

288
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,300
Why did she help you?

289
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,250
Think about it carefully.

290
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,270
[Legend of Han Qinhu]

291
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,410
This is impressive, Mr. Zang.

292
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,250
[The Drunkard's Tales]
Legend of Han Qinhu.

293
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,140
I've been looking for it for ages.

294
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,250
Thank you for helping me out

295
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,010
in front of Mr. Zhao.

296
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,730
I brought you these novels

297
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,010
to show my gratitude.

298
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,340
You are too kind, Mr. Zang.

299
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,490
I really didn't expect

300
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,580
that Mr. Eight of the Zhen Tower would be the daughter of Mr. Zhao.

301
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,970
What's wrong?

302
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,930
Can't the daughter of Mr. Zhao

303
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,860
run the Moonview Hall in secret?

304
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,060
That's not what I mean.

305
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,930
It's just that you managed to disguise yourself

306
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,730
as a storyteller

307
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,060
and tell the people what's happening in the world.

308
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,970
I find it truly admirable.

309
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,930
Alright.

310
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,730
Thank you for the novels.

311
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,580
I'll tell this story tonight.

312
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,930
I have to memorize it.

313
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,780
Mr. Zang.

314
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,450
Get down to business.

315
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,650
Miss Xiang.

316
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,010
Welcome, Mr. Zang.

317
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,860
After we parted that night,

318
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,140
I haven't managed...

319
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,650
Come upstairs.

320
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,250
Miss Xiang.

323
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,650
this ordinary tea.

324
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,730
We've met several times in the Moonview Hall.

325
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,860
At first, you couldn't even pay for tea.

326
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,300
But now, you're already quite close to Prince Yongrong.

327
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,100
I bet it won't take long

328
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,140
for you to become the most desired official.

329
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,820
I'm not there yet.

330
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,820
Thank you for your help that night.

331
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,970
I'll say that you've repaid the favor for the coins.

332
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,650
Still, I've been curious.

333
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,820
Why did you

334
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,730
go to Prince Yongrong when he was drunk that night?

335
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,690
It's only natural for me

336
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,300
to get my ancient coin back.

337
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,900
If you just wanted your ancient coin back,

338
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,410
why did you ask Prince Yongrong questions?

339
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,140
What did Yongrong say?

340
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,780
He said a woman asked him some questions

341
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,010
but he didn't remember

342
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,580
what she asked.

343
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,820
If you only wanted your coin back,

344
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,340
you wouldn't have talked to him.

345
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,100
Miss Xiang.

346
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,860
I bet you have many secrets.

347
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,490
You get to have secrets,

348
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,340
but I don't?

349
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,930

there is something remarkable about me.

353
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,930
I don't pry into things that aren't my business.

354
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,580
Whatever.

362
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,450
That's rare.

how well she narrates it tonight.

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,060
Does anyone have anything to report?

377
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,140
I have something to report.

378
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,900
What's new from the Ministry of Rites?

379
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,860
It's less than six months away from the Spring Examination.

380
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,100
We have determined

381
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,820
that we need 100,000 liang of silver from the imperial court.

382
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,580
We handed in our application a month ago,

383
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,010
but it still hasn't been approved.

384
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,250
Mr. Huang, you have no idea.

385
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,780
Your application has been sitting on His Majesty's table.

386
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,820
It's nothing against you.

387
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,060
But this year, the Ministry of Works built bridges and roads.

388
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,780
The Ministry of Revenue distributed disaster relief supplies.

389
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,580
The Treasury is currently in deficit.

390
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,100
All Six Ministries are asking for money.

391
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,110
If it really takes 100,000 liang to hold the exam,

392
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,450
why not make it every five years instead of three

393
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,730
to ease the burden of the imperial court?

394
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,730
If we postpone the imperial examination for two years,

395
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,900
it may affect the selection of officials.

396
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,450
Mr. Shi, you are overly worried.

397
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,690
The Ministry of Personnel can offer recommendations.

398
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,730
For example, Mr. Zang who just took office recently

399
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,970
was recommended by the Marquis.

400
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,100
Thank you for your praise, Mr. Cao.

401
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,860
The Imperial Astronomer must be talented in geomancy,

402
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,380
which is not on the exam.

403
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,140
Talents abound, but true recognition is rare.

404
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,250
It falls upon Mr. Shi

405
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,410
to find talents for the Six Ministries.

406
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,490
If you put it that way,

407
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,100
what do you think, Mr. Shi?

408
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,380
The Ministry of Rites is in charge of the imperial examination.

409
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,060
The Ministry of Personnel will not interfere.

410
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,140
The Cabinet will discuss this later.

411
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,580
Mr. Huang, please draw a new proposal

412
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,780
and see if you can lower the expense.

413
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,490
Anything else?

414
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,250
If there is nothing else,

415
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,170
I shall pass on His Majesty's decree.

416
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,580
General Fu Zhisong passed away guarding the land and the people.

417
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,650
Considering his great contributions,

418
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,450
His Majesty grants him the honor to be buried

419
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,140
in the Late Emperor's Mausoleum.

420
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,380
His Majesty was quite pleased

421
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,580
with Zang Hai's work on the renovation.

422
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,580
In my opinion, General Fu's burial

423
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,930
shall be entrusted to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

424
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,730
Two months should be more than enough.

425
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,210
Yes, sir.

426
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,650
His Majesty

427
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,170
asks the Ministry of Revenue to assign 30,000 liang to the construction.

428
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,620
As His Majesty commands.

429
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,140
Thank you for your hard work.

430
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,410
Court dismissed.

431
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,900
Ordinary generals

432
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,970
are only allowed oil fir as coffins without outer coffins.

433
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,900
But General Fu died for a great cause.

434
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,210
His Majesty grants him a coffin made of Chinese giant redwood.

435
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,820
Yes, sir.

436
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,820
Well noted.

437
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,620
Shi Quan.

438
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,780
Other divisions of the bureau have been busy lately.

439
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,900
Only you are free to help me.

440
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,060
Look over the construction.

441
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,100
Be extra careful.

442
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,490
Rest assured, sir.

443
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,580
Why are these craftsmen so young?

444
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,210
Works on bricks and stele

445
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,970
rely on experience, not strength.

446
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,780
Veteran craftsmen are more skilled.

447
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,140
These people are too young

448
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,160
and the construction

449
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,250
may not be completed on time.

450
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,300
You are right, sir.

451
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,820
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau

452
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,010
used to get the most skilled craftsmen

453
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,970
paid by the Ministry of Works

454
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,380
to build tombs for the burials.

455
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,820
But for some reason, they only sent

456
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,490
inexperienced young craftsmen this time.

457
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,620
What happened?

458
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,860
What...

459
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,490
Sir.

460
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,140
Sir.

461
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,730
How can you be so careless?

462
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,380
It's the last batch of carved tiles in the Ministry of Works.

463
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,410
Please forgive us.

464
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,010
We didn't mean to break them.

465
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,210
- Please spare us. - Please spare us.

466
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,820
These are broken

467
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,930
beyond repair.

468
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,730
Mr. Zang.

469
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,580
- Wait... - Young Master...

470
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,580
- Sir. - Yesterday...

471
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,300
Sir, I couldn't stop him.

472
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,860
Understood.

473
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,100
Young Master, I handed in a note yesterday...

474
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,170
Address me properly here.

475
00:30:59,360 --> 00:30:59,780
Understood.

476
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,410
Mr. Zhuang.

477
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,750
I came to ask

478
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,140
for more craftsmen for the construction of the tomb.

479
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,650
I have arranged for quite some construction work.

480
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,060
No one has ever objected to the assignment of craftsmen.

481
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,900
What is your problem?

482
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,100
Mr. Zhuang.

483
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,170
The schedule is really tight

484
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,250
and we need experienced workers

485
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,820
to carve the general's tombstone.

486
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,860
Otherwise,

487
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,860
we may not finish the work in time.

488
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,820
Fortunately, you work here.

489
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,060
We always take care of our own people.

490
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,690
That's why I came here.

491
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,490
Our own people?

492
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,930
I'm afraid I don't count as your own people.

493
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,490
You are asking me for a favor,

494
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,340
but you hand in an official note first.

495
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,540
I don't think you're showing me respect.

496
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,380
Do you really see me as your own people?

497
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,250
Since you don't,

498
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,170
let's keep this strictly professional.

499
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,930
You want some extra hands?

500
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,540
What a pity.

501
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,650
It's getting cold.

502
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,650
All the workers were sent to repair the palace halls.

503
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,900
I have no money or workers.

504
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,250
What can I do?

505
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,010
Mr. Zhuang.

506
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,010
Here's the thing.

507
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,340
General Fu's burial

508
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,300
is an important task assigned to me by your father.

509
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,930
If I don't do well,

510
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,170
I'm afraid it will hinder his plan.

511
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,540
My father?

512
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,930
What does it have to do with my father?

513
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:42,930
Mr. Zhuang.

514
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,450
Your father told me

515
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,650
not to tell anyone about this.

516
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,690
If you have doubts,

517
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,580
feel free to ask him in person.

518
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,690
But if I fail this job,

519
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,450
neither of us can bear the consequences.

520
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,300
Since it's a family business,

521
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,860
let me see what I can do.

522
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,820
Gentlemen.

523
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,250
Leave us alone.

524
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,170
- Understood. - Understood.

525
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,690
Well, there is room to maneuver.

526
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,340
Tell me how many people you need.

527
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,580
Forty.

528
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,820
Forty?

529
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,620
I doubt it's enough.

530
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,490
His Majesty attaches great importance to it.

531
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,100
We must build the tomb fast and nicely.

532
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,170
How about this?

533
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,250
I'll assign you 80 workers.

534
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,780
Sir.

535
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,490
I don't need so many workers.

536
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,380
Ask for 80 people.

537
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,130
I'll give you 40.

538
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,180
You'll finish the job in time.

539
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,610
I will keep the budget

540
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,130
for the other 40 workers.

541
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,780
We can use the extra money

542
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,490
to make friends and grease the wheels.

543
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,340
What do you think?

544
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,660
Sir.

545
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,530
This is an embezzlement.

546
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,130
It's forbidden.

547
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,900
If Mr. Cao finds out about it,

548
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,410
we will be in trouble.

549
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,300
Mr. Cao won't pursue it.

550
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,780
Who hasn't done

551
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,900
something like this in the imperial court?

552
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,530
This is inappropriate. We can't do it.

553
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,860
You brought up my father

554
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,090
to force my hand.

555
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,970
Then you didn't like the plan

556
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,050
I made for you.

557
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,450
Tell you what.

558
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,840
This is how it is in the Ministry of Works.

559
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,610
It's the only solution I can offer.

560
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,050
Show some appreciation.

561
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,820
Please don't be mad.

562
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,300
Well then.

563
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,340
I will figure something out myself.

564
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,780
So ungrateful.

565
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,490
Shi Quan.

566
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,090
You're here, Mr. Zang.

567
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,380
Look.

568
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,930
The Ministry of Works

569
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,780
didn't send us any experienced craftsmen.

570
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,780
They even got the young ones transferred.

571
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,130
What happened?

572
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,300
They said

573
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,340
that some parts of the palace halls were leaking

574
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,660
and required fixing.

575
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,700
The craftsmen won't come back

576
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,700
until they fix the palace halls.

577
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,930
I am Lu Ran,

578
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,010
a minor official in the Surveillance Office.

579
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,010
You are working hard

580
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,860
on General Fu Zhisong's burial.

581
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,260
Mr. Cao

582
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,530
sent me to check on you, sir.

583
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,410
Here are some snacks.

584
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,340
Please enjoy.

585
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,260
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

586
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,260
Why don't you show me around

587
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,780
if you have time?

588
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,260
This way.

589
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,180
Here

590
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,340
is the chamber where the coffin will rest.

591
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,450
It turns out

592
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,260
that a person ends up buried in such a small place.

593
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,660
It's not so small.

594
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,900
Many people are buried wrapped in straw mats.

595
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,970
Mr. Zang.

596
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,050
You barely started carving

597
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,970
and haven't even made the stone tablet.

598
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,570
This is a big project.

599
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,660
Isn't two people too few for this job?

600
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,820
You're right.

601
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,090
I am having a hard time.

602
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,610
But with winter approaching,

603
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,490
many places in the palace are leaking.

604
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,970
The craftsmen were sent there for renovation.

605
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,610
I have heard of it.

606
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,260
The palace needs repair.

607
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,570
Of course, they must send the workers there.

608
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,130
After all, it concerns His Majesty.

609
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,010
It's not an easy job for you.

610
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,780
Many officials who encounter difficulties think

611
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,900
they are being bullied by their superiors.

612
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,660
Some may even try

613
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,130
to kill themselves in front of His Majesty to show their grievances.

614
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,660
Mr. Cao wants to tell you

615
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,780
that if you are driven into a corner,

616
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,740
don't blame it on the wrong person.

617
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,530
Otherwise, you may die for no reason.

618
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,700
But then again,

619
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,860
where there is a will, there is a way.

620
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,180
Mr. Zang.

621
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,050
If you really can't get over it,

622
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,180
you can try another approach.

623
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,900
Well,

624
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,490
I am a bit confused.

625
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,610
Could you please enlighten me more, Mr. Lu?

626
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,740
Let me just say it.

627
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,260
Mr. Cao sent me here

628
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,780
because he didn't want you to misunderstand him.

629
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,130
He asked for you to take charge of the burial

630
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,050
against the public opinion

631
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,530
because you are highly capable and trustworthy.

632
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,930
That's why

633
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,900
he gave you a chance to impress His Majesty.

634
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,740
Others don't get such a great opportunity.

635
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,450
I am truly grateful to Mr. Cao

636
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,780
for his appreciation.

637
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,380
Mr. Cao is inviting some colleagues

638
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,660
to a family feast the day after next.

639
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,380
If you are not so busy,

640
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,090
please come over for fun.

641
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,860
If you can bond with Mr. Cao,

642
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,610
many things will be easy for you.

643
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,410
Alright.

644
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,380
I have done my job here.

645
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,340
I'm off.

646
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:14,930
By the way,

647
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,860
I almost forgot it.

648
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,380
Here is the invitation.

649
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,900
Or you won't be able to enter.

650
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,540
[To Zang Hai. You are cordially invited to my family feast.]

651
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,940
[Looking forward to your presence.]

652
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,640
Cao Jingxian is a eunuch.

653
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,200
Why would he hold a family feast?

654
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,310
He has no parents.

655
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,900
It's even less likely that he has children.

656
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,490
He invited you there

657
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,490
to put on a show with his filial offspring?

658
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,340
He gave me a hard time

659
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,300
and sent someone to give me advice.

660
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,930
He wants me to betray the Marquis and join hands with him.

661
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,380
Of course,

662
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,570
it's for the Gui Seal.

663
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,740
What do you think of Lu Ran?

664
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,700
He is also Cao Jingxian's foster son.

665
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,450
He speaks with diplomatic precision.

666
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,700
It's not easy to deal with him.

667
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,300
It's easier to dodge King Yan than his petty demons.

668
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,820
If I can't build the tomb as scheduled,

669
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,180
Cao Jingxian will definitely accuse me of deceiving His Majesty.

670
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,090
Then I'll have to meet

671
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,930
the King Yan.

672
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,820
Hai,

673
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,610
why don't you give in and ask Mr. Cao

674
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,410
for protection?

675
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,260
Master,

676
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,380
you want me to join those filth people

677
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,380
of the Surveillance Office?

678
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,490
The Marquis of Pingjin does not tell me

679
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,220
how to do my job, at least.

680
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,300
But if I work for Cao Jingxian,

681
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,610
he won't let me stay upright.

682
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,570
I've warned you

683
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,260
about the danger in the imperial court.

684
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,970
It's easier to carry out investigations as an official,

685
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,130
but there will be greater difficulties.

686
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,860
You've learned so many things.

687
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,010
I bet you can do it.

688
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,570
But I've never wanted to be an official.

689
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,260
I just want revenge.

690
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,340
Then tell me.

691
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,780
What is the most pressing issue?

692
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,570
To find the third culprit.

693
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,220
Wrong.

694
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,860
To survive.

695
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,380
So many things happened

696
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,660
right after you took office.

697
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,300
No mistakes are allowed

698
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,340
in front of the Grand Master for Glorious Happiness

699
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,860
and the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director.

700
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,340
So you have to be a corrupt official when it's needed.

701
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,180
Master.

702
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,010
These high-ranked officials are my enemies.

703
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,010
So is the third culprit.

704
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,900
I must take revenge.

705
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,610
But no matter what,

706
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,090
I can't become like them.

707
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,450
So stubborn.

708
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,820
Stay upright, then.

709
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,820
Good and bad luck are intertwined.

710
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,050
It won't be all bad.

711
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,970
Let's deal with Cao Jingxian first.

712
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,490
I have tons of ideas.

713
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,010
Like what?

714
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,050
One of the ideas

715
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,340
is to...

716
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,770
You tore it apart?

717
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,530
Relax. Go ahead. I'm listening.

718
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,740
One of the ideas is...

719
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,900
I'll come up with something else.

720
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,570
