1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,100



2
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,846
   

4
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,440
Go on.

5
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,530
How do you want to die?

6
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,230
My Lord...

7
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,690
I'd rather not die yet.

8
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,230
You pulled this off right in front of all the officials.

9
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,960
Don't you realize you're a dead man walking?

10
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,590
I was born poor, with no one to rely on.

11
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,230
If I muddle through life in ignorance,

12
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,000
what is the point of not dying?

13
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,920
But I'm not without value, so I chose to take a chance.

14
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,040
What I'm betting on is this very moment.

15
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,650
But this moment won't last long.

16
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,750
Once the carriage stops, I'll kill you.

17
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,400
So, if you have any last words, say it now while you still can.

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,240
I know well you're a man of the battlefield, bathed in blood.

19
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,390
A warrior used to life and death

20
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,820
won't believe that today's events have anything to do with fate.

21
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,590
But I... I just wasn't meant to die today.

22
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,020
You're a master of geomancy.

23
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,310
Digging yourself a way out should be easy.

24
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,000
But instead, you boldly walked out of the imperial tomb.

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,220
You want to force me to release you right under everyone's nose?

26
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,790
You want the world to see that your life was spared by fate?

27
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,850
Escaping was never hard for me. I admit that.

28
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,310
But it would've meant never showing my face as myself again.

29
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,910
It was thanks to your favor

30
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,460
that I finally left behind the days of having nothing.

31
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,030
If I still wish to serve you,

32
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,260
then I need a clean and honest identity.

33
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,590
Besides... I'm still human.

34
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:27,290
If someone's plotting to kill me, I can't just sit back and wait to die.

35
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,710
Even if it costs me my life, I must ask you for justice.

36
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,590
Justice?

37
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,340
Zang Hai, I've seen your geomancy skills with my own eyes.

38
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,150
But now, it seems your silver tongue is even more impressive.

39
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,750
You keep claiming you owe everything to me,

40
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,270
yet you've cornered me into sacrificing a valuable man

41
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,460
to resolve today's mess, at the cost of my reputation!

42
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,110
Don't you deserve to die?

43
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,870
I believe I did nothing wrong today,

44
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,000
because I know you've had enough of useless men!

45
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,190
So, you're saying my top aide is worthless?

46
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,490
You're a hero among men.

47
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,270
It's only natural that those beside you aren't fools.

48
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,710
But virtue guides talent.

49
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,240
If they can't stay loyal to you and know their place,

50
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,150
aren't they just as useless?

51
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,880
Go on.

52
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,920
Official Yang is narrow-minded and petty.

53
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,680
Not only does he fail to recruit talent for you,

54
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,750
he actively drives capable people away.

55
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,950
I'm sure many talented men have entered your household before,

56
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,380
but in the end, none of them ever made it close to you.

57
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,470
The ones who stayed were nothing but useless.

58
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,800
If it were just exclusion, that'd be one thing.

59
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,480
But these people... they abuse your name,

60
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,560
flatter the powerful and bully the weak.

61
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,130
They'll bring disaster to your manor.

62
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,280
What disaster?

63
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,390
You've achieved great merit, yet kept a low profile all these years.

64
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,920
Still, some people use your name to throw their weight around.

65
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,900
Who knows how many hidden enemies they've made?

66
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,180
The only reason your manor has remained safe is because you're here.

67
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,620
Throwing my weight around has always been my style.

68
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,720
They've only picked up a few tricks.

69
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,560
But as long as they're loyal to me,

70
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,600
so what if they get a little out of hand?

71
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,600
The real danger is those who are obedient in front of you,

72
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,920
but forget their place behind your back.

73
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
They get so used to it.

74
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,800
They start mistaking their own will for yours.

75
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,310
Just like today, before you even gave the order,

76
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,050
Official Qu acted on his own and shot Yang Zhen.

77
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,170
Even if it was with your best interest in mind, he still crossed the line.

78
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,910
If you don't believe me, just wait and see:

79
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:57,510
whether Official Qu once again decides my life or death on your behalf.

80
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,850
Get out.

81
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,430
   

82
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:04,480
   

83
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,980
Why are we stopping at the back gate?

84
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,970
It's quieter here, easier to get things done.

85
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,360
Zang Hai, any last words?

86
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,030
My life is in your hands.

87
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,120
My Lord!

88
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,860
Get a physician to treat his wounds.

89
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,620
Tell Chu Huaiming to revise the roster.

90
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,580
Remove Zang Hai's official title.

91
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,630
Report Yang Zhen's birth date and time,

92
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,270
say that Senior Secretary Yang Zhen volunteered as a tomb sacrifice.

93
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,020
My Lord, Zang Hai's ambition is dangerous.

94
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,600
He's uncontrollable. We should kill him!

95
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,240
Are you saying I can't control him?

96
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,910
Or that you can't?

97
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,266
   

98
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,550
Thank you, Physician.

99
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,250
No trouble at all.

100
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,100
Just pay me extra.

101
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,240
Careful. Here.

102
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,360
Master, what are you doing here?

103
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,240
I was worried about you!

104
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,670
Don't worry. I've settled everything with the clinic.

105
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,200
Today, I came as a properly invited physician!

106
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,870
Forgive me if my skills are limited.

107
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,680
Let me take a look now.

108
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,750
Master, if you'd been half a minute later,

109
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,420
I wouldn't have made it out of the imperial tomb today.

110
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,010
Well, I'm getting old.

111
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,910
You offended Yang Zhen. Now they are coming for you.

112
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,080
You have to accept the challenge.

113
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,620
 But they are craving for your blood! 

114
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,980
 I want them to strike first. 

115
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,810
 The moment they do, they'll expose themselves. 

116
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,320
 Only then will I have a chance to turn the tide. 

117
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,200
 Master, please help me with two things. 

118
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,630
   

119
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,320
 Follow the Xiaocang River upstream. 

120
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,360
 You'll find an old flood-control dam from the former dynasty. 

121
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,670
 No one guards it. 

122
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,150
 Back when the You River changed course, 

123
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,270
 its branch, the Xiaocang River, formed a hidden underground channel. 

124
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,490
 It runs right beneath the tomb. 

125
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,550
   

126
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,720
 The Dragon-Cracking Stone is powered by water pressure. 

127
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,690
 I'll use that channel to divert Xiaocang River's water 

128
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,600
 into the tomb's reservoir. 

129
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,360
 On the day of the Empress Dowager's burial, 

130
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,510
 you'll wait at the dam. 

131
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,560
 Bow! 

132
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,080
 The bell tolls after each stage of the funeral. 

133
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,380
 At the sixth toll, be ready. 

134
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,040
 Release the Dragon-Cracking Stone! 

135
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,510
 After the ninth toll following the release, 

136
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,750
 shut the floodgate at once. 

137
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,290
 The water in the channel will drop, 

138
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,100
 and the stone will stop. 

139
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,550
 Then, light incense to count the time. 

140
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,920
 As for me, I'll find a way to walk out from the tomb. 

141
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,620
 Zang Hai? How did you get out? 

142
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,870
 The Dragon-Cracking Stone stopped falling. 

143
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,960
 What trick did you pull? 

144
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,660
 I didn't pull any trick. 

145
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,980
 I just wasn't fated to die today! 

146
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,110
 As long as I walk out alive, it'll fall on its own! 

147
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,480
 I want every official present to believe 

148
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,630
 that the moment Yang Zhen steps into the tomb, 

149
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,630
 the stone will fall. 

150
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,480
 At the same time, I'll stall for as long as I can, 

151
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,790
 until the incense burns out. 

152
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,270
 Official Chu once told me, 

153
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,360
 to appease the spirit of the late emperor, 

154
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,120
 someone whose birth characters match His Majesty's 

155
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,750
 must stay in the tomb forever. 

156
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,460
 Who would that be? 

157
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,720
 Yang Zhen! 

158
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,960
 Nonsense! 

159
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,700
 Once the incense burns out, open the floodgate immediately. 

160
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,090
 Xiao Hai... May the heavens help you. 

161
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,490
 My Lord! 

162
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,650
 When the time is over, my death will be nothing, 

163
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:40,220
 but if this affects you officials, even death will not be enough for me. 

164
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,840
 And right now, this is the most critical moment. 

165
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,550
 I bet the Marquis of Pingjin won't be able to withstand the pressure 

166
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,990
 and will let Yang Zhen enter the tomb. 

167
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,260
 My Lord, he wants me to die with him. 

168
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,860
 Bless my disciple. 

169
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,140
 May he come through safe and sound. 

170
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,770
 It hasn't moved! 

171
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,540
 My Lord, he's lying. 

172
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,680
 How could it be? 

173
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,720
After all this, you've gotten rid of Yang Zhen

174
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,180
and gained the Marquis's favor.

175
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,320
Xiao Hai, all your suffering wasn't in vain.

176
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,510
But this isn't over yet.

177
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,850
We still have another hurdle to cross.

178
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,650
I knew it.

179
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,110
The tomb incident wouldn't blow over that easily.

180
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,970
It's only been a few hours,

181
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,640
and the Imperial Inspector already submitted their memorials.

182
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,830
If word hadn't gotten out from the palace,

183
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,720
I might've been blindsided in court tomorrow.

184
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,920
They actually dared accuse you of letting Qu Jiao kill someone in the imperial tomb!

185
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,440
These old fools are just unbearable.

186
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,630
We must figure out a way to shut their mouths.

187
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,180
How? Qu Jiao acted right in front of everyone.

188
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,400
It's easy to silence one voice, but how do you silence a hundred?

189
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,210
The more you try to stop them, the louder they get!

190
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,010
Those fools know nothing!

191
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,720
All they want is an explanation.

192
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,490
If we can't silence them,

193
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,310
then maybe we should just hand someone over.

194
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,480
You want me to turn Qu Jiao in?

195
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,300
He's been by your side for years, loyal to the bone.

196
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,780
How could I send him to his death?

197
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,210
This all started because of Zang Hai.

198
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,650
If it weren't for him, Yang Zhen would still be alive.

199
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,790
The tomb matter is settled.

200
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,520
Let's not bring it up again.

201
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,400
Or how about this?

202
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,900
Kill Zang Hai, scar his face,

203
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,450
and hand him over as Qu Jiao.

204
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,240
That man is too cunning by nature.

205
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,050
Keeping him near you only spells future trouble.

206
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,720
Father, time's running out.

207
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,570
You'd better head out first.

208
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,760
All right.

209
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,010
In your opinion, what will the Marquis do?

210
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,070
I think he actually listened to me today.

211
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,480
Master, don't worry too much.

212
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,400
Why are you so sure?

213
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,680
The Marquis is a man of war.

214
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,170
Everything he has now was earned through strength.

215
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,120
He knows better than anyone how dangerous soldiers can be.

216
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,350
We've done what we can.

217
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,070
The rest is up to fate.

218
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,300
Master, you're actually saying that?

219
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,880
That doesn't sound like you.

220
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,790
Didn't you just tell me not to worry too much?

221
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,480
I trust you.

222
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,180
I'll take my leave.

223
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,300
   

224
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,446
   

225
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,480
- Greetings, sir. 
 - What's going on?

226
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,640
The Marquis ordered that no one in the household was to leave for three days.

227
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,820
Did something happen?

228
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,150
Official Qu... he died suddenly last night.

229
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,490
Starting today, 
    

230
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,960
you are officially the senior secretary.

231
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,500
Your monthly salary is 20 taels.

232
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,880
Also, you won't stay in the Scholar Hall anymore.

233
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,400
You'll live in the inner courtyards.

234
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,310
The Marquis personally chose this place for you.

235
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:44,070
It's right next to his own quarters, for your convenience.

236
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,460
Sir, please come with me.

237
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,000
   

238
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,480
This way.

239
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,610
These servants were all assigned by the Marquis to attend to you.

240
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,070
And here are some clothes, writing supplies,

241
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,720
and a bit of silver, all for your personal use.

242
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,310
Do they meet your satisfaction?

243
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,290
Please thank the Marquis on my behalf.

244
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,590
You may all go.

245
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,200
Official Yang Zhen, even at his peak,

246
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,620
was never allowed to live in the inner courtyards.

247
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,240
The Marquis also wants you to join him for dinner tonight.

248
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,830
Understood.

249
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll take my leave.

250
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,920
Sir, please.

251
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,790
My Lord. My Lady.

252
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,870
No need to be so formal. Have a seat.

253
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,340
Zang Hai, you've worked hard these past few months.

254
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,880
Thank you for your efforts.

255
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,440
Here, this drink is for you.

256
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,070
You flatter me, Eldest Young Master.

257
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,210
I just lent a bit of muscle,

258
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,840
and carried out the orders of you and My Lord.

259
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,820
As the Marquis's aide,

260
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,160
if Zhifu ever needs guidance,

261
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,800
I hope you'll offer it generously.

262
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,920
I wouldn't dare call it guidance.

263
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,670
But if Eldest Young Master ever needs my help, I'll give it my all.

264
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,350
Zang Hai, I've given it serious thought.

265
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:46,400
Those aides Yang Zhen left behind are all useless.

266
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,550
So, I've decided to send them away.

267
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,620
What do you think?

268
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,920
You honor me, My Lord.

269
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,890
I serve at your pleasure. My life or death is in your hands.

270
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,750
Your word is final.

271
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,090
- Zhuang Shan. 
 - Yes, My Lord?

272
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,500
Keep a few of the old, trusted ones. Let the rest go.

273
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,650
Yes, My Lord.

274
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,770
Sit.

275
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,480
In a few days, it's my late father's death anniversary.

276
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,810
We'll hold a family ceremony here first, then visit his tomb.

277
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,830
Be sure to prepare accordingly.

278
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,030
My Lord, this is an important family rite.

279
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,720
I'm still new here, I dare not make decisions on my own.

280
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,030
If you're seated at this table,

281
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,510
you're someone I trust the most.

282
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,320
Letting you handle family matters is already beneath your talents.

283
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,510
Whatever concerns Your Lordship is my top priority.

284
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,140
I will serve you with all I've got.

285
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,420
Enough talking. Drink!

286
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,820
This incident turned out to be a close call.

287
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,900
Father, Zang Hai really figured out what the Emperor wanted.

288
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,880
The inspectors stopped submitting complaints.

289
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,140
And His Majesty even commended you for handling the funeral properly.

290
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,510
But Zang Hai is too calculating and difficult to understand.

291
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,550
Keeping him near you makes me uneasy.

292
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:53,120
The capital's a huge place. It's not like we can't find another strategist.

293
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,960
Better to raise one wolf

294
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,520
than feed a pen full of pigs.

295
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,480
You're right.

296
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,110
As long as you're the backbone here,

297
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:15,590
we can handle any kind of servant.

298
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,880
I may hold a respected post at court,

299
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,470
advising the Emperor,

300
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,960
but I'm not the same man who once commanded troops on the frontier.

301
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,110
Your maternal grandfather has retired.

302
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,480
He's no longer involved in politics.

303
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,450
Zhifu,

304
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,720
you must carry the future...

305
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,970
of the Zhuang family on your shoulders.

306
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,640
With your trust behind me, I, Zhifu, won't let you down.

307
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:57,650
I'll help you climb higher in the court.

308
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,930
Ideally, get a good post in the Ministry of Personnel.

309
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,920
Then work your way into the Cabinet.

310
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,270
But before that, you'll need someone by your side,

311
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,680
someone who can advise you.

312
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,120
And Zang Hai is the one I've chosen for you.

313
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,200
But is Zang Hai truly willing to serve me loyally?

314
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,590
That's still unclear.

315
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:25,870
Those born to aid kings are often strong-willed.

316
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:32,030
What matters is how you tame them.

317
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:36,540
If he gets disobedient, just crush his kneecaps.

318
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:42,250
A cripple won't dream of climbing higher.

319
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,100
Right now, he's just settled in.

320
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,360
You have to make him feel like he has a bright future.

321
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,980
Only then will he give his all.

322
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,350
I'll smooth out his rough edges...

323
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,590
before handing him over to you.

324
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,460
Just remember:

325
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,720
the honor of the Zhuang family must not be tarnished.

326
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,870
Understood, Father.

327
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,300
Chu Huaiming's work is getting sloppier by the day.

328
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,730
All these years, he's accomplished little,

329
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,160
except for being an expert at slacking off.

330
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,930
Zhuang Shan!

331
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,310
My Lord.

332
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,270
Give all these to Zang Hai.

333
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,680
Chu Huaiming's not the only one who understands this stuff anymore.

334
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,000
Yes, My Lord.

335
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,500
   

336
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,500
   

337
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,920
 - Need anything else? 
 - Please browse a little more. 

338
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,550
 If you like the food, come again! 

339
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,590
Sir, I'm looking for some geomantic manuals:

340
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,540
the "Secret Verses of the Green Satchel," the "Classic of Dragon Veins,"

341
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,310
and also the "Cloud Peak Notes."

342
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,720
Xiao Li, come here!

343
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,790
Sir.

344
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,590
Take this gentleman to the storeroom.

345
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,520
Of course. Right this way.

346
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,110
Browse freely, sir. I'll go and greet another guest.

347
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,930
Thank you.

348
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:57,270
Sir, the books you're asking for are rare editions.

349
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,690
They're quite pricey.

350
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,880
You might end up spending a lot.

351
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,750
I'm the Marquis's top aide now.

352
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,790
Who'd dare say I can't afford it?

353
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,340
Good boy. I didn't raise you for nothing.

354
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,730
Master, this is everything I've got.

355
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,750
So, you brought it all here just to show off?

356
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,560
Nothing for me, huh?

357
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,200
Master, please go easy on me.

358
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,910
I haven't even received this month's pay.

359
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,480
Look at you, so stingy.

360
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,370
How about this? The Marquis has a ton of treasures.

361
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,130
Just sneak out a piece or two every now and then. He'll never know.

362
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,350
Let's clean him out, bleed him dry, and call it payback.

363
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,270
You may go alone. Don't drag me into it.

364
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,840
You... Sit.

365
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,590
I heard the Marquis just dismissed most of his aides.

366
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:55,440
He's acting so extreme, but it's not without reason.

367
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,160
Back then, he killed all fourteen members of my family without even blinking.

368
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,200
Now he's started giving me some geomancy tasks.

369
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,720
Those must've belonged to Chu Huaiming before.

370
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,590
That must be driving Chu Huaiming mad.

371
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,550
What kind of tasks?

372
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,310
Surveying mountain terrain near the capital

373
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,590
and analyzing blueprints of ancient city buildings.

374
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,480
It's probably all to support Zhuang Zhifu.

375
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,810
That's good. It shows he trusts you.

376
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,820
Getting close to him is easier now.

377
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,310
But, Xiao Hai, you need to know something.

378
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,310
If the Marquis dies in his own estate,

379
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:35,340
and the Court of Judicial Review steps in, you'll be in deep trouble.

380
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,160
We need a foolproof plan.

381
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,000
Whether he dies of illness or by accident, you must walk away clean.

382
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,470
Going down with the ship isn't how people like us survive.

383
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,960
One step at a time.

384
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,900
If it were really that easy to kill him, you wouldn't have raised me for ten years.

385
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,870
I need to go.

386
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,260
I just became an aide. I can't be away too long.

387
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,230
If I need anything, I'll come back here.

388
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,010
All right.

389
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,830
Xiao Hai...

390
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Your status has changed.

391
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,960
Good and bad things will both come knocking. Be careful.

392
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,490
Don't worry, Master.

393
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,640
Oh, and Xiao Hai...

394
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,220
Here are the books you asked for. Don't forget to pay.

395
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,350
- Master, you... 
 - Finish the act. Go ahead.

396
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,120
Go on.

397
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,030
Sir, I want one bowl of wontons, and a plate of tofu skin.

398
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,180
Sure! Just a moment.

399
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,630
Sir, I'm really sorry. We're out of wontons.

400
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,140
Maybe try somewhere else?

401
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,780
Aren't there still some over there?

402
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,630
Yes, but this young sir ordered them all.

403
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,150
All right, I'll eat somewhere else.

404
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,230
Apologies again!

405
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,880
Nowhere else has them either, Official Zang.

406
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,400
Wherever you go, I've bought them all out.

407
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,660
Do I know you?

408
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,300
Please don't misunderstand, sir.

409
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,510
I don't mean to make things difficult.

410
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,340
But my master has prepared a banquet and wants to meet with you.

411
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,400
Who is your master?

412
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,540
The owner of Zhen Tower.

413
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,790
My master also said you're unmatched in wit and foresight.

414
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,960
So, you're sure to come.

415
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,340
Lead the way.

416
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,050
This way, sir.

417
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,239
   

418
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,590
This way, sir.

419
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,690
I'll wait for you downstairs.

420
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,420
   

421
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,670
Official Zang's name echoes through the capital.

422
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,590
Seeing you today, you truly live up to the praise!

423
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,360
I am Xu Ben, the owner of Zhen Tower.

424
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,780
Please forgive me for inviting you so suddenly.

425
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,320
No need for formalities, Owner Xu.

426
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,150
You're the impressive one here.

427
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,280
You may not know this, but I have quite the connection with Zhen Tower.

428
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,960
On my very first day in the capital,

429
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,370
I came here and watched a wonderful show.

430
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,960
Just a small act from my men.

431
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,680
Glad you enjoyed it.

432
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,590
- Please, sir. 
 - Please.

433
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,440
- Please. 
 - Please.

434
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:15,260
Sir, you must try our aged Autumn Dew wine from Shandong.

435
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,970
Please, enjoy.

436
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,280
A toast to you.

437
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,640
Cheers.

438
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,860
That's fine wine!

439
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,070
And try this, our signature dishes.

440
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,780
You won't find them outside the capital.

441
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,890
And definitely not where you were before.

442
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,660
So, Owner Xu, why have you invited me today?

443
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,400
I simply hope to make friends with you.

444
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,440
You flatter me.

445
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,840
With an imperial plaque on your wall and gold flowing in,

446
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,990
surely you're not lacking a friend like me.

447
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,970
You've only been in the capital for three months,

448
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,280
and already you're the talk of the town.

449
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,970
Wealth always follows fame.

450
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,870
Now that you're well-known, riches will come knocking.

451
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,760
These are nothing special.

452
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Just a little gift to mark our meeting.

453
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,620
If you accept it, consider me your friend from now on.

454
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:36,790
Owner Xu, I've never seen so many jewels in my life!

455
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,760
You're working at the Marquis's mansion now.

456
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,800
You'll need money handling all kinds of affairs.

457
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,450
If there's anything you need, just say the word.

458
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,630
I'm the kind of person who loves helping friends.

459
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,830
Just one word from you, and your problem will become mine.

460
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,530
- Please, sir. 
 - Owner Xu, you're too kind.

461
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,800
I do have a few small favors to ask.

462
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,010
And I hope you'll consider them.

463
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,900
Of course. Go ahead.

464
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,380
As I said earlier, on my first day in the capital,

465
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,710
I watched a play at Zhen Tower.

466
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,760
By chance, I landed the Vermilion Bird Head seat.

467
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,220
But I was broke at the time.

468
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,410
Luckily, Miss Xiang over there helped me out.

469
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:24,500
Looking back now, that seat really is the best one in the house.

470
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,190
So, I was wondering, could I have that seat again

471
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,330
on the first and fifteenth of every month

472
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,370
to enjoy the shows with special treatment?

473
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:38,780
If that's what you want, the seat is yours.

474
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,840
As for special treatment...

475
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,700
Well...

476
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,780
I suppose it can be arranged.

477
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,380
You're new in the capital and trying to expand your circle.

478
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,670
That seat is perfect for making connections.

479
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,760
Owner Xu, you're too generous!

480
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,030
Come on, please.

481
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,760
What we just discussed was personal.

482
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,160
Now I have an official matter to bring up.

483
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,680
Go ahead, sir.

484
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,280
It's a bit embarrassing...

485
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,870
Second Young Master Zhuang pawned off quite a few treasures here at Zhen Tower.

486
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,440
Some of them were spoils from the Marquis's campaigns.

487
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,410
Now that I manage the estate treasury,

488
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,440
I'm afraid if the Marquis suddenly asks,

489
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,080
I... I'll have no answer for him.

490
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,760
So, I'd like to quietly redeem those items.

491
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,410
But I'm short on funds at the moment.

492
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,200
Owner Xu, could you figure out a middle-ground solution?

493
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,140
Every treasure Second Young Master pawned...

494
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,960
is still sealed in our storeroom.

495
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,000
So, I'll send someone to gather them

496
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,950
and return them to you, no charge.

497
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,490
Owner  Xu, you truly are generous.

498
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,490
I'll drink to that!

499
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,080
Cheers.

500
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,230
Owner Xu, apologies...

501
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,820
Sorry.

502
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,220
Looks like you can't hold your liquor.

503
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,410
You'd better come by more often to build that tolerance.

504
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,000
Yes, you're absolutely right.

505
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,110
Actually, Owner Xu, there's something else...

506
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,670
Enough!

507
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,750
Stop acting. He's already figured it out.

508
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,930
How'd you know that he was not the real owner of Zhen Tower?

509
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,710
What kind of boss takes cues from his servant?

510
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,660
 The seat is yours. 

511
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,590
 As for the special treatment... 

512
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,490
 I suppose it can be arranged. 

513
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,000
This cup is worth a fortune, right?

514
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,360
Just now, when I made those unreasonable requests,

515
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,590
Owner Xu got all hesitant.

516
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,070
And he was nervous about this cup.

517
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:25,180
Plus, look at the abacus calluses on his fingertips.

518
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:30,940
If I'm not wrong, he's actually your bookkeeper.

519
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,530
Now I can't tell if he's dumb or you're just too clever.

520
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,440
I figured it out just because you wanted me to.

521
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,050
And now that you've shown your hand,

522
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,440
I assume you're not worried about money,

523
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,130
but have something real to say to me.

524
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,610
Let's go somewhere else to talk.

525
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:16,890



526
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:22,260

♫  I grant and I deprive  ♫

547

♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

548
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,380
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫
