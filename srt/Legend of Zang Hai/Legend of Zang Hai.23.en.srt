[Episode 23]

3
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,690
Mr. Zhifu,

4
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,180
sorry I didn't greet you sooner.

5
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,460
What were you doing?

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,460
Why didn't you announce his arrival?

7
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,820
My apologies, sir.

8
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,890
You seemed busy,

9
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,380
so I told him not to stay quiet.

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,780
What are you...?

11
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,680
[The bronze fish is about 2 cun long and half a cun wide]

12
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,450
It's nothing important.

13
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,340
Just a sketch to keep my hand steady.

14
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:18,940
Here.

15
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,820
Take these to the study.

16
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,260
Mr. Zhifu?

17
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,130
I came by today

18
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,410
to see if you'd join me

19
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,850
for some drinks and music.

20
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,290
You've been working nonstop.

21
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,890
You need a break.

22
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,340
You may not know this,

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,380
but I can't hold my liquor.

24
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,450
Even a sip gets me drunk,

25
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,610
and once I'm drunk, I ramble

26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,130
and say all the wrong things.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,220
Let's just enjoy the music.

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,450
Skip the drinks.

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,170
Fair enough.

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,340
Just the music.

31
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,610
No drinks. I promise.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,380
Come on.

33
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,260
Let's go.

[Zang Residence]

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,220
Where was I?

36
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,450
You've already said too much.

37
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,380
No, don't interrupt.

38
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,570
I remember now.

39
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,540
Yes...

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,820
Chu Huaiming!

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,360
That fool...

42
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,880
He made my life miserable...

43
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,940
Zang Hai, my friend,

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,660
you really can't hold your liquor.

45
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,480
Mr. Zang...

46
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,550
Mr. Zang...

47
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,690
Why did you drink so much?

48
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,690
Come on. Help him inside to rest.

49
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,660
Mr. Zhuang,

50
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,170
it's late. Shall I send someone to escort you home?

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,940
No need.

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,340
I'm exhausted too.

53
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,100
I'll just stay here tonight.

54
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,380
Find me

55
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,730
a room.

56
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,220
Yes, sir.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,060
Mr. Zang, come on.

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,540
Where are we going?

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,980
Back to your room. Easy now.

60
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,500
- Where are we going? - To your room, sir.

61
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,010
Take it slow.

62
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,140
[The bronze fish is about 2 cun long and half a cun wide]

63
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,050
Thank you, Mr. Zhuang.

64
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,250
Take Mr. Zhuang to rest.

65
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,140
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,250
Father,

67
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,290
this looks like the structure of some kind of box,

68
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,250
along with instructions for disabling its mechanism.

69
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,460
And there is a bronze fish over here.

70
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,410
Indeed.

71
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,250
Zhuang Luyin actually told Zang Hai

72
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,410
about the bronze fish.

73
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,170
It really is connected to the Gui Seal.

74
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,780
Could it be

75
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,170
that Zhuang Luyin

76
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,730
already has the seal?

77
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,140
What will you do, Father?

78
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,460
This time,

79
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,220
I'm going to confirm it myself.

80
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:56,930
Hai,

81
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,730
Zhuang Zhifu sent word.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,730
He's inviting you to lunch

83
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,100
tomorrow at Zuichun Pavilion.

84
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,020
Zang Hai,

85
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,810
this here

86
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,410
is Zuichun Pavilion's newest lamb wine.

87
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,930
It's smooth and rich.

88
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,540
You've got to give it a proper try.

89
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,410
Today, we'll drink to our hearts' content.

90
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,980
No going home sober, all right?

91
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,660
Here.

92
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,610
Thank you, Mr. Zhifu.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,290
Let's drink, then.

94
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,410
Cheers.

95
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,610
What do you think?

96
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,810
It's excellent.

97
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,460
Since you like it,

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,930
have a few more.

99
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,250
Come on.

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,730
Please.

101
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,020
Great!

102
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,370
One more.

103
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,170
Mr. Zhifu,

104
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,290
maybe we should have some food first.

105
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,220
Zang Hai,

106
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,250
if you want to stay in everyone's good graces at court,

107
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,850
you'll need to learn to hold your liquor.

108
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,980
So today,

109
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,410
let me help you train.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,700
Zang Hai,

111
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,780
you're drunk.

112
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,850
No, you're drunk.

113
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,980
Did you find

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,220
that thing

115
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,980
my father asked you to find?

116
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,820
What thing?

117
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,340
I thought that after the past few days,

118
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,700
we were already friends.

119
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,650
Friends?

120
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,100
Wasn't it your mother who went to the Marquis to speak ill of me?

121
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,650
Didn't you two try to get me kicked out?

122
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,340
Don't think I didn't know.

123
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,820
You really dare say that to my face?

124
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,820
Why wouldn't I?

125
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,100
Why wouldn't I?

126
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,610
Do you have any idea how much the Marquis values me now?

127
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,940
I'm more capable than any of you ever imagined.

128
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,820
Come on.

129
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,010
Zang Hai,

130
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,770
I admit it.

131
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,890
Being close with Yang Zhen

132
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,730
and the others

133
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,300
made me biased against you.

134
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,890
But we have to look ahead, right?

135
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,180
Honestly,

136
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,940
I admire you as much as my father does.

137
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,300
From now on, we'll only grow closer.

138
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,420
I really hope you'll treat me

139
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,220
as a friend you can speak freely to.

140
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,770
A friend I can say anything to...

141
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,940
I'm so glad you see me

142
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,820
as a friend.

143
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,010
So, Zang Hai,

144
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,530
tell me,

145
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,850
did you find that thing

146
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,130
my father asked you to find?

147
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,250
The Gui Seal?

148
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,610
You mean the Gui Seal?

149
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,250
Yeah,

150
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,490
the Marquis mentioned it.

151
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,770
He said he went through so much

152
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,890
just to track it down.

153
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,890
He said that with the Gui Seal,

154
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,580
anything's possible.

155
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,200
Anything's possible...

156
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,890
Hey, stay with me.

157
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,700
So did you find it or not?

158
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,890
Where is it?

159
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,580
Did I

160
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,650
find it?

161
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,010
No...

162
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,180
Zang Hai.

163
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,220
Don't go, Zang Hai.

164
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,610
Come back here.

165
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,730
Watch your step.

166
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,420
Why are you leaving?

167
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,820
I can't.

168
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,850
I can't say...

169
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,100
The Marquis told me

170
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,370
never to tell outsiders.

171
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,820
Outsiders?

172
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,250
Am I an outsider?

173
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,100
I swear

174
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,820
I won't tell a soul.

175
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,530
All right?

176
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,530
Hey.

177
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,010
I doubt that Father

178
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,980
ever told you anything.

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,420
He doesn't value you at all.

180
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,940
Nonsense!

181
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,250
Come here.

182
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,370
Come closer!

183
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,060
The thing

184
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,700
is in the underground vault of the Marquis's treasury.

185
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,250
Zang Hai?

186
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,180
Zang Hai?

187
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,460
Zang Hai?

188
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,250
Mr. Cao.

189
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,580
Mr. Cao!

190
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,220
Did you hear all that, sir?

191
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,610
I got him to talk.

192
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,420
He said

193
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,610
the Marquis found the Gui Seal

194
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,850
and hid it in the treasury.

195
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,730
You didn't know?

196
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,220
So the Marquis never told you?

197
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,460
My father

198
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,250
never mentioned a word.

199
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,130
Zhifu,

200
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,100
you see,

201
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,770
what he just said

202
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,300
is your father's biggest secret.

203
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,730
Your father

204
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,420
trusted him with it.

205
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,250
That makes

206
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,340
him

207
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,250
your father's

208
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,770
true confidant.

209
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,700
But now, he's chosen to side with your younger brother.

210
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,770
What does that tell you?

211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,940
As long as he's around,

212
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,060
Zhuang Zhixing

213
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,300
will be the heir.

214
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,300
Impossible!

215
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,180
I'm the rightful heir. I'm the son of my father's principal wife!

216
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,610
Your mother, Jiang Xiang, may remain in favor,

217
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,180
but it's not what it once was.

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,060
How much sway does she have now?

219
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,730
Jiang Xiang...

220
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,650
Jiang Xiang killed Shen.

221
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,580
What are you talking about?

222
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,060
I'm not making it up.

223
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,340
Everyone knows.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,460
Even Zhuang Zhixing knows.

225
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,460
No...

226
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,300
No.

227
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,060
Zhifu,

228
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,220
how about this?

229
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,460
Zang Hai may have sided with your brother,

230
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,060
but I can side with you.

231
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,770
Kill him,

232
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,220
and I'll guarantee your wealth and power.

233
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,420
What do you say?

234
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,130
Once he's gone,

235
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,820
Zhuang Zhixing will go back to his old self.

236
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,940
On his own, he's no threat.

237
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,060
And the next head of the family will surely be you.

238
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,100
What are you waiting for?

239
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,980
I...

240
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,420
I'm sorry!

241
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,610
Mr. Zhifu...

242
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,060
Mr. Zhifu...

243
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,300
Why...?

244
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,730
Why...?

245
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,530
Good boy.

246
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,010
From now on, I'll do everything in my power to help you.

247
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,530
Hang in there.

248
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,010
Father!

249
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,980
Father,

250
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,900
someone rescued Zang Hai.

251
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,660
Did you see who?

252
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,330
His guard.

253
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,330
So Zang Hai survived.

254
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,980
That

255
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,050
complicates things.

256
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,810
Mr. Cao, what do you mean?

257
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,050
Mr. Zhuang, you're not only corrupt,

258
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,660
but you also tried to kill a court official.

259
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,980
No, I didn't.

260
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,620
Guards.

261
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,140
What are you doing?

262
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,700
If you don't admit it,

263
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,250
the Surveillance Office

264
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,860
will get to the bottom of things.

265
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,420
You're coming with us.

266
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:50,980
Mr. Cao...

267
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,700
I already did everything you told me to!

268
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:53,980
Shut up!

269
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,810
Shilei,

270
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,570
get us home, now!

271
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,250
Got it.

272
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,380
Master is tailing Cao Jingxian as planned.

273
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,810
We should head back and stop the bleeding.

274
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,730
We can't go back.

275
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,330
I can still hold on.

276
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,660
You won't last much longer.

277
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,460
You'll bleed to death!

278
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,290
We stick to the plan. Take me to the Marquis's Mansion.

279
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,490
Hai, are you insane? You'll die!

280
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,570
Trust me.

281
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,330
I know what I'm doing.

282
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,940
Take me to the Marquis!

283
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,050
Shilei,

284
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,220
to the Marquis's Mansion.

285
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,810
Got it.

286
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,220
My Lord!

287
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,330
My Lord!

288
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,730
My Lord!

289
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,330
What's wrong? Why the panic?

290
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,010
It's bad!

291
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,570
Why are you bleeding?

292
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,770
This isn't my blood.

293
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,460
It's Mr. Zang's. He's badly hurt.

294
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,490
Zang Hai!

295
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,290
Stop standing around. Get a physician!

296
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,900
Yes, My Lord.

297
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,770
What happened?

298
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,940
My Lord...

299
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,180
I can't hold on much longer,

300
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,010
but there's something

301
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,250
I must tell you.

302
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,250
The one who tried to kill me today...

303
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,980
was...

304
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,770
Who was it?

305
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:27,860
It was...

306
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,330
Mr. Zhifu.

307
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,250
Zhifu tried to kill you?

308
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,460
He invited me to lunch.

309
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,570
Then he attacked me for no reason.

310
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,620
Then... Cao Jingxian showed up.

311
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,620
Cao Jingxian?

312
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,730
He must

313
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,660
have something

314
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,940
on Mr. Zhifu,

315
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,220
so Mr. Zhifu was forced to kill me.

316
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,940
Mr. Zhifu must be in danger now.

317
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,380
Hurry...

318
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,620
Go save him!

319
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,860
Zang Hai.

320
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,180
Zang Hai!

321
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,140
You can't die now.

322
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,620
Hang in there!

323
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,420

00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,980
Where's the physician?

326
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,810
My Lord.

327
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,570
Come in.

328
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,730
My Lord,

329
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,380
the Surveillance Office still won't release Mr. Zhifu.

330
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,620
Zhuang Shan, go summon two people for me:

331
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,330
Xu Daishan, the Deputy Censor-in-Chief of the Censorate,

332
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,620
and Qi Ming, the Assistant Censor-in-Chief.

333
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,570
Understood.

334
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:59,660
Xu Daishan and Qi Ming have been visiting the Marquis's Mansion frequently.

335
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,860
They and the Marquis are awfully close now.

336
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,530
Father,

337
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,730
the Marquis's birthday is coming up.

338
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,490
I've heard he's planning a grand banquet.

339
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,620
And this time, he's invited many officials

340
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,570
who don't see eye to eye with you.

341
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,290
Looks like he's done pretending.

342
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,420
Now that he has the Gui Seal, he's ready to move against me.

343

[Zang Residence]

344
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,660

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,090
Master.

346
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,980
Oh, Hai, you're finally awake.

347
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,770
Once your condition stabilized,

348
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,490
the Marquis had you sent back.

349
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,180
You've been out for days.

350
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,460
Easy now.

351
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,380
Here, Hai.

352
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,490
Easy. No rush.

353
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,050
Master,

354
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,660
how are things at the Marquis's Mansion?

355
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,050
Zhuang Zhifu got detained

356
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,620
by the Surveillance Office that day and hasn't returned since.

357
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,730
The Marquis has been meeting with his allies from the Censorate

358
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,770
in his mansion.

359
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,050
Looks like he's rallying support

360
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,620
to impeach Cao Jingxian.

361
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,770
So he believed me.

362
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,530
Your act

363
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,460
really caught him off guard.

364
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,860
It was the only way.

00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,490
Now, he'll believe

367
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,860
Cao Jingxian probably already knows

368
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,420

He learned from me that the Gui Seal

375
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,490
was hidden in the Marquis's treasury.

376
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,050
Given his temperament, he'll want to strike first.

383
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,860
And that person would probably be my third enemy.

384
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,620
Shilei and I will keep watch on Cao's Mansion.

385
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,050
We'll alert you as soon as he makes a move.

386
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,530
Hungry, huh?

387
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,700
I've got food ready.

388
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,380
I'll go get it.

389
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,090
Hai.

390
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,290
Hai.

391
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,140
Cao Jingxian finally left his mansion.

392
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,860
I've sent Shilei to tail him.

393
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,050
He's desperate now.

394
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,010
I'm going after him.

395
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,770
You're still recovering.

396
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,220
No time to worry about that.

397
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,330
Wait...

398
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,010
At least put on more clothes!

399
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,740
[Hostage's Mansion]

400
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,220
[Hostage's Mansion]

401
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:58,860
Sir,

402
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,050
what is

403
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,330
this place?

404
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,530
It's the residence of a royal hostage.

405
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,420
So your third enemy lives here?

406
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,380
I can't say for sure.

407
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,700
I'll have to get inside to find out.

408
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,010
But there are so many Surveillance Officers outside.

409
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,570
How are we supposed to get in?

410
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,490
What...

411
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,900
What are you doing?

412
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,940
The land route is blocked,

413
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,940
so I'll go in through the water.

414
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,420
I know the city's layout.

415
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,180
There's an underground channel that leads to the mansion.

416
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:09,900
But sir...

417
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,420
Shilei,

418
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,420
wait for me here.

419
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,380
Your Highness,

420
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,180
I came tonight to discuss something important.

421
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,420
I know where the Gui Seal is.

422
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,730
I'm willing to tell you everything

423
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,250
on one condition:

424
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,700
you must honor our agreement.

425
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,770
If you're here before even getting the seal,

426
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,700
it must be hidden somewhere

427
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,420
that's giving you trouble.

428
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,460
You're sharp as ever, Your Highness.

429
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,220
To be frank,

430
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,180
I'm not fully confident I can retrieve it.

431
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:36,220
But I'm willing to be open with you.

432
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,700
Let's talk and see how we can both come out ahead.

433
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,770
Sure.

434
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,140
We'll stick to our deal.

435
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,570
Then could you tell me

436
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,420
what the Gui Seal does, Your Highness?

437
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,290
You'll know when we get it.

438
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,700
I'm certain

439
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,380
the Gui Seal

440
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,250
is in the Marquis's hands.

441
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,250
It's hidden beneath his treasury.

442
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,140
Zhuang Luyin is hosting

443
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,380
a banquet the night after tomorrow.

444
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,660
I plan to show up uninvited.

445
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,700
If we work together,

446
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,180
getting the seal will be easy.

447
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,250
Aren't you afraid I'll disappear with it

448
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,090
once I have it?

449
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,900
Surely you jest, Your Highness.

450
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,380
You're a royal hostage from Dongxia.

451
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,770
What will happen if you vanish?

452
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,380
I think

453
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,490
you know that better than I do.

454
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,380
It was I who came to you back then.

455
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,050
Of course I'd come prepared.

456
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,530
Once the seal is in our hands,

457
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,250
everything is negotiable.

458
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,940
I've searched for it long enough.

459
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,490
I can't wait any longer.

460
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,380
Good night.

461
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,490
Sir!

462
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,140
Are you all right?

463
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,140
So the third person is the hostage princess from Dongxia?

464
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,860
They say she hasn't left her mansion over the past ten years.

465
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,860
No one's even seen her face.

466
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,340
She arrived in the Capital

467
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,940
the day before your family fell.

468
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,780
But she was only ten back then.

469
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,380
History has no shortage

470
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,170
of prodigies who outsmart adults

471
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,650
from a young age.

472
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,780
Besides, I heard their entire conversation clearly.

473
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,530
It makes sense.

474
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,420
The Gui Seal is Dongxia's greatest treasure.

475
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,650
Your father took it from Dongxia.

476
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,050
Of course she'd come for it.

477
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,090
Here.

478
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,090
Since Cao

479
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,530
has decided to act,

480
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,050
she won't stand by and watch.

481
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,210
She won't let him take the Gui Seal alone.

482
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,780
Therefore,

483
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,610
she'll show up that day.

484
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,400
And I'll be there,

485
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,610
waiting for my enemies.

486
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,380
Two!

487
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,300
Three!

488
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,130
Four!

489
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,090
Five!

490
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:18,940
Six!

491
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:20,900
Seven!

492
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,740
Eight!

493
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,420
Sir,

494
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,530
someone's here to see you.

495
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,340
Keep going!

496
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,550
One!

497
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,680
Two!

498
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:40,930
Three!

499
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,820
What brings you here today?

500
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,650
I have something important to tell you.

501
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,340
You're off duty tomorrow, right?

502
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,420
Yes.

503
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,130
It's Father's birthday tomorrow. I've prepared a gift.

504
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,340
Why?

505
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,260
Tomorrow night, the Marquis

506
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,090
is hosting a banquet for close allies

507
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,380
to discuss impeaching Cao Jingxian.

508
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,010
Cao's already caught wind of it.

509
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,050
He'll definitely show up.

510
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,530
What's going to happen?

511
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,010
Knowing your father and Cao Jingxian,

512
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,420
it won't end peacefully.

513
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,050
What do you want me to do?

514
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,650
Tell me,

515
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,860
how's your relationship with your men these days?

516
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,610
If you are to return to the mansion

517
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,000
to rescue your father tomorrow night, will they follow you?

518
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,090
They follow my lead now.

519
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,650
It shouldn't be a problem.

520
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,780
Good.

521
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,170
Then gather your men and charge back to the mansion

522
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,460
tomorrow night.

523
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,530
Only in a moment of true crisis like this

524
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,170
will your father see your worth.

525
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,690
It'll mean more than any birthday gift.

526
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,010
I'm not asking you to do this out of filial duty.

527
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,010
This is for your own sake.

528
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,780
Zhuang Zhifu is done for.

529
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,090
This is your chance.

530
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,650
When do we move?

531
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,010
Wait for my signal.

532
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,100
[Welcome with Great Enthusiasm]

533
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,570
Wait here.

534
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,740
Yes, sir.

535
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,740
Miss Xiang, your swordsmanship is truly impressive.

536
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,260
What brings you here?

537
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,690
I just felt like taking a walk today.

538
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,740
And somehow, I ended up here at Zhen Tower.

539
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,530
What a coincidence.

540
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,260
I was just about to visit you.

541
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,900
Do you have something to say to me?

542
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,570
Last time, I said you'd have to

543
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,610
trade your secret for mine.

544
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,980
But I've changed my mind.

545
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,340
I can tell you everything,

546
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,010
no strings attached.

547
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,090
You're not curious anymore?

548
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,090
Friends shouldn't keep secrets from each other.

549
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,300
Tomorrow night at Xu hour, meet me at Qingque Bridge outside the city.

550
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,530
Tomorrow night?

551
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,090
I'm here now, Miss Xiang.

552
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,170
Why not tell me today?

553
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,900
Today's not a good time.

554
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,860
I'll tell you everything tomorrow night.

555
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,780
But...

556
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,860
tomorrow night is the Marquis's birthday banquet.

557
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,940
So what?

558
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,570
He'll have another birthday next year.

559
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,340
What, are you hoping to make

560
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,490
more powerful friends at the banquet?

561
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,980
I warned you, didn't I?

562
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,690
Officials are the worst in the Capital.

563
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,090
You've got the wrong idea, Miss Xiang.

564
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,980
The Marquis helped me once in court.

565
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,940
I owe him.

566
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,260
I can't skip his banquet.

567
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,860
Seriously, Zang Hai?

568
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,610
You finally get the chance to know my secret,

569
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,530
and you're saying no?

570
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,260
I know the Marquis has helped you, but haven't I helped you too?

571
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,490
If you're willing to share your secret,

572
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,690
it means you truly see me as a friend.

573
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,340
How about this?

574
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,780
Wait for me a little longer tomorrow night.

575
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,380
We can talk later.

576
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,650
Don't even think about it. If you're not there by Xu hour,

577
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,570
you'll never hear that secret.

578
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,010
All right.

579
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,260
You have my word.

580
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,300
Then it's settled.

581
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,570
See you tomorrow night.

582
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,210
Miss, are you really going to tell him?

583
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,690
There's no point

584
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,820
in hiding it anymore.

585
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,010
You'll go in my place.

586
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,260
There will be blood at the Marquis's banquet tomorrow.

587
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,340
I want him far away from it and out of harm's way.

588
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,170
Stay by his side.

589
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,780
Whatever happens, don't let him leave.

590
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,490
No, I need to protect you.

591
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,420
Once it's over, I'll go meet him.

592
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,140
[Cao's Mansion]

593
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,490
Tonight's going to be brutal.

594
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,980
You're my most trusted men.

595
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,780
I've fed and trained you for years.

596
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,610
Now it's time for you to repay me.

597
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,940
- We pledge our lives to you, sir! - We pledge our lives to you, sir!

598
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,690
Lu Yan.

599
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,570
The Dongxia hostage will show up.

600
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,340
Stay close to her.

601
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,010
Understood.

602
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,650
Shilei,

603
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,380
do you remember everything I said?

604
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,690
Guanfeng,

605
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,530
don't mess up your part.

606
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,050
Master, I'm heading out.

607
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:29,980
Be careful.

608
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,010
We'll stick to the plan.

609
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:35,980
Guanfeng,

610
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,570
when you see her, tell her I got drunk at the banquet.

611
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,170
Tell her not to wait for me.

612
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,420
I will.

613
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:46,900
