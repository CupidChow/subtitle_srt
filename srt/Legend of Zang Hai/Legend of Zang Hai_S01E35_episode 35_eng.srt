1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:16,030



2
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,926
   

4
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,620
Official Zhao.

5
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,360
You...

6
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,660
Do you remember this?

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,680
I took it from you the night I rescued you.

8
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:36,570
I always figured that when I could meet you in our true identities,

9
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,030
that I would return this to its rightful owner.

10
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,190
Back then, the situation was too uncertain,

11
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,960
so I didn't dare reveal myself to you.

12
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,710
I kept my identity from you all these years...

13
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:08,520
because I feared your enemies would find out about our ties,

14
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,550
and put your entire revenge plan at risk.

15
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,110
But now, I can no longer remain hidden...

16
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,100
because you've already come so far.

17
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,820
This time, it's only right I stand by your side.

18
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,760
Sir, please accept my deepest gratitude.

19
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,940
Finally, we meet openly.

20
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,870
In the first year of the Zhenshun era,

21
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,210
I was promoted to Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue,

22
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,070
and your father was already serving as the Imperial Astronomer.

23
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,800
That year, a major construction corruption case broke out.

24
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,430
I petitioned the Emperor to launch a full investigation.

25
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:54,490
But the case involved many high-ranking officials.

26
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,720
I was framed, and your father was the only one

27
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,710
who spoke up in court to defend me.

28
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:10,630
Because of his willingness to risk his own position to help me,

29
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,780
I got off with nothing more than a demotion.

30
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:28,440
That day, I swore to repay this kindness, whatever the cost.

31
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,560
Ever since then,

32
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,920
we kept in touch through letters.

33
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,830
Being away from the capital,

34
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,850
I only knew about many court affairs

35
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,480
because of communication with your father.

36
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,630
Thanks to him, I made notable achievements even while demoted.

37
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,560
In the fifth year of Zhenshun,

38
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,330
I returned to the capital and resumed my former post.

39
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,830
In the sixth year,

40
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,870
your father was sent to Dongxia to oversee Fengshan Altar's construction.

41
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,290
From then on,

42
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,150
we never saw each other again,

43
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,480
but our correspondence continued.

44
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,190
Three years later,

45
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,430
while I was in Yuezhou handling disaster relief,

46
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,580
I suddenly received a secret letter from him.

47
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,070
He wanted to flee the capital with his family

48
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,270
and asked for my help.

49
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,560
I had assumed the altar collapse...

50
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,560
had taken Kuai Duo's life.

51
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,140
But to my surprise,

52
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,680
he was still alive.

53
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,360
Though he didn't tell me exactly what happened,

54
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,290
his words revealed extreme anxiety and fear.

55
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,480
I rushed to his residence through the night,

56
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,120
but I was still a step too late.

57
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,800
By the time I arrived, the Kuai residence was already engulfed by flames.

58
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,110
All I could do...

59
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,040
was rescue his son...

60
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,930
and make plans for the future.

61
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,310
I took you to Qingquan Town,

62
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,190
laid out a plan for your revenge,

63
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,630
and left you in Xing Dou and Gao Ming's care.

64
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,490
 Thank you, Master. 

65
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,930
That was the last thing I could do for your father.

66
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,370
Sir,

67
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,460
thank you.

68
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,170
It's been ten years. You're finally ready.

69
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,190
There's much work ahead.

70
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,190
First, we need to find out

71
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,410
whether Shi Yiping is truly involved.

72
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,120
I'll have someone send a visiting card,

73
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,750
and I'll accompany you to the Shi residence to investigate.

74
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,161
   

75
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,200
He finally told you the truth.

76
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,080
I'd been dying to tell you myself.

77
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,900
When you went to visit him,

78
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,380
I already wanted to tell you

79
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,710
you shouldn't bother, and that he was your benefactor.

80
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,480
But he insisted it was too soon.

81
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,000
And he said he just wanted to give you a bit of guidance.

82
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,390
So, Master, can you tell me

83
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,270
how you all came to know him now?

84
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Sure.

85
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,600
Xing Dou met back Master when he was demoted.

86
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,750
Xing Dou was wealthy but uptight and eccentric.

87
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,610
He offended an official, got framed, and ended up with a death sentence.

88
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,900
Master stepped in and saved him.

89
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,080
My story's different.

90
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,140
I was an orphan raised on scraps from kind strangers.

91
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,390
Thankfully, Master took me in

92
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,270
and gave me the chance to make something of myself.

93
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,320
What about Master Liu Chu?

94
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,250
Her story's not mine to tell.

95
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,150
The point is, she, too, owes Master.

96
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,890
If you're upset I kept this from you for so long, I don't blame you.

97
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,000
But I think,

98
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,880
a lie told with good intentions isn't always a bad thing.

99
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,740
Master,

100
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,790
you're the person I trust the most.

101
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:59,330
As you know, there are very few people in this world I'd trust unconditionally.

102
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,240
Like I always say,

103
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,240
nothing matters more than staying alive.

104
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,260
I never would've guessed Tong Er's father was your benefactor.

105
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,170
Maybe the whole Eighth Young Master persona was inspired by her father.

106
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,050
You may be right about that.

107
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,630
Now that you have the Emperor's backing

108
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,480
and Official Zhao on your side,

109
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,630
I'm sure it'll not be long before you get your revenge.

110
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,080
Things are still far from clear.

111
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,200
We mustn't let our guard down.

112
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,670
Then be careful when you visit the Shi Residence.

113
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,200
Even if you uncover an issue, don't act rashly.

114
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,440
Don't worry.

115
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,510
I'll protect myself well.

116
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,642
   

117
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,890
Greetings, Official Zhao.

118
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,750
Officials, please have a seat.

119
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,840
I'll go and inform my master immediately.

120
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,360
- Official Shi. 
 - Official Shi.

121
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,480
We're all colleagues in court,

122
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,390
and Official Zhao and I both serve in the Cabinet.

123
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,330
There's no need for formalities.

124
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,140
Official Zang, this is your first time

125
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,320
visiting me since taking office, isn't it?

126
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,440
I never thought someone as upright as Official Zhao

127
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,930
would interact with you.

128
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,670
Since my appointment,

129
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,600
I've yet to pay my respects to you.

130
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,030
That's my oversight.

131
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,510
Zang Hai was just appointed Vice Minister of Works.

132
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,870
I brought him here today to introduce him

133
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,600
and ask that you offer him some guidance moving forward.

134
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,390
You're being too modest, Official Zhao.

135
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,870
When it comes to spotting talent,

136
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,790
no one in the capital does it better than you.

137
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm already old now.

138
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,380
In a few more years, I'll likely retire to my hometown.

139
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,620
The Ministry of Revenue controls the purse strings.

140
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,440
If I left, the court wouldn't miss me.

141
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,120
But if you stepped down, it would fail.

142
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,030
You flatter me.

143
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,150
Official Shi, please don't say that.

144
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,640
Great Yong can't afford to lose someone like you.

145
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,600
Aside from His Majesty,

146
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,910
no one is indispensable.

147
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,270
Zhuang Luyin won countless battles

148
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,550
but still died by his own son's sword.

149
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,140
Cao Jingxian once had great sway in court,

150
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,750
but he, too, met a sudden return to the other world.

151
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,740
When water overflows, it spills. When the moon is full, it wanes.

152
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,650
A man in office must never forget that.

153
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,530
Wise words, sir.

154
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,870
Zang Hai, I heard the Emperor gave you the Sword of Justice

155
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,410
and tasked you with investigating Cao Jingxian's death.

156
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:19,840
Are you here today because you suspect the Cabinet?

157
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,840
The Cabinet drafts the Emperor's replies

158
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,150
and handles many state secrets.

159
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,780
Do you really dare to probe into that?

160
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,380
With respect, Official Shi, I don't have any leads yet.

161
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,080
But I cannot defy the Emperor's orders.

162
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,840
Since I've accepted the Sword of Justice,

163
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,050
I will see this through.

164
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,720
This case is full of strange details.

165
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,480
Zang Hai simply hopes to hear your perspective.

166
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,240
Official Zhao, you truly are a fine judge of talent.

167
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,440
Zang Hai has such resolve.

168
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,610
He may well really be able to serve in the Cabinet one day.

169
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,640
He's still young and can be impulsive.

170
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,030
He'll need to visit often,

171
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,920
so you can teach him and shape him well.

172
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,110
The younger generation is full of promise.

173
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,190
I think you've underestimated him.

174
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,720
Zang Hai, pursue your investigation as you see fit.

175
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,960
You have my full support.

176
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,150
Thank you, Official.

177
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,530
   

178
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,350
That Official Shi certainly acted like he had nothing to hide,

179
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,200
letting us investigate the Cabinet without resistance.

180
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,480
He's trying to turn you into a blade

181
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,350
that cuts into the Cabinet for him.

182
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,000
So, he's ready to start consolidating power.

183
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,600
He won't make any overt moves.

184
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,200
As for me, I can perfectly become his blade

185
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
to tighten his grip on the Cabinet.

186
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,920
I've worked alongside him for years.

187
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,480
I've seen him suppress countless major officials,

188
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,720
both openly and in secret.

189
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,830
He even used that list you submitted from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

190
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,790
to stir up trouble.

191
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,070
There's also been long-standing friction

192
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,170
between Cao Jingxian's Surveillance Office and the Cabinet.

193
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,720
But Shi Yiping's attitude toward Cao Jingxian in the court...

194
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,830
had always been inconsistent.

195
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,050
At times, they are openly in conflict,

196
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,670
while at others, they seem to be quietly colluding.

197
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,240
By the way, sir, I've heard Official Shi

198
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,920
has a well-known fondness for paintings.

199
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,000
I did notice that the front hall of his residence

200
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,350
was lined with valuable pieces.

201
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,830
Some of them looked very familiar,

202
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,090
like the ones I'd seen on the market just recently.

203
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,070
Now that you mention it,

204
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,790
I recall something.

205
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,880
The prices of calligraphy and paintings in the capital

206
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,040
have nearly doubled lately,

207
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,510
while antiques and jade have dropped significantly.

208
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,240
Sounds like people are buying art at high prices

209
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,530
to get in Official Shi's good graces.

210
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,200
If paintings are the way in,

211
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,550
I would like to give the Shi residence another visit tonight.

212
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,200
I'll bring a fine painting as a gift

213
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,790
and make it seem like I'm eager to build a closer relationship.

214
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,640
That way, he'll lower his guard,

215
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,740
and I can probe deeper.

216
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,880
Official Zang,

217
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,160
it's quite late.

218
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,720
Is something urgent?

219
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,510
I visited earlier rather hastily and came empty-handed.

220
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,270
This time, I've brought two notable paintings

221
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,430
and would like to ask Official Shi for an inscription.

222
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,910
Please come with me, sir.

223
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,220
"Autumn Colors Among Streams and Mountains."

224
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,630
"Strumming the Zither Under Trees."

225
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:59,070
Both are authentic works.

226
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,830
I didn't expect you to have such refined taste.

227
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,920
You flatter me, sir.

228
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,310
You're a true connoisseur of art.

229
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,240
I'm just pretending to be a man of culture.

230
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,550
I've long admired your calligraphy,

231
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,000
so I came hoping you might grace these with a few words.

232
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,880
Apologies for disturbing your rest.

233
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,310
Official Zang, you come to visit this late at night.

234
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:28,130
Surely it's not as simple as wanting a few inscriptions. Am I right?

235
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,270
To be honest, I caught a glimpse

236
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,660
of your "Landscape of Mount Yuren" earlier.

237
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,690
Its depiction of that famed Dongxia peak was magnificent and extraordinary.

238
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,850
I couldn't resist coming back for a closer look.

239
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,980
Everyone has things they're passionate about.

240
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,090
Just like I'm fond of paintings,

241
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,630
and His Majesty loves wooden works.

242
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,640
My "Landscape of Mount Yuren"

243
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,000
isn't some timeless masterpiece,

244
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,430
but the two you've brought are treasures I badly want but can't have.

245
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,500
You certainly know how to appeal to someone's tastes.

246
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:36,480
But I can tell you don't truly enjoy art.

247
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,570
The power and status other officials dream of...

248
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,590
isn't what you're after either.

249
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,270
Your mind isn't set on any of these things.

250
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,090
I only wish to ease the Emperor's burdens.

251
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,160
Still, one thing puzzles me.

252
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,440
What would you like to ask, Official?

253
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,240
Criminal investigations are typically handled by the Three Judicial Offices.

254
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,110
You're the Vice Minister of Works, not from the Surveillance Office.

255
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,780
Yet, His Majesty assigned the case to you.

256
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:19,260
Is there something special about you that I don't know?

257
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,480
Sir, His Majesty trusts me.

258
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,310
That's why he entrusted me with this case.

259
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,330
Even if the Emperor trusts you,

260
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,720
I do not.

261
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,680
You've risen so far in just one year.

262
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,660
Remarkable indeed.

263
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,200
Tomorrow, I'll advise His Majesty

264
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,060
to hand the case over to me.

265
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,220
You won't have to trouble yourself with it anymore.

266
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,200
If you can really persuade His Majesty,

267
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,460
I'll naturally follow his orders.

268
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,200
Do you mean

269
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,830
the Emperor wants more than just the truth behind Cao Jingxian's death

270
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:27,320
but something else he wants you to do as well?

271
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,520
What else do you think needs investigating?

272
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,550
Master, what's wrong?

273
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,210
Master!

274
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,750
Master!

275
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,390
Help! Help Master!

276
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,610
Master!

277
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,570
Lu Yan?

278
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,940
- Go after her! 
 - On it.

279
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Go and get help.

280
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,500
Now!

281
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,780
Who's there?

282
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,640
Lu Yan, why did you kill Shi Yiping?

283
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,920
He tricked my adoptive father into giving him the Gui Seal

284
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,060
and made us follow his orders.

285
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,180
But after we carried them out, he wanted us all dead.

286
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,960
He deserved to die.

287
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,250
But you deserve it even more!

288
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,680
So, the person Cao Jingxian told you to obey before he died

289
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,730
was Shi Yiping?

290
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,010
Zang Hai, I should've killed you long ago.

291
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,150
If you hadn't gotten Father killed, how could things have come to this?

292
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,750
Get the assassin!

293
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,980
Guards, get the assassin!

294
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,350
Too bad I couldn't kill you.

295
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,860
Father, I'm coming to join you.

296
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,760
Stop her!

297
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,609
Official Zang.

298
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:29,550
We searched every possible hiding spot in the residence,

299
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,090
but we found nothing.

300
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:36,400
Officials, what exactly are you looking for?

301
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:42,070
Without evidence, we can't prove anything against him.

302
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,250
Such a serious thing happened.

303
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:49,090
No matter what, we need to report to His Majesty first.

304
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,750
Eunuch Sun, this matter is of great importance.

305
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,110
Please clear the room.

306
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,960
Everyone out.

307
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,460
Yes, sir.

308
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,880
Your Majesty.

309
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,980
Your Majesty.

310
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,620
Your Majesty.

311
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,570
It's my Gui Seal.

312
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,310
Your Majesty, it was found in the residence of Grand Secretary Shi Yiping.

313
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,250
He was killed by Cao Jingxian's close attendant, Lu Yan,

314
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,970
who then killed herself to avoid punishment.

315
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,580
Before she died, she revealed

316
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,950
that Shi Yiping poisoned all the Surveillance Officers at Cao's Mansion.

317
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,820
I wouldn't have thought the one behind it all was Shi Yiping.

318
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,730
My Chief Grand Secretary was coveting what belonged to me day and night.

319
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,940
I truly misjudged him.

320
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,310
Your Majesty entrusted me with the Sword of Justice

321
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,030
and even helped me take down my third enemy.

322
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:54,460
Now, I should return this sword to Your Majesty.

323
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,910
Your Majesty,

324
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:09,000
may I ask for a painting I saw at the Shi Residence?

325
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,380
Which famous painting from his collection caught your eye?

326
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,040
It is not a renowned work,

327
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,260
just a landscape of Dongxia's mountain range.

328
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,680
That's it?

329
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,720
Take it.

330
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

331
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,050
I take my leave.

332
00:32:43,268 --> 00:32:46,793
   

333
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,550
How is Zang Hai?

334
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,720
He's fine.

335
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,140
Miss Xiang is looking after him.

336
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,380
He carried too heavy a burden for years.

337
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,580
It's good he gets a night of drinking.

338
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,360
He's extraordinarily sharp,

339
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,790
but he's still young, after all.

340
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,250
True.

341
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,290
Do you think...

342
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:20,020
he handed over both the Gui Seal and the bronze fish to the Emperor?

343
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,590
What are you implying, sir?

344
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,290
If he gave up everything,

345
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
then I have nothing to worry about.

346
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,310
You worry he might've kept something from His Majesty?

347
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,630
If he really kept the bronze fish,

348
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,330
then like his father,

349
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:47,480
he must fear that the Emperor might one day use the Gui Seal.

350
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,380
But doing so is very dangerous.

351
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,320
You just laid down. Why are you up again?

352
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,510
You drank so much.

353
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,570
You should rest early.

354
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,800
I'm not drunk.

355
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,630
Then what's wrong?

356
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,450
Everything went so smoothly today.

357
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:36,130
My last enemy is dead, and I found the Gui Seal.

358
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,070
But something still doesn't sit right with me.

359
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,110
What are you worried about?

360
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,150
It took me a long time to track down my third enemy.

361
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,400
Both the Marquis of Pingjin and Cao Jingxian

362
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,510
went to great lengths to hide his identity.

363
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,040
But today, when I finally got the chance to face him,

364
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,360
he dropped dead right in front of me.

365
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,970
If my third enemy is someone else entirely,

366
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,900
then he could've made Lu Yan sacrifice her own life

367
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,320
to put on this whole show for us.

368
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,730
He was even willing to give up the Gui Seal and the bronze fish.

369
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,500
All to make us believe that Shi Yiping was your third enemy.

370
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:29,600
If that's the case, then he's far more cunning and ruthless

371
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,450
than Cao Jingxian or Zhuang Luyin ever were.

372
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,640
Antu, come with me.

373
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,560
Take a close look at this.

374
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,900
It's a painting of Mount Yuren in Dongxia, indeed.

375
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,340
Shi Yiping's steward said it was put up only recently.

376
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,340
What does that tell us?

377
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,030
His home is filled with works by Great Yong's most renowned artists.

378
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,800
Why did he hang this one of Dongxia in the most prominent place?

379
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,000
It's as if he were trying to signal his connection to the Gui Seal.

380
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,860
Could someone have sent him that painting

381
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,210
and ensured it was displayed just to catch my attention?

382
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,450
If so, that same person likely ordered Lu Yan

383
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,300
to hide the Gui Seal and bronze fish in the Shi Residence.

384
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,550
That person is my true enemy.

385
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,760
But the Gui Seal and the bronze fish were what he wanted most.

386
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,110
Why would he just give them up like that?

387
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,510
Maybe he's after the bronze fish I still have.

388
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,340
I see.

389
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,900
Even with two in hand,

390
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,490
he'd can only activate the Gui Seal with all three. Missing even one wouldn't work.

391
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,340
Don't get anxious.

392
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,860
Get some rest first.

393
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,210
I'll help you figure this out.

394
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:28,130
I just can't let go of this doubt.

395
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,030
I'm not going anywhere.

396
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,010
I'm right here with you.

397
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,960
When everything's finally over, we'll leave the capital

398
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,490
and travel the world, just like we planned.

399
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,510
By then, you won't be able to break your promise.

400
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,610
Antu, I think I know what to do.

401
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,400
What is it?

402
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,110
I'm going to resign.

403
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,680
You're up.

404
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,450
It smells great.

405
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,030
Not so fast.

406
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,190
Why are you in such a rush?

407
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,320
It's not ready yet.

408
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,590
Wait a bit longer. Give that back.

409
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,070
Let it sit a bit longer.

410
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,630
- Cover it. 
 - All right.

411
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,920
Then I'll help keep the fire going.

412
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,230
No need.

413
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,760
Leave it.

414
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,510
Congee needs slow simmering.

415
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:52,030
If you stoke the fire, you'll burn the whole pot.

416
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,940
All right.

417
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,010
Let me.

418
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,110
Here. Have a taste.

419
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,920
Thank you, Master.

420
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,490
Be careful. It's hot.

421
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,610
It's good.

422
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,090
Do you feel a bit better now?

423
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,130
Now that you've taken your revenge, I want to have a talk with you.

424
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,100
You were drunk last night.

425
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,100
So we didn't get the chance.

426
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,880
It's all right, Master.

427
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,940
That part of my life is over.

428
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,690
So, what are your plans for the future?

429
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,110
I plan to resign and leave the capital.

430
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,360
Master, I've got it all figured out.

431
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,000
You, I, Antu, Guan Feng, and Shi Lei will leave together.

432
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,960
If Antu wants to bring Feng Liu and Ying Qi, that's fine, too.

433
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,640
We'll find a quiet place and live out our days in peace.

434
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,980
Of course, only if everyone's willing.

435
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,940
That sounds perfect.

436
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:40,480
You've got no ties left in the capital, and you don't want to stay in office anyway.

437
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,050
Then let's leave.

438
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,600
I also want to stop by Qingquan Town

439
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,530
and tell Master Xing Dou the news myself.

440
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,630
I wonder if that man's still there.

441
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,150
He always said he had no ties,

442
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:05,120
but in truth, he just didn't want to be anyone's burden.

443
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,300
We'll see when we get there.

444
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,940
It looks about done.

445
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:14,870
Then I'll go call everyone for breakfast and let them know my plans.

446
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,700
All right. Go ahead.

447
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,640
- I'm off. 
 - Go on.

448
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,440
Your Majesty, Official Zhao has arrived.

449
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,880
Your Majesty.

450
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,460
Bing Wen.

451
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,300
I summoned you here to ask you something.

452
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,170
Please go ahead, Your Majesty. I will answer as best I can.

453
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,780
- You may rise. 
 - Thank you, Your Majesty.

454
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,440
Tell me. Now that Shi Yiping is dead,

455
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,210
would you like to take his place as Chief Grand Secretary of the Cabinet?

456
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,030
I've served many years in the Ministry of Revenue,

457
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,840
but I've never handled personnel affairs.

458
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,030
I fear I'm unfit for the role.

459
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,030
I ask Your Majesty to reconsider.

460
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,630
But the Cabinet needs a chief.

461
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,920
You're already the deputy.

462
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,590
If not you, then who?

463
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,470
If I can't ease Your Majesty's burdens, then I've failed in my duty.

464
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,180
If Your Majesty approves,

465
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,780
I'm willing to serve as the acting Chief Grand Secretary

466
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,550
until a more suitable candidate is found.

467
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,840
Very well.

468
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,880
Acting or not,

469
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,960
you'll lead the Cabinet from now on.

470
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,210
I will not fail Your Majesty's trust.

471
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:15,050



472
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:22,200
 "It’s Me" - Sun Nan

00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,540
♫  I am life and death  ♫

492
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,320
♫  I grant and deprive  ♫

493
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,820
♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

494
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,420
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫

495
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:02,780
♫  I am the sowing season  ♫

496
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,400
♫  I am the autumn harvest  ♫

497
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,860
♫  I am the kingdom  ♫

498
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:13,620
♫  I’m the commoner  ♫

499
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:18,600
♫  You’re also me  ♫
