1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:17,140



2
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,700
   

4
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,000
What is the other big celebration you were talking about?

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,070
The Queen is planning a marriage alliance with the Haidong tribes?

6
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,710
The Princess is getting married.

7
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,480
It's a great opportunity for her to break away from Great Yong.

8
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,840
What did you just say?

9
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,380
The Princess is getting into a marriage alliance with the Haidong tribes?

10
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,400
Why are you anxious?

11
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,360
Did you want the Princess to marry you?

12
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,170
Come on. Let's drink.

13
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,850
It's time to eat.

14
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,850
- Your Highness. 
 - Your Highness.

15
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,310
- Your Highness. 
 - Antu.

16
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,320
Her Majesty has ordered it.

17
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,540
You can only see him from afar.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,590
Leave us alone.

19
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,060
- Yes, Your Highness. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

20
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,190
Zang Hai, I'm leaving.

21
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,320
Are you really going to get into a marriage alliance?

22
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,730
Why are you obeying her?

23
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,870
Don't ask.

24
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,120
Anyway, my sister agreed to let me come to see you one last time.

25
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,410
If you have anything to say, say it now.

26
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,310
That's all they said?

27
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,370
- Nothing else? 
 - Yes.

28
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,210
They just talked about their past in Great Yong and said some goodbyes.

29
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,260
Nothing else.

30
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,710
Leave.

31
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

32
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,190
I spent ten years in Great Yong, looking forward to the day I could return home

33
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,470
and reunite with my family.

34
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,940
But now, my mother is gone,

35
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,500
and my sister seems to be a different person.

36
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,730
I suddenly think this place is so unfamiliar.

37
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,900
Nanny,

38
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,700
I know you've always been thinking about my mother.

39
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,360
Listening to you talk about the past these days

40
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,790
makes me feel like I've been home.

41
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,390
Thank you.

42
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,310
Your Highness, you're finally back,

43
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,000
yet you're about to head to a different unfamiliar place.

44
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,430
I should have gone with you,

45
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,680
but Her Majesty doesn't want you to think of anything else.

46
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,700
You're getting married tomorrow. Why are you so glum?

47
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,410
It's not the person I am that Moersa wants to marry.

48
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,000
Whether I cry or laugh, he won't care.

49
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,940
An emissary from the Haidong tribes will meet you at 30 li outside the city.

50
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,170
When the time comes,

51
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,040
I will ask an auxiliary to act as your marriage messenger

52
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,760
and deliver you safely to them.

53
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,070
Your Majesty, I want Zang Hai to send me away.

54
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,860
I fear you will kill him as soon as I am married to the Haidong tribes,

55
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,640
so I want him to follow my marriage team to the Haidong tribes.

56
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,950
After my marriage, set him free.

57
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,500
Sister, this is the only thing I ask of you.

58
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,560
Promise me, will you?

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,360
My dear sister is getting married tomorrow,

60
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,990
so how can I, as your sister, refuse you?

61
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,260
Mother has always cared for you the most,

62
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,520
but she can't personally brush your hair or watch you get married.

63
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,680
In fact, even if you hadn't said anything, I knew.

64
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,320
You were afraid that I'd compete with you for the throne when I came back this time,

65
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,070
but you don't have to worry.

66
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,380
I long ago promised Mother

67
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,200
that my last duty to Dongxia is to fulfill her last wish.

68
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,920
Her last wish?

69
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,490
What's that?

70
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,410
To retrieve the Gui Seal.

71
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,160
The Gui Seal is already in the hands of Great Yong's Chief Secretary, Zhao Bingwen.

72
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,430
The Emperor of Great Yong has died,

73
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,340
so Zhao Bingwen will certainly do something about it.

74
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,780
He had said that he would use the Gui Seal to build an army in Dongxia.

75
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,020
At that point, whatever the Haidong tribes

76
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,080
and whoever Dongxia forms a marriage alliance with won't matter.

77
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,950
So, do you have a way to take back the Gui Seal from him?

78
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,530
I'm no match for him, but you're different.

79
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,040
Sister, you are the Queen of Dongxia.

80
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,500
- If you are willing to help me... 
 - Stop daydreaming.

81
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,690
Do your best to prepare for your marriage.

82
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,700
This will be the last time we see each other, right?

83
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,030
I won't be coming back.

84
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,450
Princess, please depart.

85
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,220
That's the Haidong tribes' greeting party?

86
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,390
We've traveled 30 li already?

87
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,060
That's right.

88
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,700
Are you the Haidong tribes' emissaries?

89
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,600
Yes. I have been ordered by the Khan to welcome the Princess of Dongxia.

90
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,176
   

91
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,940
 Are you really going to get into a marriage alliance? 

92
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,910
 Why are you obeying her? 

93
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,750
 Don't ask. 

94
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,860
 Anyway, my sister agreed to let me come to see you one last time. 

95
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,300
 If you have anything to say, say it now. 

96
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,900
 If I'd known this would happen, 

97
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,980
 I'd have stayed at Zhen Tower forever, 

98
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,670
 but how is Zhen Tower to be run without you? 

99
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,840
 How are you going to pay back the debt you owe? 

100
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,030
 I can't go back anyway, 

101
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,170
 so I'll just have to ask you to pay those debts for me. 

102
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,030
 The other debts are fine, 

103
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,790
 but you begged me 

104
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,790
 to ask Eighth Young Master to perform a storytelling for the ground polo champion, 

105
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,080
 which not only spoiled his plan 

106
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,790
 but also led them to come to you 

107
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,200
 and forcibly escort you to his residence. 

108
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,480
 I'd have forgotten about this if you hadn't mentioned it. 

109
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
 What happened after? 

110
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,750
 What happened after? 

111
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,910
 I sold the house for some money as a ransom to save you. 

112
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,550
 Madam Xiang, this is money you owe me. 

113
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,670
 Surely you're not asking me to pay it back myself? 

114
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,550
 I'm getting married anyway, 

115
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,120
 so consider it your wedding gift for me. 

116
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,740
 - Let's write it off. 
 - No way. 

117
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,510
 You owe me money, 

118
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,800
 so you can't leave me here alone. Right? 

119
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,810
 Madam, you're the only one I can trust in this palace now. 

120
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,450
 I'd like to ask you a favor. 

121
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,650
 Go to a general of Great Yong named Zhuang Zhixing. 

122
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,710
Everything is in order.

123
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,030
All the princess's dowry items are in the carriage.

124
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,110
Please take care of our princess.

125
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,150
Don't worry. We will make the marriage between the Princess and the Khan

126
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,040
proceed flawlessly.

127
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,650
Your Highness, please follow the procession to the Haidong tribes.

128
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,340
Take care.

129
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,340
Thank you.

130
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,150
Let's go back!

131
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,790
Your Highness, you can come out now.

132
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,910
Go back now. I'll go to the Haidong tribes with them.

133
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,670
Official Zang, I've been ordered by General Zhuang to meet you here.

134
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,920
Xiang Hong, thank you very much.

135
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,550
Take the stuff in the carriage with you.

136
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,960
- Where is the General? 
 - He's discussing military matters in his tent.

137
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,550
They are friends of the General. Now, prepare a clean tent.

138
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,120
Yes, sir.

139
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,170
Official Zang, you both get some rest first.

140
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,200
I'll let you know when the General is finished with his business.

141
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,900
Thank you very much.

142
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,720
Thank you for your help.

143
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,520
Long time no see, Zang Hai.

144
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,140
You've really changed a lot in just one year.

145
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,150
Only a year?

146
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,290
I feel like it's been five or six years.

147
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,760
Back when I was indulging in pleasures, I only felt that time passed too quickly,

148
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,920
but when I really suffered,

149
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,530
I realized how slowly time passed.

150
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,930
It's been hard for you to get this far at the border.

151
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,100
The commander-in-chief here was originally the State-Settling General.

152
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,660
Before that, he was at odds with my father,

153
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,350
so he gave me a hard time.

154
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,500
Later, I fought to the death and earned military merits

155
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,480
to establish myself at last.

156
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,520
In the capital, why did I never hear anything about you?

157
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,450
When I left, I was just an insignificant commander.

158
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,350
If I had died in battle, I wouldn't even get a tombstone,

159
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,140
so how could you hear anything about me?

160
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,400
Not long ago, the State-Settling General died of illness,

161
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,670
so the court appointed me to be the General of Exemplary Fortitude

162
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,450
to hold this place in his stead.

163
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,730
I didn't let you down, did I?

164
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,510
You've matured so much faster than I expected,

165
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,260
and you've become such a great leader.

166
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,880
You're right.

167
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,660
What I have is the blood of the Zhuang family's generals.

168
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,840
Only after I've fought and killed in battle

169
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,670
have I realized how many men need to be sacrificed for a victory.

170
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,710
What about you? What have you been through?

171
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,740
I was thrown into prison by Zhao Bingwen and was about to be executed,

172
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,370
but luckily, I narrowly escaped death and came to Dongxia.

173
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,490
Official Zhao has no grudge against you, so why did he do this to you?

174
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,480
Because he is my third enemy.

175
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,440
I didn't realize my father had lied to me.

176
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,670
Zhao Bingwen killed Shi Yiping and became Chief Secretary himself.

177
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,750
He framed the Emperor and planted the evidence on me.

178
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,300
Since then, he has seized power.

179
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,680
He got the Gui Seal from the Emperor,

180
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,180
so no one else in the court can stand up to him.

181
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,340
This is all happening far away in the court while I'm at the border,

182
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,590
so why are we talking about this?

183
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,670
Zang Hai.

184
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,640
It was tough for us to finally meet again.

185
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,290
Let's drink some today.

186
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,810
Antu is still waiting for me in the tent, and I'm feeling a bit tired.

187
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,100
You're busy in the army, so rest early.

188
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,440
Tomorrow morning, I will come to you.

189
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,440
Okay.

190
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,380
I've asked someone to send some food over. Go back and eat.

191
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,120
You don't have to rush. We have plenty of time.

192
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,700
What did you talk about? Why do you have such a ghastly face?

193
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,180
I expected Zhuang Zhixing to mature quickly in the barracks

194
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,000
but I wouldn't have thought that in just one short year,

195
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,030
he would already become the General of Exemplary Fortitude.

196
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,790
I told him about Zhao Bingwen's true colors,

197
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,820
but he didn't react to it,

198
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,190
so I'm afraid that Zhuang Zhixing

199
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,810
has been secretly colluding with Zhao Bingwen.

200
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,740
It seems that Zhao Bingwen's actions started earlier than I thought.

201
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,550
Could he have other plans to save us this time?

202
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,860
I don't think so. Otherwise, how could we have the chance to talk like this?

203
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,110
However, Zhuang Zhixing might report us to Zhao Bingwen at any time,

204
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,070
so we will be in danger sooner or later if we stay here.

205
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,790
I just heard the soldiers outside talking.

206
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,880
They're following the court's orders to go around conscripting laborers from Dongxia

207
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,080
and even forcibly seizing them to repair the Fengshan Altar.

208
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,790
Fengshan Altar had collapsed years ago,

209
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,970
so why are they rebuilding it now?

210
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,440
Zhao Bingwen never does things for no reason.

211
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,240
It must have something to do with the Gui Seal. We have to stop him.

212
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,510
Now Zhao Bingwen has the Gui Seal

213
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,610
and is in charge of the court. He even has the help of Zhuang Zhixing.

214
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,030
What should we do?

215
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,590
For now, we must first find a way to destroy the Gui Seal.

216
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,250
The Gui Seal was taken by my father from the depths of the Fengshan Altar.

217
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,880
When I was at the royal court, I inquired for information about the Gui Seal

218
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,450
and even asked my sister, but she knew nothing about it.

219
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,490
My mother died in Great Yong,

220
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,070
so there were many things about the Gui Seal that I never got the chance to tell my sister,

221
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,300
but I had a nanny with me who had served my mother for many years.

222
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,030
She told me a legend about the Gui Seal.

223
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,070
It is rumored that there is another world beneath Dongxia's earth.

224
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,830
There is a dome-like sky there,

225
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,510
but that sky is different from the blue sky we see.

226
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,110
There is a turquoise river of stars,

227
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,970
which was the world of ghost soldiers.

228
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,120
Zang Hai, there is one thing I forgot to tell you.

229
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,820
You are new here and unfamiliar here,

230
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,360
so I assigned Zhan Hao to protect you.

231
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,620
You can ask him if you need anything from me.

232
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,660
Thank you, General.

233
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,380
Take good care of him and Miss Xiang.

234
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,060
Yes.

235
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:08,240
Official Zang, I'll be right outside. If there's anything, ask me anytime.

236
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,630
 Does Zhuang Zhixing know about this? You can't tell him! 

237
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,480
 Keep your voice down. Listen to me. 

238
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,730
Let's go.

239
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,720
Where are you going?

240
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,830
It's not easy for us to see each other,

241
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,520
so how can you leave without saying goodbye?

242
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,030
I asked Antu to write to you so that I could destroy the Gui Seal with your help

243
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,500
after I left the Dongxia royal court,

244
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,410
but I didn't realize that you'd chosen to side with Zhao Bingwen.

245
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:45,590
So what? No matter what kind of man he is,

246
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,620
all I know is that he can give me what I want.

247
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,370
His order to rebuild the Fengshan Altar is just a cover.

248
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:59,270
His real goal is to bring the Dongxia laborers together

249
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,850
and turn them into ghost soldiers with the Gui Seal.

250
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,310
Do you really want to join him?

251
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:11,550
I'll judge for myself if what he's trying to do is right or wrong.

252
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,790
Then judge this matter seriously.

253
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,350
You only know that he's the murderer of my family

254
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,380
and the third enemy I've been painstakingly searching for

255
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,180
but not his other face.

256
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,620
Zhao Bingwen was my benefactor

257
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,350
and the one who rescued me after my family was killed.

258
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,640
After he trained me for ten years,

259
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,870
the first thing he did was to send me to your father.

260
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,590
He was helping you avenge your family?

261
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,440
Zhao Bingwen was a close friend of Zhuang Luyin and Cao Jingxian for decades,

262
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,050
yet he trained me to obtain the Gui Seal in order to take revenge on these two.

263
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,920
After getting the Gui Seal, he tried to silence me,

264
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,530
and didn't even spare Master Gao Ming, who had followed him for years.

265
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,970
You're still useful to him now,

266
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,000
but once you're no longer valuable,

267
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,830
he won't hesitate to throw you away.

268
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,240
Anyone who has merit will be eliminated by him.

269
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,960
When you approach him,

270
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,470
you'll be the first one he suspects,

271
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,830
and the first one he'll get rid of.

272
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,660
Is that all you wanted to tell me?

273
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,000
I once promised to help you regain the Marquis of Pingjin's recognition

274
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,690
and become the glory of the Zhuang family one day.

275
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,520
But I did not expect...

276
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,080
that you would follow the exact same path as your father.

277
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,040
Zang Hai,

278
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,940
I have regarded you as an ally and considered you a teacher.

279
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,580
Now, I can give you a new name and a new identity

280
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,160
to hide the fact that you are still alive.

281
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,350
Will you follow me as you served my father?

282
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,980
What I will do now is destroy the Gui Seal.

283
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,670
What do we do now?

284
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,720
We wait.

285
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,920
Okay.

286
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,150
Then let's destroy the Gui Seal.

287
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,150
Let's go.

288
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,200
We've been searching for so many days

289
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,480
but still haven't found any traces of the entrance.

290
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,780
Even if Zhuang Zhixing told me the location of the Fengshan Altar,

291
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,050
the path that my father took back then no longer exists.

292
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,420
We had to find another way.

293
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,380
However, since that was the place where the Gui Seal was sealed,

294
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,910
it was bound to follow certain laws of feng shui and geomancy.

295
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,780
However, Mount Dansui stretches far and wide.

296
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,160
If it could have been found easily,

297
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,460
it wouldn't have remained a secret all this time.

298
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,650
If you don't even have any ideas,

299
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,150
then we really can't find it.

300
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,790
The legend you told me about also mentioned

301
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:45,130
that Mount Dansui is where many of Dongxia's rivers originate,

302
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,280
so perhaps we can look for it by following the flow where the rivers converge.

303
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,530
That way, maybe we'll get a clue.

304
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,480
I've looked through the geography records of Dongxia.

305
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,000
This likely used to be a big and deep river,

306
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,910
but now, it has become a creek.

307
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,750
Back then, the collapse of the Fengshan Altar

308
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,950
must have caused damage to the mountain, leading to this change.

309
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,490
The water of these rivers probably flowed through some crevices

310
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,840
into one of the underground caves,

311
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,790
So, if we find where the water disappears,

312
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,280
we might be able to find a way in.

313
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,070
There's no more path.

314
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,190
Could the entrance be here?

315
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,350
The turquoise river of stars...

316
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,530
Is the world of ghost soldiers.

317
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,970
This shrine was probably built by the order of the ninth queen of Dongxia,

318
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,800
Minglv Huda.

319
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,590
She was my maternal grandmother, yet I never met her.

320
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:55,680
Dongxia relied on the Gui Seal to defeat enemies stronger than them.

321
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,450
In the end, the Gui Seal disappeared,

322
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,140
and that's why they lost at the hands of Zhuang Luyin.

323
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,820
Legend has it that Queen Minglv Huda sacrificed her life

324
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,400
and used the Gui Seal to bring forth ghost soldiers.

325
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,250
Do you think ghost soldiers really exist?

326
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,790
I don't believe there are ghosts in this world.

327
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,510
Legends about ghosts are just a way for people

328
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,860
to express their anger at the injustices of the world

329
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,150
and their desire for moral justice,

330
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,160
but I don't understand what ghost soldiers are

331
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,980
and how they were summoned by the Gui Seal.

332
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,010
Zang Hai.

333
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,830
Someone did come here.

334
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,040
It must have been my father.

335
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,080
Now, we are the ones who have come,

336
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,350
where it all began.

337
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,590
Now that I've made the same choice as my father,

338
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:27,040
it's time to finish what he could not.

339
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,860
What are those?

340
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,590
Zang Hai.

341
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,670
Are these...?

342
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,450
Watch out.

343
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,510
Antu, look at that.

344
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,800
These are Dongxia uniforms.

345
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,190
That's right.

346
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,550
They're Dongxia's soldiers.

347
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,880
Why are they here?

348
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,000
Did they suffer something before they died?

349
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,860
Maybe the truth is out there.

350
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,520
Light the lamp.

351
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,050
Zang Hai.

352
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,560
Someone died here.

353
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,840
Who could he be?

354
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,705
   

355
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,580
What is written in this manuscript seems to be what happened in that year.

356
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,700
In the 35th year of Wuhe, Great Yong's army crushed Dongxia.

357
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,250
Dongxia's army was defeated, and many of its strongholds were lost.

358
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,530
The capital city was about to fall.

359
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,510
At the time when Queen Minglv Huda faced peril and despair,

360
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,220
a strategist named Zhang Mie advised her

361
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,660
that she may be able to follow the example of Dongxia's first queen

362
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,800
and use the Gui Seal to repel the enemy army.

363
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,470
At this point, Dongxia was already facing total destruction.

364
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:21,130
After much hesitation, the Queen sent Zhang Mie to enter Mount Dansui.

365
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,130
Zhang Mie, who was well-versed in geomancy,

366
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,520
successfully retrieved the Gui Seal from the relics left behind by Queen Fu Xian.

367
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,330
This was the battle that decided the survival of Dongxia.

368
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,220
The Queen summoned 30,000 soldiers to the front line

369
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,200
and held a sacrificial ceremony in front of the army.

370
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,770
As she offered wine, she told the crowd that she had prayed to the heavens

371
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,010
to send ghost soldiers for vengeance.

372
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,340
On the battlefield, the soldiers beat war drums and shouted,

373
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,720
"Ghost soldiers will come. Great Yong will be defeated."

374
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,900
But the ghost soldiers did not come.

375
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,530
It turned out that the Gui Seal contained a rare poison.

376
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,165
Zhang Mie soaked the Gui Seal with his own blood

377
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:12,390
and poured the poison from the Gui Seal into the wine.

378
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,950
The soldiers who drank the poisoned wine

379
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,140
realized that they could no longer feel pain,

380
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,850
and their wounds were healing rapidly.

381
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:26,060
The army was invincible and won every battle after that.

382
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,480
Swifter than the beacon fires were the rumors spread.

383
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,720
Everyone believed that these soldiers, who needed no food or bandages,

384
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,590
were ghost soldiers who fell from the sky.

385
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,610
Dongxia's army continued to move south

386
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,630
and captured several cities of Great Yong.

387
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,080
They were about to capture Dancheng,

388
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,780
which was an important gateway to the capital region.

389
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,480
Once it was captured, Dongxia would be able to rush right into the capital,

390
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,390
but Queen Minglv Huda realized

391
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,230
that the soldiers who had been turned into ghost soldiers would gradually become delirious

392
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,850
and unable to distinguish between enemies and friends.

393
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,560
They could only kill brutally.

394
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,990
As a descendant of the Lady of Kunlun,

395
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,740
in order to stop them from wreaking more havoc,

396
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,820
the Queen used her royal blood to neutralize the Gui Seal's poison.

397
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,910
After exhausting her life,

398
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,570
she finally stopped the Gui Seal.

399
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,260
From Dongxia came the sad news of the Queen's death,

400
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,400
and the military's morale collapsed as a result.

401
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,220
Before her death, the Queen left her dying instructions,

402
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,330
ordering Zhang Mie to build a shrine

403
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,950
to seal away the Gui Seal and the ghost soldiers forever.

404
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,620
No one would ever be able to open it.

405
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,030
So, this is the truth about ghost soldiers.

406
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,490
Turns out Dongxia's royal blood was not used to open the Gui Seal

407
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,340
but to stop it.

408
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,850
This booklet proves that.

409
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,460
There's movement over there.

410
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,370
How can...

411
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,310
Be careful!

412
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,400
There's no wind from their sword swings.

413
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,010
Antu.

414
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,210
It's all an illusion.

415
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,670
These ghost soldiers are fake.

416
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,190
So, what we just saw was...

417
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:57,040
The murals here are brightly colored and have a special smell.

418
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,590
Maybe Zhang Mie added something to the paint

419
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,650
to prevent the Gui Seal's theft and induce hallucinations.

420
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,840
We can't stay here any longer.

421
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,190
Let's go now. Come on!

422
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,000
What did you find here?

423
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,410
Is it something to do with the Gui Seal?

424
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,230
Have you been following us?

425
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,400
Did you really think I'd let you go?

426
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,040
If you stop, I will tell you everything.

427
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,150
There's something you've been misunderstanding about me.

428
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,980
I'm not like my father.

429
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,610
I'm not the least bit interested in the Gui Seal.

430
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,760
Just tell Official Zhao everything you know.

431
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:16,100



432
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:22,170
