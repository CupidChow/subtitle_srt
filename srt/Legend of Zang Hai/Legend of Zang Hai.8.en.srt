[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,740
Go on.

4
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,330
How do you want to die?

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,930
My Lord...

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,290
I'd rather not die yet.

7
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,930
You pulled this off

8
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,540
right in front of all the officials.

9
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,340
Don't you realize

10
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,130
you're a dead man walking?

11
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,340
I was born poor,

12
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,890
with no one to rely on.

13
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,730
If I muddle through life in ignorance,

14
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,380
would it even matter,

15
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,500
living or dying?

16
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,170
But I'm not without value,

17
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,850
so I chose to take a chance.

18
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,540
What I'm betting on

19
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,410
is this very moment.

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,540
But this moment won't last long.

21
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,780
Once the carriage stops,

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,450
I'll kill you.

23
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,340
So if you have any last words,

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,170
say it now while you still can.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,940
I know well

26
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,610
you're a man of the battlefield,

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,410
bathed in blood.

28
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,690
A warrior used to life and death

29
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,610
won't believe

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,450
that today's events

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,540
have anything to do with fate.

32
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,130
But I...

33
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,290
I just wasn't meant to end today.

34
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,100
You're a master of geomancy.

35
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,010
Digging yourself

36
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,890
a way out

37
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,980
should be easy.

38
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,820
But instead, you boldly walked out

39
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,340
of the royal tomb.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,260
You want to force me

41
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,100
to release you

42
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,220
right under everyone's nose?

43
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,380
You want the world to see

44
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,570
that your life was spared by fate?

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,940
Escaping was never hard for me.

46
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,940
I admit that.

47
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,010
But it would've meant

48
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,100
never showing my face

49
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,380
as myself again.

50
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,380
It was thanks to your favor

51
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,380
that I finally left behind

52
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,260
the days of having nothing.

53
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,980
If I still wish to serve you,

54
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,730
then I need

55
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,060
a clean and honest identity.

56
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,050
Besides...

57
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,370
I'm still human.

58
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,370
If someone's plotting to kill me,

59
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,100
I can't just sit back and wait to die.

60
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,250
Even if it costs me my life,

61
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,850
I must ask you for justice.

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,290
Justice?

63
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,540
Zang Hai,

64
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,700
I've seen your geomancy skills

65
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,610
with my own eyes.

66
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,250
But now,

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,540
it seems your silver tongue

68
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,610
is even more impressive.

69
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,580
You keep claiming

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,290
you owe everything to me,

71
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,900
yet you've cornered me

72
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,020
into sacrificing a valuable man

73
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,700
to resolve today's mess,

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,540
at the cost of my reputation!

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,810
Don't you deserve to die?

76
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,370
I believe I did nothing wrong today,

77
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,020
because I know

78
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,850
you've had enough

79
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,700
of useless men!

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,930
So you're saying

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,730
my top aide

82
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,610
is worthless?

83
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,850
You're a hero among men.

84
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,170
It's only natural

85
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,580
that those beside you aren't fools.

86
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,810
But virtue guides talent.

87
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,900
If they can't stay loyal

88
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,700
to you

89
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,930
and know their place,

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,850
aren't they just as useless?

91
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,580
Go on.

92
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,050
Mr. Yang

93
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,100
is narrow-minded and petty.

94
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,170
Not only does he fail to recruit talent for you,

95
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,050
he actively drives capable people away.

96
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,660
I'm sure

97
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,220
many talented men have entered your household before,

98
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,370
but in the end,

99
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,580
none of them ever made it close to you.

100
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,100
The ones who stayed

101
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,170
were nothing but useless.

102
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,460
If it were just exclusion,

103
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,220
that'd be one thing.

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,540
But these people...

105
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,050
they abuse your name,

106
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,540
flatter the powerful and bully the weak.

107
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,930
They'll bring disaster to your house.

108
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,580
What disaster?

109
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,660
You've achieved great merit,

110
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,050
yet kept a low profile

111
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,850
all these years.

112
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,460
Still,

113
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,540
some people use your name

114
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,220
to throw their weight around.

115
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,410
Who knows how many hidden enemies they've made?

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,250
The only reason your house

117
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,580
has remained safe

118
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,850
is because you're here.

119
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,810
Throwing my weight around

120
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,220
has always been my style.

121
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,810
They've only picked up a few tricks.

122
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,850
But as long as they're loyal to me,

123
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,020
so what if they get

124
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,850
a little out of hand?

125
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,700
The real danger

126
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,460
is those who obey you to your face

127
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,220
but forget their place

128
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,250
behind your back.

129
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,170
They get so used to it.

130
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,140
They start mistaking their own will

131
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,900
for yours.

132
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,780
Just like today,

133
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,660
before you even gave the order,

134
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,850
Mr. Qu acted on his own and shot Yang Zhen.

135
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,220
Even if it was with your best interest in mind,

136
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,900
he still crossed the line.

137
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,170
If you don't believe me,

138
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,610
just wait and see:

139
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,700
whether Mr. Qu

140
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,980
once again

141
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,700
decides my life or death

142
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,410
on your behalf.

143
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,650
Get out.

144
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,850
Why are we stopping at the back gate?

145
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,820
It's quieter here,

146
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,770
easier to get things done.

147
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,130
Zang Hai,

148
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,060
any last words?

149
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,010
My life

150
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,730
is in your hands.

151
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,820
My Lord!

152
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,300
Get a doctor to treat his wounds.

153
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,980
Tell Chu Huaiming

154
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,610
to revise the roster.

155
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,180
Remove Zang Hai's official title.

156
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,180
Report Yang Zhen's birth date and time,

157
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,770
say that Senior Secretary Yang Zhen

158
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,010
volunteered for a tomb sacrifice.

159
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,650
My Lord,

160
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,940
Zang Hai's ambition is dangerous.

161
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,700
He's uncontrollable.

162
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,300
We should kill him!

163
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,530
Are you saying

164
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,980
"I" can't control him?

165
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,610
Or that "you" can't?

166
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,340
[Scholar Hall]

167
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,300
Thank you, Doctor.

168
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,130
No trouble at all.

169
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,940
Just pay me extra.

170
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,610
Careful.

171
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,340
Here.

172
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,770
Master!

173
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,610
What are you doing here?

174
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,850
I was worried about you!

175
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,730
Don't worry.

176
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,980
I've settled everything with the clinic.

177
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,700
Today,

178
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,370
I came as a doctor,

179
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,460
properly invited!

180
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,580
Forgive me if my skills are limited.

181
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,580
Let me take a look now.

182
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,730
Master...

183
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,250
If you'd been half a minute later,

184
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,340
I wouldn't have made it

185
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,420
out of the royal tomb today.

186
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,010
Well, I'm getting old.

187
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,490
You offended Yang Zhen.

188
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,300
Now they are coming for you.

189
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,820
You have to accept the challenge.

190
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,650
But they are craving for your blood!

191
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,610
I want them

192
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,340
to strike first.

193
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,980
The moment they do,

194
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,300
they'll expose themselves.

195
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,820
Only then will I have a chance to turn the tide.

196
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,940
Master,

197
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,100
please help me with two things.

198
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,630
[Xiaocang River]

199
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,370
Follow the Xiaocang River upstream.

200
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,010
You'll find

201
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,220
an old flood-control dam from the former dynasty.

202
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,300
No one guards it.

203
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,890
Back when the You River changed course,

204
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,700
its branch, the Xiaocang River,

205
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,010
formed a hidden underground channel.

206
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,850
[Royal Tomb, Xiaocang River]
It runs right beneath the tomb.

207
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,890
The Dragon-Cracking Stone

208
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,060
is powered by water pressure.

209
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,940
I'll use that channel

210
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,420
to divert Xiaocang River's water

211
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,060
into the tomb's reservoir.

212
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,850
On the day of the Empress Dowager's burial,

213
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,130
you'll wait at the dam.

214
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,460
Bow!

215
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,890
The bell tolls

216
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,340
after each stage of the funeral.

217
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,700
At the sixth toll,

218
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,580
be ready.

219
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,940
Release the Dragon-Cracking Stone!

220
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,130
After the ninth toll

221
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,100
following the release,

222
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,650
shut the floodgate at once.

223
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,850
The water in the channel will drop,

224
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,100
and the stone will stop.

225
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,490
Then,

226
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,730
light incense to count the time.

227
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,220
As for me,

228
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,460
I'll find a way

229
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,820
to walk out from the tomb.

230
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,220
Zang Hai?

231
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,650
How did you get out?

232
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,420
The Dragon-Cracking Stone stopped falling.

233
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,530
What trick did you pull?

234
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,460
I didn't pull any trick.

235
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,980
I just wasn't fated to die today!

236
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,890
As long as I walk out alive,

237
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,010
it'll fall on its own!

238
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,700
I want every official present to believe

239
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,980
that the moment Yang Zhen steps into the tomb,

240
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,060
the stone will fall.

241
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,100
At the same time,

242
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,100
I'll stall for as long as I can,

243
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,490
until the incense burns out.

244
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,100
Mr. Chu once told me,

245
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,730
to appease the spirit of the late Emperor,

246
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,940
someone whose birth characters

247
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,770
match His Majesty's

248
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,370
must stay in the tomb forever.

249
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,460
Who would that be?

250
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,100
Yang Zhen!

251
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,130
Nonsense!

252
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,130
Once the incense burns out,

253
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,650
open the floodgate immediately.

254
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,770
Hai...

255
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,890
May the heavens help you.

256
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,490
My Lord!

257
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,220
The hour has passed.

258
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,890
My life means nothing.

259
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,100
It's no big deal.

260
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,300
But if I drag others down with me,

261
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,060
I'll never be forgiven!

262
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,850
And right now,

263
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,770
this is the most critical moment.

264
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,650
I bet the Marquis of Pingjin

265
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,890
won't be able to withstand the pressure

266
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,890
and will let Yang Zhen enter the tomb.

267
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,010
My Lord,

268
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,370
he's trying to drag me

269
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,460
to the grave with him!

270
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,730
Bless my disciple.

271
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,940
May he come through safe and sound.

272
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,490
It hasn't moved!

273
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,340
Still hasn't moved!

274
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,300
My Lord,

275
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,340
he's lying!

276
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,580
How could that be?

277
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,900
After all this,

278
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,770
you've gotten rid of Yang Zhen

279
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,460
and gained the Marquis's favor.

280
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,730
Hai,

281
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,420
all your suffering wasn't in vain.

282
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,380
But this isn't over yet.

283
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,050
We still have another hurdle to cross.

284
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,140
I knew it.

285
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,530
The tomb incident

286
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,570
wouldn't blow over that easily.

287
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,090
It's only been a few hours,

288
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,940
and the Imperial Inspector

289
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,620
already submitted their memorials.

290
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,140
If word hadn't gotten out from the palace,

291
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,330
I might've been blindsided

292
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,140
in court tomorrow.

293
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,700
They actually dared accuse you

294
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,380
of letting Qu Jiao kill someone in the royal tomb!

295
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,900
These old fools

296
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,700
are just unbearable.

297
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,330
We must figure out a way

298
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,490
to shut their mouths.

299
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,180
How?

300
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,620
Qu Jiao acted

301
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,050
right in front of everyone.

302
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,330
It's easy to silence one voice,

303
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,810
but how do you silence a hundred?

304
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,290
The more you try to stop them,

305
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,140
the louder they get!

306
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,810
Those fools know nothing!

307
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,380
All they want

308
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,810
is an explanation.

309
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,700
If we can't silence them,

310
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,010
then maybe we should

311
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,980
just hand someone over.

312
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,180
You want me to turn Qu Jiao in?

313
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,900
He's been by your side for years,

314
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,980
loyal to the bone.

315
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,810
How could I send him to his death?

316
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,530
This all started

317
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,180
because of Zang Hai.

318
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,010
If it weren't for him,

319
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,180
Yang Zhen would still be alive.

320
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,090
The tomb matter is settled.

321
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,420
Let's not bring it up again.

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,530
Or how about this?

323
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,220
Kill Zang Hai,

324
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,660
scar his face,

325
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,050
and hand him over as Qu Jiao.

326
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,250
That man

327
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,980
is too cunning by nature.

328
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,140
Keeping him near you

329
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,050
only spells future trouble.

330
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,700
Father,

331
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,620
time's running out.

332
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,570
You'd better head out first.

333
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,860
Okay.

334
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,980
In your opinion,

335
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,010
what will the Marquis do?

336
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,490
I think

337
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,380
he actually listened to me today.

338
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,380
Master, don't worry too much.

339
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,700
Why are you so sure?

340
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,090
The Marquis is a man of war.

341
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,810
Everything he has now

342
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,900
was earned through strength.

343
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,220
He knows better than anyone

344
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,220
how dangerous soldiers can be.

345
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,860
We've done what we can.

346
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,700
The rest is up to fate.

347
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,490
Master,

348
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,530
you're actually saying that?

349
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,620
That doesn't sound like you.

350
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,570
Didn't you just tell me

351
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,620
not to worry too much?

352
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,810
I trust you.

353
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,980
I'll take my leave.

Greetings, Young Master.

What's going on?

358
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,250
The Marquis ordered

359
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,570
that no one in the household

360
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,900
is to leave for three days.

361
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,330
Did something happen?

362
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,660
Mr. Qu...

363
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,050
he died suddenly last night.

[Yu Garden]
Starting today,

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,460
you are officially the senior secretary.

Your monthly salary

367
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,900
is twenty taels.

368

Also,

369
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,980
you won't stay in the Scholar Hall anymore.

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,460
You'll live in the inner gardens.

The Marquis

372
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,250
personally chose this place for you.

373
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,700
It's right next to his own quarters,

These servants

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,180
all for your personal use.

385
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,220
Do they meet

386
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,220
your satisfaction?

387
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,290
Please thank the Marquis on my behalf.

388
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,490
You may all go.

389
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,620
Yang Zhen,

390
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,900
even at his peak,

391
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,220
was never allowed to live

392
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,420
in the inner gardens.

393
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,980
The Marquis

394
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,420
also wants you to join him for dinner tonight.

395
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,860
Understood.

396
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,700
I'll take my leave.

397
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,860
Sir, please.

398
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,460
My Lord.

399
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,220
My Lady.

400
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,490
No need to be so formal.

401
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,570
Have a seat.

402
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,180
Zang Hai,

403
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,980
you've worked hard these past few months.

404
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,380
Thank you for your efforts.

405
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,220
Here,

406
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,730
this drink

407
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,940
is for you.

408
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,380
You flatter me, Young Master.

409
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,530
I just lent a bit of muscle,

410
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,220
and carried out

411
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,330
the orders

412
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,220
of you and My Lord.

413
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,700
As the Marquis's aide,

414
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,420
if Zhifu ever needs guidance,

415
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,700
I hope you'll offer it generously.

416
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,330
I wouldn't dare call it guidance.

417
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,770
But if Young Master ever needs my help,

418
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,660
I'll give it my all.

419
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,180
Zang Hai,

420
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,420
I've given it serious thought.

421
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,620
Those aides

422
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,860
Yang Zhen left behind

423
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,570
are all useless.

424
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,810
So I've decided to send them away.

425
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,420
What do you think?

426
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,180
You honor me, My Lord.

427
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,330
I serve at your pleasure.

428
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,460
My life or death

429
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,620
is in your hands.

430
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,050
Your word is final.

431
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,250
Zhuang Shan.

432
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,140
Yes, My Lord?

433
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,770
Keep a few

434
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,940
of the old, trusted ones.

435
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,090
Let the rest go.

436
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,250
Yes, My Lord.

437
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,570
Sit.

438
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,180
In a few days,

439
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,570
it's my late father's death anniversary.

440
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,660
We'll hold a family ceremony here first,

441
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,620
then visit his tomb.

442
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,860
Be sure to prepare accordingly.

443
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,420
My Lord,

444
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,620
this is an important family rite.

445
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,380
I'm still new here,

446
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,290
I dare not make decisions on my own.

447
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,530
If you're seated at this table,

448
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,940
you're someone

449
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,460
I trust the most.

450
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,140
Letting you handle family matters

451
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,940
is already beneath your talents.

452
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,980
Whatever concerns Your Lordship

453
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,940
is my top priority.

454
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,490
I will serve you

455
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,940
with all I've got.

456
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,090
Enough talking.

457
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,140
Drink!

458
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,090
This incident

459
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,620
turned out to be a close call.

460
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,810
Father,

461
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,570
Zang Hai really figured out

462
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,770
what the Emperor wanted.

463
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,220
The inspectors stopped submitting complaints.

464
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,570
And His Majesty

465
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,980
even commended you

466
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,570
for handling the funeral properly.

467
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,810
But Zang Hai

468
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,660
is way too calculating.

469
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,860
Keeping him near you

470
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,730
makes me uneasy.

471
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,620
The Capital's a huge place.

472
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,530
It's not like

473
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,620
we can't find another strategist.

474
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,460
Better to raise one wolf

475
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,530
than feed

476
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,220
a pen full of pigs.

477
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,180
You're right.

478
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,620
As long as you're the backbone here,

479
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,290
we can handle any kind of servant.

480
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,620
I may hold a respected post at court,

481
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,860
advising the Emperor,

482
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,860
but I'm not the same man

483
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,460
who once commanded troops on the frontier.

484
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,050
Your grandfather has retired.

485
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,180
He's no longer involved in politics.

486
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,250
Zhifu,

487
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,420
you must carry the future

488
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,770
of the Zhuang family on your shoulders.

489
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,700
With your trust behind me,

490
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,010
I, Zhifu,

491
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,330
won't let you down.

492
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,420
I'll help you climb higher

493
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,250
in the court.

494
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,380
Ideally, get a good post

495
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,140
in the Ministry of Personnel.

496
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,380
Then work your way into the Cabinet.

497
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,900
But before that,

498
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,860
you'll need someone by your side,

499
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,380
someone who can advise you.

500
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,180
And Zang Hai

501
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,810
is the one

502
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,900
I've chosen for you.

503
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,940
But is Zang Hai

504
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,330
truly willing

505
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,660
to serve me loyally?

506
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,090
That's still unclear.

507
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,900
Those born to aid kings

508
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,660
are often strong-willed.

509
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,570
What matters

510
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,050
is how you tame them.

511
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,250
If he gets disobedient,

512
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,770
just crush his kneecaps.

513
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,250
A cripple

514
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,050
won't dream of climbing higher.

515
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,700
Right now he's just settled in.

516
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,090
You have to make him feel

517
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,330
like he has a bright future.

518
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,980
Only then will he give his all.

519
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,770
I'll smooth out

520
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,050
his rough edges

521
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,420
before handing him over to you.

522
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,860
Just remember:

523
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,420
the honor of the Zhuang family

524
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,090
must not be tarnished.

525
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,570
Understood, Father.

526
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,420
Chu Huaiming's work

527
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,860
is getting sloppier by the day.

528
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,730
All these years,

529
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,380
he's accomplished little,

530
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,730
except for being an expert

531
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,290
at slacking off.

532
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,730
Zhuang Shan!

533
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,530
My Lord.

534
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,770
Give all these to Zang Hai.

535
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,330
Chu's not the only one

536
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,140
who understands this stuff anymore.

537
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,090
Yes, My Lord.

Sir,

546
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,180
I'm looking

547
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,180
for some geomantic manuals:

548
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,330
the "Secret Verses of the Green Satchel,"

549
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,250
the "Classic of Dragon Veins,"

550
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,330
and also the "Cloud Peak Notes."

come here!

553
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,290
Sir.

554
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,530
Take this gentleman

555
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,330
to the storeroom.

556
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,010
Of course.

557
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,180
Right this way.

558
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,940
Browse freely, sir.

559
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,570
I'll go greet another guest.

560
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,530
Thank you.

561
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,660
Sir,

562
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,250
the books you're asking for are rare editions.

563
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,490
They're quite pricey.

564
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,460
You might end up spending a lot.

565
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,860
I'm the Marquis's

566
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,460
top aide now.

567
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,810
Who'd dare say I can't afford it?

568
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,460
Good boy.

569
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,180
I didn't raise you for nothing.

570
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,220
Master,

571
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,330
this is everything I've got.

572
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,380
So you brought it all here

573
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,180
just to show off?

574
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,700
Nothing for me, huh?

575
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,330
Master,

576
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,860
please go easy on me.

577
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,810
I haven't even received this month's pay.

578
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,180
Look at you, so stingy.

579
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,660
How about this?

580
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,860
The Marquis has a ton of treasures.

581
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,330
Just sneak out a piece or two

582
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,730
every now and then.

583
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,620
He'll never know.

584
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,330
Let's clean him out,

585
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,220
bleed him dry,

586
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,290
and call it payback.

587
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,050
You may go alone.

588
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,770
Don't drag me into it.

589
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:44,940
You...

590
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,420
Sit.

591
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,810
I heard the Marquis

592
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,900
just dismissed

593
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,620
most of his aides.

594
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,250
He's acting so extreme,

595
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,810
but it's not without reason.

596
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,460
Back then, he killed all fourteen members

597
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,220
of my family

598
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,290
without even blinking.

599
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,900
Now he's started giving me

600
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,570
some geomancy tasks.

601
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,770
Those must've belonged

602
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,570
to Chu Huaiming before.

603
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,420
That must be driving Chu mad.

604
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,460
What kind of tasks?

605
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,140
Surveying mountain terrain near the Capital

606
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,330
and analyzing blueprints

607
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:14,980
of ancient city buildings.

608
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,180
It's probably all to support Zhuang Zhifu.

609
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:19,860
That's good.

610
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,620
It shows he trusts you.

611
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,220
Getting close to him is easier now.

612
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,460
But Hai,

613
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,810
you need to know something.

614
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,770
If the Marquis dies in his own estate,

615
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,220
and the Court of Judicial Review steps in,

616
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,770
you'll be in deep trouble.

617
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,570
We need

618
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,620
a foolproof plan.

619
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,810
Whether he dies of illness or by accident,

620
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,730
you must walk away clean.

621
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,900
Going down with the ship

622
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,290
isn't how people

623
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,330
like us survive.

624
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,250
One step at a time.

625
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,810
If it were really that easy

626
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,660
to kill him,

627
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,730
you wouldn't have raised me for ten years.

628
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,420
I need to go.

629
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,010
I just became an aide.

630
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,980
I can't be away too long.

631
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,180
If I need anything,

632
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,420
I'll come back here.

633
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:09,610
All right.

634
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,530
Hai...

635
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,820
Your status has changed.

636
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,210
Good and bad things will both come knocking.

637
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,460
Be careful.

638
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,740
Don't worry, Master.

639
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,340
Oh, and Hai...

640
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,130
Here are the books you asked for.

641
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,690
Don't forget to pay.

642
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,900
Master, you...

643
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,050
Finish the act. Go ahead.

644
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:38,820
Go on.

645
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,090
Sir,

646
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,090
I want one bowl of wontons,

647
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,860
and a plate of tofu skin.

648
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,780
Sure! Just a moment.

649
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,130
Sir,

650
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,130
I'm really sorry.

651
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,380
We're out of wontons.

652
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,340
Maybe try somewhere else?

653
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,090
Aren't there still some over there?

654
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,490
Yes,

655
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,530
but this young sir ordered them all.

656
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,900
All right, I'll eat somewhere else.

657
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,010
Apologies again!

658
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,570
Nowhere else has them either, Mr. Zang.

659
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,490
Wherever you go,

660
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,420
I've bought them all out.

661
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,130
Do I know you?

662
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,610
Please don't misunderstand, sir.

663
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,090
I didn't mean to make things difficult.

664
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,380
But my master

665
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,740
has prepared a banquet

666
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,740
and want to meet with you.

667
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,340
Who is your master?

668
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,340
The owner of Zhen Tower.

669
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,900
My master also said

670
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,690
you're unmatched in wit

671
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,570
and foresight.

672
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,860
So you're sure to come.

673
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,460
Lead the way.

674
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,050
This way, sir.

675
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,300
[Zhen Tower]

676
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,090
This way, sir.

677
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,690
I'll wait for you downstairs.

678
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,500
[Liutao Pavilion]

679
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,610
Mr. Zang's name echoes through the Capital.

680
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,460
Seeing you today,

681
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,980
you truly live up to the praise!

682
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,300
I am Xu Ben,

683
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,050
the owner of Zhen Tower here.

684
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,780
Please forgive me

685
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,980
for inviting you so suddenly.

686
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,010
No need for formalities, Mr. Xu.

687
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,490
You're the impressive one here.

688
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,690
You may not know this,

689
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,650
but I have quite the connection with Zhen Tower.

690
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,740
On my very first day in the Capital,

691
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,860
I came here

692
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,570
and watched a wonderful show.

693
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,650
Just a small act from my men.

694
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,780
Glad you enjoyed it.

695
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:05,860
Please, sir.

696
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,530
Please.

697
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:06,860
Please.

698
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,340
Please.

699
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,610
Sir,

700
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,090
you must try our aged Autumn Dew wine

701
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,260
from Shandong.

702
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,650
Please, enjoy.

703
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,740
A toast to you.

704
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,740
Cheers.

705
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,980
That's fine wine!

706
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,460
And try this,

707
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,050
our signature dishes.

708
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,690
You won't find them

709
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,780
outside the Capital.

710
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,420
And definitely not

711
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,090
where you were before.

712
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,650
So, Mr. Xu,

713
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,740
why have you

714
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,980
invited me today?

715
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,900
I simply hope to make friends

716
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,530
with you.

717
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,780
You flatter me.

718
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,090
With a royal gilf plaque

719
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,570
on your wall

720
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,170
and gold flowing in,

721
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,780
surely you're not lacking

722
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,090
a friend like me.

723
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,940
You've only been in the Capital three months,

724
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,380
and already you're the talk of the town.

725
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,650
Wealth always follows fame.

726
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,090
Now that you're well-known,

727
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,610
riches will

728
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,170
come knocking.

729
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,900
These are nothing special.

730
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,010
Just a little gift to mark our meeting.

731
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,740
If you accept it,

732
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,820
consider me your friend from now on.

733
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,900
Mr. Xu,

734
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,690
I've never seen

735
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,900
so many jewels

736
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,090
in my life!

737
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,260
You're working at the Marquis's mansion now.

738
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,610
You'll need money

739
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,980
handling all kinds of affairs.

740
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,530
If there's anything you need,

741
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:44,980
just say the word.

742
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,420
I'm the kind of guy

743
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,010
who loves helping friends.

744
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,490
Just one word from you,

745
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,300
and your problem will become mine.

746
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,900
Please, sir.

747
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,740
Mr. Xu, you're too kind.

748
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,210
I do have

749
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,380
a few small favors to ask.

750
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,690
And I hope

751
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,740
you'll consider them.

752
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,210
Of course. Go ahead.

753
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,740
As I said earlier,

754
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,130
on my first day in the Capital,

755
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,260
I watched a play at Zhen Tower.

756
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,860
By chance, I landed the Vermilion Bird Head (VIP) seat.

757
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,420
But I was broke at the time.

758
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,490
Luckily, Miss Xiang over there

759
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,490
helped me out.

760
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,570
Looking back now,

761
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,980
that seat really

762
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,050
is the best one in the house.

763
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,490
So I was wondering,

764
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,780
could I have that seat again

765
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,690
on the first and fifteenth of every month

766
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,570
to enjoy the shows with the VIP treatment?

767
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,420
If that's what you want,

768
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,130
the seat is yours.

769
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,130
As for the VIP treatment...

770
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,900
well...

771
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,940
I suppose it can be arranged.

772
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,860
You're new in the Capital

773
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,170
and trying to expand your circle.

774
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,260
That seat is perfect for making connections.

775
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,690
Mr. Xu, you're too generous!

776
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,780
Come on, please.

777
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,340
What we just discussed was personal.

778
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,260
Now I have an official matter to bring up.

779
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,780
Go ahead, sir.

780
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,900
It's a bit embarrassing...

781
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,610
Young Master Zhuang pawned off

782
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,820
quite a few treasures

783
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,090
here at Zhen Tower.

784
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,820
Some of them were spoils

785
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,820
from the Marquis's campaigns.

786
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,010
Now that I manage the estate treasury,

787
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,340
I'm afraid

788
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,380
if the Marquis suddenly asks,

789
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:25,780
I...

790
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,530
I'll have no answer for him.

791
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,610
So I'd like

792
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,010
to quietly redeem those items.

793
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,610
But I'm short on funds at the moment.

794
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,820
Mr. Xu,

795
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,340
could you figure out

796
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,300
a middle-ground solution?

797
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,570
Every treasure

798
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,340
Young Master pawned

799
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,860
is still sealed in our storeroom.

800
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,420
So,

801
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,530
I'll send someone to gather them

802
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,650
and return them to you,

803
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,050
no charge.

804
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,130
Mr. Xu, you truly are generous.

805
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,090
I'll drink to that!

806
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:04,980
Cheers.

807
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,610
Ah, Mr. Xu, apologies...

808
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,820
Sorry.

809
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,530
Looks like you can't hold your liquor.

810
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,900
You'd better come by more often

811
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,260
build that tolerance.

812
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,260
Yes,

813
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,740
you're absolutely right.

814
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,690
Actually, Mr. Xu,

815
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,010
there's something else...

816
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:33,570
Enough!

817
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,460
Stop acting.

818
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,650
He's already figured it out.

819
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,980
How'd you know

820
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,340
he's not the real owner of Zhen Tower?

821
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,210
What kind of boss

822
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,900
takes cues from his own man?

823
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,860
The seat is yours.

824
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,690
As for the VIP treatment...

825
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,490
I suppose it can be arranged.

826
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,050
This cup

827
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,010
is worth a fortune, right?

828
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,420
Just now, when I made

829
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,860
those unreasonable requests,

830
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,340
Mr. Xu got all hesitant.

831
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,490
And he was nervous

832
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,460
about this cup.

833
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,570
Plus, look at the calluses

834
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,340
on his fingertips.

835
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,570
If I'm not wrong,

836
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,460
he's actually

837
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,940
your bookkeeper.

838
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,420
Now I can't tell if he's dumb

839
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,570
or you're just too clever.

840
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,690
I figured it out

841
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,650
just because

842
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,820
you wanted me to.

843
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,460
And now that

844
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,690
you've shown your hand,

845
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,610
I assume you're not worried about money,

846
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,130
but have something real to say to me.

847
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,610
Let's go somewhere else to talk.
