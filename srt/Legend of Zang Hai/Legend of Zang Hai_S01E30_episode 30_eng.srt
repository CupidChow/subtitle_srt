1
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:16,820



2
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,753
   

4
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,490
Your Majesty, this place is an empty tomb.

5
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,500
Where is she?

6
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,280
She's right in there.

7
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,680
The switch for the passageway is right there.

8
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,580
Go ahead.

9
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,660
Find another entrance.

10
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,070
Come and eat.

11
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,730
Where is Zang Hai?

12
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,420
He... has work to do.

13
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,660
He went to my mother?

14
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,630
He went to kill my mother? Didn't he?

15
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,270
Just spare me the questions.

16
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,670
All right.

17
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:56,600
Let my mother and I die with him and his child on this very day.

18
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,240
What do you mean?

19
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,160
You're a physician.

20
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,710
Can't you tell I'm pregnant?

21
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,830
No way.

22
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,510
Xiao Hai couldn't have...

23
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,780
Take my pulse if you don't believe me.

24
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,560
Deficient pulse filling.

25
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,410
No signs of fetal pulse.

26
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,270
You lied to me?

27
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,870
- But why are you... 
 - Why am I so powerful, huh?

28
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,920
The soup is mixed with Tendon-weakening Powder, isn't it?

29
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,270
What a pity that I threw them away these days.

30
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,600
I'm in a bad mood.

31
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,920
Tell me where Zang Hai is.

32
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,070
How dare you trick me?

33
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,240
Listen carefully.

34
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,510
Nobody from the Kuai family will be coerced.

35
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,740
I won't tell you where he is even if you kill me.

36
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,660
Your Majesty, be careful!

37
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,240
What do we do? They are blocked outside.

38
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,140
Keep going.

39
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,020
Why isn't it working?

40
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,240
Poisonous smoke.

41
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,120
Protect Her Majesty.

42
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,810
Go back.

43
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,510
Let's go.

44
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,200
Antu.

45
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,080
Where are you going?

46
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,270
Let him go.

47
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,600
We're the only ones here.

48
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,320
No one can beat you.

49
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,130
Besides, how would he know where Xiao Hai took your mother?

50
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,850
Where is he?

51
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,440
He is showing your mother around the capital.

52
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,250
How many people did he bring?

53
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,550
He went to see her alone.

54
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,180
If things go south, Gao Ming and Shi Lei will secretly cover him.

55
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,720
He's way too reckless.

56
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,270
How can the three of them handle the Queen of Dongxia?

57
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,380
Don't underestimate them.

58
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,320
Tell you what.

59
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,630
You thought he operated in the shadows,

60
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,000
while my mother stood in the light.

61
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,550
But she has known who he was all along.

62
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,870
She's well prepared.

63
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,080
His plan won't work.

64
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,850
No way. I don't believe you.

65
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,840
Tell me where he is.

66
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,950
I have to stop him.

67
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,630
But the revenge is his to take.

68
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,180
None of us can stop him, including you.

69
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,170
I'm afraid everything will come to an end today.

70
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,670
Sister Liu Chu,

71
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,780
please tell me where he is.

72
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,100
But it won't help even if you find him.

73
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,240
Your Majesty, the smoke dissipated as soon as we came out.

74
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,490
He just didn't want us to enter.

75
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,830
Your Majesty, be careful.

76
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,720
There were six lotuses on the wall of the first corridor.

77
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,730
And there were six of us.

78
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,000
Five lotuses in the second corridor.

79
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,910
There are five of us.

80
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,750
Stay here and wait.

81
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,300
The rest of you, follow me.

82
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,910
Your Majesty.

83
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,670
Let's go.

84
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,980
Only four lotuses left.

85
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,560
I think there are mechanisms under the entire passageway.

86
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,360
If more people enter than the number of lotuses,

87
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,120
the stone gates will remain sealed.

88
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,550
Zang Hai intends to break us up.

89
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,340
So, he wants to see me alone.

90
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,940
All of you, go back.

91
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,650
No, Your Majesty.

92
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,880
The smoke wasn't poisonous.

93
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,390
I don't think he wants to kill us.

94
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,790
- Your Majesty... 
 - Your Majesty...

95
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,480
Say no more.

96
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll enter alone.

97
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,630
- Understood. 
 - Understood.

98
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,790
The door has been locked.

99
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,420
It won't open from the inside ever again.

100
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,420
So, my daughter is not here.

101
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,850
She is somewhere safe.

102
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,510
Whose tomb is this?

103
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,910
It's the tomb of Princess Yong Ning,

104
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,240
the daughter of the late Emperor Zhen Zong.

105
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,240
Emperor Zhen Zong loved her very much.

106
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,870
But Princess Yong Ning died in a foreign land.

107
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,840
So, her tomb was abandoned before it was even completed.

108
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,930
I know her story.

109
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,530
She married the Khan far away from home

110
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,450
and had a son and a daughter with him.

111
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,720
They lived a happy life.

112
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
But it didn't last long.

113
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,340
The Khan's big brother, Chiwu Zhu, launched a coup and killed the Khan.

114
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,270
Princess Yong Ning and her children

115
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,620
were tied to wooden posts and burned to death.

116
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,870
Emperor Zhen Zong didn't have the power

117
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,740
to take down Chiwu Zhu once and for all,

118
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,690
so he bided his time.

119
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,340
Five years later, Emperor Zhen Zong led an army of 300,000 troops

120
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,150
to pacify the entire Mobei.

121
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,590
Chiwu Zhu was also tied to a wooden post and burned into charcoal.

122
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:27,510
All the murals here were hand-painted by Emperor Zhen Zong.

123
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:32,900
He did this to etch his daughter's death into his soul.

124
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,390
You didn't lure me here

125
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,800
just to tell me the story of Princess Yong Ning. Right?

126
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:46,200
The night when my whole family was killed,

127
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,010
what were you thinking while staring at the blazing fire?

128
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,410
You have a daughter, too.

129
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:01,080
If she were the one who died there, what would you have done?

130
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,960
Of course, I would have avenged her.

131
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,440
But remember.

132
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,550
If you kill me now,

133
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,170
you'll lose any chance with my daughter forever.

134
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,150
Using your daughter to get yourself out of trouble?

135
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,290
That isn't a great idea.

136
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,360
I'm not the kind of person you think.

137
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,360
Really?

138
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,090
Then, why did you paint over the murals here?

139
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,930
Were you scared that you would slowly forget to take revenge?

140
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,780
As people live on, their hatred will eventually wear out.

141
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,950
So, you kept repainting these to burn yourself with the flame of hatred.

142
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,930
You'd rather pause your life on that tragic night.

143
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,910
But time won't stop.

144
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,220
It will push you to keep going forward.

145
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,010
You'll meet someone who makes you feel for the first time

146
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,130
that there is a meaning to life apart from hatred.

147
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,610
But that pains you even more.

148
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,780
Because you will sense your hatred fading away.

149
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,200
So, you have to force yourself to give up all that

150
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,460
and continue to seek revenge.

151
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,700
Are you really going to kill me with that?

152
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,360
Look at the bags above your head.

153
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,550
They are filled with wheat flour.

154
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,790
Once I pull the rope, the wheat flour will pour out.

155
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,880
It's not easy to kill you with this arrow.

156
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,900
But it's really easy to set the chamber on fire with it.

157
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,210
I didn't expect you to set up such a trap.

158
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,960
You're surely Kuai Duo's son.

159
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,370
If you kill me, you will die, too.

160
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,900
Are you willing to die like this?

161
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,100
You keep talking because you are afraid of death.

162
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,440
The Queen of Dongxia turns out to be nothing extraordinary.

163
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,010
Zang Hai, you've worked hard.

164
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,880
But this is not a good decision.

165
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,960
Do you know what your decision will do to my daughter?

166
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,780
She will end up just like you, tormented by hatred.

167
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,110
Will you still do this if that's the case?

168
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,030
I'll feel sorry for Antu once I kill you.

169
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,970
But if I don't kill you, I'll feel sorry for my family.

170
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,120
I must take revenge.

171
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,730
Mother.

172
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,770
Antu.

173
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,050
Leave.

174
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,020
I'll avenge you.

175
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,570
- Antu. 
 - Stay back, both of you.

176
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,130
Zang Hai, I'll die for my mother.

177
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:58,070
From now on, the grudge between our families is over.

178
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,700
All right?

179
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,150
Mother.

180
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,970
Promise me. Don't give him a hard time.

181
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,860
Stop!

182
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,290
You, take her away.

183
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,490
No. You have to avenge your family.

184
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,160
If you give it up for me, you will regret it forever.

185
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,380
Both of us will suffer.

186
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,180
You have to take revenge.

187
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,200
Silly girl.

188
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,500
Ten years in Yong made you so irritable.

189
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,490
Thankfully, you haven't been fully twisted by hatred.

190
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,780
But how are you going to take down your real enemies like this?

191
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,750
The person who killed my family

192
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,580
with Zhuang Luyin and Cao Jingxian was it not you?

193
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,850
Zhuang Luyin... Cao Jingxian...

194
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,960
Tell me.

195
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,680
Why are you so certain that I was one of them?

196
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,070
I don't know your relationship with Zhuang Luyin.

197
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,010
But you have been allied with Cao Jingxian for years.

198
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,590
That petty eunuch.

199
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,740
Why would I need help to kill Kuai Duo?

200
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Your speculation is understandable.

201
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,830
Let me tell you a story first.

202
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,700
You can decide whether to believe me.

203
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,180
Zhinu,

204
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,690
you are so much like him.

205
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,830
Dongxia lost the war back then.

206
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,200
The royal court was in chaos.

207
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,830
My reign was under threat.

208
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,050
One day, some rebels attempted to assassinate me.

209
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,240
I fell off the cliff and thought I would die for sure.

210
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,000
But I woke up and found myself in an army tent.

211
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
A man from Yong saved me.

212
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,750
That man was your father.

213
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,310
Kuai Duo.

214
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,160
 You woke up? 

215
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,400
 Who are you? 

216
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,140
 Where am I? 

217
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,300
 We're on Mount Dansui, in the Artisan-Soldier Camp of Great Yong. 

218
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,340
 I am Kuai Duo, the Director of Imperial Astronomical Bureau of the Great Yong. 

219
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,680
 I am commissioned to build the Fengshan Altar here. 

220
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,550
 Fortunately, the arrow missed any vital organs. 

221
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,070
 But you must rest for at least half a month. 

222
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,720
 Once you recover, I'll send you away. 

223
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,960
 You don't trust me? 

224
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,990
 Of course not. 

225
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,880
 Why are you pushing yourself? 

226
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,310
 It's freezing out there. 

227
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:52,070
 You'll die from the cold very soon if you try to leave. 

228
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,280
 Get some good rest here. 

229
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,350
 We don't have tents specifically for ladies. 

230
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,660
 Sorry for the inconvenience. 

231
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,810
 Here. 

232
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,350
 You asked for water. 

233
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,710
 You didn't have to boil it. 

234
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,910
 Are you married? 

235
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,060
 I'm married and have a daughter and a son. 

236
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,930
 I can bring them to Dongxia. 

237
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,750
 I won't stay here forever. 

238
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,340
 They're waiting for me at home. 

239
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,300
 How dare you look down on Dongxia? 

240
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,490
 What's so great about Great Yong? 

241
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,410
 Dongxia is great. 

242
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,880
 But my family lives in Great Yong. 

243
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,160
 Where are we at the project now? 

244
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,320
 We dug 100 chi deeper. 

245
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,350
 Listen. It's snowing heavily. 

246
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,680
 The east and south constructions are quite unstable. 

247
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,830
 Tell the artisans to pay extra attention. 

248
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,490
 Understood. 

249
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,760
 This is the Fengshan Altar you're building for the Emperor of Great Yong? 

250
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,040
 That's right. 

251
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,240
 His Majesty will conduct the Fengshan ceremony here 

252
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,880
 to show his ambition of unifying all lands. 

253
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,680
 You people always aspire to grasp the whole world in your fist, 

254
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,630
 claiming that it's for the eternity of the nation. 

255
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,450
 But when your last day comes, 

256
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,800
 what can you take with you? 

257
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,400
 That is not up to me. 

258
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,410
 But people should aspire to leave something behind. 

259
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,550
 The eternity of the nation belongs to His Majesty 

260
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,320
 as well as the people of Great Yong. 

261
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,630
 You're thinking too much. 

262
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:24,160
 It's better to live for yourself as a commoner. 

263
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,470
 We should make the most of our limited time. 

264
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,510
 Though I cherish life, I value righteousness more. 

265
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,200
 When forced to choose, 

266
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,900
 I sacrifice my life for principles. 

267
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,980
 What's this? 

268
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,050
 A hand-made toy for my son. 

269
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,650
 I can tell that you really miss your family. 

270
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,630
 What are their names? 

271
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:04,060
 My son is called Zhinu. 

272
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,120
 And my daughter Yuenu. 

273
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,030
 "Nu" as in slave? 

274
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:15,440
 You people really want your kids to be slaves? 

275
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,600
 It's a term of endearment, meaning that they should grow up slowly. 

276
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,280
 I have two daughters. 

277
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,670
 One is called Yinzhu. 

278
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,350
 The other is called Antu. 

279
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,840
 So... 

280
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,460
 Are they... 

281
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,520
 They are in a safe place. 

282
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,960
Time flew.

283
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,580
After half a month in the Artisan-Soldier Camp,

284
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,480
I got used to life there.

285
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,680
If only my wounds weren't so eager to heal...

286
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,000
 I heard that Dongxia people are good at horse riding. 

287
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,970
 We just rode around. 

288
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,210
 How do you feel? 

289
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,780
 Not bad. 

290
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,580
 We're quite far from your tent. 

291
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,240
 Why did we come this far? 

292
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,400
 I promised to send you back once you recovered. 

293
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,340
 Now, it's time to go home. 

294
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,520
 How did you know where I live? 

295
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,660
 Your family has been looking for you. 

296
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,790
 Your Majesty! 

297
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,310
 The civil strife within your royal court remains unresolved. 

298
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,160
 Your Highness, 

299
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,040
 your people need you. 

300
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,410
 You knew all along? 

301
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,660
 There are things we have to face eventually. 

302
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,080
 We humbly welcome Your Majesty's return. 

303
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,040
 Let's go. 

304
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,950
 Kuai Duo, 

305
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,250
 thank you. 

306
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,960
Later, I ended the civil strife.

307
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,680
Everything went back to normal.

308
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,830
But deep down, I knew that something had changed forever.

309
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,550
 Your Majesty. 

310
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,230
 The Imperial Astronomical Bureau and the Ministry of Works of Great Yong have extended 

311
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,350
 the Fengshan Altar to over 100 chi. 

312
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,450
 Anything else? 

313
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,810
 Kuai Duo is working from dawn to midnight as usual. 

314
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,550
 Your Majesty. 

315
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,750
 What's wrong? 

316
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,750
 There was an earthquake. 

317
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,960
 The Fengshan Altar collapsed. 

318
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,780
 Many Yong artisans got injured or died. 

319
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,140
 Many are trapped under the ruins. 

320
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,200
 - What about Kuai Duo? 
 - We... We don't know yet. 

321
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,320
 We're already looking for him. 

322
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,440
 Your Majesty! Someone saw Kuai Duo 

323
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,270
 coming out from the collapsed Fengshan Altar. 

324
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,180
 He returned to the camp. 

325
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,080
 But soon after, he headed southwest on horseback. 

326
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,970
 Your Majesty. 

327
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,280
 Kuai Duo went to the woods in the west. 

328
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,460
 Stay here. Don't follow me! 

329
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,740
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty! 

330
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,730
 Kuai Duo! 

331
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,360
 Kuai Duo! 

332
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,920
 Kuai Duo! Where are you going? 

333
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,170
 Your Highness. 

334
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,760
 There was an earthquake. 

335
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,150
 The Fengshan Altar collapsed. 

336
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,210
 I have to report it. 

337
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,960
 That wasn't an earthquake. 

338
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,860
 What happened? 

339
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,840
 What did you do? 

340
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,270
 You found the Gui Seal? 

341
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,590
 So, it was hidden under Mount Dansui. 

342
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,590
 You detected it long ago? 

343
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,840
 You were here for that? 

344
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,990
 Your Highness, please stop asking questions. 

345
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,820
 You must give it to me. 

346
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,810
 Kuai Duo, do you know what the Gui Seal does exactly? 

347
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:15,010
 Do you have any idea why I'd rather lose the war than resort to that? 

348
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,070
 My mother used the Gui Seal in a war against you. 

349
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,070
 It triggered a devastating tragedy. 

350
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,920
 And she died because of that. 

351
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,600
 She left a will, forbidding all her offspring to ever look for it. 

352
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,710
 Even I didn't know where it was hidden 

353
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,510
 until this moment. 

354
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:42,800
 Kuai Duo, the Gui Seal is an ominous item. 

355
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:49,530
 It will bring you endless trouble if you keep it. 

356
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,050
 Thank you for telling me that. 

357
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,210
 But I have to bring it back. 

358
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,490
 Kuai Duo. 

359
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,380
 Give it to me. 

360
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,880
 I won't use it against Great Yong. 

361
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,530
 And please stay. 

362
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,880
 Let's stay in Dongxia... 

363
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,320
 just like when I was recovering. 

364
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,960
 All right? 

365
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,110
 Have you fully recovered? 

366
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,680
 Good to know. 

367
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,210
 You have to leave, don't you? 

368
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,710
 Give me a hug. 

369
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,460
 Will you? 

370
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,790
 I'm afraid we won't see each other again. 

371
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,710
 Don't worry. 

372
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,230
 It's just anesthetic. 

373
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,340
 You will recover soon. 

374
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,190
 I compiled this book over the years. 

375
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,400
 It contains knowledge of geoscience 

376
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,960
 and techniques such as mortise and tenon joints. 

377
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,260
 I'm leaving it to you. 

378
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,840
 Perhaps, it will be useful to your people. 

379
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,460
 Sorry. 

380
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,830
 Kuai Duo, you're such a fool. 

381
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,210
 Your Highness, 

382
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,690
 take care. 

383
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,220
Actually, the ending of this story was written in the beginning.

384
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,320
Your father only showed up briefly in my life,

385
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,540
but he taught me something.

386
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,060
We all have our own missions.

387
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,290
I never intended to disturb him.

388
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,100
Because I knew that I wasn't the one he wanted to see.

389
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:56,440
But little did I know that day would be our last goodbye.

390
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
 You may leave. 

391
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,190
One month later, my spy brought me

392
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,840
the last piece of news about Kuai Duo.

393
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,150
The Kuai family was annihilated.

394
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,230
No one survived.

395
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,150
He died with those whom he cared about the most.

396
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,050
 Leave me alone. 

397
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,320
But those like me, who never found a home in his heart,

398
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,040
must carry his memory for a lifetime.

399
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,110
Isn't it ridiculous?

400
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:43,000
For some people, life is way too short.

401
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,180
But for others, life is unbearably long.

402
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,220
But I only allowed myself to cry for him once.

403
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,510
No matter what happens,

404
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:06,270
I shall be and will always be the Queen of Dongxia.

405
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,952
   

406
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,970
   

407
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,670
This book he left behind helped us a lot,

408
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,290
making our people more well-off.

409
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,840
And that wooden palace concealing the jade fetus

410
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,380
was built with the techniques recorded in the book.

411
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,140
You are his son. 
    

412
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,860
I'm giving it back to you.

413
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,760
I didn't know you were my father's old friend.

414
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,360
I was wrong about you.

415
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,680
I had no idea...

416
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,440
that someone survived that catastrophe.

417
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:37,780
Nor did I know that my daughter would be so close to Kuai Duo's son.

418
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,740
I didn't just come to check on Antu.

419
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,980
I'm here for bigger reasons.

420
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,880
It seems that...

421
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,550
you can help me.

422
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:16,940



423
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,260
