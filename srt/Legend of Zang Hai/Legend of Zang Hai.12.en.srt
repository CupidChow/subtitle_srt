00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,490
And I ran into an old face.

4
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,380
I know he came back

5
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,540
to kill Father and avenge his family.

6
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,290
[Late mother Shen's grave]
I told him to leave the Capital

7
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,540
and never come back.

8
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,540
Mother.

9
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,540
Did I do the right thing?

10
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,460
Zhinu, come and see.

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,690
It's a rare flower.

12
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,330
When fully grown,

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,020
its root and stem can be used in medicine,

14
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,930
while its flowers and seeds are poisonous.

15
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,850
Who is there?

16
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,380
Young Master.

17
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,610
Why are you still here?

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,610
I still have pending businesses

19
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,850
to attend to.

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,380
Not afraid I'll report you?

21
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,660
I was afraid.

22
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,820
That's why I came

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,500
to kill you today.

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,730
You...

25
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,660
But I've changed my mind.

26
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,890
Listen.

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,290
I won't let you kill my father

28
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,660
just because you helped me.

29
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,010
You'd better give up.

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,340
What are you doing?

31
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,500
Look, Young Master.

32
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,130
Is it the only flower growing on this grave?

33
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,610
What's so strange about flowers growing on the grave?

34
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,980
Have you seen this flower

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,820
anywhere in the tomb?

36
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,450
This is the "Solitary South Star." The whole plant is poisonous.

37
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,090
Why is this poisonous plant

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,780
only growing and flourishing

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,610
on your mother's grave?

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,860
Perhaps the wind carried the seeds

41
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,890
from somewhere else.

42
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,010
It's a poisonous herb unique to Nanzhaozhou.

43
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,610
The wind can't carry its seeds this far.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,980
What are you implying?

45
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,680
Either someone planted it on your mother's grave

46
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,890
on purpose.

47
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,130
Or your mother's remains in the grave

48
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,060
carry the seeds.

49
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,660
But I think you know

50
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,130
that the former is hardly a possibility.

51
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,100
What are you implying?

52
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,980
If I am right,

53
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,130
your mother died from this poison.

54
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,610
No way.

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,780
My mother died from illness.

56
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,940
I never left her side

57
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,500
for a second before she died.

58
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,660
No one could have poisoned her.

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,010
The Solitary South Star

60
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,890
may not be as toxic as arsenic,

61
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,380
but with a little intake of its poison every day,

62
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,890
the toxin will accumulate in the organs over the years.

63
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,730
Eventually,

64
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,660
the victim dies.

65
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,550
If you want the truth,

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,100
all you need to do is exhume your mother's remains

67
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,900
from her grave.

68
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,540
You want me to dig up my mother's grave?

69
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,660
Don't you want to know the truth?

70
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,850
Perhaps the one who poisoned her

71
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,980
is the very person you revered

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,660
and trusted most.

73
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,580
Zang Hai, you're an animal!

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,850
What are you implying?

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,580
You're saying that my father killed my mother?

76
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,140
Nothing is impossible

77
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,170
in this world.

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,250
You want to dig up

79
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,020
my mother's grave and kill my father.

80
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,100
You fabricate lies to achieve your goal.

81
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,660
You are insane!

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,490
Then tell me.

83
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,810
Why are the Zhuang family's ancestors buried

84
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,170
in the southeast of the mausoleum

85
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,730
while your mother is buried on the north side alone

86
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,020
with such a plain grave?

87
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,050
Why haven't they moved her memorial tablet into the ancestral hall?

88
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,930
Shut up!

89
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,080
Most importantly,

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,100
Your mother's been gone for years.

91
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,370
Why has your father never once visited her grave?

92
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,980
Why?

93
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,100
Ask someone you know.

94
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,530
See if this flower is poisonous like I said.

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,730
If you don't believe it is toxic,

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,170
do you dare to eat it?

97
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,780
I won't believe a word you said.

98
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,410
I'll give you one last chance.

99
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,490
Get out of my face!

100
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,730
During tomorrow's ancestral rites,

101
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,340
open your eyes and see for yourself

102
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,980
whether I'm telling the truth.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,540
Aim.

104
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,900
Shoulders relaxed. Hands steady.

105
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,220
Exhale slowly.

106
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,930
Shoot.

107
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,340
I hit the bull's-eye.

108
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,140
Well done, Zhixing!

109
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,370
Have some water.

110
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,290
Mother, you promised

111
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,900
to make me tarts tonight if I hit the bull's-eye.

112
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,250
What a little foodie.

113
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,540
Won't you practice if I don't make you food?

114
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,020
This kid's got the same guts I had back in the day.

115
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,410
The next general in the family

116
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,340
will be him.

117
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,220
Make sure he practices riding and archery every day.

118
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,490
Don't let him slack off.

119
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,730
I can't lead troops like you.

120
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,610
How can I shoulder such a responsibility?

121
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,540
Please teach him yourself.

122
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,930
Alright. Keep going.

123
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,060
My Lord, My Lady.

124
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,850
The carriages are ready.

125
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,610
The servants are already preparing

126
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,770
the incense and offerings at the mausoleum.

00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,550
[Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion]

128
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,250
Have you brought all the hunting stuff?

129
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,220
Yes.

130
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,130
Rest assured, My Lady.

131
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,420
Father.

132
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,490
You got up early today.

133
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,890
I dare not be late

134
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,100
for the ancestor veneration.

135
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,940
Good to know.

136
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,530
I don't see Mr. Zang today.

137
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,650
Isn't he coming?

138
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,610
He wasn't feeling well last night and asked for leave.

139
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,650
Let's set off.

140
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,340
Anything else?

141
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,250
I...

142
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,180
Zhixing.

143
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,530
Let's not miss the hour for the ancestral rites.

144
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,460
- We can talk on the way... - Zhixing.

145
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,250
I have things to discuss with Father.

146
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,730
Why don't you wait until we arrive?

147
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,700
Sandalwood's fragrance lingers,

148
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,060
pure and long.

149
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,250
Steadying the state,

150
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,250
our ancestors' virtue strong.

151
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,100
Jade cups hold fine wine,

152
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,130
like amber's glow.

153
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,850
With cleansed hands we drink,

154
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,770
their grace to show.

155
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,220
My honored ancestors,

156
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,580
your unworthy descendant Zhuang Luyin

157
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,650
brought his family here to pay homage.

158
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,770
The family is thriving, my wife is virtuous, and my sons are filial.

159
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,250
May your noble spirits guard our way.

160
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,580
Pay respect.

161
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,940
Rise.

162
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,130
Pay respect again.

163
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,130
Rise.

164
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,130
Pay respect again.

165
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,890
Rise.

166
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,220
Rites completed.

167
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,820
My Lord,

168
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,490
the offerings are blessed by the ancestors now.

169
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,820
Eating them brings good luck.

170
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,370
My Lord,

171
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,940
these desserts have been left outside for a long time.

172
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,850
They must be covered in dust.

173
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,650
Let them make some new ones.

174
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,130
Wrap the incense ash up and bury it at home.

175
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,700
It also brings good luck.

176
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,580
Let's do as you say.

177
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,180
Where did this flower come from?

178
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,490
I have no idea.

179
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,460
My Lady.

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,060
Is there anything wrong with this flower?

181
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,650
Don't ask so many questions.

182
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,180
Throw it away.

183
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,850
Understood.

184
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,700
Father.

185
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,610
What now?

186
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,180
You haven't visited my mother for so long.

187
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,180
You haven't visited her

188
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,730
ever since she passed away.

189
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,300
I'm going to the hunting ground later.

190
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,100
You don't like hunting, so go ahead

191
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,250
and visit your mother.

192
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,180
Zhifu.

193
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,700
See that?

194
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,180
I swear I'll get it today.

195
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,420
You two, go check.

196
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,060
Father.

197
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,650
Nice shot.

198
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,850
Why are you here?

199
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,980
I thought you didn't like hunting.

200
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,770
You taught me archery when I was a child.

201
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,010
I haven't forgotten it.

202
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,770
You indulge in pleasure and never practice.

203
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,460
Come with us since you're here.

204
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,010
Father.

205
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,770
I saw a little deer

206
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,180
heading in that direction.

207
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,650
I'll take a look.

208
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,770
Giddy yap.

209
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,700
Father.

210
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,850
What's wrong?

211
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,510
[Late mother Shen's grave]

212
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,460
What are you doing?

213
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,220
You won't come to see my mother.

214
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,130
I have no choice but to lure you here.

215
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,610
Don't you miss her at all?

216
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,610
Don't you want to see her?

217
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,250
You loved and cared for her so much.

218
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,060
Why have you changed?

219
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,820
Why has everything changed?

220
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,850
It pains me

221
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,770
to think about her.

222
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,460
So I'd rather not think about her

223
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,300
or visit her.

224
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,610
Do you still feel sad for her?

225
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,770
Enough.

226
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,100
Let's go back.

227
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,010
Father, wait.

228
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,250
The flowers are blooming on Mother's grave.

229
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,490
Please take them back and keep them in the vase.

230
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,850
If she misses you,

231
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,130
perhaps she can see you through these flowers.

232
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,650
I'm sure

233
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,220
she misses you a lot.

234
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,300
The talk of the spirits is all nonsense.

235
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,980
We martial arts practitioners don't believe that.

236
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,130
No matter what,

237
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,580
they bloomed on my mother's grave.

238
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,770
At least, bring them home for decoration.

239
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,100
A real man shouldn't

240
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,530
be obsessed with flowers.

241
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,140
You missed your mother a lot today.

242
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,380
I won't scold you for that.

243
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,090
It's getting late. Let's go.

244
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,900
[Late mother Shen's grave]

245
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,980
You put the flowers there, didn't you?

246
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,770
Speculation is groundless.

247
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,140
It's better to see it with your own eyes.

248
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,330
Your mother was buried outside

249
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,530
of the mausoleum

250
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,220
without an outer coffin.

251
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,490
That's why the coffin decayed so fast.

252
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,810
The status of the living ones is demonstrated

253
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,330
through chariots, robes, and estates.

254
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,010
That of the deceased is shown through coffins, shrouds, and graves.

255
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,380
It's hard to imagine

256
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,380
that the Marquis's wife is buried like this.

257
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,140
I'm going to open it.

258
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,730
Wait for me up there

259
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,290
if you can't bear to see it.

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,460
No need.

261
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,330
This is my mother.

262
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,660
Come on.

263
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,530
Three, two, one.

264
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,290
Your mother's wrist bones are deformed

265
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,660
and obviously thinner than the ones

266
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,140
of ordinary people.

267
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,380
The carpal bones of her left hand are also deformed.

268
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,460
Before she died,

269
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,420
had she experienced weakness, dizziness, headaches,

270
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,140
and numbness in the limbs?

271
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,140
At first, she was just dizzy and drowsy.

272
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,810
The physicians couldn't do much.

273
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,250
Then things went worse and worse.

274
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,220
She was dizzy, nauseous, and listless all day long.

275
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,330
In the end,

276
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,620
she was mumbling nonsense,

277
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,730
having convulsion, and suffering unbearable pain.

278
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,980
That's right.

279
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,570
These symptoms point to Solitary South Star poisoning.

280
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,620
Those who are poisoned by that flower have something in common.

281
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,530
Their bones shrink and deform.

282
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,330
Besides, your mother was mumbling nonsense.

283
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,490
That's a sign of severe intoxication

284
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,530
as the poison affects the brain.

285
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,420
Are you sure?

286
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,220
I've been learning from my master since childhood.

287
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,420
I can't be mistaken.

288
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,380
I think

289
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,380
your mother passed away

290
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,700
with some seeds left undigested.

291
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,730
As time went by,

292
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,570
the seeds got into the soil with the corpse liquid

293
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,620
and took root to sprout.

294
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,420
My mother was the kindest person

295
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,900
who always put up with everything.

296
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,220
Why?

297
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,250
Why?

298
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,770
Why?

299
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,940
One does not

300
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,860
need to be evil

301
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,530
to invite disaster.

302
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,010
This poison can't kill anyone overnight.

303
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,490
It only erupts

304
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,290
when it accumulates to a certain extent through time.

305
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,290
That means

306
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,180
the culprit was close to your mother.

307
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,460
Strangers couldn't have poisoned her little by little

308
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,700
without being caught.

309
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,290
I told you to pay attention during the rites.

310
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,010
What did you notice?

311
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,420
Jiang Xiang.

312
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,290
What's the deal with that bunch of flowers in the mausoleum?

313
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,490
I assume one of the ignorant maids

314
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,940
made a mistake

315
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,460
and put it there.

316
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,810
What an ignorant girl.

317
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,090
Find her and kill her.

318
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,940
Understood.

319
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,660
But it must have been a coincidence.

320
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,900
Please don't be bothered, My Lady.

321
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,460
I really hope it was just a coincidence.

322
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,860
Otherwise, there will be trouble.

323
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,700
Are you saying...

324
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,860
that the second young master did it?

325
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,250
Do you think

326
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,660
that he's suspecting something?

327
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,940
I don't think so.

328
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,380
He comes to the mausoleum in a disheveled manner every year

329
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,900
and it's the same this time.

330
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,330
There's nothing different.

331
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,250
If he had found out the truth,

332
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,290
he would have made a big fuss about it.

333
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,420
He wouldn't remain silent.

334
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,330
Besides,

335
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,810
so what if he found out about it?

336
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,940
He has no proof.

337
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,090
And he's too much of a loser

338
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,050
to cause you any trouble.

339
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,980
My Lady, you're truly farsighted

340
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,980
to make him a good-for-nothing.

341
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,010
She was in charge of the food and supplies.

342
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,380
And my mother

343
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,180
fell ill one year after she returned to the Capital.

344
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,900
Zengzi said,

345
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,420
"How profound indeed

346
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,460
is the virtue of filial piety!"

347
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,570
You write so well, Zhixing.

348
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,730
Mother, are you alright?

349
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,180
In the beginning,

350
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,330
they called so many physicians

351
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,810
but nobody could cure her.

352
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,010
Her condition even deteriorated.

353
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,090
I was so worried

354
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,620
that I couldn't play.

355
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,050
I stayed by her side from day to night.

356
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,730
But she never got better.

357
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,330
Later,

358
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,220
I went to my father.

359
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,810
But he wouldn't see her.

360
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,490
Mother.

361
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,300
Mother.

362
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,330
Please don't die.

363
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,620
Please don't leave me.

364
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,140
From now on,

365
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,840
no matter

366
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,250
where I am,

367
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,530
I will always protect you.

368
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,730
You must listen to your father.

369
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,570
Why doesn't Father come to see you?

370
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,050
Does Father not want us anymore?

371
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,180
It's not like that.

372
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,940
It's not like that.

373
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,090
Zhixing.

374
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,940
He loves you more than anyone in this world,

375
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,730
no matter what.

376
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,530
I won't ask you

377
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,730
to be a man of great achievements

378
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,940
like your father.

379
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,460
I only hope

380
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,940
that you can be happy.

381
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,250
This is my only wish.

382
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,700
You are on your own from now on.

383
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,380
I can't keep you company anymore.

384
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,180
Mother.

385
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,330
Mother.

386
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,490
Mother.

387
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,600
Please don't leave me.

388
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,050
Please.

389
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,970
- Please. - Until she passed away,

390
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,620
my father hadn't seen her once.

391
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,530
I never understood

392
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,180
why my mother slowly lost my father's favor

393
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,460
and why my father

394
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,420
abandoned my mother and me overnight.

395
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,620
I knew something was wrong the moment I saw this flower

396
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,940
on your mother's grave last night.

397
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,900
I have asked around about you at the Marquis's Mansion.

398
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,460
All the servants told me the same story.

399
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,220
They said

400
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,980
that your mother cheated on your father.

401
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,940
She used her health condition

402
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,730
as an excuse to have an affair

403
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,530
with a physician.

404
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,660
Nonsense!

405
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,660
My mother loved my father deeply.

406
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,570
She wouldn't have done that.

407
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,900
Do you want the truth?

408
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,050
Jiang Xiang used to have an unremarkable maid.

409
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,660
Five years ago,

410
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,180
she was thrown out for doing something wrong.

411
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,730
I managed to find her today

412
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,380
and discovered the truth.

413
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,900
Jiang Xiang instructed her

414
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,420
to spread rumors about your mother having an affair

415
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,010
with the physician.

416
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,570
Don't make a scene.

417
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,170
Let me handle it.

418
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,490
Give a man a bad name and hang him.

419
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,860
To destroy a woman,

420
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,330
ruining her chastity

421
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,090
has been the most effective method for thousands of years.

422
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,660
If you still have doubts,

423
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,980
I can bring you that maid.

424
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,250
Talk to her.

425
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,810
Does

426
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,770
my father know?

427
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,770
I looked into it.

428
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,810
His Majesty reclaimed military power

429
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,420
from your father after he returned.

430
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,530
To gain a firm foothold in the court,

431
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,490
he desperately needed the help

432
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,860
of Jiang Xiang's father Jiang Jin, the Minister of Rites.

433
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,490
Presented with power,

434
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,140
he chose Jiang Xiang.

435
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,180
I'm afraid that was when he started

436
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,860
neglecting your mother.

437
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,660
And Jiang Xiang

438
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,700
started poisoning my mother

439
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,290
at that point.

440
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,980
Of course, there are ways to find out

441
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,620
whether the Marquis was involved.

442
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,220
But you will have to choose. Will you get to the bottom of it

443
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,940
or will you play dumb

444
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,730
for the rest of your life?

445
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,530
My father has seen it.

446
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,090
He knows.

447
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,660
He knows everything.

448
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,940
♪Conceal the ambition in my eyes♪

449
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:16,100
♪In my palm, I hold a dangerous desire♪

450
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,420
♪Turbulent waves hidden in my sleeves♪

451
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,820
♪Silent thunder echoes around♪

452
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,020
♪However cunning you are♪

453
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,580
♪I can see♪

454
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,380
♪Right through you...♪

455
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,490
That's right.

456
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,570
He conspired with Jiang Xiang to kill my mother.

457
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,330
Seems he's long since stopped

458
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,380
needing a son like me.

459
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,420
I disagree, Young Master.

460
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,090
The Marquis's love

461
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,940
is not unchangeable.

462
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,530
He used to love you

463
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,490
because he loved your mother

464
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,860
and because he thought

465
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,940
you could carry on his mantle.

466
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,250
He now values your brother

467
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,250
because Jiang Xiang's maiden family was useful to him.

468
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,490
Meanwhile, Jiang Xiang has made you a good-for-nothing.

469
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,380
He only likes

470
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,620
those who are useful to him.

471
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,770
Such affection is not difficult to come by.

472
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,460
As long as you trust me

473
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,420
and do as I say,

474
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,730
I can help you get everything you want.

475
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,530
I just want to avenge my mother.

476
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,730
Jiang Xiang is easy to deal with.

477
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,140
All she wants

478
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,570
is to make Zhuang Zhifu

479
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,700
the next Marquis.

480
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,010
Once Zhuang Zhifu falls out of favor,

481
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,420
Jiang Xiang will have no one to rely on.

482
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,940
The best revenge on her

483
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,570
is to destroy her greatest hope.

484
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,420
She looks down on you at the moment.

485
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,090
It happens to give you a chance.

486
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,290
Jiang Xiang deserves to die.

487
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,570
But now, even my father

488
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,940
has become my enemy.

489
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,700
Zang Hai.

490
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,940
My father is your enemy.

491
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,490
You want him dead to avenge your whole family.

492
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,620
But why are you helping me?

493
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,940
I need an answer

494
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,770
from the Marquis of Pingjin.

495
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,860
It's very important to me.

496
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,290
But you can't ask him.

497
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,730
You need someone to get that answer for you.

498
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,530
That's right.

499
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,490
My entire family was annihilated.

500
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,700
There are two other culprits besides your father.

501
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,220
One was the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director, Cao Jingxian.

502
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,010
And I still

503
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,860
haven't figured out who the other person is.

504
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,250
I have to find this person.

505
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,290
I can't afford

506
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,940
to alert my enemy.

507
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,770
You want me to figure out

508
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,010
who this person is through my father.

509
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,980
In return, you will help me?

510
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,140
That's right.

511
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,940
Once you get an answer,

512
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,660
what will you do?

513
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,250
I overstepped.

514
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,660
You infiltrated into our house for revenge.

515
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,020
I must take revenge.

516
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,420
If you won't let me,

517
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,620
feel free to tell the Marquis

518
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,220
who I am right now.

519
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,220
He killed my mother.

520
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,570
I won't forgive him.

521
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,140
But still, he is my father.

522
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,420
The person who wiped out my family is right there

523
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,140
but I can't kill him.

524
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,530
Instead, I have to be close to him.

525
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,140
You know who killed your mother

526
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,180
yet you have to be his good son,

527
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,250
showing respect and affection.

528
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,980
How is it

529
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,460
not a harsh torment on you?

530
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,610
Blood for blood.

531
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,690
This rule has remained unchanged for thousands of years.

532
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,340
I will try to help you.

533
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,170
But I'm not sure if I can help you take revenge.

534
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,340
Don't blame me

535
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,690
if I change my mind.

536
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,820
You covered for me and helped me

537
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,170
find my enemy.

538
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,690
I'm more than grateful.

539
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,650
I won't ask for more.

540
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,050
If you change your mind when the time comes,

541
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,860
I won't complain.

542
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,010
I shall honor our pact.

543
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,090
Please help me take revenge.

544
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:00,900
From now on,

545
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,820
I will do whatever you say.

546
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,010
From now on,

547
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,570
we will share weal and woe.

548
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,300
Within a year,

549
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,340
I will help him gain his father's absolute trust.

550
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,740
Once he figures out

551
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,980
who the third culprit is,

552
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,980
I'll carry out the plan.

553
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,490
Even if you do your part,

554
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,080
what if he can't

555
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,010
get anything out of his father in the end?

556
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,300
Can you wait?

557
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,130
I am enlightened.

558
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,900
I didn't bide my time

559
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,260
for a decade just to win some petty battle.

560
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,530
I will be more careful from now on.

561
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,490
Hai.

562
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,210
Let me tell you about Cao Jingxian.

563
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,570
He appears to be merely colleagues with the Marquis of Pingjin.

564
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,780
But as the Vice Minister of Works,

565
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,900
Zhuang Zhifu maintains the royal gardens,

566
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,380
and that involves the Directorate of Ceremonial.

567
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,340
My guess is,

568
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,980
that much of the money embezzled by Zhuang Zhifu

569
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,530
has ended up in Cao Jingxian's pocket.

570
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,260
That's expected.

571
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,490
Besides, he's surrounded by layers of security.

572
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,180
He's either in the palace

573
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,610
or at his private residence in the Capital.

574
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,340
It's almost impossible to reach him.

575
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,860
However,

576
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,860
there will be an opportunity in two months.

577
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,300
What are you referring to?

578
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,170
The ground polo competition held by the imperial court

579
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,460
to strengthen the fitness of men in the Great Yong.

580
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,690
It's quite popular among the noble families.

581
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,900
The Seal-Holding Eunuch Director

582
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,490
brings rewards to the champion

583
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,340
on behalf of His Majesty every year.

584
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,570
That will be your chance to meet Cao Jingxian.

585
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,650
The opportunity comes at just the right time.

586
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,650
Aren't you tired of practicing Wuji Fist over and over again

587
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,860
all day long?

588
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,490
Try something else.

589
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,490
You are the disciple and he is the master.

590
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,490
And you're slacking off here?

591
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,260
Zhinu.

592
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,460
What brings you here?

593
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,780
What did I tell you?

594
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,570
Call me Zang Hai from now on.

595
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,490
Isn't this Young Master Zhuang?

596
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,010
You recognize me?

597
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,010
Sir.

598
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,860
Why did you ask me out

599
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,260
and bring me here?

600
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,740
You are going to practice martial arts here.

601
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,010
Since you want to regain your father's favor,

602
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,490
then you can't follow your brother's path.

603
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,090
We have to find another way.

604
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,980
We must convince your father

605
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,490
that you have the potential

606
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,980
to inherit his mantle.

607
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,170
Shilei.

608
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,650
See if he is cut out to be a martial artist.

609
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,460
Alright.

610
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,010
Are you crazy?

611
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,130
His father is the Marquis of Pingjin.

612
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,570
What if he figures out who you are?

613
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,980
He already knows.

614
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,280
Then...

615
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,260
Of course, he also knows who you are.

616
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,690
Then why is he still alive?

617
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,650
Rest assured.

618
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,740
He has allied with me.

619
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,460
He will be practicing martial arts here.

620
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,690
Make sure Shilei teaches him well.

621
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,090
Guanfeng.

622
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,860
He is more gifted than you.

623
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,490
I see potential in him.

624
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,530
Shut up.

625
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,600
He idles around and does nothing all day long.

626
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:08,860
Will he make it?

627
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,460
It's time to show me what you've got.

628
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,130
I'm entrusting him to you two.

629
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,300
You have two months to make him a martial artist.

630
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,010
Sir.

631
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,260
Can we go somewhere else?

632
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,250
This place is run down.

633
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,570
I don't even see a decent table.

634
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,940
Besides, where do I sleep?

635
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,130
So...

636
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,380
I'll stop.

637
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,340
Sir.

638
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,570
It's fine here.

639
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,780
From now on,

640
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,260
learn martial arts from these two masters.

641
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,820
Remember. You promised

642
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,380
to do whatever I say.

643
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,570
This is your first step toward a transformation.

644
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,740
Of course, I'll be busy, too.

645
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,980
I have to work on your reputation in the Capital.

646
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,860
Fists facing down.

647
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,770
Can you squat properly or not?

648
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,490
Yes, I can.

649
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,230
Look at me.

650
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,940
This is a proper horse stance.

651
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,530
I see.

652
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,980
Can I have a bite?

653
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,260
Don't slack off.

654
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,400
I'm thirsty and hungry.

655
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,860
Let me have a bite, please.

656
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,820
Keep practicing and we'll see.

657
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,570
Turn around. Squat.

658
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,630
[Cao's Mansion]

659
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,130
Mr. Lu,

660
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,260
please let me see Mr. Cao for a second.

661
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,050
I will be reassured as long as

662
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,300
everything is alright.

663
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,010
Why do you want to

664
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,420
see our Lord, Mr. Chu?

665
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,820
I observed the celestial signs.

666
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,780
The Mandate Star shone brightly.

667
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,300
I read the signs.

668
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,010
Mr. Cao serves as His Majesty's closest court official.

669
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,490
So he is the Mandate Star.

670
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,050
Great news is to be expected.

671
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,300
- I... - Since you don't have something to say,

672
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,020
please go back, Mr. Chu.

673
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,690
I was humiliated by others.

674
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,510
Please do me justice.

675
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,620
Mr. Chu.

676
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,050
You are the Imperial Astronomer,

677
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,490
a fifth-rank official.

678
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,570
Who dares to humiliate you?

679
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,820
I feel embarrassed.

680
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,460
I am humiliated by the aide Zang Hai of the Marquis of Pingjin.

681
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,050
This person is insidious and vicious.

682
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,260
And he has become the top aide to the Marquis.

683
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,090
I have offended him.

684
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,130
I'm afraid that he is going to target me.

685
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,130
I seek your protection.

686
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,210
Aren't you backed by the Marquis?

687
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,130
What brings you to the Surveillance Office?

688
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,260
Mr. Lu, please don't say that.

689
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,940
I don't work for anyone.

690
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,170
I only serve the imperial court and His Majesty.

691
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,210
If Mr. Cao needs me to do anything one day,

692
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,260
I will devote myself to it entirely

693
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,340
until the last breath.

694
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,300
I see.

695
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,980
