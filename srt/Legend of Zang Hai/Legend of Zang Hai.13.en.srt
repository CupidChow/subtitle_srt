1
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,410
Well, what brings you to Zhen Tower, Mr. Zang?

4
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,050
I come here today

5
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,380
to ask a favor of you,

6
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,690
Miss Xiang.

7
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,740
The Capital is going to hold

8
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,330
the yearly ground polo contest.

9
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,820
Sons of the powerful families would participate.

10
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,850
The goal is to strengthen their body,

11
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,930
mind and soul.

12
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,490
The champion would get awarded

13
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,170
by the Emperor.

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,820
So? You want to have a try, too?

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,540
Is it not enough for you

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,890
to impress the Marquis of Pingjin?

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,570
Now you are trying to get attention of the Emperor?

18
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,220
Not me. It's Young Master Zhuang.

19
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,100
Zhuang Zhixing.

20
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,060
Him?

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,290
Why?

22
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,690
He needs this chance to get famous.

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,660
So?

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,500
He would become

25
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,130
the favorite son of his father.

26
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,570
Are you sure, Mr. Zang?

27
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,100
Have you lost your mind? Are you alright?

28
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,940
I can find a doctor for you.

29
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,450
Miss Xiang. Please sit.

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,730
If you want to survive and succeed in a powerful family,

31
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,540
you need more than one ally.

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,500
Miss Xiang.

33
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,410
Since we are good friends,

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,940
please do me this favor.

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,450
No more details, okay?

36
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,010
Speak.

37
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,380
How can I help?

38
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,340
I need Mr. Eight to cheer for Zhuang Zhixing

39
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,130
at the ground polo contest.

40
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,130
I need everyone in the Capital

41
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,730
to know Zhuang Zhixing is the younger version of Marquis.

42
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,220
Deal.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,780
I'm a businesswoman. I'm open to this offer.

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,690
First, I have to dress him up.

45
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,450
He needs to turn himself from a loser

46
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,130
into a noble

47
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,850
and energetic gentleman.

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,730
I would hire people to spread good news about him.

49
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,170
But these people need money

50
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,980
to do their job.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,170
At least three liang of silver for one man every day.

52
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,060
We need 20 men to cover the entire city,

53
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,010
which costs us 60 liang each day.

54
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,780
Of course you cannot afford it

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,730
with your meager salary.

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,730
You have to pawn something.

57
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,170
The quality of this jade

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,050
seems ordinary.

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,610
20 liang for this at most.

60
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,370
This is just a beginning.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,610
If you want to hire Mr. Eight,

62
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,020
you need to pay him 80 liang for each shadow play performance.

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,370
He needs to create new shadow models for Zhuang.

64
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,020
Total amount is 150 liang.

65
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,250
About the 150 liang...

66
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,020
Since we're friends, I will give you a discount.

67
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,250
120 liang then.

68
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,810
Nice robe.

69
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,290
A gift from the Marquis?

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,460
Beautiful fabric, smooth touch.

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,020
I can give you a good price for this.

72
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,580
Miss Xiang. You must be joking.

73
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,140
If I pawn my robe,

74
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,610
I have to leave naked.

75
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,700
None of my business.

76
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,100
It's not over yet.

77
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,050
When the contest kicks off officially,

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,250
all the fees would double.

79
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,140
Mr. Zang.

80
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,900
As soon as the contest is finished,

81
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,580
I would own you. If you don't pay me,

82
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,810
I would collect debt from your sons and grandsons.

83
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,700
The debt snowball would crush you.

84
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,140
It never ends.

85
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,780
Stop.

86
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,660
Miss Xiang.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,370
As you said, I cannot afford this.

88
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,340
But I know how

89
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,050
to help you get

90
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,370
your payment back.

91
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,020
Show me.

92
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,220
Despite his tainted reputation,

93
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,170
he's the second son of Marquis.

94
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,170
People are interested in secrets of the rich and powerful.

95
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,900
If Mr. Eight could take advantage of this,

96
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,810
basing his play on these secrets,

97
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,660
people would swarm into the theater room.

98
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,980
You can collect money for tickets.

99
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,170
This can generate at least

100
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,050
50 liang each day.

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,140
A total of 350 liang

102
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,730
for seven days.

103
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,370
I heard

104
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,580
that you create a betting pool for ground polo games.

105
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,170
As Zhuang is a newcomer,

106
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,850
few people would bet on him.

107
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,490
However, if he turns out a dark horse,

108
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,700
you would hit the jackpot

109
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,370
and make fortune out of it.

110
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,290
You can make at least

111
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,580
400 liang.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,460
Nope.

113
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,460
500 liang.

114
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,730
This is...

115
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,290
Let me finish my words.

116
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,490
When the game is over,

117
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,900
Zhuang would get famous.

118
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,170
The dishes he tried,

119
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,460
operas ordered,

120
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,660
and medicated bath preferred

121
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,410
in Zhen Tower would get famous, too.

122
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,730
To be honest,

123
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,850
Miss. Xiang, you would make a fortune

124
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,900
rather than suffering a loss.

125
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,660
You have a talent for running business. Impressive.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,660
You're better.

127
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,900
Why do you talk about expenses and costs only?

128
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,810
Are you trying

129
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,610
to con me into working for you my entire life?

130
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,020
Business is business.

131
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,340
Since it is profitable, I'm in.

132
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,460
However, do you have confidence?

133
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,900
If Zhuang Zhixing keeps losing,

134
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,460
I would lose money, a lot of money.

135
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,020
Miss Xiang. Please rest assured.

136
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,290
I have hired experienced coaches to train him.

137
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,930
He would become a new man

138
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,100
very soon.

139
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,100
Fengliu.

140
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,730
Have Zhuang Zhixing come here

141
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,660
to have fun recently?

142
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,580
Miss.

143
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,980
Mr. Zhuang is drinking

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,020
with two friends

145
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,250
downstairs right now.

146
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,140
What?

147
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,850
Come on. Master.

148
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,980
This is the new man you were talking about?

149
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,340
See you.

150
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,460
Zhuang Zhixing!

151
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,460
Leave.

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:11,930
Now!

153
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,490
Stop!

154
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,660
No!

155
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,250
Stop!

156
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,050
You!

157
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,250
Run!

158
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,980
What are you doing?

159
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,850
Get me out of here.

160
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,180
You didn't practice your martial arts

161
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,220
and took them to have fun instead.

162
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,530
Do you still remember your promise?

163
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,220
Progress doesn't happen overnight.

164
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,580
I need to relax.

165
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,820
That's why I took them to dinner.

166
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,250
Come on. It's so stinky and disgusting here.

167
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,340
Get me out of it.

168
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,060
Guanfeng.

169
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,850
Shilei.

170
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,180
I have treated you guys.

171
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,490
Do something, okay?

172
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,850
Zhuang Zhixing.

173
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,370
You promised me to avenged your mother.

174
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,130
But you can't even take the pain.

175
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,490
So be it.

176
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,180
If you've given up,

177
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,850
go home

178
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,130
and be a loser.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,300
Your mother would forgive you in heaven.

180
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,730
Don't ever talk

181
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,650
about avenging your mother again.

182
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,250
Sir.

183
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,370
I'm wrong.

184
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,490
I'm back to training right away.

185
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,820
Then

186
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,100
get out of here by yourself.

187
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,100
It's so high. How can I do that?

188
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,890
Fine.

189
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,770
I've agreed

190
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,980
to get back to training.

191

00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,770

383
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,490
You fixed the problem for the Emperor?

384
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,980
Actually,

385
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,530
the credit should go

386
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,220
to Marquis and Mr. Zhuang.

387
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,010
How did you

388
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,330
recruit such a remarkable talent?

389
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,980
Why didn't you tell me about him earlier?

390
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,980
Are you afraid that I might poach him?

391
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,570
You must be kidding.

392
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,140
There is no lack of talents in Surveillance Office.

393
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,940
Zang Hai is no match

394
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,290
for them.

395
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,490
Why do I feel that

396
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,250
I met you before?

397
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,290
Sir. You've seen millions of people

398
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,730
while serving the Emperor over years.

399
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,380
Though I have an ordinary look,

400
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,010
I'm so excited that

401
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,140
I can draw your attention.

402
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,660
Well said.

403
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,250
Quite an eloquent young man.

404
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,660
I like you.

405
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,730
I'm so bored recently.

406
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,180
I need someone like you,

407
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,700
who is smart and knows how to please me.

408
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,140
My Lord. Are you willing to humor me

409
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,570
and surrender him to me?

410
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,290
Come on. Mr. Cao.

411
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,770
In my humble opinion,

412
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,220
among these royal servants and ministers,

413
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,050
I cannot find one who is more eloquent

414
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,250
than you.

415
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,700
It means

416
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,940
that you refuse my offer?

417
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,140
Mr. Cao.

418
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,570
Everything is ready. We're waiting.

419
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,330
The Emperor has spoken:

420
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,290
I know that ground polo

421
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,380
is a popular sport in the country.

422
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,380
The winners

423
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,730
Zhuang Zhixing,

424
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,900
Mu Zhanqing,

425
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,860
Jiang Yu,

426
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,940
Sun Yongming,

427
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,940
have won a tough fight, which pleases me greatly.

428
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,730
I hereby award each of you a magpie robe.

429
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,570
Mr. Cao

430
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,900
is so unpredictable.

431
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,700
Don't be tempted by his offer.

432
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,180
Once you get in Surveillance Office,

433
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,420
you're never out.

434
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,050
Pick some decent gifts

435
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,010
from the treasury

436
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,660
and send them to Mr Cao's mansion.

437
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,490
Yes, My Lord.

438
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,330
Ask the chef to prepare Zhixing's favorite dishes

439
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,380
to celebrate his victory.

440
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,530
Yes, My Lord.

441
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,900
Zang Hai is

442
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,620
an outstanding geomancer.

443
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,980
However, I feel unsettled when seeing him.

444
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,570
You and Marquis of Pingjin, your friendship goes way back.

445
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,180
But he refuses to surrender Zang Hai.

446
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,900
Maybe he has a plan for Zang Hai.

447
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,180
Ten years have passed.

448
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,940
Zhuang Luyin never forgets.

449
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,660
Why I am a little bit nervous somehow?

450
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,900
[Cao's Mansion]

451
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:51,220
♪When will the green mountains be gone?♪

452
00:30:51,590 --> 00:31:00,290
♪How many people are buried here?♪

♪The wind sends paper money from the neighboring graves♪

455
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,940
Mr. Cao.

456
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,490
Beautiful voice.

457
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,940
You came

458
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,010
to me before,

459
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,980
asking me to protect you.

460
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,660
Tell me.

461
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,380
What do you know about Zang Hai?

462
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,330
He is from Qingquan Town, Jiangning Prefecture,

463
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,940
who came to Capital several months ago.

464
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,900
Somehow he heard

465
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,490
about the mausoleum and volunteered himself.

466
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,940
He used some trick

467
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,530
to displace the coffin

468
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,290
of Dowager Noble Consort Li

469
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,250
and came up with a haunting theory.

470
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,250
Anyway,

471
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,250
he helped Marquis of Pingjin to solve the problem.

472
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,980
I didn't think he'd take it so far that

473
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,290
he wants a job in Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion.

474
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,730
Clearly, he wants to take the chance

475
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,770
to build up a reputation.

476
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,530
The first month he got into the Mansion,

477
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,980
he began to stir things up.

478
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,810
Mr. Yang and Qu Jiao

479
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,700
got killed by him

480
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,010
only because they challenged him

481
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,860
in front of Marquis of Pingjin.

482
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,290
You mean he is vengeful and dangerous?

483
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,180
I offended him before.

484
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,620
I'm afraid I may be his next target.

485
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,460
Help me, Mr. Cao.

486
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,140
I love the Buddha figure you sent me.

487
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,770
You can count on me.

488
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,420
Thanks, Mr. Cao.

489
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,140
I would find something better

490
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,180
for you, sir.

491
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,050
Thanks.

492
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,140
Lu Jin.

493
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,250
Father.

494
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,770
Go to Qingquan Town to investigate Zang Hai's identity.

495
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,810
If Zang Hai is not clean,

496
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,140
Zhuang Luyin would not be able to cover him.

497
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,660
Go.

498
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,330
Yes, sir.

499
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,570
Lu Yan.

500
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,140
Keep a close eye on Zang Hai.

501
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,660
Once Lu Jin finds that Zang's faking his identity,

502
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,530
kill him immediately.

503
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,700
Yes, sir.

504
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,460
[Qingquan Town]

505
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,170
Have a look around.

506
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,940
Sorry, sir.

507
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,650
I knocked

508
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,380
your vegetables.

509
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,260
It's fine.

510
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,610
How about this?

511
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,050
I buy them all.

512
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,780
It's too much.

513
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,570
Take it.

514
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:49,690
This...

515
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,780
It's fine.

516
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,900
I need to ask you

517
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,490
about something.

518
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,860
You look strange to me.

519
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,420
You're not local, right?

520
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,570
I come here to visit a relative.

521
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,780
Do you have a name?

522
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,380
I've lived here for decades.

523
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,420
I know almost everyone.

524
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,740
Perfect.

525
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,820
Do you know Zang Hai?

526
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,010
He is my cousin.

527
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:09,980
I know this young man.

528
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,050
I saw him growing up.

529
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:16,420
However, he left the town several months ago.

530
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,010
When did he came to this town?

531
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,780
Let me see.

532
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,780
He've come here for over a decade.

533
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,980
He lost his parents

534
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,530
and was adopted by a carpenter in the town.

535
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,130
Where is the carpenter?

536
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,300
He died.

537
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,010
There was a fire accident

538
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,530
several months ago.

539
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,340
The carpenter was burned alive.

540
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,610
Zang Hai was cutting wood in the mountain

541
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,130
and survived the accident.

542
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,090
He must be heart-broken

543
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,940
so he decided to leave the town.

544
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,090
Thanks, sir.

545
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,090
Find anything?

546
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,260
Mr. Lu.

547
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,690
The old man didn't lie.

548
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,050
Zang Hai is clean.

549
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,170
He's too clean.

550
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,340
Do we go back now and report what we've found?

551
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,490
This is not how we do things.

552
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,490
This man is a threat to Mr. Cao.

553
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,090
If we report that Zang Hai is clean,

554
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,530
it means Mr. Cao is wrong.

555
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,740
When Mr. Cao suspects someone,

556
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,530
this man has to be dirty.

557
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,650
Send a pigeon letter

558
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,010
saying Zang Hai is dirty.

559
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,650
We must kill him and get rid of the threat.

560
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,690
Copy that.

561
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,860
What's going on?

562
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,010
Sir.

563
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,610
Why are you doing that?

564
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,780
You're twisting the truth

565
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,780
and seeking trouble.

566
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,380
The evidence is revealing itself.

567
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,300
Zang Hai has so many accomplices here.

568
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,380
He is lying about his identity.

569
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,340
Kill them all.

570
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,650
Sir, give me a bowl of wonton.

571
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,300
Okay.

572
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,860
Enjoy.

573
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,380
Thanks.

574
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,780
Sir.

575
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,420
A bowl of wonton.

576
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:00,980
Wait.

577
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,820
Don't turn back. Listen.

578
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,130
The Surveillance Officer is watching you.

579
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:07,780
I know.

580
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,210
Your wonton.

581
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,420
Thanks.

582
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,260
Thanks.

583
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,380
Cao Jingxian sends his foster son Lu Jin

584
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,530
to investigate your identity in Qingquan Town.

585
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,380
Our men failed to stop him.

586
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,860
He's left Qingquan Town two days before

587
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,900
and was heading back to Capital.

588
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,650
He should be in Jiangzhou now.

589
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,300
Cao Jingxian suspects my identity?

590
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,980
At this rate,

591
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,650
he would arrive to the capital in two days.

592
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,980
We should ambush Lu along the way.

593
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:36,820
No.

594
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,340
If he is dead,

595
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,740
Cao Jingxian would suspect me more.

596
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,090
Watch him closely and let him go.

597
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,650
Hai.

598
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,300
This man is a trouble.

599
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,210
If he is back in Capital,

600
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,340
we would not get a chance to finish him.

601
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,090
We need a plan right now.

602
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,940
We must not allow him to meet Cao Jingxian.

603
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,130
There is only

604
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,210
one solution.

605
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,740
I need time

606
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,170
to figure it out.

607
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,300
We're running out of time.

608
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,820
I'll take care of the Surveillance Officer for you.

609
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,820
Check.

610
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:19,940
Thanks.

611
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,170
Welcome to come back again.

612
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,300
Sir.

613
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,170
Are you alright?

614
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,690
Move!

615
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,740
I'm so sorry.

616
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,460
Move! Now!

617
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,090
Let's go.

618
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:12,860
See this one.

619
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,380
So lucky today.

620
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,340
Let's go home, man.

621
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,010
It's late.

622
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,940
Okay. I would catch you later.

623
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:24,260
Fine.

624
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,900
See you later.

625
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,210
Be quick!

626
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,170
