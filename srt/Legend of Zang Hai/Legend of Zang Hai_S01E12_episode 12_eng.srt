2
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:30,100
   

3
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,773
   

4
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,020
And I ran into an old friend.

5
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,160
I know he came back to kill Father and avenge his family.

6
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,640
I told him to leave the capital 
    

7
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,340
and never come back.

8
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,640
Mother, did I do the right thing?

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,180
 Zhinu, come and see. 

10
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,310
 It's a rare flower. 

11
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,640
 When fully grown, its root and stem can be used in medicine, 

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,730
 while its flowers and seeds are poisonous. 

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,050
Who is there?

14
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,180
- Second Young Master. 
 - Why are you still here?

15
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,300
I still have pending business to attend to.

16
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,120
Not afraid I'll report you?

17
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,430
I was afraid.

18
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,380
That's why I came to kill you today.

19
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,560
- You... 
 - But I've changed my mind.

20
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,160
Listen.

21
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,070
I won't let you kill my father just because you helped me.

22
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,110
You'd better give up.

23
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,440
What are you doing?

24
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,500
Look, Second Young Master.

25
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,150
Is it the only flower growing on this grave?

26
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,710
What's so strange about flowers growing on the grave?

27
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,820
Have you seen this flower anywhere in the tomb?

28
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,580
This is the "Solitary South Star." The whole plant is poisonous.

29
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,400
Why is this poisonous plant

30
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,010
only growing and flourishing on your mother's grave?

31
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,150
Perhaps the wind carried the seeds from somewhere else.

32
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,090
It's a poisonous herb unique to South Zhaozhou.

33
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,490
The wind can't carry its seeds this far.

34
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,150
What are you implying?

35
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,590
Either someone planted it on your mother's grave on purpose.

36
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:40,460
Or your mother's remains in the grave carry the seeds.

37
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,930
But I think you know that the former is hardly a possibility.

38
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,710
What are you implying?

39
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,930
If I am right, your mother died from this poison.

40
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,030
That's impossible, my mother died from illness.

41
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,750
I never left her side for a second before she died.

42
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,160
No one could have poisoned her.

43
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,840
The Solitary South Star may not be as toxic as arsenic,

44
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,530
but with a little intake of its poison every day,

45
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,710
the toxin will accumulate in the organs over the years.

46
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,560
Eventually, the victim dies.

47
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,360
If you want the truth,

48
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,700
all you need to do is exhume your mother's remains.

49
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,440
You want me to dig up my mother's grave?

50
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,680
Don't you want to know the truth?

51
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,510
Perhaps the one who poisoned her

52
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,460
is the very person you revere and trust the most.

53
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,000
Zang Hai, you're an animal!

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,700
What are you implying?

55
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,280
You're saying that my father killed my mother?

56
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,260
Nothing is impossible in this world.

57
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,270
You want to dig up my mother's grave and kill my father.

58
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,310
You fabricate lies to achieve your goal.

59
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,800
You are insane!

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,190
Then tell me.

61
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,040
Why are the Zhuang family's ancestors buried in the southeast of the mausoleum

62
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,370
while your mother is buried on the north side alone with such a plain grave?

63
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,080
Why haven't they moved her memorial tablet into the ancestral hall?

64
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,230
Shut up!

65
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,430
Most importantly, your mother's been gone for years.

66
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,470
Why has your father never once visited her grave?

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,280
Why?

68
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,700
Ask someone you know.

69
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,430
See if this flower is poisonous, like I said.

70
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,650
If you don't believe it is toxic,

71
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,470
do you dare to eat it?

72
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,850
I won't believe a word you say.

73
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,510
I'll give you one last chance.

74
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,290
Get out of my face!

75
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,560
During tomorrow's ancestral rites,

76
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,960
open your eyes and see for yourself whether I'm telling the truth.

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,640
 Aim. 

78
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,310
 Shoulders relaxed. Hands steady. 

79
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,410
 Exhale slowly. 

80
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,530
 Shoot. 

81
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,970
 I hit the bull's-eye. 

82
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,340
 Well done, Xing'er! 

83
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,470
 Have some water. 

84
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,390
 Mother, you promised to make me nut-filled pastries tonight if I hit the bull's-eye. 

85
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,620
 What a little foodie. 

86
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,120
 Will you not practice if I don't make you food? 

87
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,090
 This kid's got the same guts I had back in the day. 

88
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,740
 The next general in the family will be him. 

89
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,630
 Make sure he practices riding and archery every day. 

90
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,520
 Don't let him slack off. 

91
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,120
 I can't lead troops like you. 

92
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,310
 How can I shoulder such a responsibility? 

93
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,060
 Please teach him yourself. 

94
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,130
 All right. Keep going. 

95
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,630
My Lord. My Lady.

96
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,750
The carriages are ready.

97
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,040
The servants are already preparing the incense and offerings at the mausoleum.

98
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,550
   

99
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,600
Have you brought all the hunting stuff?

100
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,930
Yes. Rest assured, My Lady.

101
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,150
Father.

102
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,870
You got up early today.

103
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,080
I dare not be late for the ancestor veneration.

104
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,740
Good to know.

105
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,960
I don't see Official Zang today.

106
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,320
Isn't he coming?

107
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,960
He wasn't feeling well last night and asked for leave.

108
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,650
Let's set off.

109
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,470
- Anything else? 
 - I...

110
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,530
Zhixing, let's not miss the hour for the ancestral rites.

111
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,440
- We can talk on the way... 
- Zhixing.

112
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,670
I have business to discuss with Father.

113
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,730
Why don't you wait until we arrive?

114
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,630
Sandalwood's fragrance lingers, pure and long.

115
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,350
Steadying the state, our ancestors' virtue is strong.

116
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,290
Jade cups hold fine wine, like amber's glow.

117
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,870
With cleansed hands we drink, their grace to show.

118
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,830
My honored ancestors, your unworthy descendant, Zhuang Luyin,

119
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,450
brought his family here to pay homage.

120
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,600
The family is thriving, my wife is virtuous, and my sons are filial.

121
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,790
May your noble spirits guard our way.

122
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,780
Pay respect.

123
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,040
Rise.

124
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,330
Pay respect again.

125
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,730
Rise.

126
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,330
Pay respect again.

127
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,090
Rise.

128
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,420
Rites completed.

129
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,690
My Lord, the offerings are blessed by the ancestors now.

130
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,120
Eating them brings good luck.

131
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,870
My Lord,

132
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,380
these desserts have been left outside for a long time.

133
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,220
They must be covered in dust.

134
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,790
Let them make some new ones.

135
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,440
Wrap the incense ash up and bury it at home.

136
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,570
It also brings good luck.

137
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,780
Let's do as you say.

138
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,720
Where did this flower come from?

139
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,690
I have no idea.

140
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,700
My Lady, is there anything wrong with this flower?

141
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,510
Why are you asking?

142
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,950
- Throw it away. 
 - Understood.

143
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,800
Father.

144
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,710
What now?

145
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,030
You haven't visited my mother for so long.

146
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,230
You haven't visited her ever since she passed away.

147
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,870
I'm going to the hunting ground later.

148
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,440
You don't like hunting, so go ahead and visit your mother.

149
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,800
Zhifu, see that?

150
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,380
I must retrieve it today.

151
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,210
- You two, go check. 
  - Father! 

152
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,120
Nice shot.

153
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,090
Why are you here? I thought you didn't like hunting.

154
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,330
You taught me archery when I was a child. I haven't forgotten it.

155
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,000
You indulge in pleasure and never practice.

156
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,660
Come with us since you're here.

157
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,210
Father.

158
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,030
I saw a little deer heading in that direction.

159
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,710
I'll take a look.

160
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,200
 Father! 

161
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,050
What's wrong?

162
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,610
   

163
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,760
What are you doing?

164
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,840
You won't come to see my mother.

165
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,150
I had no choice but to lure you here.

166
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,630
Don't you miss her at all?

167
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,210
Don't you want to see her?

168
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,150
You loved and cared for her so much.

169
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,560
Why have you changed?

170
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,120
Why has everything changed?

171
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,950
It pains me to think about her.

172
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:05,430
So, I'd rather not think about her or visit her.

173
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,710
Do you still feel sad for her?

174
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,950
Enough. Let's go back.

175
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,210
Father, wait!

176
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,630
The flowers are blooming on Mother's grave.

177
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,750
Please take them back and keep them in the vase.

178
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:29,060
If she misses you, perhaps she can see you through these flowers.

179
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,750
I'm sure she misses you a lot.

180
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,240
The talk of the spirits is all nonsense.

181
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,390
We martial arts practitioners don't believe that.

182
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,720
No matter what, they bloomed on my mother's grave.

183
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,870
At least, bring them home for decoration.

184
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,830
A real man shouldn't be obsessed with flowers.

185
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,510
You missed your mother a lot today.

186
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,130
I won't scold you for that.

187
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,290
It's getting late. Let's go.

188
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,851
   

189
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,980
You put the flowers there, didn't you?

190
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,270
Speculation is groundless. It's better to see it with your own eyes.

191
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,870
Your mother was buried outside of the mausoleum without an outer coffin.

192
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,690
That's why the coffin decayed so fast.

193
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,630
The status of the living ones is demonstrated through chariots, robes, and estates.

194
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,110
That of the deceased is shown through coffins, shrouds, and graves.

195
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,480
It's hard to imagine that the Marquis's wife was buried like this.

196
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,950
I'm going to open it. Wait for me up there if you can't bear to see it.

197
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,660
No need.

198
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,430
This is my mother.

199
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,480
Come on. Three, two, one.

200
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,790
Your mother's wrist bones are deformed

201
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,920
and obviously thinner than the ones of ordinary people.

202
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,400
The carpal bones of her left hand are also deformed.

203
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,230
Before she died, had she experienced weakness,

204
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,120
dizziness, headaches, and numbness in the limbs?

205
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,540
At first, she was just dizzy and drowsy.

206
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,450
The physicians couldn't do much.

207
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,270
Then things got worse and worse.

208
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,310
She was dizzy, nauseous, and listless all day long.

209
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,230
In the end,

210
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,310
she was mumbling nonsense,

211
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,030
having convulsions, and suffering unbearable pain.

212
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,160
That's right.

213
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,920
These symptoms point to Solitary South Star poisoning.

214
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,790
Those who are poisoned by that flower have something in common.

215
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,720
Their bones shrink and deform.

216
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,240
Besides, your mother was mumbling nonsense.

217
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,860
That's a sign of severe intoxication as the poison affects the brain.

218
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,220
Are you sure?

219
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,720
I've been learning from my master since childhood.

220
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I can't be mistaken.

221
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,880
I think your mother passed away

222
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,480
with some seeds left undigested.

223
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,920
As time went by,

224
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,270
the seeds got into the soil with the corpse liquid

225
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,620
and took root to sprout.

226
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,220
My mother was the kindest person...

227
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,700
who always endured everything.

228
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,580
Why?

229
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,050
Why?

230
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,570
Why?

231
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:09,000
One does not need to be evil to invite disaster.

232
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,350
This poison can't kill anyone overnight.

233
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:18,330
It only erupts when it accumulates to a certain extent over time.

234
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:23,000
That means the culprit was close to your mother.

235
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,750
Strangers couldn't have poisoned her little by little without being caught.

236
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,060
I told you to pay attention during the rites.

237
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,810
What did you notice?

238
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,440
Jiang Xiang.

239
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,790
What's the deal with that bunch of flowers in the mausoleum?

240
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:43,260
I assume one of the ignorant maids made a mistake and put them there.

241
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,960
What an ignorant girl.

242
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,300
Find her and kill her.

243
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,820
Understood.

244
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,310
But it must have been a coincidence.

245
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,400
Please don't be bothered, My Lady.

246
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,260
I really hope it was just a coincidence.

247
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,860
I'm afraid someone must have done it on purpose.

248
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,880
Are you saying... that the second young master did it?

249
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,460
Do you think that he's suspecting something?

250
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,140
I don't think so.

251
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,550
He comes to the mausoleum in a disheveled manner every year

252
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,070
and it's the same this time.

253
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,880
There's nothing different.

254
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,900
If he had found out the truth, he would have made a big fuss about it.

255
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,320
He wouldn't remain silent.

256
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,550
Besides, so what if he found out about it?

257
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,240
He has no proof.

258
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,850
And he's too much of a loser to cause you any trouble.

259
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,870
My Lady, you're truly farsighted to make him a good-for-nothing.

260
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,690
She was in charge of the food and supplies.

261
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,790
And my mother fell ill one year after she returned to the capital.

262
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:09,260
 Zengzi said, "How profound indeed is the virtue of filial piety!" 

263
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,770
 You write so well, Xing'er. 

264
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,400
 Mother, are you all right? 

265
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,200
In the beginning, they called so many physicians

266
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,400
but nobody could cure her.

267
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,130
Her condition even deteriorated.

268
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,920
I was so worried that I couldn't play.

269
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,850
I stayed by her side from day to night.

270
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,530
But she never got better.

271
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,330
Later,

272
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,420
I went to my father.

273
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,250
But he wouldn't see her.

274
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,140
 Mother. 

275
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,620
 Mother. 

276
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,110
 Please don't die. 

277
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,880
 Please don't leave me. 

278
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:04,150
 From now on, no matter where I am, 

279
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,430
 I will always protect you. 

280
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,480
 You must listen to your father. 

281
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,200
 Why doesn't Father come to see you? 

282
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,310
 Does Father not want us anymore? 

283
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,030
 It's not like that. 

284
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,240
 It's not like that. 

285
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,480
 Xing'er, 

286
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,840
 he loves you more than anyone in this world, 

287
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,630
 no matter what. 

288
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,430
 I won't ask you... 

289
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,730
 to be a man of great achievements... 

290
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,100
 like your father. 

291
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,560
 I only hope... 

292
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,940
 that you can be happy. 

293
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,150
 This is my only wish. 

294
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,910
 You are... 

295
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,640
 on your own from now on. 

296
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,180
 I can't keep you company anymore. 

297
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,920
 Mother! 

298
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,210
 Mother! 

299
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,350
 Mother! 

300
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,350
 Please don't leave me! 

301
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,330
 Please! 

302
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,170
 - Please!  
 - Until she passed away,

303
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,960
my father hadn't seen her once.

304
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,130
I never understood...

305
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,240
why my mother slowly lost my father's favor

306
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,220
and why my father abandoned my mother and me overnight.

307
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,070
I knew something was wrong the moment I saw this flower

308
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,640
on your mother's grave last night.

309
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,790
I have asked around about you at the Marquis's mansion.

310
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,350
All the servants told me the same story.

311
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:20,350
They said that your mother cheated on your father.

312
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,550
She used her health condition

313
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,720
as an excuse to have an affair with a physician.

314
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,590
Nonsense!

315
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,070
My mother loved my father deeply.

316
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,720
She wouldn't have done that.

317
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,900
Do you want the truth?

318
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,030
Jiang Xiang used to have an unremarkable maid.

319
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,230
Five years ago, she was thrown out for doing something wrong.

320
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,380
I managed to find her today and discovered the truth.

321
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,620
Jiang Xiang instructed her

322
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:04,810
to spread rumors about your mother having an affair with the physician.

323
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,170
 Don't make a scene. Let me handle it. 

324
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,480
"If you want to accuse someone, it isn't hard to find excuses."

325
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,830
To destroy a woman, ruining her chastity

326
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,890
has been the most effective method for thousands of years.

327
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,340
If you still have doubts, I can bring you that maid.

328
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,050
Talk to her.

329
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,710
Does...

330
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,870
my father know?

331
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,830
I looked into it.

332
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,340
His Majesty reclaimed military power from your father after he returned.

333
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,200
To gain a firm foothold in the court,

334
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,960
he desperately needed the help

335
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,760
of Jiang Xiang's father Jiang Jin, the Minister of Rites.

336
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,290
Presented with power, he chose Jiang Xiang.

337
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,710
I'm afraid that was when he started neglecting your mother.

338
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:06,060
And Jiang Xiang started poisoning my mother at that point.

339
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,920
Of course, there are ways to find out

340
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,380
whether the Marquis was involved.

341
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,612
But you will have to choose.

342
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:31,020
Will you continue to investigate it...

343
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,530
or will you play dumb for the rest of your life?

344
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,880
My father has seen it.

345
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,790
He knows.

346
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,560
He knows everything.

347
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,840
â™«  I conceal the ambition in my eyes  â™«

348
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:16,540
â™«  In my palm, I hold a dangerous desire  â™«

349
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,000
â™«  Turbulent waves hide in my sleeves  â™«

350
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,660
â™«  Silent like the clap of thunder  â™«

351
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,140
â™«  The depth of shrewdness   â™«

352
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,580
â™«  Can't escape  â™«

353
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,480
â™«  My sharp eyes  â™«

354
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,770
That's right. He conspired with Jiang Xiang to kill my mother.

355
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,730
It seems he has long since stopped needing a son like me.

356
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,210
I disagree, Second Young Master.

357
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,340
The Marquis's love is not unchangeable.

358
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,790
He used to love you because he loved your mother

359
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,820
and because he thought you could carry on his mantle.

360
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,000
He now values your brother

361
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,210
because Jiang Xiang's maiden family was useful to him.

362
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,590
Meanwhile, Jiang Xiang has made you a good-for-nothing.

363
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:16,830
He only likes those who are useful to him.

364
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,170
Such affection is not difficult to come by.

365
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,010
As long as you trust me and do as I say,

366
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:29,030
I can help you get everything you want.

367
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,640
I just want to avenge my mother.

368
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,410
Jiang Xiang is easy to deal with.

369
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:38,650
All she wants is to make Zhuang Zhifu the next Marquis.

370
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,600
Once Zhuang Zhifu falls out of favor,

371
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,190
Jiang Xiang will have no one to rely on.

372
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:48,690
The best revenge on her is to destroy her greatest hope.

373
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,200
She looks down on you at the moment.

374
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,790
It happens to be your greatest advantage.

375
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,490
Jiang Xiang deserves to die.

376
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,170
But now, even my father has become my enemy.

377
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,880
Zang Hai, y father is your enemy.

378
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,480
You want him dead to avenge your whole family.

379
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,820
But why are you helping me?

380
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:29,160
I need some information from the Marquis of Pingjin.

381
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,240
It's very important to me.

382
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,680
But you can't ask him.

383
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,070
You need someone to get that information for you.

384
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,030
That's right.

385
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,000
My entire family was annihilated.

386
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,240
There are two other culprits besides your father.

387
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,140
One was the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director, Cao Jingjian.

388
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:52,000
And I still haven't figured out who the other person is.

389
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,400
I have to find this person.

390
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,340
I can't afford to alert my enemy before then.

391
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,690
You want me to figure out who this person is through my father.

392
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,680
This is your condition for helping me?

393
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,240
That's right.

394
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,860
Once you get an answer, what will you do?

395
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,650
I overstepped.

396
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,690
You infiltrated into our house for revenge.

397
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,240
I must take revenge.

398
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,020
If you won't let me, feel free to tell the Marquis who I am right now.

399
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,420
He killed my mother.

400
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,770
I won't forgive him.

401
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,340
But still, he is my father.

402
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,750
The person who wiped out my family is right there

403
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,640
but I can't kill him.

404
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,720
Instead, I have to be close to him.

405
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,640
You know who killed your mother

406
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,840
yet you have to be his good son, showing respect and affection.

407
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,590
How is it not a harsh torment on you?

408
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:17,890
Blood for blood. This rule has remained unchanged for thousands of years.

409
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,040
I will try to help you.

410
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,270
But I'm not sure if I can help you take revenge.

411
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,190
Don't blame me if I change my mind.

412
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,510
You covered for me and helped me find my enemy.

413
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,340
I'm more than grateful. I won't ask for more.

414
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:50,970
If you change your mind when the time comes, I won't complain.

415
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,960
I shall honor our pact.

416
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,070
Please help me take revenge.

417
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:03,920
From now on, I will do whatever you say.

418
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:12,770
From now on, we will share weal and woe.

419
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:35,080
Within a year, I will help him become his father's most trusted son.

420
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:41,190
Once he figures out who the third culprit is, I'll carry out the plan.

421
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,300
Even if you do your part,

422
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,440
what if he can't get anything out of his father in the end?

423
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,800
Can you wait?

424
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,840
I am enlightened.

425
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,500
I didn't bide my time for a decade just to win some petty battle.

426
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,930
I will be more careful from now on.

427
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,490
Xiao Hai, let me tell you about Cao Jingxian.

428
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,780
He appears to be merely colleagues with the Marquis of Pingjin.

429
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,270
But as the Vice Minister of Works, Zhuang Zhifu maintains the imperial gardens,

430
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,630
and that involves the Directorate of Ceremonial.

431
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,210
My guess is, that much of the money embezzled by Zhuang Zhifu

432
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,510
has ended up in Cao Jingxian's pocket.

433
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,820
That's expected.

434
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,150
Besides, he's surrounded by layers of security.

435
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,980
He's either in the palace or at his private residence in the capital.

436
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,640
It's almost impossible to reach him.

437
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:45,960
But there'll be an opportunity in two months.

438
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,030
What are you referring to?

439
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,400
The ground polo competition held by the imperial court

440
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,000
to strengthen the fitness of men in Great Yong.

441
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,890
It's quite popular among the young masters of the noble families.

442
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,180
The Seal-Holding Eunuch Director

443
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,850
brings rewards to the champion on behalf of His Majesty every year.

444
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,770
That will be your chance to meet Cao Jingxian.

445
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,850
The opportunity comes at just the right time.

446
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,880
Aren't you tired of practicing Wuji Fist over and over again all day long?

447
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,190
- Try something else. 
 - You are the disciple and he is the master.

448
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,490
And you're slacking off here?

449
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,610
Zhinu, what brings you here?

450
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:55,770
What did I tell you? Call me Zang Hai from now on.

451
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:02,190
Isn't this Second Young Master Zhuang?

452
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,510
You recognize me?

453
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:08,870
Sir, why did you ask me out and bring me here?

454
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,040
You are going to practice martial arts here.

455
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,180
Since you want to regain your father's favor,

456
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,880
then you can't follow your brother's path.

457
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,840
We have to find another way.

458
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,690
We must convince your father that you have the potential

459
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,680
to inherit his mantle.

460
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,960
Shi Lei, see if he is cut out to be a martial artist.

461
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,660
All right.

462
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,640
Are you crazy? His father is the Marquis of Pingjin.

463
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,060
What if he figures out who you are?

464
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,590
He already knows.

465
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,960
- Then... 
 - Of course, he also knows who you are.

466
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,800
Then why is he still alive?

467
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,440
Rest assured. He has allied with me.

468
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,710
He will be practicing martial arts here.

469
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,790
Make sure Shi Lei teaches him well.

470
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,150
Disciple, he is more gifted than you.

471
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,840
I see potential in him.

472
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,630
Shut up.

473
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,190
He idles around and does nothing all day long.

474
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,840
Will he be able to do it?

475
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,480
That depends on your ability.

476
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,760
I'm entrusting him to you two.

477
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,510
You have two months to make him a martial artist.

478
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,540
Sir, can we go somewhere else?

479
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,780
This place is run down. I don't even see a decent table.

480
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,250
Besides, where do I sleep? So...

481
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,780
I'll stop.

482
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,960
Sir, it's fine here.

483
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,460
From now on, learn martial arts from these two masters.

484
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:47,680
Remember. You promised to do whatever I say.

485
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,530
This is your first step toward a transformation.

486
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,320
Of course, I'll be busy, too.

487
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,180
I have to work on your reputation in the capital.

488
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,160
Fists facing down.

489
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,000
Can you squat properly or not?

490
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,230
Yes, I can.

491
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,030
Look at me.

492
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,920
This is a proper horse stance.

493
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,730
I see.

494
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,360
Can I have a bite?

495
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,880
Don't slack off.

496
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,710
I'm thirsty and hungry.

497
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,610
Let me have a bite, please.

498
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,320
Keep practicing and we'll see.

499
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,570
Turn around. Squat.

500
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,630
   

501
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:44,660
Official Lu, please let me see Eunuch Cao for a second.

502
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,780
I will be reassured as long as everything is all right.

503
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,420
Why do you want to see our ord, Official Chu?

504
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,400
I observed the celestial signs.

505
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
The Mandate Star shone brightly.

506
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,000
I read the signs.

507
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,230
Eunuch Cao serves as His Majesty's closest court official.

508
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,670
So, he is the Mandate Star.

509
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,230
Great news is to be expected.

510
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,960
- I... 
 - Since you don't have something to say,

511
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,120
please go back, Official Chu.

512
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,230
I was humiliated by others.

513
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,880
Please do me justice.

514
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,440
Official Chu,

515
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,360
you are the Imperial Astronomer, a fifth-rank official.

516
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,760
Who dares to humiliate you?

517
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,960
I feel embarrassed.

518
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,880
I am being humiliated by the aide, Zang Hai, of the Marquis of Pingjin.

519
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,230
This person is insidious and vicious.

520
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,280
And he has become the top aide to the Marquis.

521
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,320
I have offended him.

522
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm afraid that he is going to target me.

523
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,230
I seek your protection.

524
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,590
Aren't you backed by the Marquis?

525
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,760
What brings you to the Surveillance Office?

526
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,510
Official Lu, please don't say that.

527
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,510
I don't work for anyone.

528
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:59,470
I only serve the imperial court and His Majesty.

529
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,360
If Eunuch Cao needs me to do anything one day,

530
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,640
I will devote myself to it entirely until the last breath.

531
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,920
Understood.

532
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,180
Official Chu, please go back.

 â™ª Where Southern hills stand dotted in woe... â™ª 

537
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,360
Not even worth a second look.

538
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,980
Understood.

539
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,840
