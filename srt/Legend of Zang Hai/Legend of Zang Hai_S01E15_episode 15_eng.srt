1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:20,010



2
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:30,000
   

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,900
   

4
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,430
Lu Yan.

5
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,760
Say, would your brother betray me?

6
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,770
Never.

7
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,200
Look.

8
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,300
Is it his handwriting?

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 The Marquis of Pingjin has found out about the object. 

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,300
 I will go undercover and investigate. 

11
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,900
 If I am dead, it proves he is lying. 

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,800
Yes.

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,400
I asked Lu Jin to investigate Zang Hai.

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,610
The evidence has led to Zhuang Luyin.

15
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,160
He pretended to defect to Zhuang Luyin but was silenced instead.

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,800
And all of this is about the object.

17
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
Zhuang Luyin,

18
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,400
what have you found behind our backs?

19
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,250
You went so far as to kill Lu Jin to prevent this secret from getting back to me.

20
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,800
Lu Yan, arrange a proper funeral for Lu Jin.

21
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,700
One more thing.

23
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,900
Bring your brother to me.

24
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,860
What did Cao Jingxian come for today?

25
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,280
He was looking for you,

26
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,530
claiming that Mr. Lu came to our residence last night.

27
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,000
But later, someone else reported that Mr. Lu drowned in the Guangji River.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,100
There must be something going on.

29
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,900
But I haven't figured it out yet.

30
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,710
I'm afraid Lu Jin's death may not be as simple

31
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,360
as an enemy seeking vengeance as Cao Jingxian states.

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,900
I have a bold theory if you'll listen.

33
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,600
The Imperial Surveillance Office under Eunuch Cao

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,200
is monitoring all sorts of the capital's officials in the shadows.

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,700
Since he has nothing against you,

36
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,180
why are you drawing his attention suddenly?

37
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,180
Has something big happened recently, or has there been a change in the residence

38
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,200
that raises his attention and suspicion?

39
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,400
What do you think is the reason?

40
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,120
As a newcomer to the capital, there are many things I'm not sure about.

41
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,400
I don't understand Eunuch Cao well enough.

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,800
But he arrested me today without waiting for you to appear.

43
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,640
It seems that I'm on his watch list now.

44
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,060
As for the reasons behind this, I don't dare to guess.

45
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,790
He and I indeed have a history.

46
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,900
We've been at peace all these years.

47
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,100
But now he is looking for trouble without reason.

48
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,530
I think he is jealous that I've recruited a remarkable talent like you.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
But My Lord,

50
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,500
would Eunuch Cao really give you a hard time because of my little amount of skill?

51
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,060
Enough.

52
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,200
Let me think on this matter.

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,980
You may leave.

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,830
My Lord,

55
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,990
could you send some guards to protect me for the next few days?

56
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,970
I offended Eunuch Cao today.

57
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,820
Without anyone to protect me, I fear there will be danger.

58
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
If he decides to kill you,

59
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,760
any number of guards I give you would be useless.

60
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,230
But I have a plan to keep you safe.

61
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,290
I'll tell you this.

62
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,020
I will arrange a position for you in the court.

63
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,460
As long as you show your face in front of the Emperor,

64
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,430
it'll be more difficult for him to lay a hand on you.

65
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,020
I just want to stay by your side and serve you.

66
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,000
I never intended to leave you.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,200
Don't worry.

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,730
Even if you become a court official, you will still be one of mine.

69
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,300
Thanks, My Lord. I am at your service.

70
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,600
Come on, Master. A toast to you.

71
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,100
Drink.

72
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,830
The Marquis of Pingjin is going to promote you?

73
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,540
Which rank? How much is your salary?

74
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,180
It isn't set yet.

75
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,520
And given his attitude, I think

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,830
he'll give me a low position that is just enough to go to court.

77
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,510
But my hopes are on the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

78
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,900
You want to get rid of Chu Huaiming?

79
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,700
Chu Huaiming is evil and views others' lives as worthless.

80
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,910
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau under him has become total chaos.

81
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,500
I won't allow him to continue ruining my father's legacy.

82
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,390
There's another reason.

83
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,820
After joining the Marquis of Pingjin's residence, most of the tasks he's had me do

84
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,500
seem to be to find a secret object.

85
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,600
Looks like he's still not given up on that.

86
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,950
He chose you because you are familiar with geomancy techniques.

87
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,710
He thinks you can help him find it.

88
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,200
That's why I have to join the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

89
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,700
Chu Huaiming has not found it after looking for so many years.

90
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,320
At least I need to convince the Marquis of Pingjin that I can find it.

91
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,700
   

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,300
A gift for you.

93
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,060
No logo.

94
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,230
Who knows what stall you got this from.

95
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,470
I made it myself.

96
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,700
Please forgive my poor craftsmanship, Madam Xiang.

97
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Mr. Zang, you're really versatile.

98
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,880
Beautiful flower carving.

99
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,820
Has Cao Jingxian found anything strange about Lu Jin's death?

100
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,430
He only suspects the Marquis of Pingjin

101
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,680
but he won't dare to do anything.

102
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,140
I used to just think that you were profoundly wise.

103
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,510
Now, it looks like you are also quite bold.

104
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,880
Don't you think we are the same?

105
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,300
Then wouldn't you say you should pay me back on the favors you owe?

106
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,600
Of course.

107
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,860
At your bidding.

108
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,510
The Ghost Festival is coming.

109
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,400
Are you available?

110
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,630
Then go out with me.

111
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,960
On the day of the Ghost Festival?

112
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,800
Are you scared of ghosts?

113
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,300
Of course not.

114
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,440
I just think this isn't enough to pay the debt.

115
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,140
It's fine.

116
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,790
Favor is different from debt.

117
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,600
Debt goes down as you pay it.

118
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,800
But repaying favors builds them up.

119
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,930
You will owe me even more in the future.

120
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,900
Deal.

121
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,500
Then I will do as you say.

122
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:18,226
   

123
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
My Lord. See?

124
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,280
Doesn't the cloud look like a rabbit?

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,990
Zang Hai, today is the Ghost Festival.

126
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,500
Does the cloud indicate something?

127
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,330
My Lord.

128
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,430
On a day like this, the cloud is indeed unique.

129
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,510
But what I'm good at is reading stars and moons

130
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,740
and their relation to the seasons.

131
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,680
Clouds change constantly. Based on that, I don't dare to speak about it.

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,200
Idiot, are you done staring? Come up already.

133
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,190
Sit.

134
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,900
You look sharp today.

135
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,670
It is the Ghost Festival. It's a festival for you.

136
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,480
For me?

137
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,330
I'm not dead yet. Why?

138
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,260
A ghost of poverty is still a ghost.

139
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,000
What about you?

140
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Me?

141
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,620
I'm a ghost of loneliness.

142
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,700
You have so many companions around you every day in Zhen Tower.

143
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,000
You still feel lonely?

144
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,600
Do you know why I named it Zhen Tower?

145
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,980
Free from worries.

146
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,200
Smart.

147
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,100
But it turns out, everyone else is free from worries, so they're all left to me.

148
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,850
But your Zhen Tower provides shelter to drifters in the capital.

149
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,200
Zhen Tower is still too small.

150
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,800
If we could have a thousand, ten thousand,

151
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,400
then perhaps we could accommodate all the homeless in the country.

152
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,900
You're right, Miss Xiang.

153
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,200
Why do you suddenly call me Miss Xiang?

154
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,620
Don't you usually call me "Madam Xiang"?

155
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,000
Because I think tonight, you, Miss Xiang,

156
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,900
are different from the usual Madam Xiang in Zhen Tower.

157
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,350
Suit yourself, Young Master Zang.

158
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,420
Is she pretty?

159
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,630
Yes.

160
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,080
Then is she prettier, or am I?

161
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,750
Of course it is you, Miss Xiang.

162
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,000
Pretty how?

163
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,600
Your brows look like willow leaves.

164
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
You have starlight in your eyes.

165
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,260
Ordinary women couldn't compare.

166
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,270
Then let me ask you.

167
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,090
Do you want to see me often?

168
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,230
No answer?

169
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,700
Are you sure you want to see me often?

170
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,920
Each time we have met, something bad has happened.

171
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,650
Who said that?

172
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,270
I find it interesting.

173
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,990
Isn't it?

174
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,100
I didn't expect there to be so many river lanterns here.

175
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,260
I ordered them to drift ten thousand lanterns.

176
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,040
You must think that I have ten thousand relatives gone.

177
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,320
How could I think that?

178
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,500
Why did you drift so many lanterns?

179
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,300
Do you have someone to mourn?

180
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,180
Because I'm rich.

181
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,280
I can tell now.

182
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,300
I've heard that if you write a loved one's name on the river lantern,

183
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,400
you can send your love to them.

184
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,370
You should write them. I heard your parents and relatives are all gone.

185
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,950
I'm not qualified to mourn them yet.

186
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,500
Then leave your longing for them in your heart for now.

187
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,800
Listen.

188
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,280
Do you hear something?

189
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,400
Nothing.

190
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,030
It is very quiet here.

191
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,160
That's how it should be.

192
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,860
I love quiet and spacious places.

193
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,700
Lie down.

194
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,480
Why are you so uptight?

195
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,100
Is this chair comfortable?

196
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,200
Yes, very comfortable.

197
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,390
Idiot.

198
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,500
Zang Hai, since you're so skilled in geomancy,

199
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,900
do you recognize these stars?

200
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,790
Look.

201
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,100
There are 28 star mansions.

202
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,800
That's Seven Mansions of the Eastern Azure Dragon.

203
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,020
Then, for West, South, and North, there are the white tiger,

204
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,900
the vermilion bird, and black tortoise, respectively.

205
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,700
Look. Look at the group of stars over there.

206
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,970
- Which ones? 
 - Those.

207
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,490
Does it look like a pouty little mouth?

208
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,480
- A mouth? 
 - No?

209
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,000
A little bit.

210
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,200
Although the four stars you speak of combine to build the Winnowing Basket Mansion.

211
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,520
Next to it is Tail Mansion.

212
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,310
They combine to build the tail of the azure dragon.

213
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,630
I don't think it looks like a dragon's tail.

214
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,920
Look at those stars over there.

215
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,400
Those?

216
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,800
Does it look like a string of pearls on someone's neck?

217
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,510
Why are you laughing? You disagree?

218
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,200
They do look like that. You're right, Miss Xiang.

219
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,900
They are called Net Mansion.

220
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,850
People from other countries really do consider it a sign of a pearled beauty.

221
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,590
Right?

222
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,920
Looks like I can read stars, too.

223
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,380
My way is much more interesting than yours.

224
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,300
Look.

225
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:26,300
The chain of beads has an owner, a teary girl.

226
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,590
Although she has treasures,

227
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,240
the stars in the sky are all her tears.

228
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,490
Teardrops?

229
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,720
Why is she crying?

230
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,930
She probably was married off to someone far away and hasn't lived happily.

231
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,400
She has been waiting for someone

232
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,000
for her entire life to bring her home, but no one did.

233
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,100
Her family at home must miss her a lot.

234
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
I don't know.

235
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,730
Maybe after her teardrops dry up,

236
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,630
she will not miss home anymore.

237
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,440
It didn't occur to me that you are good at creating stories.

238
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,210
You aren't the one behind Eighth Young Master's scripts, are you?

239
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,730
There are a lot more people other than you in this world

240
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,200
who are profoundly good at creating stories.

241
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,000
Miss Xiang, look.

242
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,750
Do these stars look like a puppy?

243
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,100
That's the head. There's the tail.

244
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,330
Head? Tail?

245
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,660
Yeah.

246
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,300
Look.

247
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,800
The puppy has a heart, but it looks like a sifter.

248
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,000
That's because...

249
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,800
because the puppy is crying, too.

250
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,690
It can't find its family.

251
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,350
So, teardrops begin to flow into its heart.

252
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,600
♫  If you don't tell me, I won't understand  ♫

253
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,800
You are quite good at composing stories, too.

254
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,290
Thanks.

255
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,320
♫  You're not far away  ♫

256
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,100
♫  My heart has already been moved  ♫

257
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:42,240
♫  Who's waiting for this story?  ♫

258
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,020
♫  I used sincerity  ♫

259
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,760
♫  to exchange for the stars tonight  ♫

260
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,400
♫  Looking back suddenly  ♫

261
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,080
♫  I'm already a part of the song  ♫

262
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,700
♫  Reunion and separation will always end  ♫

263
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:07,360
♫  I can't bear to bid farewell  ♫

264
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:15,060
♫  The moonlight provides me with a night of warmth  ♫

265
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,200
Which is more? The number of stars

266
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,530
or the money you owe my Zhen Tower?

267
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,550
I owe you this much?

268
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,250
How much debt have I cleared today?

269
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,600
Today, you sat in the boat I paid for and drank the wine I bought.

270
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,500
Shouldn't you owe me more?

271
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,300
It makes sense.

272
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,410
   

273
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:55,660
   

274
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,951
   

275
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:01,400
The Winnowing Mansion indicates wind and the Net Mansion indicates rain.

276
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,800
As the stars follow the moon, rain will come.

277
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,500
A place suffering from drought for so long,

278
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,900
Zhongzhou will finally get rainfall.

279
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,200
Auspicious!

280
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,500
The moon is separated from the Net Mansion. Rain is coming.

281
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,300
If the heavy rain goes unchecked, there will certainly be a flood.

282
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,880
Any drought news recently?

283
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,510
Sir,

284
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,570
the Ministry of Works has reported that except for Zhongzhou nearby,

285
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,930
which suffered from drought for three years,

286
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,140
precipitation is normal across the country.

287
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,240
Regions along the coast are subject to wind disasters

288
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,490
but the court has allocated relief funds.

289
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,200
There are also fewer casualties than in previous years.

290
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,700
Sir, the grains are in good condition, too.

291
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,800
The rice harvest in the south is much better than that in previous years.

292
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,420
The entire country is at peace except for the drought in Zhongzhou.

293
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,510
If I release the statement

294
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,250
predicting that the drought in Zhongzhou is sure to end very soon,

295
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,640
the Emperor will surely be pleased.

296
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,960
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau's report of good news...

297
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,030
will certainly receive rewards.

298
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,290
 Excuse me. Excuse me. 
   

299
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,540
 Stop pushing. 

300
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,700
   

301
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,480
It turns out that the rabbit cloud yesterday was an auspicious sign.

302
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,810
Zhongzhou has been in drought for so long, and now it's finally going to rain!

303
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,350
My home is there.

304
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,900
My family is finally saved. Great news!

305
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,640
Sir, you're from Zhongzhou?

306
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,600
How is the situation there?

307
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,960
There is a serious drought in Zhongzhou.

308
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,900
In these past few days, there's been a ring around the sun lately. It's so odd.

309
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,380
- Rain is coming. 
 - Yeah.

310
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,930
   

311
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,970
My Lord, have you heard about the statement released by the Imperial Astronomical Bureau?

312
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,550
Yes.

313
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,320
According to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, it will rain in Zhongzhou very soon.

314
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,900
The prolonged drought will end.

315
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,200
It turns out the rabbit cloud from yesterday was a good sign indeed.

316
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,100
Zang Hai, you still need to work on your astronomical skills.

317
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm no match for Official Chu.

318
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,240
But I have a doubt to share with you, My Lord.

319
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,410
Speak.

320
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,920
Perhaps Official Chu is wrong this time.

321
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,920
While it may rain in Zhongzhou,

322
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,630
it is not an auspicious rain, but an evil one.

323
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Why do you say that?

324
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,000
When I read the stars last night,

325
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,900
I saw signs of rain coming to Zhongzhou as well.

326
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,900
But this rain has been hard to come by and will be difficult to get rid of as well.

327
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,010
I heard some people discussing in the streets

328
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,160
that a solar circle appeared in Zhongzhou for several days already.

329
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,200
Solar circles come hand in hand with floods.

330
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,700
I'm afraid the rain will not stop for a while.

331
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,270
It will develop into a flood, destroying the dam,

332
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,580
and numerous people will become homeless.

333
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,000
But it was a good sign yesterday.

334
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,500
Clouds gather and separate randomly.

335
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,500
We cannot judge the weather by reading clouds.

336
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,900
Are you sure about this?

337
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,430
I am willing to swear to you on my life.

338
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,000
Please report to the Emperor immediately,

339
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,100
and evacuate people and reinforce dams.

340
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,500
Get prepared for the upcoming flood.

341
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,280
Have you discussed this with others?

342
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,480
Then act as though you never knew about this.

343
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,030
I'll act like I never heard about this.

344
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,950
But, My Lord...

345
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,750
The Emperor is happy right now.

346
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,400
I don't want to be the one that gets in the way.

347
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,160
If I report your prediction to the Emperor,

348
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,750
and you made a mistake,

349
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,800
wouldn't I be creating problems for myself?

350
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,220
Even if there are floods and casualties in Zhongzhou,

351
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,000
it has nothing to do with me.

352
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,500
- What about the people in Zhongzhou? 
 - It's their fate.

353
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,920
Don't mention this again.

354
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,660
You may leave.

355
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,700
Yes, My Lord.

356
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,300
The Marquis of Pingjin is not getting involved

357
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:18,600
because Zhongzhou is the jurisdiction of General Fu Zhisong.

358
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,470
If things really are as you say, as soon as the flood prevention doesn't work out,

359
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,780
he will go after

360
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,700
Fu Zhisong's position as the commander.

361
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,980
He wants to pursue power,

362
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,400
so he'll let Zhongzhou's people suffer.

363
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
When the dam is destroyed by rain,

364
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,200
numerous people will lose their families and homes.

365
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,900
Even if there is a flood, it might not necessarily break the dam?

366
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,400
I've checked the maintenance record in the past few years.

367
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,770
Guess who the person responsible for maintaining it is.

368
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,900
Zhuang Zhifu?

369
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,970
Correct.

370
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,540
Given his corruption,

371
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:58,130
who knows how much cheap material has entered the structure of the dam.

372
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,800
Zhongzhou doesn't get much rain to begin with.

373
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,170
It would be difficult to tell if he was skimping on the job.

374
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,490
But now, the long-lasting drought

375
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,100
has eroded the dam, making it vulnerable to flooding.

376
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,570
It sounds so dangerous.

377
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,340
Do you still remember I told you that as long as the opportunity arose,

378
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,380
I will drag Chu Huaiming out and take his place?

379
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,530
He's digging his own grave this time.

380
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,270
Moreover, I'm going to drag in the Marquis of Pingjin

381
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,600
to make him stop the flood and save the people of Zhongzhou.

382
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,280
Wait.

383
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,800
Wait. It will be risky to involve the Marquis of Pingjin.

384
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,450
Don't you have an alternative plan?

385
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,550
My father told me that the signs of nature

386
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,200
like wind, rain, and stars

387
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,800
have an impact on people's livelihood, even lives.

388
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,700
People deserve the truth so they can prevent disasters.

389
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,220
My good disciple!

390
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,440
You've seen the truth.

391
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,820
However, as the Imperial Astronomer,

392
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,010
Chu Huaiming will use tricks and absurd theories

393
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,620
to defend his inadequacies.

394
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:23,140
People will be easily misled by him.

395
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,170
Understand?

396
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,730
Yes.

397
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,840
Then we'll use his methods against him.

398
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,550
Move. Excuse me.

399
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,370
Move.

400
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,270
What does it say?

401
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,720
It will rain in Zhongzhou soon.

402
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,460
It's an auspicious sign.

403
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,560
Auspicious!

404
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,810
Wonderful!

405
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,660
Rain is finally coming.

406
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,030
My crops in Zhongzhou will be saved.

407
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,870
Not necessarily.

408
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,070
Who is talking? Who?

409
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,370
Who?

410
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,650
Where did you come from, rascal?

411
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,340
You dare cast doubt on the Imperial Astronomical Bureau?

412
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,680
Listen.

413
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,480
Imperial Astronomer Chu Huaiming has godlike predictive powers.

414
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,380
When he says the sky points to an auspicious sign,

415
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,000
he won't be wrong!

416
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,200
- Yeah. 
 - Right?

417
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,270
Yes.

418
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,550
When reading natural signs,

419
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,000
you must investigate the whole picture thoroughly.

420
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,640
Chu Huaiming is eager to gain recognition

421
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,880
so he didn't do his proper research

422
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,820
and immediately drew a conclusion.

423
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,240
This time he's made a big mistake.

424
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,680
The upcoming rain in Zhongzhou

425
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,240
is not an auspicious rain that will save people, but an evil one that will kill people.

426
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,880
- Kill people? 
 - How does it kill people?

427
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,790
Right, rain can kill people?

428
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,700
That's so scary.

429
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,790
Stop!

430
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,790
Don't hit him.

431
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,720
- Don't hold me back! 
 - No!

432
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,310
No more nonsense here.

433
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:52,110
Let me tell you. I've personally seen special signs in the sky lately.

434
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,030
The heavens were doing magic.

435
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,160
The rain is definitely auspicious.

436
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,190
 - Yeah.  
 - Yeah.

437
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,880
I admit that it was a special sign.

438
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,000
But Chu Huaiming has read it wrong.

439
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,350
A disaster will occur in Zhongzhou.

440
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,140
 - Disaster? 
 - Really? 

441
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,450
 - Disaster? 
 - Disaster? 

442
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,790
Why do you say that?

443
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,070
I observed astronomy during the daytime. There is a bright circle around the sun.

444
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:14,110
In the night, I saw the stars. The moon is separated from the Net Mansion.

445
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,030
It's no auspicious sign at all.

446
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,640
- It's ominous. 
 - Ominous?

447
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,960
There will be a flood in Zhongzhou.

448
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,580
Flood?

449
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,270
 How? 

450
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,270
This...

451
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,140
We don't understand what you are talking about.

452
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,150
What bright circle?

453
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,110
Moon...

454
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,830
Are you from Zhongzhou?

455
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,960
Have you seen a dark shadow around the sun?

456
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,350
- Yes. 
 - It's called a sun circle.

457
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,200
It's a sign of rain.

458
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,830
Now we are at the turn of summer into autumn.

459
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,480
The weather is getting cold in July.

460
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,160
The White Tiger of the West with its Seven Mansions, is emerging.

461
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,240
The Net Mansion within it indicates rain.

462
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
Everyone,

463
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,810
days of heavy rain are coming.

464
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,190
Young master.

465
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,750
Are you telling the truth?

466
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,920
Has it happened before?

467
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,680
Long ago, Sima Yi once led the Wei troops to invade West Shu,

468
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,510
who were defeated by Zhuge Liang.

469
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,800
Both of them saw the Net Mansion separated from the moon.

470
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,520
Heavy rain is coming this month.

471
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,470
 - Sir. 
 - Sir. 

472
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,780
Your words make sense.

473
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,300
The drought has lasted for a while in Zhongzhou.

474
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,390
When it rains, it pours. There will surely be a flood!

475
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,550
 That's right! 

476
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,270
Once the dam is destroyed,

477
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:42,440
people will lose their homes and land.

478
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,410
 This... 

479
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,880
Chu Huaiming has become the Imperial Astronomer

480
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,650
all by flattering the powerful.

481
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,720
He has no real abilities.

482
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,030
If you don't believe me,

483
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,590
spread my words to people around you. Bring it to hundreds.

484
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,480
Let's wait and see whether Chu Huaiming is right or me?

485
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,830
 Who is right anyway? 

486
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,090
 I don't know you. 

487
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,580
Sir.

488
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,880
You mean... isn't my Zhongzhou doomed?

489
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,710
Sir, get up.

490
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,350
Sir, trust me.

491
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:21,520
Send my message to your family in Zhongzhou so that they can prepare early.

492
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,180
- Okay. 
 - Go.

493
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,070
Sir. No, Master.

494
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,100
Who are you?

495
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,520
I'm the Chief Aide in the Marquis of Pingjin Residence, Zang Hai.

496
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,090
 - Zang Hai. 
 - Zang Hai. 

497
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,460
 Who is Zang Hai? 

498
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,770
 Who is Zang Hai? 

499
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,030
I know him.

500
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,120
He is the one who repaired the mausoleum.

501
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
I've heard of him, too.

502
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,030
The Marquis of Pingjin thought highly of him after that.

503
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,000
Anyone the Marquis trusts must be highly capable.

504
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,960
Spread the news.

505
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,920
- Hurry. 
  - Let's go. 

506
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,460
 Come on! 

507
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,670
Did Zang Hai really spread the word that I'd made a mistake?

508
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,760
- Yes. 
 - Ridiculous!

509
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,710
Zang Hai is a nobody.

510
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,670
What does he know about stars?

511
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,920
What else did he say?

512
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,400
He said something about

513
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,280
a bright ring around the sun and moon, separated from the Net Mansion.

514
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,480
He said Zhongzhou's rain will bring a disasterous flood.

515
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,900
The truth will speak for itself in a few days.

516
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,070
He is talking nonsense.

517
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,110
Does the Marquis know this?

518
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm afraid so.

519
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,610
The light of the lantern. I can make it burn bright or crush it to pieces.

520
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,840
I told you to stay quiet

521
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,630
yet you appeared in front of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau and spread word

522
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,860
that you saw an evil omen in the sky.

523
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,180
Now everyone knows about this.

524
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,820
Are you sure you want to turn against me?

525
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,560
My Lord, I wouldn't dare.

526
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,230
I just want to do all I can to find a solution to this issue.

527
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,210
My Lord.

528
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,360
Zang Hai was trying to help.

529
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,410
But in a moment of anxiety, he overstepped.

530
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,590
He doesn't intend to be my enemy.

531
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,960
He just read a few books

532
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,210
and thought he could actually read the stars.

533
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,860
Zang Hai, the Lord trusts you so much.

534
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:30,730
How come you acted so recklessly without even thinking about him?

535
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,150
My Lord,

536
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,210
I did this for your benefit actually.

537
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,660
Tell me.

538
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,550
How do you look out for me?

539
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:48,760
I suggested you to report my theory to the Emperor.

540
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,800
I admit it's a lack of judgment.

541
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,380
As an influential minister, you should not take the risk.

542
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,280
So, I have to spread the news among citizens.

543
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,590
Official Chu was recommended by you.

544
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:09,030
If he makes a mistake, someone may make a scene out of it.

545
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,670
I'm your aide.

546
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,220
The credit goes to you if I am right.

547
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,920
But if you make a mistake, I'm to blame for that.

548
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,520
You're just an aide.

549
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,740
You're not qualified to decide how I get credit.

550
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,930
One more thing...

551
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,320
My Lord, I'm impressed by his eloquence...

552
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,190
Please hear me out.

553
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,410
Speak.

554
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:40,800
But think clearly before speaking. This may very well be the last time you speak.

555
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,820
I didn't dare to tell you before.

556
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,210
The bright circle around the sun I speak of is not only a sign of flooding

557
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,050
but also...

558
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,340
of fallen generals.

559
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,710
When Zhuan Zhu tried to assassinate King Liao of Wu,

560
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,360
a comet was striking the moon.

561
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,800
When Nie Zheng was to kill the Han Kui,

562
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
there was a bright circle around the sun.

563
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,100
These signs indicate the fall of generals and ministers.

564
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,930
Chu Huaiming.

565
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,670
Is that true?

566
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,300
This...

567
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,950
Tell me.

568
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,260
Which general will fall?

569
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,710
I don't know.

570
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,140
Do you not know...

571
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,000
or are you afraid to say?

572
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,960
I would never deceive you.

573
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,730
I just...

574
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,310
want to avert the risk for you.

575
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,800
For me?

576
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,880
So, you mean...

577
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,150
I'm falling?

578
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,840
It's hard to interpret the signs of heaven.

579
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,590
I don't know the meaning of these signs yet.

580
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:09,740
However, even if something bad will happen, there will be signs.

581
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,510
Please spare my life.

582
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,420
I can help you defuse the crisis when the time comes.

583
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,300
- Guards. 
 - Yes, My Lord.

584
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,890
If no flooding occurs in Zhongzhou,

585
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,340
I have to bring you to justice.

586
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,480
I wish you luck.

587
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,620
- Lock him up. 
 - Yes, sir.

588
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,630
Please give me seven days.

589
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,800
If it rains in Zhongzhou within seven days, it will prove that Official Chu is right.

590
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,860
Please have some patience, My Lord.

591
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,550
 Yin Zhao. 

592
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,000
 Li Ji. 

593
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,140
 Where are you? 

594
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:15,990



595
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:22,160
 "It's me" - Sun Nan 

596
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,940
♫  I conceal the ambition in my eyes  ♫
