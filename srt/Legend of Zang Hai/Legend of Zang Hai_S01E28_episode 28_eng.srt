1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:17,820



2
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,773
   

4
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,210
Father, you're forcing the Emperor's hand!

5
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,000
His Majesty will never forgive you!

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,530
To break into the palace,

7
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,430
you'll have to go through me first!

8
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,120
You unfilial son!

9
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,290
You think I won't?

10
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,700
You dare defy me!

11
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,300
Why did you betray me?

12
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,800
Father, you've already lost.

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,120
How many soldiers do you have left?

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,760
Even if you break through the gates, will you be able to see the Emperor?

15
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,030
The Five Armies Camp will arrive soon.

16
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,030
Sooner or later, you will be killed by the Emperor's reinforcements!

17
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,430
You should realize

18
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,670
that from the moment Muji Camp broke into the jail,

19
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,180
everything you do will end up like this!

20
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,560
What are you trying to say?

21
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,560
Your death is surely inevitable,

22
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,750
but by doing this today,

23
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,740
I may save our family from doom.

24
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,300
I will not fail you and revive the Zhuang family!

25
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,590
Father.

26
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,600
I've been practicing in the barracks for a long time

27
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,200
and never had a chance to show you the results of my training.

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,780
If I win,

29
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,230
please stop the siege.

30
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,690
Okay!

31
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,120
You've grown up and can even dodge my slashes.

32
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,730
Father, you're getting old and tender-hearted.

33
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,580
Really?

34
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,310
Zhuang Zhixing, you unfilial son.

35
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,590
Didn't you say I'd have to step over your corpse

36
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,240
before I could break this city?

37
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,750
As you wish!

38
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,080
Remember what you said.

39
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,070
Revive...

40
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,150
the Zhuang family...

41
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,840
Zhixing...

42
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,500
Everyone, listen!

43
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,770
Zhuang Luyin is dead.

44
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,840
Now stop fighting and surrender at once!

45
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,140
My Lord!

46
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,150
My Lord!

47
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,880
 My Lord! 

48
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,670
Last night, the Muji Camp rebelled,

49
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,090
but the Imperial Guards resisted and defeated the enemy.

50
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,720
The leader of the rebels, Zhuang Luyin, was killed in front of the city wall.

51
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,610
Hang his head on the city wall as a public demonstration...

52
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,000
of his crimes.

53
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

54
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,030
Cao Jingxian. 
    

55
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

56
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,670
I need you to lead the Imperial Surveillance Office

57
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,150
to investigate the Muji Camp's jailbreak.

58
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,220
I accept the order.

59
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,640
Your Majesty, what about the Zhuang family?

60
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,030
What do you think?

61
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,540
Your Majesty.

62
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,420
The leader of the rebels, Zhuang Luyin, is dead,

63
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,200
and his wife and son have killed themselves with poison,

64
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,000
so they deserve what they get.

65
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,650
Zhuang Luyin has another son, Zhuang Zhixing.

66
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,240
He is in prison and at our disposal.

67
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,340
I heard that last night,

68
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,750
he killed Zhuang Luyin in front of the city wall.

69
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,620
What great courage to kill his own father.

70
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,650
Your Majesty, the killing desire of the Zhuang family's offspring

71
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,530
cannot be underestimated.

72
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,170
In any case, what he did was against human decency.

73
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,080
Your Majesty, you can let him have a complete corpse

74
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,110
which is a favor to him.

75
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,500
Zhuang Zhixing gave up filial piety

76
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,510
and his family for loyalty and justice.

77
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,290
Now, Zhuang Luyin and Zhuang Zhifu are dead.

78
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,920
He is the only bloodline of the Zhuang family.

79
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:53,670
The Zhuang family has fought for Great Yong for generations

80
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,100
and made great achievements,

81
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,840
so I will not implicate anyone else.

82
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,140
Let Zhuang Zhixing 
    

83
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:09,480
guard the border for me in the same place where his father fought.

84
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,390
Zhuang Zhixing, for resisting the rebels and quelling the mutiny,

85
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,790
has been made Field Officer of Verified Loyalty

86
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,360
and ordered to be immediately on his way to the border

87
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,840
to protect the land and the people.

88
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,240
He may not return to the capital without imperial orders.

89
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,440
Your Majesty, there is one more thing.

90
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,000
Zhuang Zhifu is dead,

91
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,390
so the position of Vice Minister of Works is now vacant.

92
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:46,570
Who do you think will be able to fill it?

93
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,150
Your Majesty,

94
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,770
there is another man who was instrumental in quelling the mutiny.

95
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,130
   

96
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,870
By heaven's authority and the cosmic order, the Emperor decrees:

97
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,810
"Zang Hai, Imperial Astronomer,

98
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,810
for being incorruptible in conduct and unbending in principle,

99
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,340
observant of the laws of his ancestors,

100
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:16,150
prudent in conduct, and of outstanding ability,

101
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,770
shall enjoy the grace and be promoted to the office of Vice Minister of Works."

102
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,380
By Imperial Sanction.

103
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,080
I accept the decree and thank the Emperor for his grace.

104
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,000
Official Zang, straighten up.

105
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,170
His Majesty means that the Imperial Astronomical Bureau is still in your hands.

106
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,360
You're wearing two hats now.

107
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,890
You'll have to work harder from now on.

108
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,610
Thank you, sir.

109
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,390
- Congratulations. 
  - Congratulations, Official Zang. 

110
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,080
Don't say that.

111
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,140
Shi Quan, I've sent memorials to the Cabinet recommending you

112
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,000
for Imperial Astronomical Bureau Deputy Inspector.

113
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,960
In the future, you'll be required to take care

114
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,840
of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau's affairs.

115
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,170
Thank you, sir.

116
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,100
Sir, the Imperial Astronomical Bureau is fine now.

117
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,060
Don't worry.

118
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,362
   

119
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,891
   

120
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,500
Sir.

121
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,150
The Emperor wants to reclaim the Marquis of Pingjin Mansion,

122
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,270
so I've been ordered to come and survey the pavilion.

123
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,870
Open the gate.

124
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,078
   

125
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,116
   

126
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,360
   

127
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,940
   

128
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,080
   

129
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,523
   

130
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,080
Mother.

131
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,590
I've taken my revenge,

132
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,690
but I'm not going to end up well after that.

133
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,520
I don't think...

134
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,370
you'll ever want to see me again.

135
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,800
From now on,

136
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,800
I have no family...

137
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,590
I have...

138
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,250
I have no family in this world.

139
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,470
Mother.

140
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,520
Mother.

141
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,820
I'm leaving.

142
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,350
The Emperor has sent me to guard the border...

143
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,550
where my father once stood.

144
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,780
I will either return home with honor after many years

145
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,180
or become a corpse and be buried in an unknown place.

146
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,180
You wanted me to be the Zhuang Zhixing who would have lifetime happiness,

147
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,240
but in the end, I wasn't able to.

148
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,140
   

149
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,250
I have come to see you off.

150
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,300
After today's parting, I am afraid

151
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,090
we will never see each other again in this life.

152
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,920
The Emperor has made you Field Officer of Verified Loyalty

153
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,850
so that you can return to the place where the Zhuang family

154
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,400
has built up its reputation.

155
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,590
I will be waiting for you in the capital.

156
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,060
May your renown shake the frontier and echo across the realm.

157
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,250
Field Officer of Verified Loyalty?

158
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,070
The border is not peaceful.

159
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,640
The Emperor doesn't want to kill me personally,

160
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
so he just wants to do this indirectly.

161
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,840
Since he doesn't want to kill you himself, you still have a chance.

162
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,920
I heard that you have been promoted and are now the Vice Minister of Works.

163
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,080
Congratulations.

164
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,080
What are you going to do after this?

165
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,650
Now, you still have two enemies.

166
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,880
Have you figured out how to deal with them?

167
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,500
I'll just try my best.

168
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,300
We propose, and heaven disposes.

169
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,600
It's impossible for everything to go my way.

170
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,240
Are you happy now?

171
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,860
Your first enemy is dead, so are you happy?

172
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,500
At first, I only wanted to avenge my mother's death,

173
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,400
but then I found that I was discontent and wanted more.

174
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Now, it's too late.

175
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,700
I have come to the end of this road unknowingly.

176
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,900
Then think of today as your new life.

177
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,380
Everything will start from scratch.

178
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,170
I hope you can find a new path.

179
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,300
From now on, I will live well,

180
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,680
and I promised my father

181
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,960
to revive the Zhuang family.

182
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,700
Xiao Xing.

183
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,110
Why are you here?

184
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,410
Official Zang said you were going to be stationed at the border,

185
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,900
so we wanted to go with you to distinguish ourselves gloriously.

186
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,300
I've asked the Ministry of War for them.

187
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,900
It's a long way to the north.

188
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,300
They've gone with you through the fire and water.

189
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,200
If they go with you, you can take care of each other.

190
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,450
Are you looking down on us

191
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,820
because you are now Field Officer of Verified Loyalty?

192
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,040
You go ahead. I'll be right there.

193
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,100
Farewell, sir.

194
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,300
Don't look back.

195
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,030
Go forward.

196
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,910
Don't look back.

197
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,271
   

198
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,800
- Father. 
 - Father.

199
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,200
- Is Zhuang Zhixing out of the city? 
 - Yes.

200
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,970
He left the city gates before the hour of You.

201
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,200
He's probably in the Yuzi Valley by now.

202
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,300
This time, the road is clear. It's easy for us to take action.

203
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,830
He is now Field Officer of Verified Loyalty verified by the Emperor.

204
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,700
If he dies on his way to his post,

205
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,100
everyone will think that I am the one who is eliminating the remaining trouble.

206
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,100
A nobody like him won't jeopardize my plans.

207
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,910
I just don't like the feeling that my enemy is still alive.

208
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,200
Father, don't worry.

209
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,280
Conditions at the border are hard, and there are always offensive bandits.

210
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,900
Zhuang Zhixing is just a commandant.

211
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,500
Without his father's protection,

212
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,660
he could die at any time after being sent to war a few times.

213
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,000
Any news about the hostage?

214
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,960
We haven't been able to find her since she disappeared

215
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,880
that night at the Marquis of Pingjin Mansion,

216
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,200
but there's no word of the Gui Seal on the streets of the city.

217
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,800
We've gathered no intelligence about any response from Dongxia either.

218
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,200
Lu Yan.

219
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,140
How is the investigation at the Marquis of Pingjin Mansion going?

220
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,960
All of Zhuang Luyin's property has been confiscated.

221
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,010
I've checked them all.

222
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,450
The thing you want isn't there.

223
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,650
Prepare the carriage.

224
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,690
Now the sediment has been filtered,

225
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,770
so I'm going to check out the pearls in the shell myself.

226
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,114
   

227
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,000
   

228
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
Xiao Hai,

229
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,800
Guan Feng made a full table to celebrate your first big revenge,

230
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,200
but you don't look like you're in the mood,

231
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,520
and you didn't eat much.

232
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,780
I was just thinking.

233
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,770
If your revenge is over, what will you do with your life?

234
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,730
- Have you thought about it? 
 - What's the use of thinking about it now?

235
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,270
Xiao Hai, you must.

236
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,670
I'm sure the day will come soon.

237
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,800
Master,

238
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,200
honestly, revenge is a relief for me,

239
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,000
but I am afraid that I will die before my revenge is completed

240
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,900
to the extent that I will be ashamed to meet my parents,

241
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,100
Yuenu, and my senior brothers.

242
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,720
Even if death is inevitable,

243
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,190
you must die later than your enemies.

244
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Benefactor.

245
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Why are you here?

246
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,160
Such a big event happened in the capital.

247
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,520
Everyone knows about it.

248
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,790
Gao Ming already told me what happened.

249
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,680
Congratulations.

250
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,460
You've successfully eliminated your first enemy.

251
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,730
The Marquis of Pingjin is dead,

252
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,590
but you don't look very happy.

253
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,350
My masters have told me

254
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,720
that many things in my mind don't need to be shown.

255
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,230
I heard that you gave Zhuang Zhixing a personal send-off today.

256
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,400
Before he left, he asked me

257
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,600
if I was happy after my revenge.

258
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,500
The Marquis of Pingjin died,

259
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,400
so I should feel relaxed and happy.

260
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,100
But that day, looking at Zhuang Zhixing,

261
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,350
I realized that I had destroyed

262
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,040
an innocent and kind-hearted youth, with my own hands, in order to take revenge.

263
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,790
I probably could have found another way to achieve my goal,

264
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,600
but instead, I chose to use hatred to manipulate people's hearts

265
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,200
and ruin their lives.

266
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,400
How am I any different from the Marquis of Pingjin?

267
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,180
You're not him.

268
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,800
Let's go.

269
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,270
Looks like this place used to be an underground vault for storing charcoal.

270
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,110
This is it.

271
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:56,100
What place can be better to hide a secret than here?

272
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:02,070
If the charcoal in the underground vault hadn't been burned,

273
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:08,100
how could I have seen this house as it was?

274
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,700
Are you suggesting that Zhuang Luyin may have hidden the Gui Seal

275
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,330
inside the walls of the underground vault?

276
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,920
Benefactor,

277
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,620
why does Cao Jingxian want the Gui Seal?

278
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,300
The Marquis of Pingjin wanted the Gui Seal

279
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,100
because it was rumored that the Gui Seal could summon ghost soldiers

280
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,030
and make him invincible in battle.

281
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,240
That is the lifelong dream of every general,

282
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,100
but why does Cao Jingxian want the Gui Seal?

283
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,200
This rumor has a kind of power.

284
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,830
The power of authority.

285
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:04,300
Cao Jingxian wants the Gui Seal because the Emperor has no son.

286
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,100
So, Cao Jingxian is afraid that one day, he'll lose his power

287
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,000
and end up dead.

288
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,320
You are very enlightened.

289
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,500
Cao Jingxian is the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director, and powerful,

290
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,400
but he has no descendants,

291
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,530
and the only leader he can look up to is the Emperor.

292
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,720
Once the Emperor dies, his power will crumble.

293
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,400
But he wants a happy ending,

294
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,000
so he needs to either befriend the successor

295
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,630
or have a tool to continue his power.

296
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,530
So, it's all still about power.

297
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,900
Power doesn't die in a thousand generations.

298
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,930
Father.

299
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,770
Take a closer look.

300
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,300
- It's empty. 
 - Go.

301
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,200
Open it.

302
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,000
Sir, where do you think the Gui Seal is?

303
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,800
Those three have searched for so long but found nothing.

304
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,500
From what I know of them,

305
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:14,700
if the Gui Seal had appeared, they would have picked up the trail,

306
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,010
but they've been quiet for ten years,

307
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,400
so the Gui Seal could still be hidden.

308
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,500
Is it possible that the Gui Seal had been found by the third person

309
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,880
who has kept it under wraps

310
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,400
and is unwilling to share it with the Marquis of Pingjin and Cao Jingxian

311
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,300
in order to keep them searching for it without any clues?

312
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,410
If the Gui Seal is really in the third person's hands,

313
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,600
she'd have the bronze fish set,

314
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,300
but that's okay.

315
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,000
Whether or not the Gui Seal has been found,

316
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,600
Cao Jingxian will fall into the trap.

317
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,700
As long as he thinks that the Gui Seal is still with the Marquis of Pingjin,

318
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,380
then he will surely die.

319
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,320
What did you do?

320
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,700
I went to the Marquis of Pingjin Mansion

321
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,960
and buried something in the underground vault.

322
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,840
   

323
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,020
Zhuang Luyin.

324
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,230
You really found it.

325
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,960
Father, be careful.

326
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,140
We could be in danger if we take it out with imprudence.

327
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,230
No.

328
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:33,740
I want to watch you open it.

329
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,800
 Cao Jingxian is suspicious. 

330
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,820
 Once he finds the Gui Seal, 

331
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,550
 he will never allow his men to act independently 

332
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,590
 and will definitely verify the Gui Seal himself. 

333
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,100
 Based on his caution, 

334
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:58,460
 his guards will stand in front of him when he triggers the mechanism, 

335
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,690
 but they don't know that I have been aiming at his back from the beginning. 

336
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Attacking him while he's not prepared?

337
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,320
Gao Ming.

338
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,440
You and Xing Dou have produced a good apprentice.

339
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,400
But, Zang Hai,

340
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,280
I'm afraid that all your behavior

341
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,600
has caused the third person to catch wind of it.

342
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,000
She's far away in Dongxia.

343
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,590
If she doesn't come to the capital, there's nothing I can do about it,

344
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,700
so I want her to get wind of it.

345
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,600
Cao Jingxian is in secret collusion with the Queen of Dongxia,

346
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,900
so she may already know something.

347
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,800
If she really dares to come to the capital,

348
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
you won't surely have a chance of winning.

349
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,670
Xiang Antu disappeared after the battle at the Marquis's Mansion,

350
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,810
and I was one of Marquis of Pingjin's men, so I was there that night.

351
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,700
And because of my relationship with her,

352
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,100
her men will definitely report it to the Queen of Dongxia.

353
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,900
She doesn't know that I'm a descendant of the Kuai family,

354
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,600
but her daughter's disappearance has something to do with me anyway.

355
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,800
Maybe she's already been watching me in secret.

356
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,200
The Princess of Dongxia is still at your residence?

357
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,100
Yes. Master Liu Chu is taking care of her.

358
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,600
What will you do next?

359
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,560
I don't know yet.

360
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,000
Using her to blackmail the Queen of Dongxia might work.

361
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,150
There must be a better way.

362
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,700
We're all here.

363
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,300
You don't need to worry that you can't fight the Queen of Dongxia.

364
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,360
The Princess of Dongxia has disappeared for so many days,

365
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,460
so they won't just sit back and do nothing.

366
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,600
Gao Ming.

367
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,300
Do some snooping around and put out some more information.

368
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:26,440
And you, stay put so as not to expose your whereabouts.

369
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,360
That's what happened, but you don't have to worry too much.

370
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,600
Sister, don't go.

371
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,440
I don't want to see him.

372
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,590
I'm his master, so I must help him.

373
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,010
I can't always help you.

374
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,300
Don't worry.

375
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,320
Antu and I get along, and I'm fond of her.

376
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,780
If you bully her again, I'll beat you up.

377
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,960
I just heard from her that Zhuang Luyin is dead

378
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,280
and that you made a move on Cao Jingxian.

379
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,130
My mother's next, isn't she?

380
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,400
If you kill her, I'll hate you forever.

381
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,610
If you want to kill her, kill me first,

382
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,280
or I'll take revenge on you.

383
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,380
Fine. At that time, I will be at your disposal.

384
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's cold. Wear more clothes.

385
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,310
   

386
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,500
A prescription from Renjitang's physician.

387
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,800
Take it three times a day on schedule.

388
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,400
Thank you for your concern.

389
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,700
How are they talking?

390
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,920
The way he's going,

391
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,010
I'm not sure if he can persevere to the end.

392
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:43,480
I'm afraid Xiao Hai may fail because of a woman.

393
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,650
Xiao Hai has a clear mind.

394
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,030
I'm leaving.

395
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,320
- To where? 
 - It's none of your business.

396
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,420
I can't stay here forever.

397
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,650
Okay.

398
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,300
I'll get your carriage ready.

399
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,700
No need.

400
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,470
The carriage is already outside.

401
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,340
I'll probably be away from home for a while

402
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,800
because I have to contact Dongxia's spies

403
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,280
to help Xiao Hai get word of the Gui Seal's presence in the capital

404
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,360
as soon as possible.

405
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,260
Did I ask you?

406
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,570
I was just talking to myself.

407
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,560
Did I give you permission to go?

408
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,260
What else?

409
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,190
Fill the stove in my carriage with charcoal. I need it to be warm.

410
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,260
Good. I'll do it.

411
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,440
I'll add more.

412
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,480
I'll add more.

413
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,400
You underestimate the Queen of Dongxia.

414
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,500
How can you kill her?

415
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,850
You've locked me in here just to lure her here.

416
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,190
How can the Queen of Dongxia be compared to Zhuang Luyin and Cao Jingxian?

417
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,400
That's right.

418
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,610
I can't even figure out your plots, let alone your mother's.

419
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,800
Zang Hai.

420
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,000
Don't go to my mother.

421
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,700
You can't defeat her, and you will die.

422
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,750
It'll be great if she can kill me.

423
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:09,990



424
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,200
