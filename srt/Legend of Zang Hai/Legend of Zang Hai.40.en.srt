1
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 40]

3
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,770
Well, well.

4
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,850
I didn't think you'd still be alive.

5
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,430
I really did

6
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,130
underestimate you and Gao Ming.

7
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,760
Come back with me.

8
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
We'll have

9
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,260
plenty of time

10
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,410
to talk things over.

11
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,750
Take him away.

12
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,220
Mr. Zhao.

13
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,780
General Zhuang,

14
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,820
you're truly loyal and capable.

15
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,170
You wasted no time catching

16
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,410
one of the court's most wanted.

17
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,410
I was only following your instructions, sir.

18
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,820
I dare not take the credit.

19
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,970
No need to be so modest.

20
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,450
I've come

21
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,170
bearing good news.

22
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,340
The eldest son of the Prince of Linzi

23
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,650
has ascended the throne.

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,380
I spoke highly

25
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,980
of your strict command to His Majesty.

26
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,780
To award you

27
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,570
In recognition of your service at the border,

28
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,450
he has granted you the title of General of Agile Cavalry.

29
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,380
I thank His Majesty for his grace!

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,180
Back when

31
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,730
your father

32
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,850
was appointed Defender-General of the State,

33
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,850
he was older than you are now.

34
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,940
You've already surpassed him.

35
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,820
It was only thanks to your guidance, sir.

36
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,220
I will always be grateful.

37
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,470
But your father's

38
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,380
greatest regret

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,980
was failing

40
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,500
to press the advantage after defeating Dongxia.

41
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,980
That let them

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,380
survive to this day.

43
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,170
Of course,

44
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,100
the late Emperor's mercy

45
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,380
also played a part.

46
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,450
But now,

47
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,660
your chance has come.

48
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,260
You should carry out your father's unfinished mission

49
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,660
and complete what he could not.

50
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,450
Are you saying we should

51
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,410
strike Dongxia once and for all

52
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,340
to crush

53
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,820
any future ambitions they may harbor?

54
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,660
Exactly.

55
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:17,900
Now

56
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,810
is the perfect time.

57
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,370
The problem is

58
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,290
my troops alone aren't enough.

59
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,490
To conquer Dongxia,

60
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,810
we'll need reinforcements from the court.

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,660
I'm here

62
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,460
precisely to deliver those reinforcements.

63
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,850
Reporting!

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,460
Sir,

65
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,610
we found this on him.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,810
He hid it in his robe.

67
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,610
Zhuang Zhixing,

68
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,020
is this what you wanted?

69
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,580
You'll end up

70
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,980
just like your father did!

71
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,610
Wasn't it you

72
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,050
who got my father killed?

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,580
How dare you say that to me?

74
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,460
If it hadn't been for you,

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,930
would my family have ended up like this?

76
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,100
You're already

77
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,020
General of Exemplary Fortitude.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,140
Why side with him?

79
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,370
Why become a traitor to the Great Yong?

80
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,980
Without Mr. Zhao,

81
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,220
how could I have achieved such honor today?

82
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,170
I told you long ago

83
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,900
that what I wanted

84
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,820
was to restore the Zhuang family to glory.

85
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,900
All right, enough.

86
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,170
You two go way back.

87
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,800
No need to make this ugly.

88
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,310
You're acting like children.

89
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,340
Zang Hai.

90
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,730
You actually managed to find

91
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,810
Minglv Huda's shrine.

92
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,730
You're every bit as capable

93
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,850
as your father.

94
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,290
I spent a long time trying to figure out

95
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,900
how to use the Gui Seal

96
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,430
to summon the ghost soldiers.

97
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,650
Now I see.

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,790
This is how it works.

99
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,940
The Queen of Dongxia once had

100
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,540
such a treasure,

101
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,320
yet she still lost to the Great Yong?

102
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,320
This time, let me

103
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,910
show Dongxia

104
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,840
how to use it properly.

105
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,710
Sir,

106
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,350
I...

107
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,040
Bring 1,000 laborers

108
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,470
from the Fengshan Altar

109
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,470
to the camp.

110
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,560
Yes, sir.

111
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,510
Someone help! Help!

112
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,560
Something's gone wrong!

113
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,160
Sir.

114
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,200
Burn the body.

115
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,440
Yes, sir.

116
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,960
Our scouts report

117
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,080
after the failed marriage alliance,

118
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,440
Dongxia is growing restless.

119
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,280
Patrol the surrounding ten li

120
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,510
carefully.

121
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,320
Keep Mr. Zhao safe at all costs!

122
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,320
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

123
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,840
You saw this coming, didn't you?

124
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,560
Even though you

125
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,630
didn't say anything,

126
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,390
I could tell

127
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,230
you were hiding something.

128
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,710
Everything you want to know

129
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,230
is in Zhang Mie's manuscript.

130
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,040
You already know how to summon

131
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,320
the ghost soldiers.

132
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,960
What more do you want?

133
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,440
I want to know

134
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,920
why the ghost soldiers

135
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,630
became what they are now,

136
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,280
completely out of control.

137
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,800
You tampered

138
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,960
with the manuscript.

139
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,080
You tore something out, didn't you?

140
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,440
The manuscript says Minglv Huda

141
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,560
took Zhang Mie's advice

142
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,510
and activated the Gui Seal.

143
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,230
The ghost soldiers crushed

144
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,510
the Great Yong army at the gates,

145
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,750
reversing the tide

146
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,920
in a single battle.

147
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,710
But not long after,

148
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,560
Minglv Huda died.

149
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,510
Before her death, she ordered

150
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,990
Zhang Mie to seal the Gui Seal

151
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,800
and never let it be used again.

152
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,680
Doesn't it feel

153
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,750
like something's missing in between?

154
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,990
I did tear out one page,

155
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,160
but even if you read it,

156
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,350
it wouldn't be of any help.

157
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,350
What did it say?

158
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,680
Zhang Mie wrote

159
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,960
that the soldiers of Dongxia,

160
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,990
turned into ghost soldiers by the Gui Seal,

161
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,960
gained immense strength

162
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,350
and became immune to blades.

163
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,680
But over time, they lost all sense of self

164
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,040
and became

165
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,390
mindless monsters,

166
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,750
unable to tell friend from foe.

167
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,200
Minglv Huda,

168
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,440
to prevent them from causing

169
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,870
greater disaster,

170
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,440
used her own life

171
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,470
to shut down the Gui Seal.

172
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,110
They say the ghost soldiers

173
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,680
crushed cities and fortresses for Dongxia

174
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,230
and were invincible.

175
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,160
If what you say is true,

176
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,230
then why did you

177
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,040
tear out that page

178
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,680
and hide it from me?

179
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,230
Those tales

180
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,630
are nothing

181
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,200
but myths

182
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,230
and rumors repeated until believed.

183
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,200
The ghost soldiers

184
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,440
are exactly what you saw.

185
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,200
They cannot be controlled,

186
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,680
nor will they follow commands

187
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,200
or fight for you.

188
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,320
They cannot be controlled?

189
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,470
The more you deny something,

190
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,390
the more obvious it becomes

191
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,750
that you're hiding something.

192
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,560
That missing page

193
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,710
probably explained

194
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,230
how to control them.

195
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,160
You didn't want anyone

196
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,510
to learn the truth,

197
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,840
so you took the manuscript,

198
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,080
but you

199
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,280
still miscalculated.

200
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,390
Even if you think I'm lying,

201
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,350
what can you do?

202
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,560
Force the truth out of me

203
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,280
or

204
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,320
kill me?

205
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,960
I don't need to do either.

206
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,110
Since you brought the manuscript

207
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,630
from the shrine,

208
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,800
the real secret

209
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,680
must still be buried there.

210
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,800
There's nothing valuable there.

211
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,440
If you go, you'll be wasting your time.

212
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,920
Why are you so nervous?

213
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,840
I used to think

214
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,200
that with the Gui Seal in my hand,

215
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,160
the shrine was meaningless.

216
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,350
But now it seems

217
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,990
I really must pay it a visit.

218
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,560
We depart now.

219
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,280
Sir,

220
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,920
if we leave at night,

221
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,470
we must be wary of a Dongxia ambush.

222
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,630
Let me escort you.

223
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:10,960
Very well.

224
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,560
Your Majesty, you haven't been

225
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,630
resting well lately.

226
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,510
It's bad for your health.

227
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,820
[cold medicine]

228
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,590
The Princess left you

229
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,800
this medicine before she left.

230
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,630
It's very effective for colds.

231
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,200
You should drink it while it's hot.

232
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,160
Don't you mention her.

233
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,870
Bring her up now.

234
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,950
You ruined Dongxia's

235
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,320
marriage alliance with the Haidong Tribes,

236
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,390
and you still dare show your face?

237
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm here to save you.

238
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,950
What are you talking about?

239
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,390
Zhao Bingwen, Chief Grand Secretary of Great Yong,

240
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,870
is already in Dongxia.

241
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,240
He'll make his move

242
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,280
against Dongxia soon.

243
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,280
You came back dressed like that

244
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,190
just to tell me this?

245
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,720
He was the one who wrote to warn me last time

246
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,080
that you might return to Dongxia

247
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,430
with ill intentions.

248
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,670
No wonder you found

249
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,190
Zang Hai and me so quickly.

250
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,080
Zhao Bingwen

251
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,080
is using you to do his dirty work.

252
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,480
I'll be honest.

253
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,150
Zhao Bingwen came to Dongxia this time

254
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,630
specifically to meet with me.

255
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,560
The newly enthroned Emperor of Great Yong

256
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,150
sent Zhao Bingwen, the Chief Grand Secretary,

257
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,630
to Dongxia

258
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,630
to speak with me

259
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,430
about improving relations between our nations.

260
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,840
He brought the Gui Seal with him.

261
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,240
He's planning to use it here.

262
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,190
He didn't come

263
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,240
for peace.

264
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,840
He came

265
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,840
to take you hostage

266
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,280
so Dongxia can't fight back.

267
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,560
Mingxiang Antu,

268
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,530
you must be dying to see me fall out

269
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,280
with Great Yong's Chief Grand Secretary

270
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,560
so that I become the one

271
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,320
to blame for ruining

272
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,590
Dongxia's relations with Great Yong

273
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,720
and you can ascend the throne yourself.

274
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,110
I told you long ago

275
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,480
I had no interest in the throne.

276
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,800
If you don't believe me,

277
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,080
lock me up.

278
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,320
But you can't just sit back

279
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,840
and let Zhao Bingwen destroy Dongxia.

280
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,870
You think you're

281
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,000
so noble, don't you?

282
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,000
I can't stand

283
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,630
that righteous look of yours.

284
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,820
You have no idea how terrifying the Gui Seal

285
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,000
and the ghost soldiers are.

286
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,760
They can bring disaster

287
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,560
and wipe Dongxia out completely.

288
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,150
If our homeland

289
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,110
is gone,

290
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,350
what's the point of the throne?

291
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:03,950
I found

292
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,350
the shrine where the Gui Seal was sealed.

293
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,080
I now understand

294
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,320
why Queen Minglv Huda

295
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,800
hid it away.

296
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,760
Mother wanted it back

297
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,240
only so no one else could ever use it.

298
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,840
Yinshu,

299
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,240
you are the Queen of Dongxia.

300
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,950
The people here are your people.

301
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,630
You have to save them.

302
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,720
You can't go in.

303
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,110
If you do,

304
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,590
there's no coming back.

305
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,760
Stop trying to scare me.

306
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,980
You

307
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,430
made it out just fine.

308
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,870
Why wouldn't I?

309
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,950
All of you, stay here.

310
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,840
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

311
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,720
So this is where Kuai Duo

312
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,190
took the Gui Seal.

313
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,190
This is

314
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,240
where ghost soldiers should be created.

315
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:53,870
Sir...

316
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,390
Bring it out.

317
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,110
How incredible.

318
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,950
Why do you look so scared?

319
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,560
Take it

320
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,240
to him.

321
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,280
Drink it.

322
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,720
You want to know

323
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,350
what was on the page

324
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,350
I tore out, right?

325
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,240
Do you think this is how it works?

326
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,320
The truth

327
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,840
is right there on the murals.

328
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,320
Didn't you teach me

329
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,280
to fool others by telling the truth?

330
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,590
What Zhang Mie wrote on that page

331
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,590
was exactly what I told you.

332
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,560
Ghost soldiers

333
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,950
cannot be controlled.

334
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,670
They will only bring disaster.

335
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,480
Shut up!

336
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,390
You'll never be able to use the Gui Seal

337
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,760
to achieve your goal.

338
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,950
Zang Hai,

339
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,000
the Gui Seal

340
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,150
is in my hands.

341
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,520
Don't tell me

342
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,430
you're trying to kill me

343
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,390
with words.

344
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,520
You're not that naive, are you?

345
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,190
Should we head down

346
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,110
to check on Mr. Zhao?

347
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,670
He told us to stay here.

348
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,760
We shouldn't act on our own.

349
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,110
Still, I feel worried.

350
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,040
Are you worried about Mr. Zhao

351
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,110
or about Zang Hai?

352
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,080
How dare you attack a court officer?

353
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,950
So what if I did?

354
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,630
We'll blame it on Dongxia.

355
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,840
Do you really think Mr. Zhao didn't know

356
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,240
you let their princess go?

357
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,350
Today,

358
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,560
none of you

359
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,560
are leaving here alive.

360
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,520
I was about to say the same.

361
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,910
You always thought

362
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,430
I was too obsessed with revenge.

363
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,000
But aren't you the same

364
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,840
with the Gui Seal?

365
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,800
Even if I told you the truth,

366
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,670
you would never believe it.

367
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,080
That's why you came

368
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,430
to this cursed place.

369
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,280
You want to know

370
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,430
how to control ghost soldiers, huh?

371
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,350
Then watch closely

372
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,590
how they

373
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,910
obey my command!

374
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,110
Protect Mr. Zhao!

375
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,320
Farewell,

376
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:40,950
my "benefactor."

377
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:00,870
You're finally here.

378
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,190
Where is Zang Hai?

379
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,480
He and Zhao Bingwen are still down there.

380
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,240
Go!

381
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,560
Are you all right?

382
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,840
I'm fine.

383
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,590
Mother wanted it back

384
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,340
so no one

385
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,480
