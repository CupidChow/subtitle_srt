00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,940
[Legend of Zang Hai]

2
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,100
[Zhen Tower]

4
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,130
I knew it.

5
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,690
Anyone who walks out

6
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,130
of the imperial tomb alive

7
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,410
is no ordinary man.

8
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,570
The Marquis of Pingjin is truly fortunate

9
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,220
to have you, a man

10
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,890
of rare political acumen, working for him.

11
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,290
You flatter me.

12
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,260
I've only served the Marquis

13
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,730
for a few days.

14
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,060
I'm not great at socializing,

15
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,170
but I appreciate your compliments.

16
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,610
Please,

17
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,730
speak plainly.

18
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,570
Very well.

19
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,730
Then I'll get to the point.

20
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,170
I'm Xiang Antu,

21
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,850
owner of Zhen Tower.

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,730
I'm Zang Hai. It's a pleasure, Miss Xiang.

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,010
This is our third meeting.

24
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,780
Who would've thought?

25
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,610
You came to the Capital

26
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,730
penniless.

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,940
But now,

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,980
you've actually become the Marquis's

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,890
top aide.

30
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,060
In just a few months,

31
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,690
you've moved up so fast.

32
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,410
I'm truly curious.

33
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,010
What exactly

34
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,130
did you do

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,060
to rise from nothing

36
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,850
overnight?

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,010
Oh,

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,220
it was nothing but luck.

39
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,570
Let me be frank.

40
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,730
I admire your talent.

41
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,780
We've crossed paths more than once,

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,570
and I consider that fate.

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,450
If you're willing to serve

44
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,690
the Marquis of Pingjin,

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,010
why not consider becoming

46
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,500
an honored guest of mine?

47
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,450
Be it wealth or fame,

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,410
I can give you

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,060
whatever he gives you.

50
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,660
Are you trying to steal me

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,690
from the Marquis?

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,980
So what if I am?

53
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,290
It pays to be friends with me.

54
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:48,980
Forgive me.

55
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,170
I'm flattered

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,010
you think so highly of me.

57
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,450
But as for being friends,

58
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,850
I'm not worthy.

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,890
Last time at Zhen Tower,

60
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,680
Yang Zhen, Qu Jiao,

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,290
and Chu Huaiming humiliated you.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,540
I could've stood by and watched.

63
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,610
Do you know

64
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,940
why I stepped in?

65
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,010
Because you're different from them.

66
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,020
You're not evil by nature.

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,900
That's why you should know this:

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,100
The Marquis was a general.

69
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,930
He kills without hesitation

70
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,460
and trusts no one.

71
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,490
Working for him

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,220
will be

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,610
like dancing on the edge of a blade.

74
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,460
So tell me,

75
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,550
why throw in with him

76
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,540
and put your life at risk?

77
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,460
You're a pearl cast into the dust.

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,930
It's a waste.

79
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,980
You overestimate me, Miss Xiang.

80
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,350
I'm just

81
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,980
a grain of sand passing for a gem.

82
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,980
Everything I've done

83
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,210
has only been

84
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,570
to find a place to survive

85
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,730
in this vast world.

86
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,460
You say that,

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,020
but I don't believe your ambitions end there.

88
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,290
Are you trying to help him

89
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,730
regain command of the army

90
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,700
to prove your worth?

91
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,580
I always hope to do

92
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,050
what others can't.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,660
Looks like I was

94
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,730
wrong about you.

95
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,730
You and the Marquis are the same kind of man.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,460
In that case,

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,580
I won't press further.

98
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,100
I wish you success and glory.

99
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,490
Thank you, Miss Xiang.

100
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,930
I'll take my leave.

101
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,250
But do remember this:

102
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,610
Here in the Capital,

103
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,340
you'll need Zhen Tower's help

104
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,570
far more

105
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,490
than I'll need yours.

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,980
If you're ever in trouble and come asking for help,

107
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,700
don't be embarrassed when thinking

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,170
of what you said today.

109
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,180
[Zhen Tower]

110
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,220
I heard

111
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,930
he turned down your offer?

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,810
So that's Zang Hai, huh?

113
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,250
He described himself as a man

114
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,460
chasing fame and fortune.

115
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,370
And yet

116
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,220
he refused

117
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,460
your offer.

118
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,220
Seems he's got some principles after all.

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,660
What's that about?

120
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,490
Don't you understand?

121
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,680
He's determined to stake everything on the Marquis of Pingjin

122
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
to prove to the world

123
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,370
that he is no ordinary man.

124
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,850
And that he can achieve greatness.

125
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,490
What a shame.

126
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,850
He's in your bad books now.

127
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,970
With the Marquis's temperament,

128
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,780
if he ever regains military command,

129
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,040
he'll surely lead another campaign to the borders.

130
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,110
Yang Zhen is a petty man.

131
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,050
He's no threat at all.

132
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,900
But Zang Hai is different.

133
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,500
I don't want to see

134
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,820
a talent like him

135
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,290
under the Marquis's command.

136
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,140
So you want to get rid of him?

137
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,730
"Good fortune doesn't last forever.

138
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,100
Flowers don't bloom all year."

139
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,920
He may be the Marquis's

140
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,900
top aide now,

141
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,370
but with all the matters coming his way,

142
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,310
he can easily

143
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,100
slip up

144
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,460
and lose the Marquis's favor.

145
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,900
Mr. Zhuang.

146
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,490
Mr. Zang, you're back.

147
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,050
What are these?

148
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,350
These are all gifts from outside the residence.

149
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,700
They're for you.

150
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,660
Now that you're

151
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,810
favored by the Marquis,

152
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,340
everyone's rushing to curry favor

153
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,410
with you.

154
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,490
Look,

155
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,490
a jade belt hook carved with dragons and clouds.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,780
Look at the quality and the finish.

157
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,290
It's the finest of the fine.

158
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,930
Come, take a look at this too.

159
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,580
Go on. Unroll it.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,930
"Peacocks and a Loquat Tree"

161
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,340
by Cui Zixi of the Song Dynasty.

162
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,610
One glance, and you know it's genuine.

163
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,850
Look.

164
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,460
[A humble gift. May it bring delight.]

165
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,610
See these leaves and feathers?

166
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,780
[Note with gift]
So exquisite.

167
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,100
Absolutely elegant.

168
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,220
Sir,

169
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,780
why do none of these notes

170
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,790
have names attached?

171
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,170
Well...

172
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,100
Take them all inside.

173
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,810
Sir, you must not know.

174
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,660
These are what we call "reciprocal gifts".

175
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,370
It's an unwritten rule

176
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,770
here in the Capital.

177
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,420
Even if you want to return them,

178
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,980
you won't know whom to send them back to.

179
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,580
And when they

180
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,580
need my help,

181
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,490
they'll come and admit they sent the gifts.

182
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,580
Wise as always, sir.

183
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,730
Does the Marquis know?

184
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,850
Of course,

185
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,770
or you wouldn't have seen them here.

186
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,490
Did he say anything?

187
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,820
He doesn't bother with these things.

188
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,060
Since

189
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,700
the gifts are meant for you,

190
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,530
you can

191
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,580
handle them

192
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,650
as you see fit.

193
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,890
I see.

194
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,220
Then I'll accept them.

195
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,250
Did he accept the gifts?

196
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,490
Yes, My Lord.

197
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,770
Did you explain

198
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,980
what a "reciprocal gift" is?

199
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,420
I did.

200
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,100
And he knew

201
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,220
that accepting those gifts

202
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,370
meant owing favors to those who sent them.

203
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:31,450
[Marquis of Pingjin's Mansion]

204
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,410
Thank you...

205
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,150
Here you go.

206
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,720
What's going on?

207
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,060
- Someone's handing out congee. - Here, take it.

208
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,690
- Thanks. - The Marquis is so kind.

209
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,700
Come back if you need more.

210
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,530
- Here. - Thank you.

211
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,530
Careful. It's hot. Hold it steady.

212
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,460
Here.

213
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,580
Thank you, sir.

214
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,340
There's more if you need.

215
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,820
Little one,

216
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,850
- here you are. - Thank you.

217
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,180
- Be careful. It's hot. - Thank you.

218
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,890
Thank you so much.

219
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,690
Thank you.

220
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,060
Here you go.

221
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:51,940
Here.

222
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,610
Thank you.

223
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,390
Thank you.

224
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,670
Here.

225
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,830
Thank you.

226
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,360
Thanks.

227
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,200
- Here you go. - Thank you.

228
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,220
Greetings, My Lord.

229
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,230
The Marquis is so kind.

230
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,390
Next.

231
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,420
What are you doing?

232
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,090
Be careful. It's hot.

233
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:07,630
All right.

234
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,300
My Lord,

235
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,880
I received

236
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,010
some reciprocal gifts yesterday.

237
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,490
It weighed heavily on me,

238
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,750
so I converted the gifts

239
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,830
into grain

240
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,180
and gave it out

241
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,380
in your name

242
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,330
to the struggling common folk.

243
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,490
The Marquis is here!

244
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,460
The Marquis is here!

245
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,770
Thank you for your grace!

246
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,460
Thank you for your kindness!

247
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,610
Thank you for your grace!

248
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,300
We'll never forget...

249
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,450
Thank you, My Lord!

250
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,530
Your great kindness!

251
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,420
Thank you, My Lord!

252
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,130
- All right. - Thank you for your grace!

253
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,530
The Marquis is giving out congee

254
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,820
so you can all eat your fill.

255
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,940
So go ahead.

256
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,980
Thank you, My Lord!

257
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,370
Thank you!

258
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,490
Let's go get congee!

259
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,370
Come on. Let's go.

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,200
There's enough for everyone!

261
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,580
I acted on my own.

262
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,130
Please forgive me, My Lord.

263
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,770
Zang Hai,

264
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,060
I'm impressed.

265
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,300
You've handled this well.

266
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,820
I underestimated you.

267
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,290
- That's enough. - Thank you.

268
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:08,890
My Lord,

269
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,300
I'm flattered.

270
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,060
I've always kept in mind

271
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,340
that I serve you.

272
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,460
But those gifts were too extravagant.

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,890
If I'd accepted them,

274
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,300
you would've become indebted to those who sent them.

275
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,460
What I did today

276
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,030
should be enough

277
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,690
to stop more from coming.

278
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,530
If they send more,

279
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,730
just take them.

280
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,970
Or do you think

281
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,980
I can't handle

282
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,820
a few favors?

283
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,650
I would never think that.

284
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,250
Once you're done with the congee,

285
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,100
go to my study

286
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,370
and get the "Wei Liao's Art of War."

287
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,250
If you're to follow me,

288
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,890
you'll need to read more than Confucian Texts.

289
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,730
Start studying military strategy too.

290
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,850
Yes, My Lord.

291
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,680
Congratulations, Mr. Zang!

292
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,100
The Marquis has just

293
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,120
granted you

294
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,530
free access

295
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,980
to his study.

296
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,490
Tea tastes better when brewed

297
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,650
in this jade teapot.

298
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,980
If you like it, keep it.

299
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,490
There won't be another one anyway.

300
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,270
After what happened yesterday,

301
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,700
word has spread through the Capital.

302
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,490
And no one brought

303
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,300
any gifts today.

304
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,850
Gifts...

305
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,490
Whether you accept them or not, it leads to trouble.

306
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,980
Turn them down,

307
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,530
and you seem arrogant

308
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,700
and invite suspicion.

309
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,180
But I can't just take them either.

310
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,650
Yang Zhen has served the Marquis for over a decade.

311
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,530
The Marquis knows him

312
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,530
inside out.

313
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,100
Yang can accept gifts as he pleases,

314
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,730
but I can't.

315
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,180
Exactly.

316
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,890
All eyes

317
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,770
are on you now.

318
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,850
Anyway,

319
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,690
you've picked

320
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,030
all this up fast.

321
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,660
Who taught you that?

322
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,870
You did, of course.

323
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,890
Master, were you ever

324
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,770
in politics yourself?

325
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,860
Let's just say this:

326
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,780
Back when I was

327
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,080
making waves in the world,

328
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,820
you were still busy

329
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,970
playing in the mud.

330
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,180
There's one thing I didn't expect:

331
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,100
The mastermind behind the famed Zhen Tower

332
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,700
is actually

333
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,820
that pretty young lady.

334
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,490
She set me up at first，

335
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,370
but then pulled me out of danger,

336
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,920
and now she wants me

337
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,490
to turn against the Marquis and join her.

338
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,940
And she made you

339
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,130
a generous offer,

340
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,460
which you turned down.

341
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,100
She's more than she seems.

342
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,300
She's smart

343
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,250
and resourceful,

344
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,580
but she doesn't seem like a bad person.

345
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,340
Zang Hai really played

346
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,060
this hand beautifully.

347
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,060
The whole Capital's poor

348
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,420
now owe him a debt of gratitude.

349
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,490
Not only did he

350
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,300
kill off any hope of bribing him,

351
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,650
but he also managed to earn the Marquis's admiration.

352
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,700
You've been outsmarted.

353
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,100
That smile...

354
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,420
Zang Hai's in for a rough time, isn't he?

355
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,010
Do something for me.

356
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,100
What now?

357
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,250
When news comes from Mr. Eight,

358
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,770
the entire Capital believes it.

359
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,370
Spread a few things for me.

360
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,340
What kind of things?

361
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,420
No way.

362
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,130
I only speak the truth.

363
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,820
I don't start rumors.

364
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,700
You make your living off Zhen Tower.

365
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,610
How dare you say no?

366
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,490
Are you going to help me or not?

367
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,610
No.

368
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,240
Last time, when you gossiped about the Empress Dowager

369
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,370
and drew the attention of the undercover guards,

370
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,940
wasn't I the one who got you out of trouble?

371
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,260
But I only did that to help Zhen Tower

372
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,300
earn more money.

373
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:02,940
Then how about this?

374
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,770
From now on, I'll give you an extra cut

375
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,730
from ticket sales.

376
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,250
Just help me this once,

377
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,010
will you?

378
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,580
Come on.

379
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,130
Please?

380
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,730
Then let's be clear.

381
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,820
Just this once.

382
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,180
Just once this year.

383
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,010

00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,460
Where did you get these tools?

573
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,380
None of your concern.

574
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,860
Then tell me.

575
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,810
Why do you need to get close to the Marquis?

576
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,330
You're about to die anyway.

577
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,700
I might as well tell you.

578
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,250
I want to get close to him

579
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,860
so I can kill him

580
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,460
and avenge my master.

581
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,660
Your master?

582
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,730
Isn't he right here?

583
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,380
I'm not talking about him.

584
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,370
I'm avenging

585
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,330
the death of my true master.

586
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,570
And who was that?

587
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,660
Enough.

588
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,980
Stop stalling.

589
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,810
You're dying today no matter what.

590
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,810
Right!

591
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,380
If I'm dying today,

592
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,940
at least hear me out.

593
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,620
If you want my face,

594
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,030
taking just the skin above the neck

595
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,740
won't work.

596
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,480
Bet you didn't know that.

597
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,250
The skin on the neck, chest,

598
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,460
and back is all connected.

599
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,900
One slip,

600
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,260
and you'll tear the whole thing.

601
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,300
If you want a clean cut,

602
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,490
you've got to start from the back.

603
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,490
Shut up.

604
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,540
Spare me the lecture.

605
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,820
Of course I know that.

606
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,010
I was just testing the angle.

607
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,260
Strip him.

608
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,640
Hurry.

609
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:34,820
What's wrong?

610
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,380
Scars.

611
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,460
So?

612
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,380
We just need his face.

613
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,780
I'll knock him out now.

614
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,460
Wait!

615
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,380
How did you get these scars?

616
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,410
I got them

617
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,900
from being whipped

618
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,030
as a child.

619
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,780
My father was in Dongxia then.

620
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,530
My senior brother

621
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,490
applied the medicine for me.

622
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,260
But the wounds were deep.

623
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,300
They didn't heal right.

624
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,620
Later, a master

625
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,130
helped mend them.

626
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,350
Why mend them?

627
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,490
Because I, too,

628
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,760
have a blood feud to settle.

629
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,650
Are you...?

630
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,260
When my senior brother was three,

631
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,980
my father took him in as a disciple.

632
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,490
As kids,

633
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,560
we'd go up the mountains together

634
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,930
to survey the land and gather herbs.

635
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,210
We'd even skip lessons and get punished together.

636
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,530
Whenever I got into trouble,

637
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,610
I'd make him take the blame.

638
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,530
I was always pranking him.

639
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,980
One time,

640
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,090
he got punished

641
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,300
and sent to the back mountain,

642
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,380
so he didn't get to die with his master,

643
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,130
and he just kept dragging out his days. Is that right?

644
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,530
He wasn't the most gifted disciple,

645
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,690
but he was the one

646
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,010
my father cared for the most.

647
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,520
If Father knew

648
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,260
he was still alive,

649
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,590
he'd be overjoyed.

650
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,090
Father named him Guanfeng,
[*watching the wind]

651
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,300
hoping he'd live freely

652
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,490
like the breeze itself.

653
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,690
I am Guanfeng.

654
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,130
I am Guanfeng.

655
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,340
I am Guanfeng!

656
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,900
It's really you, Zhinu!

657
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,460
You're alive!

658
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,530
Zhinu,

659
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,300
I'm so glad you're alive.

660
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,980
That's all that matters.

661
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,490
That's everything

662
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,650
that happened.

663
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,610
So

664
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,300
you had your face changed.

665
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,460
No wonder I didn't recognize you.

666
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,010
You're not

667
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,210
that chubby kid from back then either.

668
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,610
We've both changed a lot.

669
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,530
That young master of yours...

670
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,650
Can he really be trusted?

671
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,090
He's an orphan from outside the Capital.

672
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,710
He's devoted to his training.

673
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,460
We've known each other for years.

674
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,740
He'd

675
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,900
risk his life to help me get revenge.

676
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,420
You can trust him.

677
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:01,860
But hey,

678
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,610
he's not my real master.

679
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,940
Sounds like you've

680
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,570
been through a lot too.

681
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,340
Tell me everything.

682
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,860
That day,

683
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,900
Madam sent me to the mountain

684
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,420
to chop firewood and reflect on my mistakes.

685
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,340
Just after nightfall,

686
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,460
I saw Master

687
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,650
return from the southwest.

688
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,210
I thought

689
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,380
Madam might be glad

690
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,900
to see him home...

691
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,570
- Master... - And go easy on me.

692
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,230
Master...

693
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,650
- Master... - So I rushed down the mountain.

694
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,920
But when I was almost home,

695
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,630
I heard screams.

696
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,760
A bunch of people were guarding the residence,

697
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,970
and they were armed with swords.

698
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,980
I hid right away.

699
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,060
Then

700
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,620
I saw someone

701
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,460
come out.

702
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,380
It was the Marquis of Pingjin.

703
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,980
Next, I saw Master and Madam

704
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,170
being carried out by his men.

705
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:04,860
I was terrified.

706
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,900
I didn't know what had happened.

707
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,010
After they all left,

708
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,610
I ran home.

709
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,050
But the fire had already spread.

710
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,820
I couldn't get inside.

711
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,740
Help!

712
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,980
Fire!

713
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,200
Uncle Li, help me put out the fire!

714
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,650
I rushed to get help from the neighbors,

715
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,980
but when I entered their home,

716
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,610
all I saw were bodies.

717
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,900
After that,

718
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,380
I ended up on the streets,

719
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,260
living from day to day.

720
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,570
But all this time,

721
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,780
I held on

722
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,210
to the Eight-Lancet Set Master gave me,

723
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,650
vowing

724
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,210
to take revenge one day.

725
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,010
Two buns, please.

726
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,610
Right away.

727
00:39:59,400 --> 00:39:59,940
Here you go.

728
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,650
Thanks.

729
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,130
Sir.

730
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,250
Coming!

731
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,200
I'm paying for a bun.

732
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,470
Thanks a lot.

733
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:32,900
Go ahead and eat.

734
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,170
That day,

735
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,460
I met Shilei

736
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,530
and Kaizhen Sanren.

737
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,980
They took me in,

738
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,860
and Shilei became my new master.

739
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,860
After Kaizhen Sanren passed away,

740
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,340
Shilei and I

741
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,340
depended on each other for survival.

742
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,090
But there's one thing

743
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,130
I've never let go of:

744
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,300
revenge.

745
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,130
So later,

746
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,900
I found a way

747
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,340
into the Marquis's mansion as an aide.

748
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,300
Shame on me.

749
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,670
After all these years,

750
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,490
I still couldn't

751
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,300
get close to him.

752
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,900
But fortunately,

753
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,740
you're here now.

754
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,780
We'll take him down together.

755
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,560
You're the Marquis's

756
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,420
top aide now.

757
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,860
Do you have

758
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:18,940
a plan to make a move?

759
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,010
Actually, before you two, someone else

760
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,420
tried to make me kill the Marquis.

761
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,590
I was about to take the risk,

762
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,980
but then you captured me.

763
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,900
So that's the person you said threatened you?

764
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,860
Who could it be?

765
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,490
I'm not sure yet.

766
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:39,650
But

767
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,300
it doesn't matter anymore.

768
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,690
I'm going to kill the Marquis anyway.

769
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,280
Earlier, you mentioned

770
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,570
there was something crucial.

771
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,130
What is it?

772
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:51,980
The Marquis of Pingjin

773
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,530
killed so many people in our family

774
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,170
because he was after something

775
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,090
my father brought back

776
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,980
from Dongxia.

777
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,740
But he never found it.

778
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,210
Father must have

779
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,570
hidden it away beforehand.

780
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,820
But I can't figure out

781
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,260
where he could've hidden it.

782
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,690
He hid something?

783
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,180
Where could it be?

784
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,940
Didn't you just say

785
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,870
that when my father

786
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,610
returned from Dongxia,

787
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,690
he came from the southwest?

788
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,100
Normally,

789
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,380
he should've come from the northeast.

790
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,050
If he came from the southwest,

791
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,170
he must've taken a big detour.

792
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,640
Do you think he

793
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,780
took that route

794
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,490
to hide the thing?

795
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,940
When we were little,

796
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:34,990
didn't he often take us

797
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,300
to the mountains over there for lessons?

798
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,420
But I

799
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,940
only remember a few mountains in that area.

800
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,940
Where do you think

801
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,900
he could've hidden it?

802
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,050
It must be somewhere hard to find.

803
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,860
The Tomb of Liu Xian.

804
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,130
Before going to Dongxia,

805
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,380
he took me to that tomb once.

806
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,050
Right.

807
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,010
What better place

808
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,860
to hide it

809
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,940
