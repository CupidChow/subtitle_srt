1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:18,220



2
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:30,060
   

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,746
   

4
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,135
   

5
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,260
Is he suspecting something?

6
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,760
Xiao Hai and you are together at the Cabinet together.

7
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,580
He's too busy to even get any sleep.

8
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,000
I doubt he has any other thoughts.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Judging from Zang Hai's intelligence,

10
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,790
do you think he's getting further away

11
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,130
or closer to the truth?

12
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,310
Since you can't locate the bronze fish,

13
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,460
I won't wait any longer.

14
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,320
It's time to do it my way.

15
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,260
Sir, why don't I search again?

16
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,450
You won't find what he's hidden with a simple search.

17
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,020
Then...

18
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,800
 Master. 

19
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,930
- What is it? 
  - Lord Zang has invited you to dinner tonight. 

20
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,080
I see.

21
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,140
- Sir... 
 - I know what you want to say.

22
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,870
Don't worry.

23
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,230
I only want what's best for him.

24
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,850
You may leave.

25
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,500
It's time.

26
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,560
Go ahead.

27
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,010
Understood.

28
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,410
Sir.

29
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,400
Benefactor.

30
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,000
Please.

31
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,860
Xiao Hai,

32
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,240
it seems that you cooked a nice table of food without me.

33
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,030
Master has always cooked for us.

34
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,400
It's your disciple's turn to cook for you.

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,710
The disciple surpasses the master.

36
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,000
Gao Ming,

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,400
you are going to lose your job as a master.

38
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,130
Benefactor, please sit.

39
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,510
Where are the rest?

40
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,960
I cooked for everyone.

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,200
In the end, Feng Liu and Ying Qi dragged Antu to see the lanterns.

42
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,560
Guan Feng and Shi Lei went with them.

43
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,480
Just like that, I'm left at home all alone.

44
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,610
Master, sit.

45
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,940
All right.

46
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,390
Benefactor,

47
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,500
I've learned a lot from you while working in the Cabinet.

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,370
This cup of wine is a toast to you.

49
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
Zang Hai,

50
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,060
you joined the Cabinet to share my burden

51
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,830
and make up for the deficiencies.

52
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,290
I should be the one proposing this toast.

53
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,430
Benefactor, please help yourself.

54
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,800
All right.

55
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,380
Try the stir-fried eggs with tomatoes.

56
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,540
- All right. 
 - My mother taught me how to make this.

57
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,510
Our family was too large for lavish meals every day.

58
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,390
But we had plenty of hens that laid eggs.

59
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,940
Try this. It's cold tofu with green onions.

60
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,090
It was my father's favorite food.

61
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,350
There is a well-known story about this dish.

62
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,920
A ministerial counselor of the founding emperor discovered that

63
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,140
his hometown friend and the local officials were accepting bribes.

64
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,190
Instead of covering up for his friend,

65
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,950
he abided by the law and executed him.

66
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,600
But the local officials were afraid that they would be implicated

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
and made false accusations against him.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,850
Later, in the winter,

69
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,390
that minister served the Emperor a pottery jar

70
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,940
filled with cold tofu with green onions.

71
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,950
The Emperor caught the hidden meaning.

72
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,710
He punished all the corrupt officials and sought justice for the minister.

73
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,360
Clear and transparent.

74
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,020
It's quite similar to the story of my demotion back then.

75
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,560
He didn't win the Emperor's trust with that dish.

76
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,580
It was because he helped the Emperor to conquer the world.

77
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,750
It was the same with my father.

78
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,600
Back then, he spoke up for you in the imperial court to seek justice

79
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,410
and leveraged his connections with His Majesty.

80
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,210
If it weren't for my father,

81
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,900
I'm afraid you wouldn't have resumed your officialdom.

82
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,500
Your father helped me,

83
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,750
but I failed to repay him.

84
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,750
My father never expected anything in return when helping others.

85
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,440
But even if someone can't repay other people's kindness,

86
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,150
they shouldn't return favors with betrayal.

87
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,820
Lord Zhao,

88
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,700
should I call you my benefactor

89
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,510
or my enemy?

90
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,120
Xiao Hai!

91
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,830
Zang Hai.

92
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,800
I take it you aren't just probing for information.

93
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,870
You assigned the masters to teach me everything.

94
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,190
How can you expect to deceive me with Shi Yiping's death?

95
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,790
Even if your plan was foolproof,

96
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,970
it was you who took me to the Shi Residence, after all.

97
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,590
As long as I have a trace of doubt,

98
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,110
I'll find out the truth eventually.

99
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,700
What did you find out?

100
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,390
Lu Min.

101
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,970
Lu Min?

102
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,000
He was your classmate at the Academy of Great Yong.

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,700
Back then, Lu Min, Zhuang Luyin, and you

104
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,150
attended the Academy of Great Yong and became classmates.

105
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,610
Remember?

106
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,380
A tiny flaw in perfect planning.

107
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,470
I didn't expect you would find out about the Academy of Great Yong.

108
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,740
Zhinu, congratulations.

109
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,720
Finally, you've reached the end of this path.

110
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,700
Since you're well prepared, I think everyone is here.

111
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,390
Come out!

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,360
You...

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,720
I've considered several possibilities.

114
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,790
For example,

115
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,690
you're indeed my third enemy,

116
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,170
but you are not the mastermind.

117
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,910
You were one step late

118
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,810
to stop Zhuang Luyin and Cao Jingxian from killing my family.

119
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,380
Today,

120
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,100
I demand an answer.

121
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,140
Because only you know the truth now.

122
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,510
Zang Hai,

123
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,150
you are indeed a real genius.

124
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:57,980
I wonder if it's a blessing or a curse.

125
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,480
But it's a pity...

126
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,740
that I'm better informed

127
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,270
and have gotten ahead of you.

128
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,530
However, now that it has come to this,

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,380
I don't want to hide the truth anymore.

130
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,000
I am...

131
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,420
your last enemy.

132
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:30,330
I planned for the annihilation of the Kuai family.

133
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,220
Even if your father hadn't died at Zhuang Luyin's hands

134
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,490
and surrendered the Gui Seal,

135
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,580
he wouldn't have survived.

136
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,010
   

137
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,650
After all, you saved me and let me live till today.

138
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,610
I can grant you a quick death.

139
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,560
I'm impressed you could figure me out

140
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,030
but you are wrong about something.

141
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:55,600
I didn't stage Shi Yiping's death to deceive you.

142
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,330
I did it to deceive another person.

143
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,270
   

144
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,650
- Don't move! 
 - Don't move!

145
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,220
You...

146
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,730
We're here to arrest Zang Hai on His Majesty's verbal decree.

147
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,420
Arrest him!

148
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,830
You may leave.

149
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,450
Let me talk to him alone.

150
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

151
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,410
You...

152
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Zang Hai,

153
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,630
do you know how it feels to be an emperor?

154
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,280
No, Your Majesty.

155
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,020
It feels lonely.

156
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,420
I have to make decisions for the entire nation.

157
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,050
I must hold onto power,

158
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,280
govern all the ministers,

159
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,900
and take care of the people.

160
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,070
It's lonely at the top.

161
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,250
That's why Your Majesty likes carpentry.

162
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,600
It's something you do for yourself.

163
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,020
I miss my old life every single day

164
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,500
since I ascended the throne.

165
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,980
But if I hadn't become the emperor,

166
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,590
I would have died long ago.

167
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,530
I just don't understand.

168
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,430
Why didn't your father trust me, either?

169
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,650
Your Majesty, my father didn't betray you.

170
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,670
Otherwise, he wouldn't have taken the secret of the Gui Seal to his grave.

171
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,280
I've always wanted to ask your father...

172
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,440
why he chose to keep the secret at the cost of his life.

173
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,100
He could have just spilled the beans.

174
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,940
He thought I'd be afraid of those people?

175
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,230
My father died for a just cause.

176
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,110
He wasn't trying to keep your secret.

177
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,500
He just didn't want the Gui Seal to be activated again.

178
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,660
Kuai Duo,

179
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,440
I've underestimated you.

180
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,740
Zang Hai, you lied to me

181
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,390
but I won't kill you.

182
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,520
Nor will I vent my anger on your people.

183
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,400
But...

184
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,220
you must hand over the bronze fish.

185
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,570
The bronze fish are in Wenyuan Pavilion,

186
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,350
hidden under Zhao Bingwen's seat.

187
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,780
These are the bronze fish that weren't handed over to me.

188
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,070
Your Majesty, I gave you the Gui Seal

189
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,780
without handing over the bronze fish

190
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,690
because I understood my father's painstaking efforts.

191
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,550
What makes you think I would activate the seal?

192
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,770
Great Yong hasn't waged a war against anyone for over a decade.

193
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,380
All states have surrendered; the kingdom is at peace.

194
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:50,170
I wanted the Gui Seal because my father told me to obtain it before he died.

195
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,970
You hid the bronze fish

196
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,770
because you feared your father would die in vain.

197
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,410
You wanted to honor his legacy.

198
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,550
But it's the same for me.

199
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,970
Even if Your Majesty never uses the Gui Seal,

200
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,060
who can guarantee that every emperor

201
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,360
in the later eras will do the same as Your Majesty?

202
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,110
What about you?

203
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,860
If you keep the bronze fish to yourself,

204
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,740
can you guarantee that your descendants won't covet the Gui Seal?

205
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,860
Your Majesty, the Gui Seal is an ominous item.

206
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,650
Countless people have died because of it.

207
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,250
As sovereign of all under heaven,

208
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,490
Your Majesty should govern with benevolent authority.

209
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,900
I implore you to destroy this item.

210
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,820
One more thing.

211
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,430
My third enemy is still alive.

212
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,720
It's Zhao Bingwen.

213
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,490
Everything that happened before was just a smokescreen to deceive us.

214
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,060
He told you about the bronze fish

215
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,580
to prevent me from avenging my family.

216
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,380
Zhao Bingwen didn't tell me about the bronze fish.

217
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,960
 Your Majesty. 

218
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,060
 What's going on? 

219
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,750
 Your Majesty, the imperial guards caught him outside the palace. 

220
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,870
 He's Shi Quan from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, a wanted man. 

221
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,900
 He kept asking to see you. 

222
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,060
 And he said something that shouldn't be said. 

223
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,160
 I want to tell Your Majesty something 

224
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,560
 about the treasure of Dongxia. 

225
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,160
 Leave us alone. 

226
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,730
 Understood. 

227
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,100
 I remember that you have another name. 

228
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,830
 I'm Eunuch Cao's foster son. My real name is Lu Fen. 

229
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,200
 You two took something from me. 

230
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,580
 Cao Jingxian is dead. Why are you still alive? 

231
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,240
 I should have killed myself. 

232
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,140
 But I couldn't die without avenging my foster father. 

233
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,510
 How do you want to avenge him? Let's hear it. 

234
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,450
 Your Majesty, do you know 

235
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,930
 that it takes three bronze fish to activate the Gui Seal? 

236
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,900
 What did you say? 

237
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,970
 I denounce Zang Hai for hiding Your Majesty's treasure 

238
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,580
 and deceiving Your Majesty for personal gain. 

239
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,240
Sir.

240
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,420
Sir, you finally came.

241
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,290
I did everything you told me.

242
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,930
Your Majesty, please investigate.

243
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,460
Zhao Bingwen admitted to me that he was my third enemy.

244
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,380
Besides, it was he who took me to visit Shi Yiping.

245
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,690
He instigated Lu Yan to kill Lord Shi.

246
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,270
He also instigated Lu Fen to snitch on me.

247
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,510
Enough! Regarding Zhao Bingwen,

248
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,540
I'll investigate on my own.

249
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,970
Be careful, Your Majesty.

250
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,640
He must be coveting the Gui Seal!

251
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,980
I'm tired. Take him away.

252
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,340
I will decide how to deal with him later.

253
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,240
Guards!

254
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,430
Tomorrow morning,

255
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,880
summon Zhao Bingwen to the palace.

256
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

257
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,330
   

258
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,530
What lies did you tell His Majesty again?

259
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,340
His Majesty didn't ask me anything.

260
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,710
Why should I lie?

261
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,060
You made Lu Fen snitch on me

262
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,180
and forced me to hand over the bronze fish.

263
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,910
Now, you can't get them, either.

264
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,240
Something happened to His Majesty last night.

265
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,290
His life is at stake.

266
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,240
You were the last person to see him,

267
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,140
and he put you in jail.

268
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,350
Eunuch Sun knows what happened.

269
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,240
- He wouldn't... 
 - I'm the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

270
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,100
I'm deeply trusted by His Majesty.

271
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,140
His Majesty was in trouble.

272
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,030
Sun Defang and Xue Zhao failed to protect him.

273
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,830
I've put them in jail.

274
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,510
His Majesty is now under my protection.

275
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,410
Getting the bronze fish and the Gui Seal

276
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:04,380
is just like taking an item out of a bag.

277
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,760
Zang Hai, what a pity.

278
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,430
All this is destined to happen.

279
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,620
If you hadn't discovered my real identity,

280
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,280
as the Chief Cabinet Secretary, I could release you now.

281
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,590
You can then keep working for me.

282
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,190
There are so many things...

283
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,040
we can work on together.

284
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,520
One lie needs a hundred more lies to cover it.

285
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,620
Sooner or later, the truth will be revealed.

286
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,790
The art of deception is a conspiracy. The art of strategy

287
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,360
is an overt plan.

288
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,690
Plan overtly,

289
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,780
succeed covertly.

290
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,290
Can you grasp the difference?

291
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,730
When did you start plotting against me?

292
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:15,700
When you told me that Kuai Duo gave the Gui Seal to His Majesty.

293
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,440
I learned where the Gui Seal was.

294
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,240
But I was deeply concerned

295
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,420
because you had His Majesty's support.

296
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:37,290
But the real challenge lies in getting the last bronze fish from you.

297
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,110
So, you placed the bronze fish and the Gui Seal

298
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,880
in Shi Yiping's residence.

299
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,350
This is about framing Shi Yiping as the fall guy,

300
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,080
allowing His Majesty to secure the Gui Seal,

301
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,720
dispelling his suspicions,

302
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,200
and driving a wedge between His Majesty and me

303
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,600
with the bronze fish that I possessed.

304
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:02,900
You have to give something to get something.

305
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,090
General, there is no one here.

306
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,060
Seems like they made earlier preparations.

307
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,240
Relay this order. Lock down the whole city!

308
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,730
Understood.

309
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,640
You want me to weigh

310
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,030
personal revenge against peace in the kingdom.

311
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,310
If I hand over the bronze fish,

312
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,000
the Gui Seal may be activated at any time.

313
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,440
But if I don't,

314
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,960
I can't prove it to His Majesty that you're the third person.

315
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,350
I know you all too well.

316
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,920
You only want revenge

317
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,630
but you can't change who you are.

318
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,790
In this world,

319
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:13,110
being good just makes life harder.

320
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:18,160
Because your ties and worries weigh too heavily.

321
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,030
As long as you make the same decision as your father,

322
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:25,520
you can't use His Majesty against me.

323
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,850
You know my father very well.

324
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,550
Is your story with him true or false?

325
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,870
The most powerful trick is to deceive people by telling the truth.

326
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,640
Mix one lie with nine truths.

327
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,070
That's the art of deception.

328
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,510
Kuai Duo did speak out for me in court.

329
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:10,670
I did write a petition asking His Majesty to punish the culprits.

330
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:16,960
However, we had no correspondence.

331
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,160
I had never received any letter from him in Yuezhou.

332
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,120
The letter was sent to me by Zhuang Luyin.

333
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,880
I asked Gao Ming to stay in Yuezhou on my behalf

334
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,750
and hurried back to the capital.

335
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,580
I told Cao Jingxian to guard the city gates

336
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,030
with the Surveillance Officers.

337
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:42,400
Sure enough, we found your father's tracks that day

338
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,110
but he later vanished into thin air.

339
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,600
Little did we know that he took the secret passage to the palace.

340
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,750
Anyway, we waited for him near the mansion.

341
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,620
So, I was right.

342
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,960
You manipulated the bandits into getting caught

343
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,310
and made them admit to killing my family.

344
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,810
You later implored His Majesty to punish the culprits.

345
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,280
That was how you killed everyone involved.

346
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,150
After that,

347
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,140
I've been waiting for someone to seek justice for Kuai Duo.

348
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:26,210
I waited for the person who hid the Gui Seal to show up.

349
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,070
But I didn't expect

350
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,310
that Kuai Duo's death was like a rock sinking into the sea,

351
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,490
which didn't stir anything up.

352
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,280
Eventually, I learned from you...

353
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,860
that His Majesty held the Gui Seal.

354
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,390
Zhuang Luyin tipped you off.

355
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,860
Cao Jingxian guarded the gates for you.

356
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,620
You managed to make them follow your plan

357
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,540
and keep you behind the scenes.

358
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:07,190
Are you interested in what happened at the Academy of Great Yong?

359
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:18,110
I was born in a border town constantly caught up in wars.

360
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,740
My father named me "Bingwen" 
    

361
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,100
and wanted me to uphold the moral principles of Emperor Wen

362
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,090
and become an imperial court official one day.

363
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,860
In the end, I lived up to his expectations

364
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,130
and was admitted to the Academy of Great Yong at the age of ten.

365
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,010
Back then, most of the students 
    

366
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,490
were children of noble families.

367
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:46,280
I soon became a thorn in their eyes

368
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,680
because my family was poor, but I was extremely talented.

369
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,610
 Let go. 

370
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,800
 You want to be someone like us? 

371
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,190
 In your dreams! 

372
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,360
 The rule of Great Xian bars imperfect people from joining the imperial court. 

373
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,720
 I will cut off your finger and stop you from dreaming. 

374
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,920
 The son of a defeated general dares to stand up for him? 

375
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,530
 You're losing a finger, too! 

376
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,180
 Master, come quickly. They are over there! 

377
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,460
 Consider yourself lucky. Just you wait! 

378
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,000
 Are you hurt? 

379
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,900
 I'm fine. 

380
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,630
 I am Lu Min. He is Zhuang Luyin. 

381
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,650
 What is your name? 

382
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,400
 Zhao Bingwen. 

383
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,340
Just like me, Lu Min was from a poor family.

384
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,340
Zhuang Luyin's father died in a battle at the border.

385
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,440
His family fell from grace.

386
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:48,570
After that, the three of us were ostracized by the other students.

387
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,110
We were often bullied.

388
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,090
We tried to fight back

389
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,360
but even the masters sided with them.

390
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,840
At that time, I realized...

391
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,760
there is something called "power" in the world.

392
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,040
 If you don't want to be bullied, make him scared of you first. 

393
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,200
 You go first. 

394
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,890
 How dare you hit me? 

395
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,530
 - Behave! 
 - I won't let you off! 

396
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,830
 I will tell my father. 

397
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,060
 Once he comes, he will kill you all! 

398
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,220
 Stop running. 

399
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,270
 Help... 

400
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,840
 Help... 

401
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,610
 Help... 

402
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,660
 Does it mean we won't be bullied again? 

403
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,400
 Sooner or later, someone else will bully us. 

404
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,540
 We can only survive by constantly gaining power. 

405
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,260
But we couldn't hide the truth forever.

406
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,050
Nor would the hatred disappear.

407
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,000
Lu Min's wounds made people believe

408
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,900
that he was related to the drowning.

409
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,880
   

410
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,670
Lu Min's life was ruined.

411
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,840
He could no longer remain at the Academy of Great Yong

412
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,660
and had to enter the palace as a eunuch.

413
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,280
 Let's go. 

414
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,880
 Since you've taken this step, 

415
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,220
 the outside world no longer has anything to do with you. 

416
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,590
Many years later, Lu Min, who had long been renamed Cao Jingxian,

417
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,630
became the Seal-Holding Eunuch Director.

418
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,710
Zhuang Luyin defeated the Dongxia Army

419
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,920
and became a prominent general.

420
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,220
I also became the deputy chief secretary of the Cabinet.

421
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,810
Only we knew that we were true allies.

422
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,780
   

423
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:33,290
If it weren't for you, they wouldn't have ended up like this.

424
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:45,540
   

425
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,780
Miss, take it easy.

426
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,530
We will hear from Guan Feng soon.

427
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,320
- Antu. 
 - Tong'er, you finally came.

428
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,950
Antu, it wasn't easy to get rid of the people trailing me.

429
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,390
But I can't stay long.

430
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,310
How did you find this hidden place?

431
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,700
I thought you had left.

432
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,730
Zang Hai prepared this safe house.

433
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,470
We rushed here once the imperial guards left last night.

434
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,270
Antu, you're on the wanted notices throughout the capital.

435
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,380
Be very careful.

436
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,690
But His Majesty promised to set us free last night.

437
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,200
Why are we on the wanted notices today?

438
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,750
What happened to Zang Hai?

439
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,140
Come here.

440
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,610
I don't know what Lord Zang said to His Majesty.

441
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,350
But everyone in the palace is saying

442
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:38,350
that he attempted to kill His Majesty.

443
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,950
He wouldn't do that.

444
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,590
He was set up!

445
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,400
- Where are you going? 
 - To save him!

446
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,690
Zang Hai is in jail. How can you save him?

447
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,330
Maybe you'll be arrested even before you get to see him.

448
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,990
I'll go to Prince of Yong Rong. He can save Zang Hai.

449
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,400
He's the most powerful member of the imperial clan.

450
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,800
That makes him a major suspect.

451
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,580
Besides, he's locked up in his mansion and can't even go out.

452
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,310
Who can save Lord Zang now?

453
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,710
Antu, calm down.

454
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,440
We will figure something out.

455
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,770
Should I ask my father for help?

456
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:31,000
Tong'er, what I'm about to say may put you in a difficult position.

457
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,990
But I have to tell you, anyway.

458
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,220
It's about my father?

459
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,360
Why did you save me?

460
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,400
Why did you train me?

461
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,760
If you hadn't told me about the third enemy,

462
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,110
I might have been kept in the dark forever.

463
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:53,670
How are you going to live without hatred?

464
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,840
I told you about your three enemies

465
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,380
so that you would keep taking revenge

466
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,280
until you helped me find the Gui Seal.

467
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,500
You are the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

468
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,340
Why are you obsessed with the Gui Seal?

469
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,740
Great Yong is a huge place.

470
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,660
There's too much work

471
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,320
and we need many ministers.

472
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,510
As long as those people exist,

473
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:30,100
even His Majesty will encounter obstacles.

474
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,840
I want to change the kingdom.

475
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:41,010
However, we can't count on people like Kuai Duo to do that.

476
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,920
But the Gui Seal is different.

477
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,400
As long as I obtain it,

478
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,150
I can turn all the people in Dongxia into ghost soldiers

479
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,770
and form an invincible army.

480
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,930
I will make all rulers submit to Great Yong...

481
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:07,360
and make their people work for Great Yong.

482
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,710
That will only bring endless war.

483
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,340
The unity of the kingdom relies on harmony.

484
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:22,400
History will record you as a scourge of the nation.

485
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,340
Only losers will be despised.

486
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:33,370
As long as I succeed, history will record praises of me.

487
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:49,880



488
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:22,260
 "It's me" - Sun Nan 

489
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,780
♫  I conceal the ambition in my eyes  ♫

490
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:36,360
♫  In my palm, I hold a dangerous desire  ♫

491
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,920
♫  Turbulent waves hide in my sleeves  ♫

492
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,420
♫  Silent like the clap of thunder  ♫

493
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,060
♫  The depth of shrewdness  ♫

494
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,330
♫  Can’t escape  ♫

495
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,480
♫  My sharp eyes  ♫

496
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:04,640
♫  Conspiracies are my armor  ♫

497
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,680
♫  Overt plans are my sword and spear  ♫

498
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,140
♫  With stoic madness  ♫

499
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,920
♫  I cleanse the filth of the world  ♫

500
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,540
♫  The night is not dark  ♫

501
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,640
♫  Because  ♫

502
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,720
♫  My heart is burning bright  ♫

503
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,500
♫  I’m the turning clouds  ♫

504
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,320
♫  I’m the falling rain  ♫

505
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,800
♫  The compass of the human soul is unpredictable  ♫

506
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,980
♫  There will always be people who rise and fall  ♫

507
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,600
♫  I am life and death  ♫

508
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,280
♫  I grant and deprive  ♫

509
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,780
♫  When faith burns like the scorching sun  ♫

510
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,380
♫  I will sing loudly with you  ♫

511
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,740
♫  I am the sowing season  ♫

512
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,460
♫  I am the autumn harvest  ♫

513
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,820
♫  I am the kingdom  ♫

514
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,580
♫  I’m the commoner  ♫

515
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,860
♫  You’re also me  ♫
