00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,300
work for the Marquis directly

196
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,250
with you, Mr. Yang.

197
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,610
You've been in charge of the aides

198
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,530
for years.

199
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,700
Don't let this young man take your place.

200
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,420
If you lose to him,

201
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,180
my life won't be easy, either.

202
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,650
He may hold a grudge

203
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,820
for the hardship I've put him through.

204
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,060
We've seen so many young men

205
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,250
smarter than him

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,220
fail to obtain power.

207
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,980
Since the Marquis has asked about him,

208
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,010
we'd better pay him some attention.

209
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,730
Coming.

210
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,820
Mr. Zang.

211
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,580
Please join Mr. Yang at the Zhen Tower

212
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,420
this early evening.

213
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,700
Alright.

214
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,320
- Bravo. - Bravo.

[Ledger]

216
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,770
Young Master Zhuang

217
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,420
owes 500 liang to the Lotus House,

218
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,420
320 liang to the Peony House,

219

170 liang to the Yecha Theater,

221
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,650
and he owes

222
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,770
1325 liang to the gambling house.

223
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,420

224
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,300
is it correct?

225
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,180
Yes.

226
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:47,770
- Yes. - Yes.

227
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,250
So he owes the Zhen Tower

228
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,010
3165 liang in total.

229
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,820
Where is Young Master Zhuang?

230
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,370
In the gambling house.

231
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,730
Invite him over.

232
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,060
Understood.

233
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,420
Yang Zhen from the Marquis's Mansion is also here.

234
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,490
He's at the Jing'er Hall.

235
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,940
Is he alone?

236
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,180
He's with Qu Jiao and Chu Huaiming.

237
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,820
Are they only here for fun?

238
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,010
I heard

239
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,180
that they're holding

240
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,340
a feast for an aide

241
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,610
called Zang Hai.

242
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,010
Zang Hai?

243
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,010
Haven't heard of him.

244
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,890
He's here.

245
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,420
It's him?

246
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,420
Keep an eye on him.

247
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,250
Understood.

Come on.

250
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,100
- Let's drink to this wonderful moment. - Mr. Chu, have an orange.

251
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,130
Come on.

252
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,850
Let's have some fun.

253
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,250
- Sing aloud in daylight, we drink with cheer. - Guess which hand.

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,370
- With spring as companion, homeward we steer. - Whoever loses drinks.

256
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,100
Feed me again.

257
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,420
It doesn't count.

258
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,660
Stop teasing me, Mr. Yang.

259
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,140
I just fed you.

260
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,660
Why doesn't it count?

261
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,060
It only counts

262
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,780
if you feed me with your rosy lips.

263
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,540
I am Aide Zang Hai from the Scholar Hall.

264
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,180
I pay my respects to you.

265
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,250
There you are, Zang Hai.

266
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,180
Come here.

267
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,100
Sit.

268
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,180
Zang Hai.

269
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,220
Don't be shy.

270
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,820
You've been living in the Marquis's Mansion

271
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,770
long enough to deserve

272
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,850
a fleeting moment of joy and pleasure.

273
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,820
It will help you with the writing.

274
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,420
This is my humble opinion.

275
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,890
What do you think, Zang Hai?

276
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,570
What a refined hobby you have, My Lords.

277
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,290
I just don't know

278
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,180
why Mr. Yang

279
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,010
has summoned me

280
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,770
here tonight.

281
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,770
Don't be so uptight.

282
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,700
It's Mr. Yang's birthday.

283
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,010
We invited you here

284
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,860
to celebrate.

285
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,620
So it is Mr. Yang's birthday.

286
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,330
But...

287
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,660
But I didn't bring any gifts.

288
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,250
Your presence is all we need.

289
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,010
We see each other all the time

290
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,900
in the Marquis's Mansion.

291
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,530
Spare the formality.

292
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,730
You're new here

293
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,620
and haven't seen

294
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,940
the hustle and bustle of the capital.

295
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,460
Today,

296
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,660
let's just hang out

297
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,940
and relax.

298
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,380

299
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,250
Don't turn down

300

Mr. Yang's goodwill.

301
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,490
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

302
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,090
Come on in.

303
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,980
Among all the aides,

304
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,620
only one person managed

305
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,490
to pull some tricks

306
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,460
under my nose.

307
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,140
And only one person

308
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,460
managed to

309
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,490
catch my attention.

310
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,660
Mr. Yang.

311
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,730
What do you mean?

312
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,090
I don't understand.

313
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,490
It is alright to not understand.

314
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,940
I searched

315
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,420
the entire city and found this beauty.

316
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,770
She is a born singer.

317
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,730
Her voice lingers around the beams, weaving endlessly.

318
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,490
Miss, what is your name?

319
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,530

320
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,290
My name is Zhi.

321

322
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,330
Why don't you

323
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,330
sing to this young man

324
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,530
with your great voice?

325
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,770
He just came to the capital.

326
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,220
You have to make him

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,570

00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,770
I will

386
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,900
get her for you.

387
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,380
It seems

388
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,700
that he's very demanding.

389
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,980
She may not be good enough for him.

390
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,860
Young Master.

391
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,660
Please take me home.

392
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,220
I am from a poor family.

393
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,380
We are in a huge debt.

394
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,290
Let me serve you...

395
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,530
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

396
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,180
I am flattered.

397
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,090
But I just don't know

398
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,420
what I have done

399
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,810
to deserve

400
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,290
your appreciation.

401
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,140
I've served the Marquis for years.

402
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,860
I know His Lordship

403
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,010
better than anyone else.

404
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,940
Our Lord has a heavy workload.

405
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,980
I've always wanted to find someone

406
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,380
to assist our Lord with me.

407
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,180
Unfortunately, no one met my requirements.

408
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,180
I ended up

409
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,180
waiting for over a decade.

410
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,530
But now, you are here.

411
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,460
You are smart,

412
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,330
adaptive,

413
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,490
insightful,

414
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,380
and highly capable.

415
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,290
I am so glad to have met you.

416
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,420
I want to promote you

417
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,810
to be my deputy.

418
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,050
From now on,

419
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,770
we can work together and share the burden

420
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,490
for the Marquis.

421
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,460
Thank you for your appreciation.

422
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:46,860
Alright.

423
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,380
Such a beauty is hard to find.

424
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,770
Take her home

425
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,090
as a gift.

426
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,090
Then we will be sworn brothers

427
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,330
without taking an oath like the common folks do.

428
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,380
Thank you for your kindness.

429
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,700
But I really dare not

430
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,980
accept this generous gift.

431
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,220
Mr. Yang is giving you a promotion.

432
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,250
But you don't appreciate it.

433
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,900
Tell you what.

434
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,700
Smart people are everywhere.

435
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,810
But the smartest ones

436
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,940
know when to be obedient.

437
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,010
My Lords.

438
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,220
Please kindly enlighten me.

439
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,460
What will happen

440
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,050
if I don't accept this gift?

441
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,330
Nothing will happen.

442
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,490
Zang Hai, you are overly concerned.

443
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,530
You don't find her worthy.

444
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,570
It is alright.

445
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,380
I am not a narrow-minded person.

446
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,290
It's just that you're a newcomer.

447
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,180
If I promote you to be my deputy right away,

448
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,090
people might be jealous.

449
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,490
I have an idea for you.

450
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,140
Write a letter

451
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,940
to the Marquis now.

452
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,090
Tell him that you are going to

453
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,220
spend three years writing his biography

454
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,010
and can't serve him during this period.

455
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,290
Once you return with the book

456
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,490
in three years,

457
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,050
I will personally

458
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,660
recommend you to the Marquis

459
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,620
and make sure

460
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,250
your potential is fully released.

461
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,940
By then,

462
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,330
even if others are jealous,

463
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,090
there is nothing they can do.

464
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,570
Zang Hai,

465
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,700
go ahead.

466
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,090
What if I say no?

467
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,730
I appreciate your kindness,

468
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,860
My Lords.

469
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,290
It's just that I'm not skilled in writing.

470
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,700
I can't bear to keep writing

471
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,940
for three years nonstop.

472
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,290
The pleasure you seek here

473
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,980
is too much for me.

474
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,570
Don't let me

475
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,570
ruin your good mood.

476
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,530
I take my leave.

477
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,620
Stop there!

478
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,730
Young man.

479
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,180
You'd better know your place.

480
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,380
I'm a regular here, after all.

481
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,180
Just do me a favor, please.

482
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,530
Mr. Qu.

483
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,940
Don't be mad.

484
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,700
Zhi, you didn't

485
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,140
serve Zang Hai well.

486
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,140
He's leaving.

487
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,700
My Lord.

488
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,050
My Lord, please spare me.

489
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,700
Please spare me.

490
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,380
Tell me.

491
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,140
How should I punish you?

492
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,490
Young Master, please.

493
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,290
Please.

494
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,050
Take me home.

495
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,810
What are you doing?

496
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,140
What are you doing?

497
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,250
What are you doing?

498
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,050
What are you doing?

499
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,250
Stop it!

500
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,620
Watch closely.

501
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,090
Come on.

502
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,010
Open your mouth.

503
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,420
Stop it.

504
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,090
My Lords.

505
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,330
I am just a country folk.

506
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,860
I really don't know

507
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,010
how to deal with something like this.

508
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,660
I apologize for

509
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,050
ruining your mood.

510
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,290
I have to leave.

511
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,180
Since you have

512
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,770
given this lady to me,

513
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,330
I shall take her with me.

514
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,810
Greetings, gentlemen.

515
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,380
What's going on?

516
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,860
This is not the place

517
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,900
for you to wield swords.

518
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,420
Isn't it Miss Xiang?

519
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,330
What brings you here?

520
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,460
I have a message for you.

521
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,180
Young Master Zhuang wants to see you.

522
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,420
Young Master is here?

523
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,570
He came to settle the accounts.

524
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,940
Go take a look.

525
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,290
He's having a hard time

526
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,570
paying up his debt today.

527
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,330
What do you mean?

528
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,730
He wants us to square the books?

529
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,730
I have no idea.

530
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,290
Why don't you talk in person?

531
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,810
How about this, My Lords?

532
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,220
I will see Young Master alone.

533
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,380
I am accepting this lady.

534
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,620
I will think carefully

535
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,730
about your proposal, Mr. Yang.

536
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,420
Why didn't you

537
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,010
say that earlier?

538
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,490
What a bummer.

539
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,570
Ladies, let's go.

540
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,940
Miss Zhi.

541
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,380
Is there a clinic nearby?

542
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,180
We have a physician here.

543
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,420
But it costs a lot to save her.

544
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,140
Nobody will care

545
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,180
if a girl like her dies.

546
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,090
Still want to save her?

547
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,010
Of course.

548
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,570
Just get the physician here.

549
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,010
Her throat is totally burnt.

550
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,180
Whether she can make it

551
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,250
depends on her luck.

552
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,490
Sir.

553
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,770
Please save her at all costs.

554
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,380
I will do my best.

555
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,380
Thank you.

556
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,530
I am Zang Hai.

557
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:38,900
Thank you

558
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,250
for your help, Miss Xiang.

559
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,010
Don't mention it.

560
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,050
You helped us avoid trouble last time.

561
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,250
Now we're even.

562
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,330
How did you offend them?

563
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,700
It's nothing serious.

564
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,290
Really?

565
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,010
Whatever.

566
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,180
Miss Xiang.

567
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,420
Will you let Zhi stay here tonight?

568
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,180
I will fetch some money.

569
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,770
Forget it.

570
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,490
I will take care of her.

571
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,010
Her throat is ruined.

572
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,980
Can she still make a living here?

573
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,010
Don't worry about that.

574
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,900
We will take care of her.

575
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,730
You saved her life.

576
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,570
How can I repay you?

577
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,420
I actually need you

578
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,290
to do me a favor.

579
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,050
Young Master Zhuang.

580
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,380
Your aide is here to pick you up.

581
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,090
It's you.

582
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,050
Young Master.

583
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,810
Come on, we are home.

584
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,250
Watch your step.

585
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,980
Come on, steadily.

586
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,140
Come on, please be careful.

587
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,330
Watch your step.

588
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,420
Come on.

589
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,380
Help the Young Master.

590
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,460
Zang Hai.

591
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,700
Take care, Young Master.

592
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,900
See you around.

593
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,220
Thankfully, that lady

594
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,730
helped you out tonight.

595
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:47,900
But still,

596
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,530
an innocent lady got implicated.

597
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,730
Now you realize

598
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,570
what kind of people

599
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,810
you are dealing with.

600
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,050
Those beasts have no respect for life

601
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,050
and no bottom line.

602
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,330
But,

603
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,380
you have principles about what you will and will not do.

604
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,490
It won't be easy

605
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,660
to take them down.

606
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,220
Yang Zhen felt threatened.

607
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,770
That means

608
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,290
the Marquis had noticed me.

609
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,460
But that's not enough.

610
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,770
I must show the Marquis

611
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,770
that I'm more useful than Yang Zhen.

612
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,860
That's easy to say.

613
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,570
There are so many people

614
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,660
standing between you two.

615
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,900
How can you earn his appreciation?

616
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,050
Master.

617
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,700
I can't approach him.

618
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,180
But someone can take me to him.

619
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,860
You mean,

620
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,420
Zhuang Zhixing?

621
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,140
He may be worthless,

622
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,010
but he's easier to approach

623
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,660
than his brother Zhuang Zhifu.

624
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,490
Let me give it a try

625
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,290
and see if he can help me break the deadlock.

626
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,500
Take a look.

627
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,020
[Zhen Tower]
Come and get me.

628
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,140
Greetings, Young Master.

629
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,460
What took you so long?

630
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,730
You brought me home last night.

631
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,660
Am I right?

632
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,330
Yes.

633
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,220
So you're also a customer here.

634
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,530
But how come

635
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,700
I have never seen you before?

636
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,330
You got me wrong.

637
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,250
With my humble wage,

638
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,050
I don't dare to come here.

639
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,570
I came last night

640
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,010
because Mr. Yang invited me

641
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,250
to celebrate his birthday.

642
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,940
What a coincidence.

643
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,050
I don't like

644
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,980
owing others.

645
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,050
I invited you

646
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,010
to have a nice time

647
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,900
and relax.

648
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:01,900
Come on.

649
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,900
Join me.

650
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,260
Please don't say that.

651
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,610
I simply did what I had to do.

652
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,650
I dare not share the bath

653
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,740
with someone of your status.

654
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,170
Why are you so distant?

655
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,610
Don't turn me down.

656
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,300
Please allow me to serve you tea.

657
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,900
As you like.

658
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,490
They use

659
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,170
hundreds of rare herbs in this bath.

660
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,090
Take a bath

661
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,210
and you will feel completely refreshed.

662
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,050
It works better than ten sea cucumbers.

663
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,380
It's your loss.

664
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,900
I am truly ignorant.

665
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,420
I have no idea there is such a place

666
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,010
in the Zhen Tower.

667
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:47,940
The Zhen Tower

668
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,690
holds a cluster of halls and houses.

669
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,530
Only the lobby, gambling house,

670
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,170
and the shops are open to the public.

671
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,340
The other places

672
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,090
are not open to random people.

673
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,210
You need a regular to bring you here

674
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,460
or you must know the boss in person.

675
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,570
Otherwise,

676
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,050
you can't enter

677
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,530
even if you're loaded.

678
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,340
You surely know how to enjoy life.

679
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,900
If people like us

680
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,050
don't know how to

681
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,980
entertain ourselves,

682
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,610
what's the point of life?

683
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,260
You and your brother assist your father

684
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,610
with his work.

685
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,740
I didn't expect

686
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,690
that you'd manage to have

687
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,980
such an enriched schedule.

688
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,530
I truly admire you.

689
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,340
I'm as free as I am now

690
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,340
all thanks to my big brother.

691
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,260
He doesn't want me to work so hard.

692
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,340
And I

693
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,340
just do

694
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,740
some little work for my family.

695
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,940
The main credit

696
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,740
goes to my brother, of course.

697
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,090
But

698
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,820
my job

699
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,420
is quite important.

700
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,820
What's so funny?

701
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,490
You and your brother

702
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,490
are kind and caring towards each other.

703
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,780
I really envy you.

704
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,300
But

705
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,650
you are living such an easy life

706
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,260
not just because

707
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,380
your brother cares for you.

708
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,940
In the end,

709
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,530
it's because your father loves you.

710
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,340
You're right.

711
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,570
My father treats me very well.

712
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,740
To be honest,

713
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,740
my father loves me far more than my elder brother.

714
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,130
Back then,

715
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,900
he carried me to ride and shoot

716
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,980
and patrol the garrison.

717
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,780
He wouldn't bring anyone else.

718
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,740
But I have grown up

719
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,780
and have many things to do.

720
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,490
My father has always been busy

721
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,050
so he stopped looking after me.

722
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,300
He may not be looking after you,

723
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,650
but he must be concerned about you.

724
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,170
Young Master.

725
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,610
Why don't you go to him?

726
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,490
You clueless outsider.

727
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,300
My father cares about me.

728
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,090
We don't have to meet every day.

729
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,780
You're right.

730
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,260
If you want to

731
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,010
see the Marquis more often,

732
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,260
I actually have an idea.

733
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,300
Why do you keep mentioning my father?

734
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,380
What do you want?

735
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,940
I admire your father.

736
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,260
But I haven't ever

737
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,570
had a chance to talk to him.

738
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,650
That's why I got a bit carried away

739
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,610
and spoke recklessly.

740
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,490
Please forgive me.

741
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,130
I knew it.

742
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,820
Everyone is all about

743
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,860
seeing my father

744
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,210
and getting his recognition.

745
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,460
You're honest, at least.

746
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,420
You waste your time seeking fame and wealth.

747
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,380
I really

748
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,570
don't understand you people.

749
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,980
You are from a noble family.

750
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,690
You don't need to understand

751
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,130
the difficulties we face in life.

752
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,980
How about I give you

753
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,980
a word of advice?

754
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:08,820
I'm all ears.

755
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,300
Many aides have died in the mansion.

756
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,300
Because they were overly smart.

757
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,570
So I think it's better

758
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,090
if you're stupid.

759
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,340
Rumor has it

760
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,820
that Zhuang Zhixing is worthless

761
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,420
and disliked by the Marquis.

762
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,490
So he can't do much but remain

763
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,420
a useless rich young man.

764
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,340
It's a huge challenge

765
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,570
to work on him.

766
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,010
He is indeed different

767
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,740
from how he was as a kid.

768
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:58,980
He might have

769
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,130
been a bit spoiled back then,

770
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,260
but at least,

771
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,690
he had the backbone and spirit

772
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,940
of a family of warriors.

773
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,380
But it seems

774
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,780
those qualities are long gone.

775
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,900
He has become a good-for-nothing.

776
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,940
But I can tell

777
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,170
that he wants his father's attention.

778
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,490
It gives me a chance.

779
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,300
You'd better hurry up.

780
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,780
Time doesn't wait for anyone.

781
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,140
You're late.

782
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,060
It's your patrol shift.

783
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,740
Get going.

784
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,020
Alright.

785
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,340
Be careful.

786
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,140
Dowager Noble Consort Li's coffin was just taken away.

787
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,580
The late emperor

788
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,020
might show up out of rage.

789
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,740
Nonsense.

790
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,700
How dare you say that?

791
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:07,940
Get going.

792
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,300
A ghost!

793
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,130
There's a ghost!

794
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,380
A ghost!

795
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,490
There's a ghost!

796
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,050
The late emperor's spirit appeared?

797
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,650
It is really fishy.

798
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,050
Last night,

799
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,570
banging sounds came from the hall

800
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,820
where the late emperor's coffin rests.

801
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,130
Craftsmen entered the back hall

802
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,610
from the side door this morning.

803
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,690
The coffin

804
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,980
of the late emperor has moved

805
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,530
and blocked the entrance.

806
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,460
The coffin of Dowager Noble Consort Li

807
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,980
was just removed,

808
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,490
and weird things happened.

809
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,170
Has the Marquis

810
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,490
heard about this?

811
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,090
I haven't had time to inform him.

812
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,530
I rushed here

813
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,740
to discuss it with you first.

814
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,380
Here is our chance.

815
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,570
Are you saying

816
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,210
that it's our chance

817
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,780
to get rid of Zang Hai?

818
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,420
If he manages

819
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,490
to solve the mystery,

820
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:44,940
we can honor him

821
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,740
by making him a burial object.

822
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,130
But if he can't solve the mystery...

823
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,650
We'll just charge him

824
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,050
with incompetence.

825
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,300
Either way, he dies.
