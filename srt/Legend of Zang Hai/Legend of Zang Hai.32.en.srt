would not miss the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,860
My younger sister, Lu Yan, is loyal

194
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,810
but has a somewhat erratic personality.

195
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,220
I am indeed different from all of them.

196
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,380
I'm valued by Father

197
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,940
because I'm patient.

198
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,290
Isn't patience the specialty

199
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,570
of people like us?

200
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,250
Zang Hai.

201
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,330
I'm better than you after all.

202
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,810
At first,

203
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,090
I thought

204
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,660
you were looking for the Gui Seal for the Marquis of Pingjin,

205
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,420
but the death of the Marquis of Pingjin

206
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,940
did not disrupt

207
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,220
your process at all.

208
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,050
From that moment on,

209
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,050
I knew it wasn't for anyone else.

210
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,050
You were doing all this

211
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,250
just for yourself.

212
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,420
I'm curious.

213
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,810
Who are you really?

214
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,860
Lu Fen.

215
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,050
Lu Fen.

216
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,810
I'm here

217
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,980
just in time.

218
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,180
Father.

219
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,220
I've got it.

220
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,530
Gui Seal.

221
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,810
This is the Gui Seal.

222
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,730
I

223
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,570
hadn't seen it before,

224
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,530
but as soon as

225
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,090
I held it in my hand,

226
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,700
I knew

227
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,290
it was the Gui Seal.

228
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,290
That's it.

229
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,220
That's it!

230
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,730
Lu Fen.

231
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,900
I was right

232
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,620
not to send you back

233
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,730
from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

234
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,530
You

235
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,290
did a great job.

236
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,700
Thanks for the compliment.

237
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,290
Zang Hai.

238
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,290
You're really smart,

239
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,700
but you made a wrong move.

240
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,940
Mr. Cao.

241
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,620
You are lucky.

242
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,770
It's not that easy

243
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,090
to take my life.

244
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,050
Tell me.

245
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,660
Who

246
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,290
are you?

247
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,330
Do you remember

248
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,980
Kuai Duo?

249
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,980
Kuai Duo

250
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,140
is my father.

251
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,940
I finally understand

252
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,490
why I've been so haunted

253
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,090
by you.

254
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,290
You are Kuai Duo's son.

255
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,220
Your face

256
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,220
is very different from Kuai Duo's,

257
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,220
but your eyes

258
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,490
always show me something

259
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,420
I know very well.

260
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,980
Modest but aloof.

261
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,460
Pedantic.

262
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,900
Zhuang Luyin.

263
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,090
You're such a fool

264
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,460
that you trusted your enemy's son.

265
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,490
No wonder you ended up

266
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,530
being killed by your son.

267
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,010
Didn't Zhuang Luyin

268
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,940
die because of you?

269
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,810
He ignored the covenant

270
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,940
and betrayed me, so he deserved to die.

271
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,860
I'm afraid your fate

272
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,220
will be no better.

273
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,250
Your Majesty.

274
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,050
I didn't realize you'd kept this from me for so long.

275
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,770
So back then,

276
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,660
Kuai Duo found it

277
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,940
and gave it to you.

278
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,290
And then you hid it in the palace.

279
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,420
Since

280
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,140
you never used it,

281
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,330
let me

282
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,660
keep it.

283
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,140
Zang Hai.

284
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,530
You've got a lot of guts.

285
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,380
You dare to take even the Emperor's things.

286
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,490
You're Kuai Duo's son

287
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,460
but doing the opposite

288
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,220
of Kuai Duo.

289
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,140
Why are you doing this?

290
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,380
I get it.

291
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,530
You wanted to make

292
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,860
a fake Gui Seal

293
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,290
and put it back in order to make it look real.

294
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,490
And then, you want to use that real one

295
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,330
against your enemy,

296
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,810
don't you?

297
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,490
Am I right?

298
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,570
Father, be careful.

299
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,980
Don't worry.

300
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,770
But who would have expected

301
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,010
I'd get this great gift as soon as I arrived

302
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,700
at the Imperial Astronomical Bureau today?

303
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,810
The Gui Seal

304
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,290
has gone into my hands

305
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,460
after all.

306
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,660
And you, Zang Hai,

307
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,380
just take the blame

308
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,490
for me.

309
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,620
Mr. Cao.

310
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,290
It took the Emperor

311
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,460
ten years,

312
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,490
but he failed to open the Gui Seal,

313
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,050
so do you think you can?

314
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,490
Are you trying

315
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,380
to blackmail me

316
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,570
by opening the Gui Seal?

317
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,490
You

318
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,050
don't have to

319
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,290
worry about the Gui Seal.

320
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,810
I'll mull it over carefully.

321
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,090
Today is the Lantern Festival,

322
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,900
so let's help Zang Hai

323
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,420
reunite with his loved ones.

324
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,380
Yes, sir.

325
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,770
Let's go.

326
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,380
I'll take care of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

327
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,940
This place will always be as you want it to be.

328
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,420
Don't worry.

329
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,090
Your Highness.

330
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,700
What brings you here?

331
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,220
Mr. Cao.

332
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,570
Long time no see.

333
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,700
Good to see you.

334
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,620
Don't worry, Your Highness.

335
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,660
I won't die.

336
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,090
Zang Hai's scheme is too risky,

337
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,980
isn't it?

338
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,770
How can you

339
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,050
let such an ignorant boy

340
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,140
hold the Gui Seal alone?

341
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,090
Do you really think

342
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,140
he will give you the Gui Seal?

343
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,660
In my opinion,

344
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,730
he may make

345
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,860
a fake one for you.

346
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,290
Mr. Cao.

347
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,530
Cut the crap.

348
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,180
Give me the Gui Seal.

349
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,570
Your Highness.

350
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,330
We have a covenant.

351
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,900
We can sit down

352
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,530
and talk

353
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,660
about the Gui Seal.

354
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,700
Okay.

355
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,700
I'll talk to you now.

356
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:15,810
Father.

357
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,330
Stupid woman.

358
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,140
How dare you sneak up on me?

359
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,220
Kill them!

360
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,250
- Kill them! - Kill them!

361
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,490
Kill them!

362
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,900
Let's go!

363
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,770
Now.

364
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,700
Let's go.

365
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,900
You can't escape.

366
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,620
Leave the Gui Seal here!

367
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,900
If

368
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,140
I give you the Gui Seal,

369
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,730
will you

370
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,460
let me go?

371
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,010
You caused Kuai Duo's death,

372
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,330
so of course, I won't let you go.

373
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,290
Give me the Gui Seal,

374
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,220
and I will keep your body intact.

375
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,050
So you also know

376
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,180
about Kuai Duo.

377
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,010
Now that it's over,

378
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,330
I

379
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,810
have a favor to ask.

380
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,660
I don't want the Emperor

381
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,010
to know

382
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,460
about what happened tonight.

383
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,620
I want the Emperor

384
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:01,900
to remember

385
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,380
my loyalty

Okay.

394

Now.

395
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,170
Father.

396
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,570
Help me.

397

Let's go!

398

399

Hold on.

400
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,610
I'll take you home.

and

406
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,380
get the Gui Seal back.

407
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,820
Your father

408
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,570
didn't really

409
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,300
say anything to me

410
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,460
before he died,

411
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,380
did he?

412
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,740
It doesn't matter.

413
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,780
I'll ask him myself.

414
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,490
Mother!

415
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,900

Mother!

418

In this life,

419
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,420
I have lived

420
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,780
and died for Dongxia.

421
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,690
It's not perfect,

422
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,490
but I have no regrets.

423
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,980

I need you

431

to take your mother back to Hostage's Mansion immediately.

Antu.

433
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,490
My mother is gone,

434
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,260
and the Gui Seal has been taken from me.

435
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,380

you're sad right now,

437
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,490
but I need you to listen to me carefully.

We don't have much time.

440
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,690
You must take your mother back

441
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,490
to Hostage's Mansion right now

442
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,610
and fake her death

443
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,380
as an accident.

444
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,050
What happens to us then?

445
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,860
Don't worry.

446
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,740
I'll take care of everything.

447
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,740
Whatever happens afterward,

448
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,420
we'll face it together.

449
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,420
Remember.

450
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,780
No one came here tonight.

451
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,740
I will avenge my mother's death.

last night

459
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,980
at Hostage's Mansion.

460
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,460
Tell me.

461
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,610
What happened last night?

462
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,130
Last night's fireworks were so good

463
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,570
that they even blinded

464
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,650
my Imperial Guards.

465
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,130
Since they were blinded yesterday,

466
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,420
I

467
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,210
will let them

468
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,380
be blinded forever.

469
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,420
So, now who can tell me

470
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,610
where

471
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,260
the fireworks came from?

472
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,740
Who set it off?

473
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:03,860
What?

474
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,820
Are you all mute?

The Queen of Dongxia's death

476
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,780
is very strange.

Your Majesty.

478
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,820
The Queen of Dongxia's death in our palace

479
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,740
was so sudden

480
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,980
that I don't think

481
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,050
it should be investigated.

482
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,570
Appeasing the people in Dongxia is the priority.

483
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,460
We need to explain it

484
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,740
to the people of Dongxia.

485
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,010
Now draw up an edict

486
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,940
and pass on my will.

and is in my deepest sorrow.

490
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,340
She will have an imperial funeral,

491
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,780
and her casket

492
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,420
will be returned to Dongxia."
