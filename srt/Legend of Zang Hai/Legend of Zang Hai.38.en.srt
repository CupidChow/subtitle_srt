[Episode 38]

3
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,410
Thinking about Zang Hai?

4
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,210
Forgive me, sir.

5
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,460
For this day,

6
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,500
[To Imperial Guard Bureau...]

7
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,980
you should've been ready long ago.

8
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,490
Sir...

9
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,100
is this really how it ends?

10
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,540
I gave him a choice.

11
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,850
This is what he chose.

12
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,940
You're right, sir.

13
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,500
I failed to see it clearly.

14
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,820
Can you give him some dignity?

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,500
Don't worry.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,500
I'll keep his body intact.

17
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,100
Do you want to see him again?

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,980
At this point...

19
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,540
there's nothing left to say.

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,980
He likely doesn't want to see me either.

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,980
Sir...

22
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,260
I'd like to cook one last meal for Hai.

23
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,660
Let him eat before he goes.

24
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,610
Of course.

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,980
Time to eat.

[The Great Prison]

27
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,930
It's time.

28
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,170
Any last words?

29
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,250
Proceed.

30
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,170
Mr. Zang,

31
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,100
this method's called "Face Plastering."

32
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,810
We soak mulberry paper in water,

33
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,250
then paste it layer by layer on your face.

34
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,610
That way your corpse stays intact.

35
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,220
It must be done silently.

36
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,930
Sir,

37
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,540
one more layer

38
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,730
and he won't survive it.

39
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,930
Add two more!

40
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,660
Yes, sir.

41
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,660
Sir.

42
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,140
He shows no pulse. Death confirmed.

43

46

They're demanding to see you.

47
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,580

Zhinu,

81
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,730
you've grown so tall.

82
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,100
I almost didn't recognize you.

83
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,980
You're really Zhinu?

84
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,730
I thought you'd never find your way home.

85
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,300
No!

86
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,700
You're not supposed to be here.

Who let you come back?

88
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,220
Go back!

89
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,690
Don't ever come here!

Mother,

91

I'm not leaving.

I'm not going anywhere, Mother!

- Listen to me! - No!

94
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,100

Go back.

Move!

102
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,850
Why does everyone want me gone?

103
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,980
I don't want to go back!

104
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,010
I don't want to go back!

105
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,250
I don't want to go back...

106
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,770
I don't want to go back...

107
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,770

Father!

109
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,130
Don't go any farther.

110
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,220
You don't belong here.

111

Father...

112
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,010
I want to go home.

No matter how hard or painful,

114
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,060
you have to keep going.

115

Your life is just beginning.

116
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,580
You'll come here one day,

117
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,180
but not today.

118
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,250

156
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,420
I already needled the philtrum.

157
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,860

Zang Hai,

169
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,660
you owe your life to Master Gao Ming.

170
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,420
Miss Xiang

171
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,530
had Miss Tong'er ask me

172
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,220
to help figure out a plan to save you.

173
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,090
But Mr. Zhao is so cautious and suspicious.

174
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,380
He had to see you die for real

175
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,770
before anything could change.

176
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,940
Did you put something

177
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,490
in the food

178
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,420
that made me dizzy

179
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,570
and weak all over?

180
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,290
I added a secret herb.

181
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,220
It helped you pass out in advance,

182
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,810
with no pulse.

183
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,290
Pig liver with pork tripe,

184
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,530
pan-fried chicken,

185
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,490
fish in vinegar sauce,

186
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,980
and grilled oysters.

187
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,010
The second I saw those dishes, I knew you had a plan.

188
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,350
I knew it.

189
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,700
You'd catch on when you saw those dishes.

190
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,860
If you were conscious during the execution,

191
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,980
you'd keep resisting

192
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,530
until your final breath.

193
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,660
Only by doing this

194
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,730
could we fool the executioners.

195
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,700
Thank you.

196
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,330
You should thank someone else too.

197
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,260
If he hadn't distracted Mr. Zhao

198
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,180
at the critical moment,

199
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,570
you might not have made it.

200
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,220
Mr. Zang.

201
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,700
Mr. Shen.

202
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,810
The Prince couldn't come in person.

203
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,530
He asked me to pass on a message.

204
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,380
Go ahead.

205
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,220
Before the Emperor passed away,

206
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,090
he kept calling your name.

207
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,700
He also said you were right.

208
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,140
How's the Prince now?

209
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,980
No need to worry, Mr. Zang.

210
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,250
He's the Emperor's brother, after all.

211
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,290
Zhao Bingwen wouldn't dare act rashly.

212
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,090
It's not safe to linger here.

213
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,770
I must take my leave.

214
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,860
Take care, Mr. Zang.

215
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,420
You too.

216
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,180
Sit.

217
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,050
Zang Hai,

218
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,940
what's your next move?

219
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,490
I'm going to Dongxia.

220
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,900
Dongxia?

221
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,770
Zhao Bingwen told me

222
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,010
he's taking the Gui Seal there

223
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,140
to raise an army of his own.

224
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,220
I have to stop him.

225
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,050
Then I'm going with you.

226
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,570
I can't let him get his way.

227
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,940
Besides, you've never been to Dongxia.

228
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,420
I know the place better.

229
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,010
But right now, aside from me and Hai,

230
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,730
the rest are all wanted.

231
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,940
It won't be easy to get out of the Capital.

232
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,010
Guanfeng, Shilei, Fengliu, and Yingqi

233
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,860
will all stay behind.

234
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,050
I'll find my own way to meet up with you.

235
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,530
Master,

236
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,140
we're taking Antu with us.

237
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,220
No time to waste.

238
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,490
We'll leave as soon as we're ready.

239
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,530
Hai, once you're out of the city,

240
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,980
the carriage will take you to a safe spot.

241
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,330
There's a merchant convoy heading to Dongxia.

242
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,180
You can leave Great Yong with them.

243
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,660
Once you get to Dongxia,

244
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,090
Miss Xiang will take the lead.

245
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,900
Master,

246
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,180
you're not coming with us?

247
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,010
I can't.

248
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,700
I have to stay by Mr. Zhao's side

249
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,860
and keep an eye on him for you.

250
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,330
Hai's brush with death

251
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,180
really shook me!

252
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,290
Master,

253
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,380
turns out, when you're near death,

254
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,730
you really can dream of your family.

255
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,490
They looked just like I remembered.

256
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,330
And what did they say?

257
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,220
They said they missed me...

258
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,980
but told me to hurry back here.

259
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,290
Hai,

260
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,770
remember the day you left Xing Dou's Manor?

261
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,660
The day you left without a word?

262
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,350
Actually,

263
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,810
Xing Dou and I had a fight.

264
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,050
He always believed

265
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,700
Zhinu shouldn't become Zang Hai.

266
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,250
He thought only by letting go of hatred

267
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,420
could you start a new life.

268
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,010
But I believed

269
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,980
only by settling that hatred

270
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,090
could you truly move on

271
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,730
and find a future of your own.

272
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,900
Don't worry.

273
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,620
I'm not the same Zhinu I was ten years ago.

274
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,180
Ten years together,

275
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,180
I'll walk with you one last stretch today.

276
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,700
Remember,

277
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,180
do what must be done,

278
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,940
but more importantly, live well.

279
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,220
We've still got a long road ahead.

280
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,490
Be careful out there.

281
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,420
We're almost at the city gate.

282
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,490
Lie down, quickly.

283
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,050
Come on, lie down.

284
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,180
Take care.

285
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,980
Don't blow your cover later.

286
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,570
If anyone finds out,

287
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,900
we're in real trouble.

288
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,420
Here.

289
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,780
[Wanted Notice]

290
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,060
[Ding'an Gate]

291
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,170
[Plague]
Stop! Inspection!

292
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,940
Whoa, stop!

293
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,420
Sirs.

294
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,220
By order of the court:

295
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,810
Wanted men are on the run in the Capital.

296
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,940
No wagons or carts

297
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,570
can pass without inspection!

298
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,730
This cart's carrying corpses.

299
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,660
They died coughing blood.

300
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,700
We need to burn them outside the city right away.

301
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,980
Even plague wagons

302
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,980
must be checked.

303
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,660
Sir,

304
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,420
I just work at a clinic to earn a living.

305
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,330
If this thing spreads,

306
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,940
I won't survive the blame.

307
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,940
Cut the nonsense!

308
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,530
Check it thoroughly!

309
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,250
Hey, sir!

310
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,220
Sir...

311
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,940
Out of the way!

312
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,530
Sir...

313
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,050
These... these are all bodies.

314
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,570
Check it carefully!

315
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,620
Oh no, he's infected too!

316
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,420
Back up! Let them pass!

317
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,290
Clear!

318
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,250
Go...

319
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,330
Hurry!

320
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,940
Move!

321
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,140
Go!

322
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,050
Hurry!

323
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,810
Go!

324
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,250
Antu...

325
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,570
Take care.

326
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,740
[Ding'an Gate]

327
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,140
Stop the cart...

328
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,490
Hai,

329
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,090
we made it out!

330
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,250
Master...

331
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,490
are you okay?

332
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,860
Hai...

333
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,420
Not bad for an old-timer, right?

334
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,010
Lucky I had a backup plan.

335
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,250
Or we never would've fooled them.

336
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,140
No big deal.

337
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,620
Hai...

338
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,940
Keep this.

339
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,330
Didn't you always ask why I saved so much?

340
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,180
I was saving it for you.

341
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,050
All farewells come to an end.

342
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,770
Once you pass this gate,

343
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,810
the road ahead...

344
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,490
you'll be walking it without me.

345
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,220
Take care.

346
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,490
Wait for me to come back.

347
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,490
Enough!

348
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,380
Go already!

349
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,050
Stop the cart...

350
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,530
- Stop! - Zang Hai, what's wrong?

351
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,950
Stop the cart!

352
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,140
Zang Hai!

353
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,180
[Ding'an Gate]

354
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,940
Hai...

355
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,010
I drank Mr. Zhao's tea. I won't survive it.

356
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,220
I've lied to you for ten years,

357
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,290
and I still owe you an apology.

358
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,330
I envy Liuchu.

359
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,420
She doesn't know Zhao is your enemy.

360
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,250
She never had to carry that weight.

361
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,180
I envy Xing Dou too.

362
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,290
He passed away before I did.

363
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,770
Because he understood better

364
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,430
that this day would come.

365
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,490
But I got to spend more time with you.

366
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,940
He might envy me for that.

367
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,700
I didn't raise you for nothing!

368
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,980
In this world, it's never right for a master

369
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,620
to outlive his disciple!

370
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,180
But if the intention is sincere,

371
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,250
sometimes a lie isn't such a bad thing.

372
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,050
You liar...

373
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,010
Big liar...

374
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,490

Sir,

376
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,250
Gao Ming was found dead by the city gate.

377
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,940
What are you thinking about?

378
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,810
I'm thinking about

379
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,090
the years before we entered the Capital.

380
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,730
The days I spent with my masters.

381
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,530
From now on,

382
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,530
I'll walk this road without them.

383
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,220
I often dream of my mother too,

384
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,050
of the past,

385
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,180
of those carefree days.

386
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,140
Turns out in this life,

387
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,810
joy is fleeting,

388
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,380
but sorrow lasts forever.

389
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,980
I have to return to the Dongxia royal court

390
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,570
to find my sister.

391
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,330
Only the queens of past generations

392
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,530
are allowed to know Dongxia's ultimate secret.

393
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,420
But it's been years since you returned,

394
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,860
and your sister only just became queen.

395
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,780
If you go back now,

396
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,490
she might not take it well.

397
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,420
Someone else must've witnessed the battle

398
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,210
when the Gui Seal surfaced.

399
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,010
We can settle near the palace first.

400
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,690
Maybe gather some intel.

401
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,620
♪Lamplight fills the tower, driving away the mist♪

402
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,700
♪I have kissed the frost and embraced the cold♪

403
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,180
♪Wrapped myself♪

404
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,060
♪In memories like a thin coat♪

405
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,140
♪Kindling warmth in a world so narrow♪

406
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,380
♪Though the light boat has not passed the mountains♪

407
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:24,220
♪Perhaps it's better to rest because the sky is already dark♪

408
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,300
♪I must hurry before the long road♪

409
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,460
♪To catch that fleeting moonlight from years past♪

410
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,340
♪Each step yesterday rang firm and clear♪

411
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,140
♪Stirring up so many dreams I hold dear to♪

412
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,300
♪Let me hide in a quiet harbor of peace...♪

413
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,170
That's Mount Yuren.

414
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,300
We're not far from Dongxia's capital now.

415
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,900
Is Mount Dansui there too?

416
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,090
Mount Yuren is part of Dansui's range.

417
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,130
That taller one behind it

418
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,380
is the sacred Mount Dansui.

419
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,530
Legend says

420
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,860
if the people of Dongxia pray sincerely,

421
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,010
Mount Dansui's spirit will protect them.

422
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,650
Guess what I wished for.

423
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,740
What?

424
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,420
That we'll never be lost again,

425
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,860
and never be separated again.

426
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,580
Greetings, Princess!

427
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,340
Antu,

428
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,990
it's been ten years.

429
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,570
How have you been?

430
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,490
So he's the Zang Hai Mother mentioned?

431
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,690
You're a Princess of Dongxia.

432
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,090
How can you be with someone from Great Yong?

433
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,010
No one move!

434
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,980
Didn't you

435
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,180
already strip me of my title?

436
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,790
I'm the new Queen of Dongxia,

437
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,160
and your elder sister.

438
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,860
Whenever I say you're not a princess,

439
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,260
then you're not.

440
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,170
Whenever I say you are,

441
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,090
then you are.

442
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,530
How did you know I was here?

443
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,940
I got a letter from Great Yong.

444
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,740
They said you were wanted by the court.

445
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,650
They figured you must've run back to Dongxia.

446
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,490
I never imagined,

447
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,900
my sister, once a noble hostage,

448
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,610
nearly ended up in chains.

449
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,210
Why have you returned?

450
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,420
What are you really after?

451
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,170
If you won't say,

452
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,170
don't blame me.

453
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:34,740
Take them away!

454
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,620
[Ding'an Gate]

455
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,610
Your Highness,

456
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,420
please eat something.

457
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,050
You haven't eaten at all.

458
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,780
You'll hurt yourself like this.

459
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,340
I know you're upset.

460
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,780
But if the late queen can see you now,

461
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,940
she may be heartbroken.

462
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,490
Get up.

463
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,860
You're a subject of Dongxia.

464
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,300
I don't want to make things hard for you.

465
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

466
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,490
Have you ever served my mother?

467
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,960
The late queen often told us

468
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,650
stories of your childhood.

469
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,380
Truth is,

470
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,260
she always held you close to her heart.

471
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,780
What happened to the man from Great Yong?

472
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,900
Do you know anything?

473
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,780
I heard

474
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,530
they put him in...

475
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,780
Here comes the Queen!

476
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,260
Antu, is the palace comfortable?

477
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,090
Where are you holding Zang Hai?

478
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,260
In the Sky Prison.

479
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,690
You've captured both of us

480
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,050
and kept us locked away.

481
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,490
You clearly want something from me.

482
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,050
Antu,

483
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,650
you're still as clever as ever.

484
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,090
Leave us.

485
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

486
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,130
What is this about?

487
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,780
The Eighteen Tribes of Haidong

488
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,260
have long clashed with Dongxia.

489
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,940
Ten days before your return,

490
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,170
they finally submitted to us.

491
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,940
Still,

492
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,940
I'm not fully at ease.

493
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,300
A royal of Dongxia

494
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,340
must go assist the Haidong King.

495
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,300
Their khan, Moersa,

496
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,940
just lost one of his consorts.

497
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,610
I want you to marry him.

498
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,940
He's over sixty!

499
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,900
And you want me to marry him?

500
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,130
Moersa is indeed old,

501
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,690
but his son is quite young.

502
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,690
Do you really think your little schemes

503
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,490
can fool the Great Yong Emperor?

504
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,420
He'll find out soon enough

505
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,940
that you've taken over Haidong.

506
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,380
Dongxia will face war at any moment.

507
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,940
The Great Yong Emperor?

508
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,420
He's dead.

509
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,300
They can't even manage their own mess,

510
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,210
let alone deal with Haidong.

511
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,900
You're marrying him,

512
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,860
whether you like it or not.

513
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,490
I won't. Unless you plan to marry off my corpse.

514
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,690
How dare you!

515
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,300
I was a hostage for ten years.

516
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,780
I owe Dongxia nothing.

517
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,740
And I've never betrayed her.

518
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,090
Even if I die and face our mother,

519
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,300
I don't think she'll blame me.

520
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,940
Is it because of Zang Hai?

521
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,740
You really love him that much?

522
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:07,820
Guards!

523
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,170
Cut off a finger from that Great Yong man.

524
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,130
I want it now!

525
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:11,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

526
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,300
Wait!

527
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,740
Each day you refuse,

528
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,170
I'll take one more of his fingers.

529
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,490
By the time you agree to marry,

530
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,650
he'll already be a cripple.

531
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,820
And what cripple

532
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,420
will dare dream

533
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,050
of marrying a Dongxia Princess?

534
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:32,740
What are you waiting for? Go!

535
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:33,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

536
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,740
I'll do it.

537
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,090
You're still too softhearted.

538
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,940
You don't deserve to be Queen of Dongxia.
