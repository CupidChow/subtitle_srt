Yes, it's me.

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,260
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,230
On our way in here,

16
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,500
I couldn't move my body
freely anymore.

17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,040
It's okay. You hung in there well.

18
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,709
I can still feel it.

19
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,219
That thing keeps on stirring
inside my head.

20
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,290
Let's hurry.

21
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,590
I want to be myself...

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,859
when I take my last breath.

23
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,240
I want to be by your side.

24
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,080
Let's put an end...

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,580
to this tenacious fight.

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,280
Let's end it.

27
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,020
Hey, are you okay?

28
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,530
Let's go.

29
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:12,259
Why?

30
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,069
- Why are you doing this?
- What?

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,639
Is it fun making this world a mess?

32
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,310
Is that why you're doing this?

33
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,409
No.

34
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,340
To be honest,
I prefer reading books.

35
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,009
Then why are you doing this?

36
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,849
Because I want Yeon to die.

37
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,419
It's not like
Yeon will die that easily.

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,550
Exactly.

39
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,419
He keeps on attacking me
without getting tired.

40
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,189
He keeps on trying to defy his fate.

41
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,560
It's too late to go back.

42
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,240
Both of us already crossed the line.

43
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,610
Mr. Lee.

44
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,150
You're not hurt, are you?

45
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,219
Not really.

46
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,819
Great.
It's time for you to get hurt now.

47
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,189
How dare you fool me?

48
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,159
- This was the only way.
- Be quiet.

49
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,160
This was predictable
when we gathered to strategize.

50
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,629
Don't act like you knew.

51
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:20,569
He wouldn't have talked about it
if he really had the Uiryeong sword.

52
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:22,670
He would've just
ignorantly wielded it.

53
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,699
What did you say?

54
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,470
Mr. Lee focuses more on conversing
than on grammar.

55
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,139
That's what I mean.

56
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,009
Did you get the answer you wanted?

57
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,579
Kind of.

58
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:35,050
What was the answer?

59
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,620
- The key.
- The key to what?

60
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,350
The key he needs in order to go
into a different body.

61
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,550
Does that mean you can
kick him out of Ms. Nam's body?

62
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,790
That won't be enough.

63
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,759
What?

64
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,230
I'm going to bury him forever...

65
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,829
so he can never return.

66
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,339
Stop right there.

67
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,240
Can't you hear me?

68
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,009
The moment you step out that door,
you'll lose everything.

69
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,449
I'll make that happen!

70
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:23,560
What do I have to lose?

71
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,829
You own the Styx, and your position
gets you close to the spirits.

72
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,899
I even gave you eternal life!

73
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:33,069
That's not what I wanted.

74
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:34,910
I wanted my wife and my son.

75
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,879
Honey. Living with you forever...

76
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,019
is the biggest punishment for me.

77
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,160
Stop right there.

78
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,019
I said, stop!

- Yes?

81
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,860

83
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,259
What did Mr. Choi say?

84
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,230
He said a police officer died.

85
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,129
- Why?
- From a heart attack.

86
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,639
When he performed CPR
on the officer,

87
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,899
he saw strange spots on him.

88
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:41,139
Also, he threw up some egg?

89
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,740
"An egg"?

90
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,079
Are they with Mr. Choi right now?

91
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,610
Where are you?

92
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,050

- Exactly.

Get away from him right now.

Yes.

97
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,069
Did Mr. Choi
go to the police station?

98
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,839
Yes. He performed CPR
on the person that died.

99
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,509

100

Not yet.

Things are going just as he warned.

114
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:21,209
What did he warn?

115
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,910
He said he'd spread a plague...

and kill those whom I cherish.

117
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,410
Wait. Then my parents...

118
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,080
I'll check on them.
Do as Mr. Lee said, and go home.

Look who's talking.

127
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,909
You're the female Imoogi.

128
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,679
- Let's just go about our business.
- Do as you please.

129

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
You dropped...

134
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,740
Mr. Hyuneuiong?

135
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,909
Thankfully,

136
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:38,809

No.

Those from Styx have started
to make a move?

140
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,929
I'm relieved.

An immense calamity
is bound to take place soon.

142
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,360
- Granny.
- Be careful what you say now on.

143
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,600
Because I am just as irritated
as you right now.

144
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,600
How dare you meddle
with the register?

145
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,769
Did you really turn against me
and choose the path...

146
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,539
that even you won't be able
to forgive yourself later on?

147
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:43,610
Did you really?

148
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,139
I don't care what you say.
I won't withdraw the register.

149
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,110
That is...

150
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,580
the decision I've made.

151
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,820
Why have you targeted Ji A...

152
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,419
instead of the Imoogi
who has spread the plague?

153
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,590
Could you successfully pierce him
with your sword?

154
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,399
You don't die from a sword.

155
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,440
What's inside that girl
is the problem.

156
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,009
We need to catch that first...

157
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:18,210
if we want to kill the other one.
And to do that,

158
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,580
she needs to die.

159
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,379
Let me say this for the last time.

160
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,419
Put everything back...

161
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:30,490
to where they belong.

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,960
This is where they belong.

Only then will everything be over.

164
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,500
No.

165
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,139
No one...

166
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:48,570
can take her.

167
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,279
Not even you.

168
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,879
There's nothing you can do anymore.

169
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,440
Come at me.

170
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,820
So, you're saying
that accidents like that one...

171
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:41,590
will continue to occur until I die?

172
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm glad I said goodbye
to my parents.

173
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,370
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:52,970
Don't be.

175
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,470
You saved my life.

176
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,279
I tried my best to stop it.

177
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,779
But this is the most I can do.

178
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,789
Where's Yeon?

179
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,490
He went to confront Granny.

180
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,059
- Will he be okay?
- I'm not sure.

181
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,230
Never once in her lifetime
has she ever changed a decision...

182
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,570
she thought was right.

183
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,970
Yeon knows that as well.

184
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,440
Then he did that...

185
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,669
because of me.

186
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,909
Yeon has put his everything
on the line.

187
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,419
I'll sacrifice my life.

188
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,460
Give me three days.

189
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,570
If I fail to catch him
in three days,

190
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:00,600
you can kill me.

191
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,110
I'm afraid I can't do that.

192
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,139
The Imoogi is already
out of control.

193
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,779
- I have his scale.
- It's too late.

194
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,019
I can catch him.
I can kill the Imoogi!

195
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,490
How many more lives do you think
he'll take in the next three days?

196
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,129
Their lives are just as important as
the one you're striving to save.

197
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,350
Please spare her.

198
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,860
Please don't kill her.

199
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,360
I'll do anything.

200
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,360
- I'll do anything you want.
- I'd rather have you charge at me.

201
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,970
Quit this pitiful act.
Be yourself and confront me!

202
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,669
Please.

203
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,610
Yeon.

204
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,350
I wouldn't have gone down this road
if I knew I could take it all back.

205
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,590
How could you do this to me?

206
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,919
I lost my son and my husband.

207
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,429
What makes you think
I won't be able to lose you?

208
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,940
You will regret this,

209
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,370
Granny.

210
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,149
Where do you think
it all went wrong?

211
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,690
Had it not been for me,

212
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,960
Yeon would've still been
a mountain spirit.

213
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,160
No.

214
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,769
Had I not been born to begin with...

215
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,299
Ji A, this isn't your fault.

216
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,940
Why are you hating yourself...

217
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,869
and regretting having met Yeon?

218
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,240
It feels like
I'm the cause of everything.

219
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,980
We, the immortals,
are just like humans.

220
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,579
We're all hanging on
thanks to the memories we've made.

221
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,150
For me, it was my late son.

222
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,890
For the Snail Bride,
it was her loving husband.

223
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,190
And Yeon could live on
because of you.

224
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,759
The Imoogi told me...

225
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,299
that I would kill Yeon...

226
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,269
with my own two hands.

227
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,400
That is why...

228
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,970
you're putting up a fight
to protect each other.

229
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,740
Both you and Yeon.

230
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,609
No matter what I do,
it's a dead end.

231
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,230
Darn it!
Why isn't this lighter working?

232
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,839
You said you'd quit smoking.

233
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:59,380
I tried practically everything
to quit smoking.

234
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,509
I chewed on eundan, gum,
and even wore a nicotine patch.

235
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,119
They even have special medicine
these days.

236
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,519
But no matter how hard I tried,
it was impossible.

237
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:13,319
What's your point?

238
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,630
No matter how much you struggle,

239
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,000
if you can't change the ending,
what will you do?

240
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,099
What if only one of you can live?

241
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,500
The ending...

242
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,069
won't change?

243
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,940
Shall I treat you?

244
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,740
- Are you kidding me?
- Or do you want a car?

245
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,440
Forget it.

246
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,750
And can you do something about
that runny nose?

247
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,279
I'm very squeamish, you know.

248
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,789
How long have you worn that shirt?
Did you even wash it?

249
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,099
Go to the department store
and get some clothes.

250
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,240
I'm very sensitive
when it comes to hygiene.

251
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,039
I need to use the bathroom.

252
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,549
What are these stickers?

253
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,319
You're dead when I get out!

254
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:53,990
The weather is lovely.

255
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:55,660
Look how sunny it is.

256
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:57,829
Here's your coffee.

257
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,369
This tree grew so much.

258
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,940
I know. It grew beautifully.

259
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:11,680
What are you thinking of?

260
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,740
Where do you think we were...

261
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,980
while so much time passed?

262
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,049
I know. We were apparently missing
for a long time.

263
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,990
It feels so strange.

264
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:24,190
All I remember is being asleep.

265
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,220
But we don't have any bedsores
on our bodies...

266
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:30,160
and Ji A seems anxious,
which keeps bothering me.

267
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,799
It reminds me of
the legend of Ieodo.

268
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,769
"Ieodo"?

269
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,140
You know, a fisherman arrived
at a majestic island by accident...

270
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,109
and when he came back out,
100 years had passed.

271
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:48,849
I feel so grateful Ji A grew up
so well...

272
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,049
just like that tree.

273
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,910
Is this all we have to eat?

274
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,039
It's good.

275
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,710
I want naengmyeon.

276
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,210
Yu Ri.

277
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,710
When is she coming?

278
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:24,609
I'm thinking about...

279
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,180
the right timing.

280
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,779
Why do you only think
and do nothing?

281
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,890
Because when I'm done
with the thinking,

282
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,559
Lee Yeon will have
to lose something.

283
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:36,559
It's been 600 years.

284
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,529
I'm about to end
this never-ending fight.

285
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,000
And if you fail?

286
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,730
Rang.

287
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:46,640
That's why I need you.

288
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,369
If something happens to me,

289
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,279
you must finish this job instead.

290
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,920
I want you to be my last weapon.

291
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:03,819
I refuse.

292
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,019
I don't care if the Imoogi...

293
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,990
destroys the world
or kills your woman.

294
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,130
We have different things
we want to protect.

295
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,970
- Rang.
- You protect her.

296
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,140
I will save Yu Ri...

297
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,240
and save you.

298
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,220
Why are you smiling?

299
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,019
I realized that being nice
doesn't fit me.

300
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:38,289
See you.

301
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,200
Make sure you guard this house,
Blackie.

302
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:47,460
Why am I Blackie?

303
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,039
Si Yeong.

304
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,910
Oh, hello.

305
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,079
What brings you here at this hour?

306
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:02,210
I just came for some samgyetang.

307
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:08,150
Are you feeling ill, by any chance?

308
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,019
What are you talking about?

309
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:13,920
I'm a guy that does
200 squats every day.

310
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,160
Do you want to see my thighs?

311
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,259
My gosh.

312
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:17,960
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

313
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,460
Take his order.

314
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:23,700
Seven police officers were taken
to the hospital this morning.

315
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:25,500
What about Mr. Choi?

316
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,339
He looked perfectly fine.

317
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:30,970
He should still go to the hospital.
He's so stubborn.

318
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,150
If Mr. Choi is okay,
we're probably okay too, right?

319
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:38,720
Let's just worry about our editing
for now. Come on.

320
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,089
You must be busy
preparing for business.

321
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,490
I had no appetite all morning,
but now I'm feeling better.

322
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,130
What's wrong?

323
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,970
Your face is so pale.

324
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,369
Do I have a fever?

325
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,240
No. It feels so cold.

326
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,150
Give me your hand.
Your hand feels cold too.

327
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,450
How could your temperature drop
so much?

328
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,130
It's a serpent egg.

329
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,869
He's sleeping again. Get up.

330
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,940
Hey, get up.

331
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,950
Sir. Sir?

332
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,019
What the...

333
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,190
He's...dead.

334
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,589
Hey, call an ambulance now.
I'll go ask for help.

335
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,400
What?

336
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,859
They're dead?

337
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,170
Everyone who worked
on the same floor as us?

338
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:39,299
Hold on.

339
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,910
This is breaking news.
People are dying all around Seoul...

340
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,049
from an unidentified disease.

341
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,509
It has only been two days since
the first victim died...

342
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,049
at a hospital in Geumran-gu.

343
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,049
The government is assuming it
as an unknown disease...

344
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:58,289
that is highly contagious
with a high fatality rate.

345
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,089
All the victims had red spots
all over their bodies,

346
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,359
and according to an autopsy of
the first victim, his organs were...

347
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,599
mutilated very severely
as if attacked by an animal.

348
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,269
The victim, Kim,
who was a male in his 30s...

349
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:15,069
had no particular illness...

350
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,319
- How do I look?
- You look horrible.

351
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,019
It's not my type.

352
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,190
That means I look okay.

353
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,000
Where are you going?

354
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,099
For a cup of tea.

355
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,670
I'll allow you
a special visit today too.

356
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,299
- "A visit"?
- Your boyfriend.

357
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,509
Go meet him.

358
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:04,349
Yu Ri. Are you okay?

359
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,690
Let's meet now.

360
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,430
Now?

361
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,000
Where?

362
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,000
I'll go see you.

363
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:37,619
Come out.

364
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,259
I know you're hiding inside me.

365
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,329
I said, come out.

366
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,000
If you don't come out
on the count of three,

367
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,500
I'll die.

368
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,809
1. 2.

369
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,180
Three.

370
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,519
You're crazy.

371
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:17,730
How dare a shell like you
tell me what to do?

372
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,329
"A shell"?

373
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,970
You don't even pay rent
while living in my body.

374
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:25,670
Why are you acting like
you own this house?

375
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,640
Because the owner will change soon.

376
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,240
It'll only take a day or two...

377
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:35,250
before I completely
take over your body.

378
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,910
That's a lot longer than I thought.

379
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,950
Why so?

380
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,019
The fox marble disappeared
a long time ago.

381
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,319
It's an aftereffect.

382
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,759
I slept for too long
because of that marble.

383
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,490
Let's say our goodbyes first.

384
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,859
Once the owner changes,

385
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,299
the one to fall asleep forever
in your body...

386
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,369
will be you.

387
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,339
That means you're incomplete,

388
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:02,940
at least until that happens.

389
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,910
Gosh.
It's not like you can do anything.

390
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,880
What if I die before then?

391
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,750
You can't do that.

392
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,079
You know,

393
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,490
people can do anything if there's
something they want to protect.

394
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:24,430
I could become someone crazy.

395
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,670
Help!

396
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:31,569
- What's wrong?
- Miss!

397
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,740
- Get up. What's wrong with you?
- Hey. What's wrong?

398
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,799
Gosh.

399
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,009
Anyone, help. Please help.

400
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:40,880
Can't anyone help me?

401
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,420
Will you look at that?

402
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
That's enough.

403
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:50,990
Stop acting up and go back in.

404
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,920
That's all I wanted to check.

405
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,400
Listen, woman.
I'll get rid of Yeon through you...

406
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:05,069
since he can never give up on you.

407
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,700
If you have time to concern yourself
with someone else's love life,

408
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,769
you should focus on your other half.

409
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,779
He can't get over
the pain of loss...

410
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,380
and is planning to take both of us
down to the underworld.

411
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,180
That's impossible.

412
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,920
My register changed.

413
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,390
Do you think he wouldn't have
guessed that Taleuipa...

414
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,230
would do this if he killed
so many innocent people?

415
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,230
Are you in there?

416
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,200
Yes. I'm coming out.

417
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:49,650
Yu Ri!

418
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,349
Are you hurt anywhere? Let me see.

419
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:55,420
I'm not hurt.

420
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,190
I'm glad.

421
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,329
I was worried sick.

422
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,299
How did you come here?
Did you run away?

423
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,799
Why didn't you tell me
it was because of Imoogi?

424
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:12,900
- What about Mr. Lee?
- He woke up safely.

425
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,640
He didn't say anything,
but I think he's worried about you.

426
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,009
I'm glad.

427
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,980
Let's go. Mr. Lee will be happy...

428
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,480
- when I tell him you're back.
- I can't go back.

429
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,920
What?

430
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:30,119
I said, I can't go back.

431
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,220
Neither of us.

432
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,359
What do you mean?

433
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,359
I'm stalling by keeping you here.

434
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,759
What are you saying?

435
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,869
No.

436
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,910
Let me go.

437
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,380
I told you. Neither of us can go.

438
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,450
I'll allow you
a special visit today too.

439
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:04,990
Your boyfriend. Go meet him.

440
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,430
Why should I do
what you tell me to do?

441
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:13,799
Because if I see Sin Ju today,

442
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,130
he'll die.

443
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,319
- Hey, Dad.
- Ji A.

444
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,079
- Where are you?
- I'm out.

445
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,519
- Why?
- A friend of yours came here.

446
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:41,559
A friend of mine? Who?

447
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,490
I told you not to open the door
for anyone.

448
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,660
Well... He's a familiar face.

449
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,269
But who would you know?

450
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,539
- Is it Yeon?
- No.

451
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,339
The young man
with fair skin from before.

452
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,079
The carnation.

453
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,450
What?

454
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,449
I told you I won't be so kind
to you anymore.

455
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:15,019
I won't let you get away with it
if you touch a hair on them.

456
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,460
Don't try to defy fate.

457
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,829
I can crush everything you cherish.

458
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,340
Who are you?
You're not Ji A's friend, are you?

459
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:29,039
No, Mom! Don't do that.

460
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,739
I want to hang myself.

461
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,840
No!

462
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,849
I want to hang myself.

463
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:40,980
No!

464
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,289
You can't go out.

465
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,389
No, I have to leave.

466
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:52,659
My parents are in danger. Please.

467
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:54,829
What do I do?

468
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,610
Fall asleep.

469
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,559
How did you know I'd be here?

470
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,460
I just came from the Styx.

471
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,469
Did you use that old woman's
clairvoyance power?

472
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,000
Granny fixed Ji A's register...

473
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:08,639
thanks to you spreading a plague.

474
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:09,739
But she's still alive.

475
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:11,940
I just spoke to her on the phone.

476
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,710
Because Hyuneuiong is protecting her
instead of me.

477
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:17,510
Although
that won't last long either.

478
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,750
I thought you came from the Styx.

479
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,880
Why didn't you beg the old woman?

480
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,820
I already begged enough.

481
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:27,190
It didn't work, did it?

482
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,059
If Ji A dies, your other half
won't be safe either.

483
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,730
So?

484
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:40,500
What is it that you really want?

485
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,099
Make a guess.

486
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:46,880
For you, your existence itself
is a deficiency.

487
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,250
That was the case when you were
a child of a human, and now too.

488
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,920
It's almost as if you were made
to be ruined.

489
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:56,920
You're a cursed being.
That's an Imoogi.

490
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,559
Are you trying to pick a fight?

491
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,989
No, it's the opposite.

492
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,000
- What?
- What if there's...

493
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,269
something better than me or Ji A
to fulfill your deficiency?

494
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,840
What if you get a position
a lowly mountain spirit...

495
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,809
wouldn't even dare to dream of?

496
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:21,079
Say it so I can understand.

497
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,710
The ruler of all rulers.

498
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:26,349
You can't be serious.

499
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,690
I'm talking about
the owner of the Styx.

500
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,429
Let's kill her together.

501
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:21,500
How original. I didn't expect that.

502
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:24,369
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think you'd betray her.

503
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,039
I'm willing to do anything
to save Ji A.

504
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,710
So...

505
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,780
you will join hands with me?

506
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,590
Yes, I'm even willing to stoop
as low as joining hands with you.

507
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:39,989
What's your condition?

508
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,989
Let Ji A go.

509
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,059
Take back your other half
inside of her...

510
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,929
and never look for us ever again.

511
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,099
That's my only condition.

512
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,699
If you were me, would you believe
that this wouldn't be a trap?

513
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:55,869
No, I wouldn't.

514
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,110
What?

515
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:07,949
Then guess.

516
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:10,789
What do you think I'll say?

517
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:15,159
"No." That's what you'd like to say.

518
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:17,630
But you will end up
accepting my offer.

519
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:22,360
Where do you get that confidence?

520
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,610
They're both dead ends.

521
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,539
If you refuse my offer,
you will lose your other half,

522
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,480
and I will lose Ji A.

523
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,150
Then we'll fight to our deaths
and end up in the underworld.

524
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,960
That was exactly what I had in mind
after my last date with her.

525
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,329
Call me if you change your mind.

526
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,599
You have time until sunrise tomorrow.

527
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,719
You kept me here,
knowing that the Imoogi...

528
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:15,750
was going to kill them? Why?

529
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,159
Did he threaten you? Or...

530
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,489
did he control your mind again
like when you had stabbed Mr. Lee?

531
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,960
- It's neither of them.
- Then why?

532
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:27,059
Why did you do this?

533
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:31,170
Those petty humans
don't mean anything.

534
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,070
"Petty humans"?

535
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,110
I thought you were here to see me.

536
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,179
I was worried sick about you!

537
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:50,949
But...

538
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:53,920
I was just bait.

539
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,059
You took advantage
of my love for you.

540
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,400
- Sin Ju...
- Enough.

541
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,630
Don't say another word.

542
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:08,900
Or for the first time,
I might regret liking you.

543
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:36,130
You must've been very worried.
They're safe.

544
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,030
I erased their memories too.

545
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,769
They won't remember encountering
the Imoogi.

546
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:44,809
Thank you, Yeon.

547
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,250
It's all because of me.
I had left them alone.

548
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,750
It's not your fault.

549
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,920
I know you've been
keeping them safe.

550
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,760
Thank you for protecting Ji A
while I was gone.

551
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,699
What's your plan?

552
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,199
I'm going to join hands
with the Imoogi.

553
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,670
- What?
- What do you mean?

554
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,500
Is it because of her?

555
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,239
Yes.

556
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,840
In the end, she decided
to turn her back...

557
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,309
against you.

558
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:25,710
She provided me one last chance
to fight against him.

559
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,579
Can you explain?

560
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,090
She gave me two more days.

561
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,050
You'll be safe during that time.

562
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,690
Then I'll be...

563
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,059
Of course. Why would you die?

564
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:40,260
I won't allow that.

565
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,829
Then you're joining hands
with him because...

566
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:44,599
Of course, I have a plan.

567
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,199
I knew it.

568
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:50,269
- What's her condition?
- There is none.

569
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,739
Except for the fact that I must kill
the Imoogi this time around.

570
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:54,840
- Yeon.
- Later.

571
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,750
I'll tell you the details later.

572
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:58,449
I want to go eat something
with Ji A.

573
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:01,949
Let me get changed.

574
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,579
No matter how much you struggle,

575
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:36,090
if you can't change the ending,
what will you do?

576
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,820
What if only one of you can live?

577
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,619
The ending...

578
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,130
won't change?

579
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,420
Then there's nothing more
to worry about.

580
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:12,050
What will you do then?

581
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,559
I'll eat this.

582
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,099
I'm going to transfer the Imoogi
inside Ji A into my body.

583
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,230
Then I'm going to grab
the other half and jump...

584
00:44:25,969 --> 00:44:27,039
into the Styx.

585
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,510
That way, he won't be able
to reincarnate anymore.

586
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:34,309
- Jumping into the Styx means...
- I know.

587
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,449
I won't be able
to reincarnate either.

588
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:40,750
I also know...

589
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,750
that I won't be able
to see Ji A ever again.

590
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,530
I'm sorry for this inconvenience.

591
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,130
I could've just gone to a hospital.

592
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:32,000
That'll be of no use.

593
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:35,039
This isn't like any other illnesses
you are aware of.

594
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:39,710
It's freezing cold.

595
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,679
Hang in there.

596
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,050
Soon, this never-ending battle...

597
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:47,820
will end.

598
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:51,150
So hang on tenaciously until then.

599
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:57,630
I knew it. You're someone special,

600
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,760
aren't you, Hye Ja?

601
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,539
Oh, come on.

602
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,610
I was wondering
why the restaurant was closed.

603
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,210
I'm sorry.

604
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,780
Goodness.

605
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:25,050
Come.

606
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,800
Do you even know who he is?

607
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,030
What are you talking about
out of the blue?

608
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,469
He's your husband!

609
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,070
- What?
- He's the husband...

610
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,639
that you've never been able
to forget about.

611
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,780
Is anyone there? Hey!

612
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,710
I'm dying in here!

613
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:57,389
Darn it!

614
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:08,360
Are you okay? Oh, dear.
You have spots all over your body.

615
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,869
Detective, let me go to a hospital.

616
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:12,500
There's no use.

617
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,800
The time it takes to die varies,

618
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,469
but the fatality rate
is 100 percent.

619
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,010
How did this happen?

620
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,250
But since when did a detective
of this country...

621
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:32,690
wear such clean and shiny shoes?

622
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:35,719
Man, that darned dress code.

623
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:44,269
Who sent you?

624
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,369
Lee Yeon? Or...

625
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:49,440
Why does that matter now?
You're about to die.

626
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:53,079
I doubt you came to watch me die.

627
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,409
I love doing that.

628
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:56,909
See? I even brought popcorn.

629
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,480
I even visit funeral homes
on purpose.

630
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,889
What do you want? Tell me.

631
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,989
How dare you try to negotiate
when you're about to die?

632
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,389
Do you still think
you can do anything...

633
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,690
if Imoogi backs you up?

634
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,130
If Imoogi dies,

635
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,000
this horrific disease
will go away, right?

636
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:18,500
Probably.

637
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:19,699
Let me out of here.

638
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,500
- Why should I?
- I've served Imoogi much longer...

639
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,670
than you think.

640
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:26,380
Therefore, there's no one
who knows him better than me.

641
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:30,750
So? You'll gain freedom
by just blabbering like that?

642
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,579
And even fix your disease for free?

643
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,449
Come on, I don't want that.

644
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,489
I'm not that fond of fighting,

645
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:40,260
and I hate leaving scars on my body.

646
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:44,889
I know what you mean.

647
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,300
That's why you came.

648
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,360
To not get blood on your own hands.

649
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:58,869
(Cell Number 2)

650
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,590
He escaped.

651
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,760
Who?

652
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:19,659
The suspect of the serial murders.

653
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
Who let him go?

654
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,329
The thing is, on the CCTV...

655
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:27,170
What? Why aren't you telling me?

656
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,340
It was you.

657
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:30,309
What?

658
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:34,409
(Gopbun Gopchang)

659
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,239
Can I take your order?

660
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,210
We'll have an assorted gopchang
and a bottle of soju.

661
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,349
- With extra cheese.
- Okay.

662
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:53,400
(Gopbun Gopchang)

663
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,929
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

664
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,769
Gosh, look at all this cheese.

665
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,179
- What?
- You're so pretty.

666
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,460
Promise me something.

667
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:32,699
What?

668
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,469
Let's come here again
when it snows for the first time.

669
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,239
Okay.

670
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,039
Spend Christmas with me.

671
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,480
We can go to the ocean
we went to before.

672
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:51,250
- Okay.
- And on New Year's Day,

673
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,159
you can come over to our place
and eat tteokguk with my parents.

674
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,460
And on my birthday...

675
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:03,469
What do you want?

676
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,539
Okay, I'll get it for you.

677
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,079
What do you have to do if you want
to keep all of these promises?

678
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,590
I have to live for a long time.

679
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,360
Cheers.

680
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,980
What is this?
It's like I forced you to get these.

681
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:54,280
You should've told me
it was your birthday.

682
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,920
Who celebrates their
lunar birthdays these days?

683
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,090
My mom would be
the only one to remember it.

684
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:04,429
This smells nice.

685
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:11,400
I live alone...

686
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:13,940
and raise two tropical fish.

687
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:15,599
Do they have names?

688
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,610
Deok Bae and Chun Sam.

689
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,539
Their surnames are both Kim
from Gyeongju.

690
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,780
I wanted to get them...

691
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,010
a bigger water tank
when I get paid this month.

692
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,480
Do you want to adopt them?

693
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:35,789
Here, make a wish first.

694
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:45,530
I wish Jae Hwan will buy me cake
on my next birthday too.

695
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:02,150
It's our last drink.

696
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,030
This might be the last soju...

697
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,559
we'll drink together.

698
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:16,530
I want to savor it.

699
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:21,369
Don't say that.

700
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:25,309
The thing inside me told me earlier.

701
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,139
That I have two days at most.

702
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,409
That I'll just become
an empty shell...

703
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,219
without a soul.

704
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:35,780
That will never happen.

705
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,849
Won't everything be okay
as long as I'm gone?

706
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:42,460
If I die, Imoogi will go away too...

707
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:45,360
and my beloved family, friends,

708
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,829
and you...

709
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,530
will never be hurt.

710
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:56,769
Don't say that ever again.

711
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:58,809
But you know what?

712
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,880
If that happens,

713
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,650
how will you live alone?

714
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:07,780
I will...

715
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:11,690
probably live the rest of my life
blaming myself.

716
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,960
For not being able
to protect you again.

717
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,860
I feel the same.

718
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:24,329
I don't think I can live properly
without you now.

719
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,170
That's why we need
to protect each other.

720
00:54:30,269 --> 00:54:32,969
We must never let Imoogi
get what he wants.

721
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:42,650
Yes, Jae Hwan.

722
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,989
What?

723
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,929
I told you not to come.

724
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:57,929
Why are you here?

725
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:05,070
Why are you sitting here like this?
Why?

726
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:06,809
Why?

727
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:09,280
Don't touch me.
You might get it too.

728
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:32,070
I hope I never see
that unpleasant face of yours.

729
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:42,179
I never imagined us
parting like this.

730
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,150
I know. I should've killed you.

731
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:51,190
Since you can't turn back now,
try your best to survive.

732
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:53,420
It seemed like you finally made up
with your brother.

733
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:54,960
Will you be able to handle
the consequences?

734
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,230
No. Lee Yeon will never forgive me.

735
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,960
I might never see him again.

736
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,070
Still, it's better than him dying.

737
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:06,969
Tread carefully.

738
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,710
Pitiful guys like you
usually meet tragic endings.

739
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,940
I don't have any
ground cherries left,

740
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:16,579
and I can only live
as long as a human being.

741
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:18,110
So stop getting on my nerves.

742
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:20,150
I'm going to spend all my money
before I die.

743
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,449
Goodbye.

744
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:39,130
You protect her.

745
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:42,969
I will save Yu Ri and save you.

746
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:47,739
How could I not notice
all this time?

747
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,840
I kept on noticing him,

748
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,780
so I tried so hard to ignore him.

749
00:56:52,949 --> 00:56:55,019
His spirit from his previous life
must've come all the way here...

750
00:56:55,019 --> 00:56:56,420
because it noticed
how much you missed him.

751
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,590
What's the point?

752
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:01,760
I finally found him but he's sick.
This is so unfair.

753
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:03,090
I mean it.

754
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,900
Could all of this be coincidental?

755
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:11,699
Pardon?

756
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:13,699
With Yeon and Ji A at the center,

757
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:16,940
all the tangled relationships...

758
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:18,610
are gathering in one spot.

759
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:23,380
In our previous lives,
we were lovers, family, friends,

760
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:26,409
and even enemies.

761
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:32,090
I'm feeling anxious.

762
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:34,519
I have a feeling...

763
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,460
that something we can't handle
might happen.

764
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,780
Stay here for a while. Stay with me.

765
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:02,719
Hey.

766
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:04,889
Send him away.

767
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:06,920
Don't stay here.
You'll fall in danger too.

768
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,519
I would've caught it already
if it was contagious.

769
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,289
Or maybe it's dormant for now.

770
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:12,130
Beat him up.

771
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,030
I won't leave even if I get beat.
I'll protect you.

772
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,500
You need someone to look after you.

773
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,599
Let me go and talk to the others.

774
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:20,170
Watch her for now.

775
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,780
What about Mr. Choi?

776
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,820
He threw up an egg,
but he hasn't improved.

777
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,590
What is that egg about?

778
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,260
There's a small baby snake inside,

779
00:58:47,929 --> 00:58:49,559
and that snake will eat up
the inside of the person.

780
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,670
I can't watch her die.

781
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,969
I can't.

782
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,940
Everything will be over soon.

783
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:06,449
He just has to bite the bait
I prepared.

784
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:07,949
Once that happens...

785
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:14,860
Just hang in there a little longer.

786
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,090
Please wait just a little more.

787
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,070
Let's kill her together.

788
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:29,500
Call me if you change your mind.

789
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,510
You have time until sunrise tomorrow.

790
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,519
Let's have one more bite.

791
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:35,769
It's over for me.

792
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,039
Sae Rom.

793
01:00:40,809 --> 01:00:42,309
- Ms. Kim.
- Sae Rom!

794
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:43,309
Ms. Kim...

795
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,860
Fine. Let's kill...

796
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,829
the owner of the Styx together.

797
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,360
Yeon and Imoogi?

798
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:12,829
You're kidding, right?

799
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,469
No.

800
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,139
What?

801
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,369
That's suicidal.

802
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,880
He's intending to die with Imoogi.

803
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,320
Yeon. You'll be caught...

804
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,179
in your own trap.

805
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:34,719
With this,
we'll go on the same stage.

806
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:40,329
Once we step foot on it,
no one can step down...

807
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:43,000
until both of us die.

808
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,579
What are you doing here?

809
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:04,119
I can only live if you die.

810
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,349
I'll end everything with my hands.

811
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:09,619
Don't do this. If you do this...

812
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:11,260
Goodbye.

813
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:28,409
What? They didn't say it would rain.

814
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:59,769
When did you get here?

815
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:03,610
As soon as it showered
against the forecast.

816
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,849
Are you here to walk me home?

817
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,920
I don't want you to get wet.

818
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,750
Did you finish work?

819
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:17,289
Yes. It was a simple edit,
so I finished it fast.

820
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,289
Who on earth is getting in the way
of you reuniting with your family?

821
01:04:20,329 --> 01:04:22,360
- My boss.
- And me.

822
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:25,199
- What?
- I didn't bring the car today.

823
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,239
You're right.
Did you leave it at home?

824
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:29,570
It only takes 20 minutes
to your place.

825
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,070
We don't have the time to date
because of your parents anyway.

826
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:39,480
Buy me a cup of instant noodles.
If you do, I'll free you.

827
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,119
All right.

828
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:55,929
One cup of noodles isn't enough.

829
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:57,199
No, it's definitely not enough.

830
01:04:57,469 --> 01:04:59,000
I told you we should buy two.

831
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:02,369
Tell me the two conditions
for instant noodles to taste good.

832
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:04,369
One must be kimchi.
What is the other one?

833
01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:06,010
Someone who steals a bite.

834
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,739
I'll make it taste extra good.

835
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:20,889
You're eating so well.

836
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:24,159
I want some soup,
but I should stop myself.

837
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:25,860
Why?

838
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,559
It's going to make me crave soju.

839
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:30,130
You're indeed a woman with class.

840
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:34,769
Did you know that these noodles
are 40m-long when untangled?

841
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,570
That's as high as
a 13-story building.

842
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:38,539
Why are you suddenly acting like
an encyclopedia?

843
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:41,780
I don't want to be even half a cup
of noodles away from you.

844
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,880
What's with this sweet talk
over a cup of noodles?

845
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:47,750
How are you always so cute?

846
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:50,949
I was always cute ever since
I was at Baekdudaegan.

847
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,260
You look happy. It's been a while.

848
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,130
Yes.

849
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,469
Mom and Dad
are waiting for me at home,

850
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,469
and I have you in front of me.

851
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,869
All of my dreams came true,

852
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:17,349
but who will make
your dreams come true?

853
01:06:20,849 --> 01:06:24,420
I wonder how it feels to be human.

854
01:06:32,929 --> 01:06:36,059
It doesn't matter if you're a human
or a nine-tailed fox.

855
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:38,869
What matters is that
we're together right now.

856
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,300
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

857
01:07:17,269 --> 01:07:20,170
If I don't stop her, she's going
to try to protect me...

858
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,510
instead of herself again.

859
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:22,679
Don't do it.

860
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,210
You must understand me.

861
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:26,679
I'm going to wait for you...

862
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,380
like you had waited for me.

863
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,719
This is the Underworld.

864
01:07:30,019 --> 01:07:31,889
This very place where I'm standing.

865
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,619
Do you even know what that means?

866
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:36,090
If I fail, you must kill him.

867
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:38,329
If something happens to Yeon...

868
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:41,460
- How dare you?
- This was my plan all along.

869
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,199
No. I won't do it.

870
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:45,369
No!
