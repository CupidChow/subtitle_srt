(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

10
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,129
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

11
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,599
So this is how we meet again.
How long has it been?

12
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,239
I didn't hit him once,
but the traitor was fast to confess.

13
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:41,769
I put him up to it. I wanted
to see you here at this hour.

14
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,709
You don't die from a sword.

15
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,849
I borrowed the body
of a female human back then.

16
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,090
Not anymore.

17
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,240
You have a lot of cheap tricks.

18
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,509
I always wanted
to fight against you.

19
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:14,569
It's just what I wanted.

20
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,590
Not bad.

21
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,319
You don't know anything about me,
Lee Yeon.

22
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,889
I lived much longer than you think.

23
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,030
I existed before you were born.

24
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,800
Don't be so tied down to the past.

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,569
I'll also live longer than you.

26
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,599
Don't be so obsessed
about the future that'll never come.

27
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,439
You were born in a cave of plague,

28
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,069
and in order to become a spirit
while escaping from the darkness,

29
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,810
you patiently waited underneath
the black waters for 1,000 years.

30
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,509
I would have been
in your position...

31
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,710
if I wasn't seen by humans
when I was ascending as a dragon.

32
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,750
It's too bad. It's just like...

33
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,860
getting kicked out during your
national college entrance exam...

34
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,120
because you were caught
with your phone.

35
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,659
But, that's your character
and your fate.

36
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,229
Don't you have a name?
Is it just Imoogi?

37
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:12,830
You haven't changed.
You're still arrogant.

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,770
I bet you think
everyone is below you.

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,270
At least you are.

40
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,139
I have the urge to trample on you.

41
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,310
Your brother, that woman,

42
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,680
and her parents' lives...

43
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,580
are all in my hands.

44
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,909
But what do you have?

45
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,780
This is a reasonable offer.

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,050
Yeon, if you give me your body,
I'll spare everyone else.

47
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,930
What do I look like to you?

48
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
A west capital traitor.

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,610
You took my parents, didn't you?

50
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,199
I made this carnation.

51
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,699
Look at the back.

52
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,180
Ji A, why aren't you coming
to rescue us?

53
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,050
Are they alive?

54
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,949
- Where are they?
- Offer me the mountain spirit...

55
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,420
and I'll give you your parents.

56
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,720
- Tell me. Where are they?
- You saw them.

57
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,689
You just didn't recognize them.

58
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,259
What do you mean?

59
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,430
You'll find out soon enough.

60
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,629
You won't get away with this.

61
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,800
Do you want to call the police?
Or perhaps your boyfriend?

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,199
I'm okay with either, but you won't
ever get to see your parents again.

63
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,699
Why? Why my parents?

64
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,410
Because I knew
such a day would come.

65
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,480
You're someone who'd do anything
in order to save her parents.

66
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,009
Just like how you saved your father
in your previous life,

67
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:10,149
I hope you make a wise decision
once again.

68
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,290
You'll release them
if I give you my body?

69
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,230
Ji A and her parents too?
Lee Rang too?

70
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,699
I want the whole package,

71
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,899
but if you don't want that,
just the heart would be enough.

72
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,410
Do you mean it?

73
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,310
I mean it.

74
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,009
So is that a yes or a no?

75
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,379
I...

76
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,149
My answer is...

77
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,230
No.

78
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,029
- Why not?
- You look like a swindler.

79
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,839
I don't make deals
with people like you.

80
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,509
I'll find them one by one myself.

81
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:09,670
You can go ahead and see...

82
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,779
what it feels like to trample on
what's precious to you again.

83
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,579
This might be a bad question,

84
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,449
but why did you come back?

85
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,920
You're the icon of misfortune,
plagues, and war. No one likes you.

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Are you asking me about
how I view the world?

87
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,120
I don't have any.

88
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,120
There's only one thing that I want.

89
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,990
It's her.

90
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,000
The one who was sacrificed to me
as a baby...

91
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,629
but ended up saving you
and killing me.

92
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,269
I like her.

93
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,470
How dare you?

94
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,550
That's enough. I just wanted to see
how strong you were.

95
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:53,920
I've just begun.

96
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,300
I want to die right now.

97
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,709
You can feel him, can't you?

98
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,949
I knew it. You're connected to him.

99
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,790
- What?
- You're his shell.

100
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,120
Why are you doing this?

101
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,660
You're human too.

102
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,259
Exactly. I fear death,
but I'm greedy as well.

103
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,129
I guess being a traitor
wasn't enough.

104
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,910
I was born into a lowly family...

105
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,139
and only dreamed of living
in a new world.

106
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,939
My children, my wife, and my mother.

107
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,279
All I wanted
was to feed them decent food,

108
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,079
yet they called me a traitor
and wanted to behead me.

109
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,350
And that's when I met him.

110
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,580
I'm sure it wasn't for free.

111
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,190
What did you have to offer
in return?

112
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,259
My children, my wife, and my mother.

113
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,830
I only survived after giving them up
as offerings.

114
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,529
You lunatic.

115
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,370
To gain something,
one must lose something first.

116
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,070
So you want me to betray Yeon?

117
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,980
You want me to become like you?

118
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,909
It's your choice.

119
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:02,480
Your parents have lost
half of their lives thanks to you.

120
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,879
Will you give them a funeral or...

121
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:15,230
One drop, and he'll fall
into a deep sleep.

122
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:18,860
Put him to sleep,

123
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,899
and I'll give you the life
you've always dreamed about.

(Episode 11: Ground Cherry)

125
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:40,120
I told you
we needed a massage chair.

126
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Why waste money
if we're only going to end up...

127
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
hanging laundry on it?

128
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,159
My joints are sore due to old age.

129
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,289
Massage properly, will you?

130
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,200
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:56,730
Bok Gil was a terrific masseur.

132
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,570
Since you work day and night,
he'd brew some tea...

133
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,409
with hardy rubber tree barks
and manyprickle acanthopanax...

134
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:06,139
since they were good
for your joints.

135
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,779
Don't ever mention
that wretched boy's name again.

136
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,960
Don't call my son wretched.

137
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,360
Get out.

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,610
Why do you act like
you're the only one...

139
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,970
who has lost a son?

140
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,940
I said, leave!

141
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,279
It's all because of you.

142
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,779
Had you only spared his wife,

143
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,549
our son wouldn't have ended
his own life.

144
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,360
A plagued spirit had possessed him.

145
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,190
Was I to just sit and watch...

146
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,129
that wench infect
the entire country?

147
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,860
Right. That's who you are.

148
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,929
You're neither Bok Gil's mom
nor my wife.

149
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:05,370
You're just a loyal servant
of the Styx.

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,539
I must've been insane to put up
with you all these years...

151
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,309
just so I could understand you.

152
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,750
I don't want to see you. Get out.

the contract,

159
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,289
try to undo what's been tangled.

160

00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,940
("Unprecedented Mass Suicide
Shocks Everyone")

163
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,710
Does this make sense?

164
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,580
Is this some horror movie or what?

165
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,679
How could 132 individuals...

166
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,080
kill themselves simultaneously
in a single area?

167
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,350
Maybe it was a suicide club.

168
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,620
There were no suicide notes.

169
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,179
People who commit suicide
have a strong desire...

170
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,590
to explain in detail the reason
and the people responsible for it.

171
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,789
What if it was a cult?

172
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:34,090
In the 70s in Jonestown,

173
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,289
a mass suicide was carried out
by some cult followers.

174
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,289
They were all poisoned,

175
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,429
but these people died
in various ways.

176
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,169
This is so odd.

177
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,570
I'm back.

178
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,139
Hey, Terry.

179
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:48,269
Hold on. You were in Geumran-gu.
Hey, you.

180
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,480
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

181
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,179
- Pardon?
- Did you not see the news?

182
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:56,149
Countless people died there
an hour ago.

183
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,779
- Seriously?
- And Ji A? Is she not with you?

184
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,019
Something came up,
so she left first.

185
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,820
- Is she not here?
- Really?

186
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,460
When did she come?

187
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:07,690
- Today's footages are in here.
- Thank you.

188
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,590
How was it today?

189
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,799
Did Ji A torment you?

190
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,169
Not at all. She was much nicer
than I had expected.

191
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,019
(Nam Ji A)

192
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,700
Offer me the mountain spirit,

193
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,269
and I'll give you your parents.

194
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,309
(Lee Yeon)

195
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,190
(Ji A, why aren't you coming
to rescue us?)

196
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,159
Come here.

197
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,929
Gosh.

198
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,100
This is such a nice house.

199
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,899
The living room is quite spacious,
but there aren't many rooms.

200
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,809
I didn't know vets
made so much money.

201
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,049
Come this way.

202
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,620
Sit down.

203
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,840
- Isn't this...
- Traditional Russian dish, borscht.

204
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,110
I'm sure you didn't have this
growing up,

205
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,110
but I thought you'd be homesick.

206
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,620
Do you not like it?

207
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,789
At times, I really miss
the forest I used to grow up in.

208
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,889
Now, an apartment complex
replaced it.

209
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,840
I know this smell, and I like it.

210
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,750
It's also good.

211
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,350
Eat up.

212
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,259
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,570
Blackie?

214
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,970
Mister.

215
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,700
You better get over here.

216
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:45,009
Don't get on my nerves,
or I'll kill you.

217
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,879
Who is he?

218
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,480
My stepdad.

219
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,450
Come here. Come here, you punk.

220
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:54,690
Make your choice.

221
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,350
If you ask me for help,

222
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,720
you'll never see him again.

223
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,230
Or I'll just pretend
I didn't see anything.

224
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,759
Hey. Do you know him?

225
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,859
Why are you interfering
with our family's business?

226
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,130
Quiet. I'm waiting for his answer.

227
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,569
Who are you? A cop?

228
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,170
Well...

229
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,480
I...

230
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:21,309
Kim Soo Ho.
You better answer correctly.

231
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,720
I need to go home.

232
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,119
Okay.

233
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,480
I know you have no friends
or family.

234
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,950
- What?
- I can't live without chicken,

235
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,420
but if you need to eat Russian food
three times a day,

236
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,519
I'm thinking of changing
my taste for food.

237
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:05,259
What do you mean?

238
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,059
I mean, I want to be...

239
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,059
your family and friend.

240
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,299
A family?

241
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,509
I have something similar to that.

242
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,569
Your fake parents Lee Rang made
for you?

243
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,009
The CEO of the department store?

244
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,609
Yes.

245
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,009
I know I'm just pretending to be
their dead daughter,

246
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,250
but they can't live without me.

247
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,619
I heard people say...

248
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,319
family is something they want to
throw away...

249
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,119
if there isn't anyone watching.

250
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,220
Since they make each other
suffer so much.

251
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,089
But later on, they find themselves
searching desperately for it again.

252
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,329
That's what family is.

253
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,430
Like Lee Yeon and Lee Rang?

254
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:48,799
Yes.

255
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,269
So...

256
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,509
let your fake parents
live their real lives now,

257
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,880
and how about being a family
with me and...

258
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,380
What are you two doing here?

259
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,710
- Mr. Lee.
- Lee Yeon?

260
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,049
Why are you here?

261
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,420
This is my house.

262
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,089
Hey, did you see Ji A?

263
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,789
She wasn't here. Why?

264
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,720
She's not picking up at work either.
Where is she?

265
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,829
Anyhow, go on and continue
with the necklace thief.

266
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,299
Darn, this was Lee Yeon's house?

267
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:24,170
It's okay. Mr. Lee's house
is practically my house.

268
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,369
Did you just laugh?

269
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,170
Oh, let's eat.

270
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,549
Mr. Lee?

271
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,079
What?

272
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,720
What are you doing here?

273
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,990
I thought I'd be able to see you
if I waited here.

274
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:24,960
You didn't answer my calls all day.
Did something happen?

275
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,700
Yes.

276
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,670
Me too.

277
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,440
What happened?

278
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,940
Before that,

279
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,670
Ta-da!

280
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,980
Open it.

281
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,190
Something that makes you happy
just by thinking about it.

282
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,000
You remembered?

283
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,799
Of course. The smell of cooked rice,
books of world literature,

284
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,170
your dad's gimbap, new shoes,

285
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,069
and me.

286
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,140
You get me for free.

287
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:18,349
They say if you give your girlfriend
new shoes, she'll run away.

288
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,890
Even if you do,
I want you to wear new shoes...

289
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:24,720
and go to places that make you happy.

290
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,200
Why are you smiling so sadly?

291
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:36,670
You don't like these shoes?

292
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,670
Of course not.

293
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,109
I never knew the word "shoe"...

294
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:46,509
could sound so sweet.

295
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,950
I like you.

296
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,990
I can even sacrifice
my life for you.

297
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,000
Shall we walk?

298
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,230
Somewhere nice?

299
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,269
Together.

300
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:23,680
What is this?

301
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:27,220
What do you think?
It's a fresh human being.

302
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,819
Who is he?

303
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,319
You don't have to know.

304
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,390
He won't cause any trouble,

305
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,220
so make him into a ground cherry
for your emergency food supply.

306
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,390
I'll gladly accept.

307
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,740
He moved the ground cherry pot
somewhere else?

308
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,509
Do you want to see for yourself?

309
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,039
Is it okay for you
to show me such things?

310
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,349
There's nothing to hide
between us anyway.

311
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,619
It looks like a regular seed, right?

312
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,849
The body and soul is
contained in here,

313
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,859
so I call it
the "Lock of Body and Soul".

314
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,529
It's something only the Imoogi
can make.

315
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,069
He's a nasty one.

316
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:54,940
He went to prison numerous times.

317
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,509
You saved a little kid?

318
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,349
I need an excuse at least...

319
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,180
when I go to the Underworld later.

320
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,359
- Do you want more milk?
- Yes.

321
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,700
Here you go.

322
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,630
Stop eating so much.
That milk is mine.

323
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,970
Why isn't that lady going home?

324
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,700
You're the one who should go home.

325
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,740
Before I eat your liver.

326
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,509
I don't have a home now.

327
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,650
Stop acting so pitifully.

328
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,279
Seoul is packed with homeless people
besides you.

329
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,849
- You don't have a home either?
- Not me.

330
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,259
Stop fighting.

331
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,660
Did you say your name is Soo Ho?
Where is your mom?

332
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,130
My mom was beaten up every day,

333
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,900
and she ran away with a stranger.

334
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,799
That's why my stepdad
is always angry at me.

335
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,339
I guess you don't have
anywhere to go then.

336
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:01,740
Oh, my gosh.

337
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,769
Mr. Lee, why are you doing this
to me?

338
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:05,880
Eat up.

339
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:18,990
What are you thinking about?

340
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,299
Do you know the fairy tale
"The Little Mermaid"?

341
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,369
By Hans Christian Andersen?

342
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,000
Yes.

343
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,400
I always hated how that story ended
since I was a kid.

344
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:38,009
She could've lived
if she killed the prince.

345
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,539
Why did she choose to
throw herself into the sea?

346
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:44,809
What about you? If it were you,
what would you have done?

347
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,549
When I was young, I always thought
I'd kill the prince...

348
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,450
and save myself.

349
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,960
But? Did you change your mind?

350
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,160
But now that I've met a prince,

351
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:59,230
I like him much more
than I expected.

352
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,400
Even when the fairy tale
can end happily...

353
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:05,539
if the prince dies.

354
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,650
If I were the little mermaid,

355
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,079
I'd kill the witch that cursed me.

356
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,849
I don't want such a person
to make a fool out of me.

357
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,059
I've been cursed.

358
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,730
If I hand you over,
they'll return Mom and Dad.

359
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,180
Instead of what they want,

360
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,309
tell me what you want.

361
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,380
I want to find my voice...

362
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,380
and keep the prince too.

363
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,349
Of course, I don't intend on
turning into bubbles either.

364
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,359
Won't you help me catch the witch?

365
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,190
Do you have the time for this?

366
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,730
Our deal ends in 24 hours.

367
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,769
This could be the last day
of my life.

368
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:17,609
Why do you care if I use my day
efficiently or if I...

369
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,109
waste my time?

370
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,839
Are you going
to throw away your life...

371
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,349
for your brother whom you hated
so much?

372
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,549
Today, Imoogi met with Yeon.

373
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,859
Yeon was told
that we have three sets of hostages.

374
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,359
Ji A, her parents, and you.

375
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,130
But where could Yeon be right now?

376
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,170
Did he even call you out of worry?

377
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:52,140
Don't joke.

378
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,109
You must've gotten abandoned
once again.

379
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:59,119
Yes, I abandoned you.

380
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:00,480
I'm sorry.

381
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:03,150
For saving you when you were
abandoned by your human mother.

382
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:06,720
Yeon...

383
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,690
I never abandoned you.

384
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,200
said he never abandoned me.

385
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:22,109
You know better than anyone
that's not true.

386
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,740
- Hey, kid!
- Yeon?

387
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,819
He came to the Forest
of Starving Ghosts to save me.

388
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:33,680
It was an act to save Ji A.

389
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:36,250
You're nothing but a prop.

390
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,490
Be quiet!

391
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,859
He'd do anything for Ji A.

392
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,960
Even if that'll push
his brother to death.

393
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,599
If you touch her,

394
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,900
I'll kill you this time.

395
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,710
Are you really going
to give up on your life?

396
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,740
For your big brother who only
cares about a woman?

397
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:23,430
Yes, Mr. Lee.

398
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,000
What? Sin Ju?

399
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:31,670
He wants to speak to you.

400
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:34,779
Sin Ju speaking.

401
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,180
You know where Yeon is, right?
Where is he?

402
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,950
He went out to see Ms. Nam.

403
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,250
So where are they?

404
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,549
I'll ask and then call you back.

405
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,829
There are 132 lives...

406
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:55,500
who weren't even on the list.

407
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,230
That number is going to grow.

408
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:00,740
- What?
- He's misfortune itself.

409
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:02,339
This is only the beginning.

410
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,009
Let's bring him in.
Tell me how and I'll do it.

411
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,710
You can't.

412
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,779
In order to catch him,

413
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:13,349
I'll have to do something
you despise so much.

414
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:14,519
And what could that be?

415
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,019
Hey, Yeon.

416
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:31,940
What? You're...

417
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,710
Hello.

418
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,539
I'm Nam Ji A.

419
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,990
I heard a lot about you from Yeon.

420
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,289
Nice to meet you.

421
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,660
Hey!

422
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,130
How dare you bring a living person
in here?

423
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,940
She's alive,

424
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,170
but she's also the subject
of the issue you're fighting over.

425
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,349
This is no place for a child
of a human to walk into. Leave.

426
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:20,980
I know you place the utmost
importance on rules and principles.

427
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,519
I know it might be discourteous,
but I decided to come because...

428
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,759
Does it look like this place
is where you can make wishes?

429
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,759
- Come on.
- Stop.

430
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,029
If not,

431
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,759
should I tell you
the date of your death?

432
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,269
No. I don't want a spoiler.

433
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,630
I don't even go to fortune-tellers.

434
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,740
- Then what is it?
- I lost my parents at nine.

435
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,910
Are you at an audition?
I don't care about your story.

436
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,839
I hear something of Imoogi's
is in my body.

437
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,809
That must be your fate too.

438
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:51,880
I intend to fight until I die
against that fate.

439
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:58,289
That's why I came here
knowing this isn't a place...

440
00:31:58,289 --> 00:31:59,559
for living people.

441
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:03,559
- You two are the same.
- Yes, we're perfect for each other.

442
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,259
I admit you're bold enough
to not be scared of me.

443
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,869
Why are you here?

444
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,700
Please lend me
your clairvoyance power.

445
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,839
I want to know where my parents are.

446
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,279
- What?
- I'm not asking for it for free.

447
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,380
Do you have the power to repay me?

448
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,210
Even if you overcharge me,
I'm still desperate to borrow it.

449
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,519
However, I don't have much on me.

450
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,019
How do you intend on making a deal
without having much on you?

451
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,059
We'll catch Imoogi.

452
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,829
Yeon and I will do it together.

453
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,680
Gosh, I made it out alive.

454
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,109
Did you notice my legs shaking?

455
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,250
Not at all.

456
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,549
I thought previous life
and afterlife...

457
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,450
were something in comic books,

458
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,920
but they're all real.

459
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:08,829
People say those who
committed crimes live better,

460
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:10,730
but that doesn't apply
in the afterlife.

461
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,099
Is this where you send
the deceased to the Styx?

462
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,170
I give them presentations
on how to get to the afterlife,

463
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,700
and I go catch the ones
who try to stay behind.

464
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,009
I have to please my wife too.

465
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,910
I'm glad.

466
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,680
You're the very first one
the deceased will meet,

467
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,549
and you're such a warm person.

468
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,319
Gosh. You parted from your parents
at a young age,

469
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,690
but you grew up well.

470
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,990
Your parents will be proud of you
when they see you.

471
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:44,759
Do you think
I'll be able to see them?

472
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,730
Let's trust Yeon and wait.

473
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,670
This isn't like you.

474
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,480
Then what's like me?

475
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,750
I'm talking about Imoogi.
Normally, you would've...

476
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:06,750
turned him into a stone.

477
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,349
When the mountain spirit up north
went crazy,

478
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:12,559
you turned him into a stone pillar.
I saw it.

479
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:13,760
So why?

480
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,590
Why is he an exception?

481
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,099
Because I don't want to see you
go crazy?

482
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:26,199
- What do you mean?
- It's inside her too.

483
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:27,599
Imoogi.

484
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,780
Is there a way...

485
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,809
to take out what's in her?

486
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,219
No.

487
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,820
Not unless she dies...

488
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,590
or if Imoogi decides to come out
on its own.

489
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,489
No. You must have heard about
how such a thing...

490
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,829
can live off of a human's body.

491
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,429
No matter how much you struggle,
Imoogi already opened its eyes.

492
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,329
She'll be sacrificed,

493
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,039
and you'll once again
live many years in pain.

494
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,610
That's...

495
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,280
your fate.

496
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:14,679
That's why you told me
not to find her...

497
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:17,250
from the beginning.

498
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,559
And that Ji A and I shouldn't meet.

499
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,989
You didn't want me
to get hurt again...

500
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:27,030
and dragged into that same fate.

501
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,039
Thanks, Granny.

502
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:39,739
Nevertheless, I choose her.

503
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,980
Because she's the reason
I've lived this long.

504
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:48,920
I can see...

505
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,349
that your decision
will never change.

506
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,360
The ground cherries.

507
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,769
Her parents are in there.

508
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:15,880
Let's go.

509
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,750
- Goodbye, sir.
- Okay.

510
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,179
If something happens,

511
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,989
stand there
and call my name three times.

512
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,519
Whether you guys win or lose,

513
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:27,019
I'm betting on you two
no matter what.

514
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:28,860
Thank you.

515
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:31,829
Go on.

516
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:43,309
Did you find out?

517
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,909
The ground cherries.

518
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,139
The ground cherries?

519
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,579
I didn't expect to see
ground cherries in Seoul.

520
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,010
These are ground cherries?

521
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,920
My parents are in there?

522
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,320
How?

523
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,050
Those plants contain
human blood and flesh.

524
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,659
Imoogi's followers were able
to live for long thanks to them.

525
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,760
Let's go.
They were in the living room.

526
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,030
I saw them there.

527
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,699
He must've moved them already.
They weren't there last time.

528
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,690
Our deal ends in 24 hours.

529
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,150
You've spread poison
between the brothers.

530
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,380
Do you think Rang will side with us?

531
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,489
He will.

532
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,590
It's safe to say
that Rang is obsessed with Yeon.

533
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,789
It's more twisted than you think.

534
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:10,829
Rang could kill him
because he loves him so much?

535
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:12,659
Leave this to me.

536
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:15,059
I'll bring you Yeon's heart.

537
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,500
Don't underestimate him.

538
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,199
That very mistake
put me in a deep sleep...

539
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:21,170
in the past.

540
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:23,710
That's why I've set three traps.

541
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,369
Any of them will do.

542
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,550
I'm going to do politics
once this comes to an end.

543
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,980
I'm sick of being the president
of a broadcasting company.

544
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,679
- I need a well-deserved reward.
- Whatever you wish.

545
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,190
What a monster.

546
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,659
But where could Yeon be right now?

547
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,530
Did he even call you out of worry?

548
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,429
You must've gotten abandoned
once again.

549
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:52,130
Are you really going
to give up on your life?

550
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:54,900
For your big brother who only
cares about a woman?

551
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,420
- Yeon?
- You've seen the ground cherries...

552
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,679
at the Imoogi's place, right?

553
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,849
Ji A's parents are in there.
Do you know anything about them?

554
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:16,059
Is that all you want to say to me?

555
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,389
Is it a yes or a no?

556
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,699
Yes.

557
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,829
Where is it hidden?

558
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,699
I don't know.

559
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,500
- Bye.
- I can look into it...

560
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,139
since the president takes
great care of them.

561
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,880
- Really?
- Let's meet tomorrow.

562
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:34,440
We'll talk then.

563
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:56,599
Rang will look into it.
We're meeting tomorrow.

564
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,070
Where? What time?
Should I tag along?

565
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:04,570
Leave it to me. You should focus
on something only you can do.

566
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,610
Why are you guys here?

567
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,050
After finding out
that Ji A's boyfriend...

568
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,880
was a nine-tailed fox,
I just couldn't stop worrying.

569
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,920
- Ji A.
- Yes?

570
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,789
How did you find my house?

571
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:21,159
Ms. Nam had scanned
your fingerprints before.

572
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,789
Why did you come all the way here?

573
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:25,030
I came to check
on my dear princess. Why?

574
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:28,000
I will never allow you to date
a nine-tailed...

575
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,769
You can.
Gosh, how big is this living room?

576
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:38,469
I didn't want to come empty-handed.

577
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,539
- What is it?
- Just a snack.

578
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:44,150
- Mealworms?
- I asked a colleague...

579
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,449
who was in charge
of an animal program...

580
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:46,980
and found out that foxes love them.

581
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,190
I was in a dilemma
between them and crickets.

582
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:51,449
Feel free to enjoy them.

583
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:56,059
Did you have dinner yet?

584
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:58,090
- No.
- I'll order some food.

585
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,309
Unless you die,

586
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:46,280
a fox can't escape
from its contract.

587
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,519
(Gopbuni Tripes)

588
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,190
They're delivered in bundles.

589
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,059
Let's just feed them.

590
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:15,000
So our president was the accomplice
to the mummy case?

591
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,340
I showed him the fingernail
and confronted him. He confessed.

592
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,579
Let's report this to the police.

593
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,809
And say what?

594
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,409
"Our president is actually
from the Goryeo Dynasty."

595
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,050
"He's a follower of the Imoogi,
a mythical creature,"

596
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,480
"and kills people."

597
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,780
They'll definitely believe you.

598
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,090
You're right.

599
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,960
How about we let Detective Baek
wear the tiger's eyebrows?

600
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,690
"Look. If previous lives exist,"

601
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,260
"it's possible for a Goryeo man
to exist as well."

602
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,360
Are you sure he went
to the most prestigious university?

603
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,030
He's a good kid.

604
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,530
Why aren't you eating?

605
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:47,900
You neither ate the mealworms
nor these tripes.

606
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,199
Do you only eat human livers?

607
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:53,510
Actually, I am craving some
right now.

608
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,150
It's tastier than I thought.

609
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,489
- Yes.
- Nice.

610
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:06,460
I'm sorry, but do you have a tail?

611
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,719
Why would you ask if you're sorry?

612
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,329
I still can't believe
that you're a nine-tailed fox.

613
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:11,960
He does have one. I saw it.

614
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,260
No way. Do you also put a leaf
on your forehead and transform?

615
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,429
That's a raccoon.

616
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:18,869
I can transform,
but I refuse to stoop that low.

617
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:21,369
Show us, show us...

618
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,769
You little...

619
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,510
- Just eat.
- Eat. Hurry.

620
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,760
I'll do it.

621
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,530
Why the sudden change of heart?

622
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,800
I want to live.

623
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:58,769
But are you sure
you can take his heart?

624
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,980
You can do that.

625
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,579
I'll lure him.

626
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:07,519
You're so softhearted.

627
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:12,349
Take this.

628
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,860
Lure him to the designated location.

629
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,030
You and I are a team
from this moment on.

630
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,800
You should spend the night here.

631
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,780
Kids like him are destined
to work at broadcasting companies.

632
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,579
You should work here
until you retire.

633
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,449
Did you buy all of this
in the morning?

634
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:17,789
Yes.

635
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:19,989
- Eat up.
- It looks good. Hurry.

636
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,860
When did you become so close?

637
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,289
Hey. He's incredible.

638
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:27,530
He's an expert on history, culture,
art, and even religion.

639
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:28,900
He's like a walking encyclopedia.

640
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,429
He was pretty useful
in the field too.

641
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:33,070
You know those foreign references
for our previous life story?

642
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:35,739
He translated the dissertations that
were written in English, French,

643
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:36,869
and even Chinese.

644
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,210
What's your secret?

645
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,110
I barely left the house when I was
a kid because I was ill.

646
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,849
I was always alone, except when
my babysitter visited.

647
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:46,880
So I read books all the time.

648
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,460
Good morning. You guys were
all gathered here.

649
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,829
Gosh, is this toast?

650
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,070
- It's mine.
- Wait.

651
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,340
Let me have one.
Don't be so cheap.

652
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,610
My proud teammates,
let's have a team dinner tonight.

653
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,239
- I can't go.
- Me neither.

654
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:15,579
No, no. Whether it's shooting,
writing, or editing,

655
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:17,949
I won't accept any excuses today.
Why?

656
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,780
Because today is Terry's
welcome party.

657
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,639
You're here.

658
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:43,440
What are you doing here?

659
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,239
I'm brewing coffee.

660
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,380
What are all these plants
that don't suit you at all?

661
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:53,150
I just want you to enjoy
the taste of home.

662
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,389
Choose the one you like.
Women really love it.

663
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,320
Well, if you insist.

664
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:45,130
Where are the ground cherries?
Did you look into it?

665
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,369
Why are you in such a rush?

666
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:47,840
I don't have time to chat with you.

667
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,610
- What?
- I don't have time either.

668
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,010
But still, you should listen to
what I have to say.

669
00:47:58,650 --> 00:47:59,820
What is it?

670
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,420
What am I to you?

671
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,289
What's your problem this time?

672
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,960
I think I've done enough for you.

673
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:15,800
What is it now?

674
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,099
Answer me.

675
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,139
What am I to you?

676
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:24,269
You're family.

677
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,710
Just because we share the blood
of the same father,

678
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,010
you torment me like crazy
as if it's your right...

679
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,280
and it disgusts me.

680
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:35,880
Just because we're surrounded
by flowers,

681
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,349
don't expect me to say
something sweet to you.

682
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:42,019
I'm sick and tired of you
still acting like a kid.

683
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,260
You're so mean to me...

684
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:51,230
when you're so generous
to that girl.

685
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,869
Yes. She's much stronger than you.

686
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:56,869
Her family history is
almost as tragic as ours,

687
00:48:56,869 --> 00:48:58,539
but she never whines like you.

688
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:01,480
It's strange.

689
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:05,880
You were never a kind brother to me,

690
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,050
but you were always radiant.

691
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:13,360
You looked perfect.

692
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:15,789
I wanted...

693
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,760
to be like you.

694
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:27,670
Drink it.

695
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,739
Who knows what you put
in this coffee?

696
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,880
What's with the face?
I'm just kidding.

697
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:02,670
So? Where are the ground cherries?

698
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:04,869
Wait. You'll find them soon.

699
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:08,440
You better not try anything funny.

700
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,710
You saved me from
the Forest of Starving Ghosts.

701
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,780
That's when I thought...

702
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:19,960
I should die for you someday.

703
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:22,260
After saving your life.

704
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,590
But you know what?

705
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,199
Now that the time has come,
I changed my mind.

706
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,030
I want to live.

707
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,800
That being said,

708
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:37,940
can you die, brother?

709
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:52,849
Do you want to fight?

710
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,659
I can't beat you in a fair fight.

711
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:02,460
The coffee?

712
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,309
If you cared for me half as much as
you cared for her,

713
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:22,449
I wouldn't have done this.

714
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,150
I would never have done it.

715
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,059
You fool.

716
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:28,980
I have Lee Yeon.

717
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,019
Wait until I get there.

718
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:35,489
And don't call this number
from now on.

719
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:45,699
Darn it. Am I his dog or what?

720
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,449
Hey, over here. Come have a seat.

721
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,420
Come sit down. Here you go.

722
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,550
Well, then. Fill up your glasses.

723
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:07,489
I'll pour you one, Terry.

724
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:10,090
Here you go.

725
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,230
- Thank you.
- Let me say a toast.

726
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:16,300
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

727
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,230
- Thank you.
- Drink up.

728
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:23,840
Gosh, I wish I had a son like you.

729
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,110
You're handsome, intelligent,
and even...

730
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,510
Gosh, look how muscular you are.
You're like Virtual Fighter.

731
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:35,349
Look at you.
Well, you're nice, at least.

732
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:38,190
You never disappoint me, sir.

733
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:40,559
How could you be so consistent?
Isn't he?

734
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,230
I need to get some fresh air.

735
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:55,800
Terry, where are you going?

736
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:05,909
I need to go meet someone.

737
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,219
I'll be back soon.

738
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,179
Where did you learn
to be rude like that?

739
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,050
Sorry?

740
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:12,920
Who suddenly leaves
during a team gathering?

741
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:14,260
And when it's your own
welcome party?

742
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:17,659
I'm sorry.

743
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:19,659
I have so many questions to ask you.

744
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:22,929
Like what?

745
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,599
What's your favorite book?

746
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:30,469
- "A Lover's Discourse: Fragments".
- By Roland Barthes?

747
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:31,739
Did you read it?

748
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,170
The title hooked me.

749
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:35,539
I thought it was
a guidebook on dating.

750
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:38,079
If one wants to understand
his language of love,

751
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,949
you need at least a master's degree
in humanities.

752
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:43,519
There are many beautiful lines too.

753
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:47,159
"He praises the other
for being perfect,"

754
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:50,329
"he glorifies himself
for having chosen..."

755
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,289
"this perfect other."

756
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,099
I praise cocktails.

757
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,099
Let's go.

758
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,719
There's five minutes left.
End the contract.

759
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:20,690
To make it clear, it's over
when we get Yeon's heart.

760
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,429
I brought him as I promised.

761
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,289
Say that the contract is over.

762
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,699
I'm waiting for Imoogi.

763
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:30,269
Why are you talking to me casually?

764
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,800
Is it driving you crazy?

765
00:55:32,969 --> 00:55:35,369
You can't kill someone
you're indebted to.

766
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,380
You were born a slave,

767
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,150
so I guess you can't do anything
without your master.

768
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,679
Watch your mouth.

769
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,849
You'll have to do everything
if I tell you to repay me.

770
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:53,860
You're licking Imoogi's behind
who ate your family.

771
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,059
Shut your mouth.

772
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:57,130
How did it feel...

773
00:55:57,489 --> 00:56:01,400
at the moment when your family
was screaming? Did you cry?

774
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,030
- I said, shut your mouth.
- Say it.

775
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,170
Say our contract is over.

776
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:08,969
Sure.
I'll end our contract for good...

777
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,510
in my own way.

778
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,190
Hey, are you crazy?

779
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:28,489
I gave it a thought,
and this isn't going to work.

780
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,460
I know I'm a jerk, but I can't...

781
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:35,130
sacrifice my own family
as an offering.

782
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,070
What? Then you'll die.

783
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,340
I won't die.

784
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,639
A fox will definitely die
if the fox violates the contract.

785
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,309
A fox...

786
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:49,380
can change the appearance.

787
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,679
Gosh. I hate doing this
since it's not very classy.

788
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,320
You're always on about being classy.

789
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:04,090
You said you'd only have a sip
of the coffee, but you slept deeply.

790
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:08,300
Since when...

791
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:12,699
Since last night. At your place.

792
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,150
What are you...

793
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,579
doing here?

794
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:35,760
I'm sorry.

795
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:38,989
I only heard
you were one of the hostages.

796
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,329
I didn't know that everyone
will end up dying.

797
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,739
Let's live together.

798
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:00,380
No matter how hard I try,

799
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,420
I can't escape from this contract.

800
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:05,090
You can.

801
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:08,260
How?

802
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,460
Let's switch. You and me.

803
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:16,130
Then, take me to him
just as he asked.

804
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:19,199
I'll do it.

805
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,340
Take this.

806
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,170
You should sleep here tonight.

807
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:46,929
How dare you? How dare you?

808
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:00,070
You. Kill Yeon right now.

809
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:03,409
Stop bothering my brother.

810
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,780
I'll really cut your throat.

811
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:10,079
The choice is yours.

812
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,860
Do you want to kill Rang here
and die in my hands...

813
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:16,719
or do you want
to change the contract?

814
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:26,000
Save me. Return the favor.

815
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:49,789
The ground cherry.
Take me to the ground cherry tree.

816
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:17,820
People drink so they can get drunk.

817
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,820
- But you're too drunk.
- Are you serious?

818
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,389
- Gosh.
- Thank you. Bye.

819
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:23,019
Thank you!

820
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:28,500
You should take my car.
I called for a replacement driver.

821
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,230
- That's okay.
- I'm not okay with it.

822
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:39,539
Sorry, sir. You can go.

823
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,289
Ms. Nam.

824
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,530
- Yes?
- Do you have a boyfriend?

825
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,099
Yes, I do.

826
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:03,099
What kind of person is he?

827
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:06,730
He's like a man from a fairy tale.

828
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:08,900
You should break up with him.

829
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,010
- What?
- You know, fairy tales...

830
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,440
for adults have cruel endings.

831
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:30,090
Bye. Thank you for everything.

832
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,460
He told us everything so easily.

833
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:45,940
I'm free.

834
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:53,250
Your acting was good.

835
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,050
You could be an actor.

836
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:56,750
Should I try it out?

837
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,110
Terry.

838
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,320
Don't act like a man in front of me.

839
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,420
To me, you're...

840
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:38,829
just my parents' enemy.

841
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,559
Nothing more, nothing less.

842
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,769
So you knew.

843
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:52,239
Is that why you kept me behind?

844
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:56,309
You should focus
on something only you can do.

845
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,710
Something only I can do?

846
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:03,179
While I look for the ground cherry,
keep Imoogi with you.

847
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:04,889
"Imoogi"?

848
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,360
Where is he?

849
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:08,719
Probably...

850
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,289
somewhere much closer
than you think.

851
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,159
Somewhere close to me?

852
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,300
Could it be...

853
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:27,539
You look defenseless
for someone who knows who I am.

854
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:31,750
Yeon told me...

855
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,519
you can't kill me.

856
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:38,489
It's true.

857
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:45,489
Because I like you.

858
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:37,199
Mom?

859
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:42,210
Dad?

860
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:29,760
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

861
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,929
He probably wanted to warn us.

862
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,460
I'll save you at all costs.

863
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,530
You're going to attack the Imoogi?

864
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:38,170
I'm going to find his weakness.

865
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:40,769
I'm going to kill those
who are dear to you.

866
01:06:40,769 --> 01:06:42,369
A bigger hardship is coming.

867
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,269
Don't touch them.

868
01:06:44,269 --> 01:06:46,809
Look closely. I'm you.

869
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,940
And Ji A? Where is she?

870
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:50,849
A plague
will sweep across the world.

871
01:06:50,949 --> 01:06:53,210
Everyone will be miserable.

872
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,619
Why Ji A? Why?

873
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:57,250
Put everything back in its place.
