(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

8
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,990
Once a fox turns 100,
it can become a beautiful woman,

9
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:51,520
or it can become a man
to have relations with a woman.

10
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,030
A fox that lived for 1,000 years
makes a connection with the sky,

11
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,390
becoming a "chunho".

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,030
Its extraordinary abilities equal
that of a shaman.

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,270
They can see things many miles away.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,040
I was going to give this to you
once we get home,

15
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,579
but here.
It's your birthday present.

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,890
Do you like your present?

17
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,859
Yes. I really like it.

18
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,680
(Yeou Gogae, 1999)

19
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,930
Ji A...

20
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,680
Please help me.

21
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,080
Please help me.

22
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,479
You're up.

23
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,680
I'm glad it was all a dream.

24
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,189
- All right.
- Let's have some fruit.

25
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,560
Mom, I love you. I love you so much.

26
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,790
What has gotten into you?
You were just asleep.

27
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,500
- I love you, Dad. I love you a lot.
- Okay.

28
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,129
Goodness.
I love you so much too, Ji A.

29
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,100
By the way, did you have a nightmare
or something?

30
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,670
I don't even want to think about it.

31
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,740
Goodness.

32
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,329
This evening, a fire broke out
at Sungjin Market...

33
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,870
in Samho 2-dong, Seoul.

34
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,470
Many individuals lost their lives.

35
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,040
The fire broke out at 7pm...

36
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,740
and engulfed three houses
before it was extinguished.

37
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,209
Due to this fire...

38
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:16,490
There were many casualties...

39
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,160
that was caused by the fire.

40
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,189
Mom. I'm hungry.

41
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,199
- Do you want some fruit?
- No.

42
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,699
I want some walnut cakes.

43
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,209
Where were those walnut cakes again?

44
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,980
I think we're out.

45
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,120
Can I get you some more tomorrow?

46
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,019
We don't have any walnut cakes.

47
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,290
I'm allergic to nuts
and was hospitalized before.

48
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,329
Right. I forgot.

49
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:01,529
That's not possible.
My mom's a doctor.

50
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,100
I made a mistake
because I was too tired.

51
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,740
You're not my mom.

52
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,980
- Ji A...
- Where's my mom?

53
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,649
I am your mom.

54
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,279
Hey!

55
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,610
Ji A, open the door.

56
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,439
Let's talk.

57
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,709
You're a good girl. Right, Ji A?

58
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,019
Look at this wench.

59
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,360
Are you...

60
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,800
Ah Eum?

61
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,759
No.

62
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,389
You're not Ah Eum.

63
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,740
Forget everything you saw today.

64
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,509
If you don't...

65
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,659
This is Yeou Gogae on Road 144.

66
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,429
A vehicle has rolled over.

67
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,330
There's blood on both the driver
and the passenger seats.

68
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,059
There's a lot of blood.

69
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,299
However, there are no bodies.

70
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,350
Mom. Dad.

71
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,320
Yes, there's one survivor, a girl.

72
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,090
Mom.

73
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,320
- Dad.
- Are you okay?

74
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,490
I can't find my parents.

75
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,700
Please find them for me.

76
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,000
We will find them for you,
so don't worry.

77
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,629
Do you remember what happened?

78
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,169
Were you alone from the start?

79
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,840
(Episode 1: What Happened in
Yeou Gogae)

(21 years later)

81
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,519
(Wedding)

82
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:19,389
Please have the ice cream
after eating breakfast.

83
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,220
The weather forecast
didn't mention any rain.

84
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,419
Exactly. I got my hair done today.

85
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,590
- What should I do?
- You're all wet.

86
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,360
Look.

87
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,529
Today's the fox's wedding.
That's why.

88
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,029
What was that?

89
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,539
You look so pretty.

90
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,480
- Let's take some photos.
- Sure.

91
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,480
1, 2, 3.

92
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,950
- Let me see. Do I look okay?
- You look beautiful.

93
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,590
- You're so photogenic.
- Goodness.

94
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,289
You didn't send me
the wedding invite.

95
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,429
Can you let us talk in private?

96
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,360
Who is he? Your ex?

97
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,429
- Introduce him to us.
- Get out.

98
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,179
Lee Yeon, why are you here?

99
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:48,679
I'm not here to catch the bouquet.

100
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:50,679
How did you find me?

101
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,620
How did you get off the grid
so perfectly?

102
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,019
Did you think changing
your face and identity...

103
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,049
would change your bloody past
as well?

104
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,159
But you see, switching lives...

105
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:02,659
isn't as easy as taking
a bus transfer.

106
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,059
- Please spare me.
- It's too late.

107
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,429
I've changed.
I don't harm humans either.

108
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,629
Look here, fox.

109
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,070
After consuming so many livers
of your foster parents' and men's,

110
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,110
you don't deserve to have
a happy ending.

111
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,509
There's a man I love.

112
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,450
I want to live as a human. Please.

113
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,720
How romantic.

114
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,419
Still, you'll be dying today.

115
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:31,120
You've loved a human too.

116
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,559
You understand, right?

117
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,789
There's something
you don't quite know.

118
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,899
First, I hate it the most
when people make rumors about me.

119
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,529
And second, don't you dare...

120
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,370
bare your claws in front of me.

121
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:51,409
- Goodbye.
- Just once.

122
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,149
Let me see him for the last time.

123
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:58,379
Speaking from experience,
it's best that you don't.

124
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,149
Please. I beg you.

125
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,419
Miss, it's time.

126
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,529
I see.

127
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:15,169
It's time to make your entrance.
Let's go.

128
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,269
I'll only wait until
the end of the wedding.

129
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,139
"It's possible that some beings
that we're not aware of..."

130
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,809
"are living with us in this world."

131
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,179
"The recent ghost stories
that are being told lately..."

132
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,220
"might be because of them."

133
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,789
- What do you think?
- You changed the script again?

134
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,259
The writer will go crazy.

135
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,220
- Do you think she'll feel offended?
- Of course.

136
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,289
Nevertheless, it's better to fix it,
right?

137
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,659
Of course.

138
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,159
Then let's go with this.

139
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,370
A producer has to be
insanely bold or reckless.

140
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,000
What's really mysterious is...

141
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,440
I don't believe in ghost stories
or ghosts at all.

142
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,799
But it's really scary.

143
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,639
I'm not scared at all,
but I believe it.

144
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,610
You do? Why?

145
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,279
Have you ever seen a ghost?

146
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,350
Mom, Dad.

147
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:09,120
- Yes.
- Really?

148
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,059
You're just trying to scare me,
aren't you?

149
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,919
Whatever you want to think.

150
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,100
What's up with the weather?

151
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,700
They say when it rains on your
wedding day, you live happily.

152
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,700
Congratulations!

153
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,139
Congratulations!

154
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,009
- Here are the meal tickets.
- We don't need them.

155
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,320
No, give them to me.

156
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,019
We should fill our stomachs at least
after paying all this money.

157
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,620
Strangely, it's so hard for me
to stomach food at weddings.

158
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,659
Why do you think that is?

159
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:48,529
It's just that this air that forces
happiness on people suffocates me.

160
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,299
You should believe in that stuff
sometimes.

161
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,629
Who knows? You may suddenly meet
your soulmate here.

162
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,340
(It's an emergency!
Our scoop has been canceled.)

163
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,440
I guess I'll have to look for

00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:04,139
Our scoop has been canceled.

165

is this way.

166
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,889
- Please follow me.
- Please come with me.

168
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,879
What right do you have to kill us?

169
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:49,990
What's with that accent?

170
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,190
If it weren't for you, I'd be eating
ice cream and watching dramas.

171
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,259
You're just a nine-tailed fox
who broke the holy rules...

172
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,529
and got kicked out of
being a mountain spirit.

173
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:59,330
That's why I'm suffering
like this now.

174
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,940
Help me!

175
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,210
Help!

176
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,950
Who are you?

177
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,549
Do you think you can hide
when you look like that?

178
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,690
Who are you?

179
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,519
Who are you?

180
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,490
You just don't listen, do you?

181
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:14,440
Stop.

182
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,789
- No...
- Please don't watch.

183
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:44,839
You fool.

184
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,240
You should've run away
when you had time.

185
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,539
I wanted to be a bride.

186
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,809
Don't ever love again
if you're reborn.

187
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,779
I have one last favor.

188
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,019
Please erase...

189
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,890
any good memories he has of me.

190
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Deal.

191
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:49,599
Listen carefully.

192
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,440
Your bride is...

193
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,380
Hey, it's not the girl
from last time.

194
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,450
Be quiet. You're going to get me
in trouble.

195
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,509
You look handsome.

196
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,549
- Do I?
- What is this?

197
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,349
How can this happen?

198
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,220
I can't believe this!

199
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,990

200
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,630
Get up.

201
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,829
- I have some shocking news.
- What's going on?

202
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,200
The wedding in the next hall
has been called off.

203
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,630
Really?

204
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,349
I know him from somewhere.

205
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:53,230
Who is that? Do you know him?

206
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,170
- No.
- Shall I go find out?

207
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,170
- Find out what?
- How a peaceful wedding...

208
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,740
turned into Pandora's box
of mystery.

209
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,410
Who knows? We may get
an amazing story from there.

210
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,000
The bride ran away.

211
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,099
Ran away?

212
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,170
Yes, that's possible.

213
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,069
But what could she have realized...

214
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:35,240
to run away after spending
all this money?

215
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:36,940
It's because of true love.

216
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,279
- She had another man?
- Yes.

217
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,509
That man said, "She is mine."

218
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,119
And the bride grabbed his hand
as if she had been waiting...

219
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:48,190
and said,
"I will seek my true love."

220
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,720
All the witnesses are saying
the same thing.

221
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,319
This shows there was a struggle.

222
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,859
- It's a blood stain.
- It means there was a fight.

223
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,460
I didn't hear anything like that.

224
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,730
More importantly,

225
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,769
what is this wedding dress
doing here?

226
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,170
Since she took it off...

227
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,299
Wait a minute.
What did she change into then?

228
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,869
The witness' statements
and the crime scene...

229
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:12,009
are telling different stories.

230
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,240
Were they all hypnotized or what?

231
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,720
I need to see the face of that
romantic wedding crasher.

232
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:20,380
Okay, I'll go get the tapes.

It's fox fur.

234

- A fox?
- A red fox.

235

A native Korean species.

236
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,940
I thought those foxes went extinct.

237
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,279
So there is something
you don't know.

started since 2012.

How could the marks of a fox
released in Mount Sobaek...

243
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,099
be found near this area?

244
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:08,700
One was caught in an apartment
complex in Yeongju.

245
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,829
And another one crossed the DMZ
and went north.

they got together with.

273

even after 1,000 nights.

- No.

- No.
- Why not?

why did you only pick up now?

- Code Red. Code Red.

You sure don't sound sorry.

353
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,160

This is him coming in,

Gosh. His face is perfectly covered
by the umbrella.

Wait.
It didn't rain after the wedding.

357

He must be a smart criminal.

358
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,470
Of course he went in by himself,

359
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,380
but why is he walking out alone?

360
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,140
- There wasn't anyone else.
- What?

361
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,349

- No, I'm experienced in this world.

- Who is he?

From next time on,

428
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,570
make sure you give me
just the right amount.

429

Let's meet.

438
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,469

Don't get smart with me.

Take the bus tonight
at the place I told you about.

450
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,800
There's one condition, though.

451
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,230
A condition?

452
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,630

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,949
That... That hurts.

485
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,219
Please let me loose.

486
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:27,460
We're here.

487
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,099
You should cut down on drinking.

488
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:35,300
Don't act like
you did something grand for me.

489
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,139
I've already repaid you.

490
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,710
Pardon?

491
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,289
Sir, hold on!

492
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,889
- Where are you headed?
- I'm following Bus 1200.

493
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:08,769
Sir, there was a man behind me.

494
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:11,539
Who? I only saw you.

495
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,849
Hello? There's been an accident
on Road 144.

496
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,420
Yes, it's Yeou Gogae.

497
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,989
"Yeou Gogae"?

498
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,110
This is Yeou Gogae on Road 144.

499
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,210
I can't find my parents.

500
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:26,550
No.

501
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,489
Mister. Mister?

502
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,739
Hey. Wake up!

503
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:53,780
Hey.

504
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,860
Hey. Can you hear me?

505
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,699
I told you not to take pictures.

506
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:49,900
Stop them from making pictures.
Darn.

507
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,840
Ji A! What are you doing here?

508
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,840
Detective Baek. That could've been
my body you found today.

509
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,079
What are you talking about?

510
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,750
- I almost got on that bus.
- What?

511
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:07,250
I was supposed to get on that bus.

512
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,380
For real?

513
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,050
- Five people died and one survived.
- Really?

514
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,389
- There's one person missing.
- What?

515
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,659
There were seven people
on this bus.

516
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:16,730
Are you sure?

517
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,460
I saw it clearly with my eyes.

518
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:25,829
That man is missing.

519
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,800
He vanished into thin air.

520
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,269
He probably got off.

521
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,110
No. This bus didn't stop midway.

522
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,650
There are no bus stops
on the road to the tunnel.

523
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,250
Hey, we need to check something.
Come with me.

524
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,119
Come on.

There was only one survivor
among six passengers.

527
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,829
- Let's go.
- Too many people died.

528
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,269
- So?
- Why don't you just leave it?

529
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:01,570
I have to take care of it myself.

(Jung Soo Young, female, age 17)

531
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:17,619
Soo Young, can you recognize me?

532
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,219
We met at the bus stop.

533
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:26,460
Can you remember
how the accident happened?

534
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:39,269
I know you are scared since
you're the only survivor.

535
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,280
I was in a similar accident too
a long time ago.

536
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:46,420
That's why I'm alone now.

537
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,590
If you put your mind to it,

538
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:53,059
you can turn a tragedy into
a very convenient shield.

539
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:56,389
Since everyone tries so hard
to sympathize with you.

540
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:00,329
I really hope you stay strong.

541
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,800
Since becoming a producer
is way more fun...

542
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,369
than becoming a victim.

543
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:30,130
You can call me anytime
if you need me.

544
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:38,699
By any chance, did you see
the young man on the bus...

545
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:39,900
sitting next to the window
on the right?

546
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,570
He had an umbrella like this.

547
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,320
You saw him.

548
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:56,889
What did you see?
Why are you panicking?

549
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,690
He's going to come.

550
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,820
What?

551
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:02,420
To kill me.

552
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,489
He's going to come here to kill me.

553
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:13,500
Jae Hwan, call Detective Baek
and ask him to send someone here.

554
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,639
Okay. What about the CCTV footage
from the bus?

555
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:17,710
It's broken.

556
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:20,809
It's the same as the wedding
last time.

557
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:22,710
What about the cameras on the road?

558
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,380
There are none on either exits
of the tunnel.

559
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,260
I'm looking for
a high school student...

560
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,130
from last night's bus accident.

561
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,030
Did you come with her?

562
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,400
What?

563
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,679
I found him.

564
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:04,889
(Woojin University Hospital)

565
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,260
What does a producer want with me?

566
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:11,030
This voice... No way...

567
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,329
What do you think?

568
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,730
Is this some sort of street casting?

569
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,199
But too bad.
I can't dance nor sing.

570
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:24,239
All I have as a talent
is this handsome face.

571
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,909
It is a casting,
but for another genre.

572
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,480
- Then what is it?
- Yeou Gogae.

573
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:33,949
Is it a horror drama?

574
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:36,420
Well, you can call it
an urban ghost story.

575
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,719
For example, when a passenger
on bus 1002 disappears.

576
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:42,389
As if he evaporated.

577
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,090
It sounds pretty lame to me.

578
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,460
I like romantic comedies better.

579
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,139
Then what about this?

580
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,280
That red color looks dashing
on the camera.

581
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,510
I don't know if it's fate
or coincidence,

582
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,349
but I've already seen you
three times.

583
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,389
First, at the wedding
where the bride disappeared,

584
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:11,920
and second, on the bus 1002.

585
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:16,059
Lastly, this hospital where I came
to see the victim of the accident.

586
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,460
Let's just call it fate.

587
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,699
But unfortunately,
I have a girlfriend.

588
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:27,570
And you might not believe it,
but I'm a very pure guy.

589
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,840
Did you kill them?

590
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,550
Or are you here to kill her?

591
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,119
I just found someone
I want to kill.

592
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:02,269
He said he'd be here in 10 minutes.
Where is he?

593
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,340
When you usually accuse
someone like that,

594
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,980
shouldn't you come prepared?

595
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:11,949
Like proof or a witness.

596
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:14,820
Or even a police badge.

597
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:19,190
That's true. I guess I was rude.
I'm sorry.

598
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,590
No need for the fake apology.

599
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:25,230
You didn't even touch your coffee.

600
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:27,800
Have some.

601
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,699
I don't drink coffee
strangers give me.

602

- What's your name?
- I don't want to tell you.

606
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,710
Why don't you try finding out?

607
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:44,309
Hey.

608
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,280
Can you take my business card
at least?

609
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:49,719
It's inside that bag.

610
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:54,960
What is this, a blind date?

611
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,329
I'm sorry, but I refuse.

612
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:11,039
Jae Hwan, it's me.

613
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:12,940
Ask Detective Baek
to analyze a fingerprint for me.

614
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,110
Yes.

615
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,119
It's a leather bag.

616
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:23,820
This could really be fate.

617
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:25,650
That little kid you saved
20 years ago...

618
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,420
has reappeared in front of you.

619
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,829
She probably doesn't even remember.

620
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,289
I don't like her.

621
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:32,530
She does look alike.

622
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,960
I get surprised
every time I see her.

623
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,099
You should stop providing advice
for that show.

624
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:40,239
I can't. It's connected to
my livelihood.

629
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,010
That the outfit of the
Grim Reaper was wrong.

I told you not to leave her alone.

dream about it?

if my clothes will fit you.

646
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,019
I'm sorry for being a nuisance.

647
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:38,550
It's just for a night anyway.

648
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:40,989
What about your family?

649
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,730
It's just me here,
so make yourself at home.

650
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,099
So you're alone.

651
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,619
When was she discharged?

652
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,989
Just a moment ago.

653
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:13,019
I was asked to pass this over
if she gets a visitor.

654
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:16,059
- Who asked?
- The woman who took the patient.

655
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,519
Soo Young.

656
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,559
What are you doing up?

657
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:51,059
I remembered...

658
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,329
what happened
in the tunnel that day.

659
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:09,809
The bus went into the tunnel.

660
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,780
When I took off my earphones,

661
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,090
it was so quiet around me.

662
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,590
Do you want...

663
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:57,289
They all died.

664
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,300
That man...

665
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,170
approached me in the darkness.

666
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,539
"That man"?

667
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:09,269
The man with an umbrella.

668
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:13,110
What did he do?

669
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,050
He tried to kill me.

670
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,619
I was so scared.

671
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:34,230
It's okay. It'll get better.

672
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,099
Are you okay? Are you hurt?
Lift your foot.

673
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:40,539
I'm okay...

674
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:47,139
By the way, Soo Young.
Where were you going at that hour?

675
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:50,380
What? I was going home, of course.

676
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,820
I looked up your address,
and the bus to your house...

677
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:56,179
was on the opposite side.

678
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,650
That day, I just...

679
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,789
Don't talk nonsense.

680
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,989
Ji A.

681
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:17,239
Since when did you know?

682
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:22,579
You know,

683
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,550
people tend to instinctively
protect themselves...

684
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,050
when a car accident happens.

685
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,820
But the only survivor didn't have...

686
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:33,519
any traces of defending herself
on her body.

687
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,800
I never believed in miracles.

688
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,699
Who are you?

689
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:52,269
I'm someone you know,

690
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,010
and also someone you don't know.

691
00:57:58,650 --> 00:57:59,710
How?

692
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:03,820
Where's Soo Young?

693
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:05,119
I ate her.

694
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,769
Do you think you can hurt me
with something like this?

695
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,599
Of course not.

696
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:24,610
I'm just using myself as bait.

697
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:26,570
"Bait"?

698
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:32,480
Hey, you. I thought I told you
I don't want to see you again.

699
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,480
I'm taking home
what you're looking for.

700
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,420
This isn't the time for it.

701
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,969
- Did you miss me?
- Do you want to die, brother?

702
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,170
- He's your little brother?
- It's a long story.

703
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,969
We're a messed up family.

704
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,690
This is why getting properly taught
by your parents is important.

705
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:39,380
How many people did you kill?

706
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,079
Are you scared I'll end up
in the netherworld?

707
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,420
No, it's because I'm embarrassed.

708
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,389
I did it because I don't want
to live my life like you.

709
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:49,019
Whining like you at your age
is worse.

710
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,130
Timeout. Timeout. Let's make a bet
instead of fighting.

711
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:02,670
Do you still have that bad habit?

712
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:06,739
If you don't find her until
the end of next month, she'll die.

713
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,409
- What?
- You know I'm not joking, right?

714
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,190
I'll see you again next time.

715
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,599
Excuse me. Who are you people?

716
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,679
Forget everything about me.

717
01:00:54,889 --> 01:00:56,920
(Detective Baek)

718
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,559
About the fingerprint
you asked about before...

719
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,099
We just identified it.

720
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:12,039
I thought I told you
I don't want to see you again.

721
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:16,639
This isn't the time for it.

722
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:19,780
Is that you, Sin Ju?

723
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:23,079
Why did you leave the doors open?

724
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:25,119
Did you miss me?

725
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,619
Do you want to die, brother?

726
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:29,190
It's a long story.
We're a messed up family.

727
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,320
What is that sound?

728
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,260
This is why getting properly taught
by your parents is important.

729
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:44,269
How many people did you kill?

730
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:46,010
Are you scared I'll end up
in the netherworld?

731
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,840
No, it's because I'm embarrassed.

732
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,880
I did it because I don't want
to live my life like you.

733
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,579
Whining like you at your age
is worse.

734
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,429
Do you like it?

735
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,369
How did you get in?

736
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,840
Your name is Lee Yeon,
and your Korean age is 36.

737
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:18,039
It's obviously a fake identity.

738
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,909
I guess this makes it a fate,
and not a coincidence.

739
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:24,110
Do you still have your memories?

740
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,880
Whatever it is, it doesn't work
too well on me, does it?

741
01:02:28,449 --> 01:02:29,619
What do you want?

742
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:31,750
The original is here.

743
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,619
If you want it, come and get it.

744
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:31,909
I knew it. You're not a human.

745
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:36,179
Did you test me?

746
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:47,500
Forget everything you saw today.

747
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,400
If you don't...

748
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,739
I'll kill you.

749
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,409
I've been waiting for you.

750
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:03,300
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

751
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,840
A cost?

752
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,539
I'll take away the eyes
that saw what they shouldn't have.

753
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:09,840
I'll keep on following you around...

754
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:11,679
until one of you dies.

755
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:14,480
Go back to the world you belong.

756
01:05:15,949 --> 01:05:17,179
I'm desperate.

757
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,920
Is that patch for motion sickness?

758
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:22,489
Do you mean
that's really sleeping under here?

759
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,030
Don't look for it. It will
change your fate one more time.

760
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,829
Ah Eum reincarnated, right?

761
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,929
Just don't get out of my sight.

762
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:32,469
Do you really want to see
the world I live in?
