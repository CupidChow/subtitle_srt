Does it not hurt anymore?

9
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:52,259
Look at me.

10
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,370
It's been a long time, Yeon.

11
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,370
It's been a long time, Yeon.

12
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:09,909
She's mine.

13
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:11,140
She's mine.

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:21,689
How does it feel?

15
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,120
You waited over 600 years...

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,659
to become enemies with the woman
you love again.

17
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,090
What about Ji A?

18
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,670
Where is she?

19
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,730
Right here. She's in here with me.

20
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,739
She's screaming...

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,370
while blaming her helpless fate.

22
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,709
Let me ask you one thing.

23
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:46,879
Who was that man earlier,

24
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,019
and who are you?

25
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,349
This is all your fault.

26
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,319
If this woman was sacrificed
at that well on that island,

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,689
we would have stayed as 1
instead of 2.

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,629
When the time comes,
we'll become one again.

29
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:09,500
When will that time come?

30
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,639
The day we transfer over
to your body.

31
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,340
Why are you so obsessed
with my body?

32
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,009
Can't you just
live a good life on your own?

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Didn't you see how fast it can grow?

34
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,289
Do you mean...

35
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,159
it can grow old...

36
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,830
as fast as it grew up?

37
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,930
So that's your curse.

38
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,939
There was a chance
to change my fate once.

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,039
If you had become a dragon...

40
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,370
The mountain spirit
of Baekdudaegan...

41
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,810
would have been me instead of you.

42
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,650
It was revenge.

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,250
That's why you were
obsessed with me...

44
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,219
out of all the immortal bodies.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,560
For your information,
now that I came out,

46
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:06,560
this woman will be gone soon.

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,629
- I'll kill you.
- If you kill me,

48
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,129
your woman will die too.

49
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,599
If you save your woman, you'll die.

50
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,900
Do you want to save her,
or do you want to live?

51
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,080
Unfortunately,

52
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,979
we don't like any of the choices
you listed.

53
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,560
No matter what you say,

54
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,229
you can't touch a hair on this body.

55
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,870
You're weak.

56
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,710
What?

57
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,479
Do you get weak in this body?

58
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,319
Most strength and abilities
are with the other Imoogi.

59
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,219
You're like his heart.

60
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:10,120
That's why you need Ji A
as your shield...

61
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,990
in order to hide the fact
that you're weak.

62
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,600
You can't change fate.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,009
All will be good
as long as you're gone.

64
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:34,449
All I need is you, Ji A.

65
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,449
Please.

66
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,550
Just leave that body and die.

67
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,269
Ji A.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,069
Are you listening?

69
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,639
You're there, right?

70
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,339
Be quiet.

71
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,680
Come back.

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,449
I'll always be waiting for you.

73
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,250
Come back, Ji A.

74
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:18,060
I'll always be waiting for you.

75
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,829
I've been waiting for you too.

76
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm used to waiting,
more than anything else.

77
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,370
24 hours is nothing.
I could sit here for 24 years.

78
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,800
I had a feeling I might see you
if I wait here.

79
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,740
I'll stay beside you.

80
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,579
I'm yours until I die.

82
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,019
Yes. It's me. I'm right here.

83
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,899
Help me, Yeon.

84
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,329
Just kill me instead...

85
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,100
so I won't be able to hurt you.

86
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,819
It's okay. It's okay.

87
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,189
It'll all be okay.

(Episode 13: Another Imoogi)

89
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:16,110
Dr. Gu, thank you for today.
We didn't die thanks to you.

90
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,779
Don't thank me.
You should thank Mr. Lee.

91
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,410
Both of you,
take care of yourselves.

92
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,819
Mr. Lee.

93
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,550
I'll be right there.

94
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,860
I don't care about Yeon or Imoogi.

95
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,500
All I need is ground cherry.

96
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:39,899
Just ground cherry.

97
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,800
Hey.

98
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,209
Hey, you shouldn't drive
so dangerously.

99
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,980
- Who are you?
- I'm Hyuneuiong.

100
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,279
I got a report, so I came
to retrieve the ground cherries.

101
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,250
Who sent you? Imoogi? Or Yeon?

102
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,779
Why does that matter?

103
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,790
These don't belong to you anyway.

104
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,889
Don't be absurd!

105
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
These ground cherries are mine!
Mine!

106
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,029
Gosh, that hurts.

107
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:11,560
I hate the smell of gunpowder.

108
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,730
Look, here. You shouldn't shorten
other people's lives as you please.

109
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,240
What are you?
Are you also a monster?

110
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,509
Goodness.

111
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,810
By the look of it,
I think we'll meet again soon.

Are you sure
she's herself right now?

115
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,529
But we don't know when she'll turn
once again and attack you.

116
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,799
I let her hurt me on purpose.

117
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,570
What?

118
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,309
I wanted to check.

119
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,419
It could benefit the Imoogi
to be split into two.

120
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,450
But I thought it could also serve
as his fatal weakness.

121
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,120
What do you mean?

122
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,690
The Imoogi inside of her...

123
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,389
is different from the other one.

124
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,429
They're the same Imoogi,
but they're different?

125
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:55,299
This one is much more similar
to the one from the past.

126
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,440
What do you need me to do?

127
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,070
Visit the Snail Bride right now...

128
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:02,840
and ask her where
the fortune teller is.

129
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,980
Do you mean the old man
who ran away with your fox marble?

130
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,690
Should we turn them back to humans?

131
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
I'll check the register
and only give life to those...

132
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
who still have time left.

133
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,029
It's going to be a pain
if they all come back at once.

134
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,759
Okay. All right, let's eat first.

135

Honey, do you want
some tteokbokki...

with gimmari and sundae?

137
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:30,370
Add some cheese.

138
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,070
Okay, I'll add some mozzarella.

139
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,509
You'll have level 3 spiciness,
and I'll have level 1.

Why would you apologize?

151

They were my hands.

152

I stabbed you with my own hands.

00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,559
I might really go insane.

167
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,580
Then would you like
to go somewhere together?

168
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,559
Okay. Let's go.

169
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,889
Let's go somewhere
where it's just us two.

170
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,929
Don't worry too much
about your parents.

171
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,100
I told Sin Ju
to keep an eye on them.

172
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,139
Thank you.

173
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,179
By the way, where are we going?

174
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,309
Wherever.

175
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,169
Do you remember
the day we first met?

176
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,299
When you were a kid?

177
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,240
No.

178
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,110
Of course, I do.

179
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,549
I spent all my life chasing others.

180
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,179
You were the first person
to chase after me so viciously.

181
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,389
I should've viciously confessed
my feelings to you back then.

182
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:17,330
Then we could've had
a bit more time feeling happy...

183
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,200
in ignorance.

184
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,940
Darn it!

185
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,860
Going somewhere?

186
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,070
Please forgive me.
I must've gone crazy for a while.

187
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,100
I was blinded
by those ground cherries. Lunatic!

188
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:02,669
Lift your head.

189
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,120
You were born in a thatched house
into a family of servants...

190
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,179
and came so far.

191
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,750
It's all thanks to you.

192
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,559
I was also the one...

193
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,419
who saved you from being killed
for being a traitor.

194
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,360
I will never forget that.

195
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,529
Then...

196
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,100
why did you join hands with Yeon?

197
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,309
I heard you gave him
a lot of information.

198
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,549
Spare me, please.
Please give me one more chance.

199
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,679
There's no need.

200
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,220
I don't need anything...

201
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,590
or anyone anymore.

202
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,990
I've changed my plan.

203
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,389
Sorry?

204
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,169
I wish all of you who are living...

205
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,870
will live a life of misery.

206
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,909
Turn yourself in.

207
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,179
Being a sinner suits you.

208
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,159
Do you want to play a game?

209
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,759
What game?

210
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,230
Like you said,

211
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,070
we're going to pretend like
we don't know anything.

212
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,139
For example?

213
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:46,879
You're an ordinary person
who hates her boring, warm life.

214
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:48,350
And I'm...

215
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:50,950
not a nine-tailed fox.

216
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,590
Do we know each other?

217
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,059
We're...

218
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,590
married.

219
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,860
We're an ordinary couple.

220
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,299
You go to work as usual,
and I make dinner and wait for you.

221
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,099
- What do you say?
- So I'm the breadwinner?

222
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,039
I own countless buildings
and have more than enough cash.

223
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,210
I want to be a househusband
who receives monthly rents.

224
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,609
Don't laugh. Be serious.

225
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,250
Then what should I do?

226
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:25,349
Hold on.

227
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,450
Give me a minute.

228
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,890
Come home from work.

229
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,500
Come home.

230
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,369
This seems a bit stupid.

231
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,839
I'm home.

232
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:55,880
Honey?

233
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,220
"I'm home, honey"?

234
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,589
My darling, are you upset?

235
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,220
Why are you upset?

236
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,259
What time is it?

237
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:10,990
All you say is that
it's normal for a working woman...

238
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,529
to come home late.

239
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,700
Didn't you say you'd be back
by 12 o'clock?

240
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,000
Did you promise me or not?

241
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,799
- I even have a curfew?
- Yes.

242
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,539
You broke your curfew
twice last month.

243
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,240
Are promises you make to me
not important?

244
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,339
That's true.
Please forgive me this one time.

245
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,849
No, I can't. Sit over there.

246
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,119
Sit down, we need to talk.

247
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,890
Honey, you just came out of rehab.

248
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,859
Me?

249
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,589
Is that so?

250
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,700
So you're taking it a step further?

251
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:47,259
Honey, you've changed lately.

252
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:49,069
Do you even love me?

253
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,799
I love you.

254
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,579
Me too.

255
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,880
Are we all good now?

256
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,250
Of course. Our fights never last...

257
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,019
more than five minutes anyway.

258
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,289
It's unfair.

259
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,170
Why can't we have
an ordinary life like this?

260
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,569
It's really so unfair.

261
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,849
If you were a person...

262
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,519
and we were really married,

263
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,160
and if we lived in a world...

264
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:50,359
where Imoogi didn't even exist...

265
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,170
If we met like that,

266
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,440
how happy would we have been?

267
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,440
I will protect you.

268
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,450
No matter what happens...

269
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,750
at the end of this fight,
you must survive.

270
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,960
That's enough for me.

271
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,710
No matter how many times I'm reborn,

272
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,339
the world is full of darkness.

273
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,710
Lee Yeon, I'll show you too.

274
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,650
How the world I live in
looks in the end.

275
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,710
(Terry)

276
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,759
Hello?

277
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,190
A party is about to begin.

278
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,890
I can't stay kind forever, you know.

279
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,599
You can look forward to it.

280
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,240
I pity you.

281
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,640
You never learned how to love
or to be loved.

282
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:52,640
All you can do is threaten me.

283
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,279
Like you said, this is a threat.

284
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,009
Your body will become
a ticking bomb from now on.

285
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,779
Look at yourself.

286
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,829
Soon, that thing will
totally consume your body.

287
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:17,029
And when that time comes,

288
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,970
you'll have to kill Lee Yeon
with your own hands.

289
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:56,240
Have you lost your mind?

290
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,079
How dare you peek at my computer?

291
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,250
What are you intending to do?
Why are you changing her register?

292
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,890
She's the real one.

293
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,890
The real Imoogi.

294
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:14,859
What do you mean?

295
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,089
The real Imoogi is inside her body.

296
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,359
I must catch that first to catch
the other one making a fuss.

297
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:25,539
So you'll sacrifice an innocent girl
to catch Imoogi?

298
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,769
Even when you know
what she means to Yeon?

299
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,039
I know better than anyone.

300
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,039
- Then how could you?
- That's why it must be me.

301
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,849
Yeon will never let her die.

302
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,779
And Imoogi is well aware of it.

303
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,220
If that thing takes over
Yeon's body too,

304
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,720
what do you think will happen?

305
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,289
You'll kill a human over something
that hasn't even happened yet?

306
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,960
What is it you want to protect
by going so far?

307
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,230
This is my job!

308
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,200
For the same reason,

309
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,170
our son lost his bride,
and we lost our son.

310
00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:00,200
You changed her register
back then too.

311
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,740
As a result,

312
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,910
our son took his own life.

313
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,250
We haven't even retrieved
his soul yet.

314
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,950
We were able to stop the plague.

315
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,880
Our son Bok Gil
can't even be reborn!

316
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,589
That is...

317
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,329
his fate.

318
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:26,259
I thought you had changed
at least a little bit...

319
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,329
after we lost our son like that.

320
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,440
But you haven't changed at all.

321
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,970
A bigger disaster is coming.

322
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,710
- If we don't stop it now...
- Fine.

323
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,609
You stop the disaster.

324
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,650
I'll stop you.

325
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,650
What are you trying to say?

326
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,450
The moment you change the date
of her death,

327
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:55,190
it's over between us.

328
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:36,369
I'm looking at you sleeping
while writing this.

329
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,640
I've decided to go back to Seoul.

330
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,509
The decision I've made
while I spent the night here...

331
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,509
is that no matter how far
I run away,

332
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:54,079
there's no way to escape.

333
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:03,990
I'm at the seashore.

334
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,859
Let's walk together.

335
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:12,000
Let's walk until the end of
this seashore and go back.

336
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,839
I'm just a small and trivial being,

337
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:22,309
and the weight of my fate
feels too heavy on my shoulders,

338
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:26,549
and it feels as if I'm drowning
to the bottom of the sea.

339
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,859
But you push me back up
like buoyancy.

340
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,630
You let me float again.

341
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,599
You stop me from drowning.

342
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,539
A mundane...

343
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,680
but warm life like ordinary people.

344
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,890
I promised to return her...

345
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:04,220
such a daily life.

346
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,390
But in front of that ocean,

347
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,329
she told me...

348
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,359
she doesn't want it if she's alone.

349
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,269
That we should be together...

350
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,940
whether we live or die.

351
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,339
Perhaps...

352
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,809
I might not be able...

353
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,680
to keep that promise.

354
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,750
Bring Mr. Lee back to life.

355
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,359
I did everything I could,
but none of it worked.

356
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,130
Why should I?

357
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,500
Why should I do you a favor?

358
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,130
Because of you, I stabbed him
and was framed.

359
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,470
You have to be responsible.

360
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,000
Who do you think I am?

361
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,809
The manager
of a ground cherry factory.

362
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,109
I'm not scared of you.

363
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,539
I can see you mean it.

364
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,849
But if you want a deal,
shouldn't I get something in return?

365
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,250
You don't look like
you'd have anything I want.

366
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,960
As for this incompetent fox,
he's useless to me now.

367
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,930
Take my life in return
and bring him back to life.

368
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,430
Are you going to be okay with it?

369
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,240
Wait.

370
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:32,940
Mr. Lee. I'm leaving like this,

371
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:34,809
but you should live a long life.

372
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,819
Don't skip your meals
and gain some weight.

373
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,750
Stop chasing after
your big brother too.

374
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,390
Just a little...

375
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,460
You should become
just a little happier.

376
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,039
Kill me.

377
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,079
Don't stall. This is more annoying!

378
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,119
Open your eyes.

379
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,450
I'll do what you asked.

380
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,490
But...

381
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,059
you're coming with me.

382
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,930
When the Imoogi inside her
calls you,

383
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,769
you'll become my soldier.

384
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:45,980
If you stay in such a place
for too long,

385
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,319
the darkness can eat you up.

386
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,180
Can I help you?

387
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,579
I'll confess.

388
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,109
What?

389
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,920
I came to turn myself in.

390
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,119
I'm the murderer.

391
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,750
Who did you murder?

392
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,559
The mummy you found at
a construction site in Geumran-gu.

393
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:29,390
Is this true?

394
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:31,190
There are four more.

395
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,599
If you check the records
on my car's GPS,

396
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,069
you'll be able to find the places
I temporarily buried the others.

397
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,599
- Go check it.
- Okay.

398
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
What's the motive?

399
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:44,609
Why would a CEO
of a broadcasting station do that?

400
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,039
I just wanted to live long.

401
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,619
If you're put in the same situation,

402
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,390
you'd make the same choice.

403
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,859
Should I go in with you?

404
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,700
No.

405
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,299
I want to see
my parents' faces properly.

406
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:16,910
- If something happens to me...
- That won't ever happen.

407
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:23,549
But if this is how you feel,
you should do it.

408
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,180
Don't worry.

409
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:30,950
He only appears
when he feels threatened.

410
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,420
Or when he sees blood.

411
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,970
Now that I think about it...

412
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:56,980
It's been a long time, Yeon.

413
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,049
The scales are getting bigger.

414
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,220
I might not have much time left...

415
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,730
as myself.

416
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:31,579
I better go see Snail Bride.

417
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,480
Come to my house
with my part-timers later.

418
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,849
Are you talking about Ms. Kim
and Jae Hwan?

419
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:47,460
What about Yu Ri? Where is she?

420
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,970
She left with that scary man.

421
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,640
She's not coming back.

422
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,279
What did the fortune teller say?
Did you look into it?

423
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,279
I've been asking around
through my customers.

424
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,690
He didn't seem like
a low-class spirit from Korea.

425
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,619
What does that man do?

426
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,019
I think this is...

427
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:16,989
just a groundless rumor, but...

428
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,000
I hear one of the afterlife kings...

429
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,929
occasionally leaves his post.

430
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,469
How interesting.

431
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,179
Anyway, let me know as soon as
you hear about that man.

432
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,380
- Here.
- What is this?

433
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,449
What is all this?

434
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:45,289
I couldn't buy you any gifts
with what I earned all this time.

435
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,820
It bothered me.

436
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,199
You must be busy.
When did you go to buy this?

437
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,829
It's so pretty.

438
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,269
It's really nice.

439
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,400
Try it on.

440
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,869
It's too precious for me to wear.

441
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,409
Our daughter worked hard
to earn the money to buy these.

442
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,050
It's our duty to wear them.

443
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,010
Try it on.

444
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:12,920
Should I?

445
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,269
This is not the way to my place.

446
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,840
Just give me five minutes.

447
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,349
Is it good? Is it?

448
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:47,449
Yu Ri!

449
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,690
What brought you to the vet
at this hour?

450
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,630
What is this all of a sudden?

451
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm here to say goodbye.

452
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,940
We're going to break up.

453
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:12,739
- What are you talking about?
- Gu Sin Ju, I just dumped you.

454
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:16,579
From now on, don't wait for me...

455
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:17,980
or come looking for me.

456
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,050
Why? Did I do something wrong?

457
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,179
I just got sick of you.

458
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:24,489
- I tend to get sick of people.
- No.

459
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,159
You're not that type.

460
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,460
You take time to warm up,

461
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,630
but once you do,
you like them for a long time.

462
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:34,000
You act cold, but you're
soft-hearted and kind.

463
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,170
- What do you know about me?
- I know just from the way...

464
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:39,699
- you treat Mr. Lee and the dog.
- Stop acting like you're nice.

465
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,610
I don't need any friends or family.

466
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,239
I'm annoyed with your lectures.

467
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,739
You're so old-fashioned,
and you're always smiling.

468
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,280
I hate it all.

469
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:56,190
I won't lecture.

470
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:59,460
I'll buy and wear
whatever you pick for me.

471
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,260
- I'll only smile when you tell...
- Enough, already.

472
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,460
I don't like you! I don't!

473
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,929
You're lying.

474
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:16,170
Don't get clingy either.

475
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:23,250
Bye.

476
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,880
I can't break up with you.

477
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,190
- Let me go.
- No. I won't.

478
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,519
I'll only let you go
if you take back your words.

479
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,099
Sin Ju.

480
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,730
If you keep doing this,
it'll only disgust me even more.

481
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:48,570
I'm sorry.

482
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,780
Whatever it may be,
I'm sorry for everything so...

483
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:07,289
Don't follow me.

484
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:18,400
Please disappear from my life.

485
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,989
She says I'm intentionally being
too nice.

486
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:45,460
She hates my face.
She said my clothes were tacky.

487
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,630
Right.
It does sound reasonable but...

488
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,469
That ground cherry thief
is so wretched.

489
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,309
How dare she toy with you?

490
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:02,980
Don't talk badly about her.

491
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:05,250
Please.

492
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:08,820
Stop crying.

493
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:11,320
She was my first and last love.

494
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,789
I was going to propose to her too.

495
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,690
I bought two golden rings
at Jongno yesterday.

496
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:20,260
So how...

497
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,400
There must've been a reason why
she wanted to suddenly break up.

498
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:26,469
I don't know.

499
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:29,610
It was the Imoogi. He took her.

500
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,539
Mr. Lee.

501
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,880
Rang.

502
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,610
What are you doing?

503
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,750
You're awake. You're back.

504
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:43,289
Treat me like you always do.
If not, I might want to die again.

505
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,960
- How did you wake up?
- What did you say a while ago?

506
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,260
The Imoogi took her?

507
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:51,690
Yu Ri agreed to go with him
in return for waking me up.

508
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,059
Soo Ho saw everything.

509
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,659
No. I need to find her.

510
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:59,670
- Not like this.
- What if he kills her?

511
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,039
Let me go!

512
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,480
What a fool.
Do you want to die as well?

513
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,409
You wouldn't have been able to,
so I did you a favor.

514
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,750
I give you my word.

515
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,519
I'll bring her back alive.

516
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,320
I'm going to kill him.

517
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,460
Leave that up to me.

518
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,800
He tried to kill me twice.

519
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,900
By the way, where is Soo Ho?

520
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,829
Is he home alone?

521
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,440
Of course, he is.

522
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,610
How could you leave a boy
all by himself?

523
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,940
You won't be able
to drag him out of there.

524
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,300
You're all here.

525
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:06,199
There's also a face
I'm not too happy to see.

526
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,699
Who are they?

527
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,139
My part-timers.

528
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,789
- What are you looking at?
- Judging by your handsomeness,

529
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:24,090
it's obvious.

530
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,389
You're not human, are you?

531
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:27,920
Don't talk to me, or I'll bite you.

532
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,090
I knew it.

533
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,360
There are 3 humans and 2 foxes.

534
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:33,829
What about you?

535
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,699
There are 3 humans and 3 foxes.

536
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,369
I think we're all done
introducing ourselves.

537
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:41,869
Shall we begin?

538
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:44,670
I thought we were discussing
our plan, so why are you here?

539
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:46,980
Because I've dealt with the Imoogi
more than you have.

540
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,480
And you have one in you as well.

541
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,949
Leave her out of this.
What if the Imoogi eavesdrops on us?

542
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:56,650
No, we need her for this.

543
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:59,150
If you're against it, you can leave.

544
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,590
All of us have met the Imoogi
at least once.

545
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,460
He's threatened us in various ways.

546
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,829
He also has one of us hostage.

547
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,170
On top of that,
there are two of him.

548
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,909
This battle will only end
once we get both of them.

549
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,210
What's even worse is...

550
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,809
What's worse is...

551
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,179
This is the main one.

552
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,489
Hey, Imoogi's nest.

553
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:42,000
How about you save us the trouble
and just die?

554
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,929
You should've never woken up.

555
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:47,440
The Sleeping Beauty image
suited you.

556
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:53,280
Physically attacking the Imoogi
won't kill him.

557
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,639
He can also control people's minds.

558
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,780
Ji A and I are the only ones
who are immune to that.

559
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,849
It'll be quite hard, but...

560
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,650
do your best
not to confront it one-on-one.

561
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,820
How can we put up a fight
without being seen?

562
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,219
What can you do, anyway?

563
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,559
You'll only be screaming for help.

564
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,400
- That's a warning.
- "That's a warning."

565
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:16,699
So what in the world
is Terry's intention?

566
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,440
He said he's going to kill everyone.

567
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,039
After that...

568
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,210
Then a plague will go around
the world.

569
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,139
No one will dare to be happy.

570
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,909
A plague?

571
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,820
Mr. Lee, quit playing your game.

572
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,489
I'm still listening.
Just cut to the chase already.

573
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,400
Up until now,
I only fought against Terry...

574
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,730
because I was afraid
of hurting Ji A.

575
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,630
But from now on,

576
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,699
we're going to change our target.

577
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:57,940
How will you kill the Imoogi
inside of her?

578
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:00,940
Have you found a way?

579
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,679
I have.

580
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,050
(Traditional Korean Food:
Snail Bride)

581
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:18,489
(Traditional Korean Food:
Snail Bride)

582
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,800
Do you remember the fortune teller
from the folk village?

583
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,599
Of course.

584
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,139
Thanks to someone,
he took my fox marble.

585
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,039
Rumor has it that he's a big shot.
Is that true?

586
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,840
He's one of the afterlife kings.

587
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:35,639
- What?
- He also has...

588
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,679
- the Uiryeong sword.
- What?

589
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,079
No way.

590
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:41,820
What is the Uiryeong sword?

591
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,719
It pierces your sins.

592
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:45,690
It pierces your sins?

593
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,159
King Yeomra made that sword using
a branch from Uiryeong Tree,

594
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,690
which was used to weigh one's sins.

595
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:53,500
But didn't that sword disappear
thousands of years ago?

596
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,570
The Snail Bride got her hands on it
just now.

597
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,039
But wouldn't Ms. Nam get hurt too
if you start slashing her?

598
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:02,139
She won't.

599
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,369
The Uiryeong sword is wooden.

600
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,179
It only pierces through things
that aren't visible.

601
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,650
In other words, it'll only pierce
the Imoogi's soul.

602
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,610
I'm so relieved, Ji A.

603
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,719
So when's the D-Day?

604
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,530
Tomorrow.

605
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,519
How does it feel to be reborn?

606
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:53,219
Maybe it's because
I rose from the dead,

607
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:54,960
but this coffee is scrumptious.

608
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,190
Live long, you fool.

609
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:00,429
If you die early, you won't get
to have your favorite coffee.

610
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:01,530
How sad would that be?

611
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,269
Were you terrified that I'd die?

612
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:05,900
Yes, I was.

613
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:10,610
What did you order?
Let me have a sip.

614
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,710
It's good.

615
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:17,550
Why are you being so nice?

616
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,619
Because we never visited
a cafe like this before.

617
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,420
You were only an arm's reach away.

618
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,789
I wonder why it took so long.

619
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,059
Why do you sound like
you're going to die soon?

620
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,070
It really is good.

621
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,099
It really is, right?

622
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,969
Let me try yours.

623
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:43,139
No. This isn't for you.

624
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:45,039
What an ungrateful jerk.

625
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,579
Don't drink it.

626
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,019
What is that?

627
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:01,719
It's nothing.

628
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,030
Did she do that to you?

629
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,929
It's not what you think.

630
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:06,300
Seeing you trying to protect her
means I'm right.

631
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,940
Are you sure that Uiryeong sword
or whatever will work on Imoogi?

632
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,940
It's been 600 years.

633
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:21,809
I'm about to end
this never-ending fight.

634
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:23,880
And if you fail?

635
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,519
What happens to me?

636
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:33,289
Rang.

637
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,389
That's why I need you.

638
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:47,139
I struggled so hard to live
a successful life.

639
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,110
I was one step away from becoming
the ruler of this country.

640
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,170
Darn it.

641
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,710
I ended up in a tiny cell.

642
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,510
Still, I'm alive.

643
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,849
I'm alive.

644
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:38,090
(Dukki Tteokbokki)

645
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,150
This looks good.

646
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:41,590
How could you crave tteokbokki
in this situation?

647
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:44,860
Even if the world ends tomorrow,
I must eat tteokbokki.

648
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,599
Come on, scoop some more.

649
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,429
- Do you want cheese balls?
- Yes, of course.

650
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:51,099
- Can we get some cheese balls?
- Okay.

651
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,969
This is delicious.

652
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,210
- This tastes the best.
- This?

653
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,409
How could this taste so good
in this situation?

654
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:07,719
Let's see.

655
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:15,889
Don't come to see me
for the time being.

656
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,429
You may fall in danger
if you're with me.

657
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,199
I'll do what I want.

658
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,460
You guys almost died.

659
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:27,800
Do you remember?

660
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,739
When my mom came to Seoul
for her spinal disc surgery?

661
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,639
She had a show that day,

662
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,639
and cried all day long because
she couldn't go to the hospital.

663
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,510
You went to the hospital for me.

664
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,550
You stayed beside my mom.

665
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,050
If she were alone when she died,

666
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:43,989
I would've regretted it for
the rest of my life.

667
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:47,420
- Let us help you.
- She's right.

668
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:50,360
I know we don't have
any superpowers or anything,

669
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,059
but if we have to save you,
I'm willing to do anything.

670
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,969
Right now, going back to work...

671
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:03,570
is how you'll help me.

672
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:07,610
If all three of us are gone, what
do you think Mr. Choi will think?

673
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:08,880
He's not at the office.

674
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,179
What?

675
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,250
He turned himself in?

676
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,590
There's no way Imoogi would
let him live like that.

677
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:23,429
Find out what's happening
at the police station.

678
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:24,690
Okay.

679
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:28,760
The person you have reached
is not available...

680
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:31,630
Mr. Choi isn't answering his phone.

681
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:43,750
Call an ambulance now!

682
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:46,880
Is this 119?
This is the police station.

683
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,019
Wait a minute. Let me see.

684
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,320
- Open the airway.
- Okay.

685
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,679
Snail Bride, we need to move up
our plan.

686
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:28,190
(Traditional Korean Food:
Snail Bride, Closed)

687
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,280
(Traditional Korean Food:
Snail Bride)

688
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,659
(Traditional Korean Food:
Snail Bride)

689
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,570
He has started to make a move.

690
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,400
We don't have much time.

691
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:20,409
We will kill the Imoogi
inside Ji A first tonight.

692
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,579
We must not make a single mistake
from now on.

693
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,449
We're listening, so just tell us.

694
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,949
The plan is simple.

695
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,920
Ji A will make herself bleed...

696
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,389
and call out the Imoogi inside her.

697
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:38,389
When it comes out, I will kill it
with the Uiryeong sword.

698
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,059
Sin Ju, when Ji A and I go inside,

699
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:43,369
lock the door from outside.

700
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,300
No one must approach
until I send the signal.

701
00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:50,969
Why?

702
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:53,210
Because if it escapes from Ji A,

703
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,409
you might fall in danger.

704
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,250
It might possess your bodies.

705
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,880
That's why I put horse blood
around the perimeter.

706
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,690
This thing is different from
the Imoogi we're familiar with.

707
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,360
We don't know what it looks like
or how it moves.

708
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,559
We have no way of knowing.

709
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:12,989
We must not make a mistake.

710
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,900
What if it goes into your body?

711
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:19,269
That won't happen
as long as I'm awake.

712
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,599
Sin Ju.

713
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:28,039
It's a serpent.
It fits that punk perfectly.

714
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,179
So, it's best to kill it
in one strike.

715
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:35,780
And even if it runs away,

716
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,150
that's the only thing
it can go inside.

717
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,889
Let's go. I want to get rid of it
as soon as possible.

718
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,280
This is the sword.

719
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:41,179
Good work. You can go now.

720
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:44,820
I wish you good luck.

721
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:29,829
Then...

722
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,670
shall we begin?

723
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,300
Before that,

724
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:38,440
tie me to the chair with this.

725
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,039
What if I hurt you again?

726
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:43,579
There's no need for that.

727
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:46,510
Just do as I say. Okay?

728
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,590
Why do you keep trying to
protect me?

729
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,309
I have a bad feeling about this.

730
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,639
Don't say that. You'll jinx it.

731
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,269
Then I'll tie you up now.

732
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:41,199
Okay. Lee Yeon.

733
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:44,739
Can you give me a hug?

734
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,219
Don't hesitate because of me.

735
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,489
Don't be nervous.

736
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,920
It's a wooden sword
that hasn't been sharpened.

737
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,989
I'm prepared to get injured.

738
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:06,960
Why would I let you get hurt?

739
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,030
Also, this is a sword that can
only cut things you can't,

740
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,000
like Imoogi's spirit.

741
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:16,969
Then could it cut...

742
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:18,639
your spirit too?

743
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,889
Don't hesitate because of me.

744
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,389
Don't be nervous.

745
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,559
It's a wooden sword
that hasn't been sharpened.

746
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,590
I'm prepared to get injured.

747
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,559
Why would I let you get hurt?

748
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,570
Also, this is a sword that can
only cut things you can't,

749
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,670
like Imoogi's spirit.

750
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,469
Then could it cut...

751
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,309
your spirit too?

752
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,239
Of course it can.

753
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,519
- But...
- Yes?

754
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,929
Since a while ago...

755
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Who is this?

756
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,400
The one that'll disappear...

757
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,340
is your spirit.

758
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,179
- You can't.
- Move.

759
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:35,920
I'll kill that woman
if something happens to Yeon.

760
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:38,750
You can't go in.
You'll have to kill me first.

761
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,920
Do you think
I won't be able to do it?

762
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:49,829
What a fool.

763
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:54,599
Who would've thought
he'd find the Uiryeong sword?

764
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:01,480
Hey. Are you faking to sleep?

765
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:14,789
What is this?

766
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,730
Did his spirit really fly away?

767
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,650
This would have happened anyway.

768
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:28,829
I'll give you this old house,
so give me a new house.

769
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:43,309
Don't you know how expensive
houses are these days?

770
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:45,050
You're a thief for trying to get it
for so cheap.

771
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,949
- What is this?
- What do you think?

772
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,650
This is what I wanted to check.

773
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,289
You use this scale
to transfer bodies, don't you?

774
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:01,329
The fortune teller went missing
ever since the folk village.

775
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,929
They were nowhere to be found
even with clairvoyance power.

776
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:06,829
Darn it.

777
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,539
What should we do now?

778
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:13,039
You should go out right now
and get any wooden sword.

779
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:14,309
A wooden sword?

780
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:16,840
What will you do with a sword
that can't cut anything?

781
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,550
I'll try to cut something
that can't be cut.

782
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:29,719
Let's play a different game now.

783
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,369
Pull over.

784
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:47,909
Then that sword was never...

785
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,650
It's from a flea market near
Cheonggyecheon. It was 10 dollars.

786
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,880
I heard that fortune teller
only appears...

787
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,980
at places he wants,
only when he wants.

788
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,349
You're a thug.

789
01:01:58,349 --> 01:02:00,090
Look who's talking.

790
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:01,889
Why did you act like you're Ji A?

791
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:03,190
Did you know it was me?

792
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:06,590
It smelled fishy. It smelled
like blood the moment I walked in.

793
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,800
I have a good sense of smell,
you know.

794
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,800
Anyway, thanks for the donation.

795
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,570
Do you think you can turn things
around instantly with that scale?

796
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:21,809
Even if you transfer me elsewhere,
I'll come back to this woman...

797
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,349
until you surrender
and give up that body.

798
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:29,719
Do you mean I can transfer you...

799
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,320
with this?

800
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:37,159
For example, how about that snake?

801
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:40,659
Try me.

802
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,429
All right.

803
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,170
You must not think...

804
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:49,440
I'll leave this body peacefully...

805
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:52,309
when I'm being forced to transfer,
do you?

806
01:03:11,389 --> 01:03:13,860
All right. To be honest,

807
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,599
I like you better than
the other Imoogi.

808
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,630
One should be reckless like you
to call themselves a villain.

809
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,940
Why would Imoogi care about romance?

810
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:26,909
To me, this woman is just
a hostage, nothing more.

811
01:03:26,909 --> 01:03:29,239
That Imoogi is more interested
in Ji A...

812
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:30,880
than getting a body for you.

813
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:33,809
He's nothing but a crumb of my body.

814
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:35,579
I don't think he agrees with you.

815
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:38,949
Do you think I'd part ways with him
if you do this?

816
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,920
Wake up.

817
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,159
Do you have any idea
what he's been up to?

818
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:53,000
He's been...

819
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,920
Gosh. Why is everyone bothering me?

820
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,920

(Date of Death: Today)

823
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:06,139
Innocent lives are dying.

824
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,710
If we leave it the way it is,
the world will fall into chaos.

825
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,780
No, you're wrong.

826
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,650
You've always been like this
from the very beginning.

827
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,150
- Honey.
- Don't call me that.

828
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,159
I just decided...

829
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:24,130
to quit being your husband.

830
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:26,889
Don't joke. Who says?

831
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:32,199
Stop right there.

832
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,139
Can't you hear me?

833
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:37,099
The moment you step out that door,
you'll lose everything.

834
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,739
I'll make that happen!

835
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,309
Hey, are you okay?

836
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:29,860
Yeon.

837
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:33,260
Yes, it's me.

838
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:37,500
Let's hurry.

839
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:40,000
I want to be myself...

840
01:06:41,139 --> 01:06:43,039
when I take my last breath.

841
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:50,380
I want to be by your side.

842
01:06:58,449 --> 01:06:59,590
Let's put an end...

843
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:02,989
to this tenacious fight.

844
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:05,659
Let's end it.

(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

850
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:52,610
Give me three days.

851
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,880
I can catch him.
I can get rid of the Imoogi!

852
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:56,239
It's too late.

853
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,550
You will regret this.

854
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:00,449
Had it not been for me,

855
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,449
Yeon would've still been
a mountain spirit.

856
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,619
Yeon will never forgive me.

857
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,320
For the first time,
I might regret liking you.

858
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,429
I could destroy everything
that you cherish.

859
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,829
Let's get rid
of the owner of the Styx.

860
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,329
What's your condition?

861
01:08:18,699 --> 01:08:19,869
Let Ji A go.
