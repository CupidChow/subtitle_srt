Wear them and look in the mirror.

10
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,859
The answer to your curiosity
lies there.

11
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,579
There are times when we need rain.

12
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,349
For nature, for the farmers,

13
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,189
and for us.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

15
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,770
I guess our times run...

16
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,370
at different speeds.

17
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,319
You still look like how you did
when I first met you.

18
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,750
Are you afraid...

19
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,629
of the phases in life
you must face as a human?

20
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,659
I'm afraid.

21
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,569
I'm not afraid of growing old,
getting sick, and dying,

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
but you'll have to get through...

23
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,469
many days and nights without me.

24
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,169
I'm afraid of that.

25
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,620
I try to stop time,
but it won't stay for me.

26
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,979
There, I stopped time.

27
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,680
I'll live well even without you.

28
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,310
You're so cold-hearted.

29
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,419
That's why you should get rid
of that bow and live a long life.

30
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:11,060
Let your hair turn grey
and your back bend...

31
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,789
so I fall out of love with you
before you leave.

32
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:16,290
Promise me you won't change
even then.

33
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,730
If I ever betray you...

34
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,370
What then?

35
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:26,139
Shoot me.

36
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,259
My lady.

37
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,920
Lady Ah Eum.

38
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,930
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

39
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,160
Do I have to report to you
when I'm going to the outhouse?

40
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,399
How vulgar.

41
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,199
A message came from the palace.
You need to move in right away.

42
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,139
- What?
- Let's get you changed first.

43
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,339
Who would dare to order...

44
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,509
the daughter the King kicked out
to move back in?

45
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,439
It's the King's order.

46
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,620
Did you just say
it's the King's order?

47
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,449
Let's go without further delay.

48
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,959
His Highness is in a critical state.

49
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,350
You have grown a lot.

50
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,259
You have grown very weak.

51
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,199
How was life outside the palace?

52
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,529
My eyes stung.

53
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,269
Your eyes...

54
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,839
stung?

55
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,639
The streets were filled with smoke.

56
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,250
At first, I thought it was coming
from the fire of making food,

57
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,050
but I was wrong.

58
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:20,149
The smoke was from the fire
they used to burn starved mouths.

59
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,750
I am talking about your people.

60
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,259
The country...

61
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,230
is in disorder.

62
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,959
I thought the country
was in disorder,

63
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,500
but I was wrong about that too.

64
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,300
It is the king's mind
that is in disorder.

65
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,439
Because something wicked...

66
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,779
has possessed his body.

67
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,730
I should have finished you off
when I had the chance.

68
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,500
You must be Imoogi.

69
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,029
You are still the only one
who can recognize me...

70
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,769
in this huge palace.

71
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:16,939
Come out.

72
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:20,910
I said, leave that body!

73
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,980
Oh, how about you screaming
and calling everyone out again?

74
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,660
Try and shoot.
This body will die anyway.

75
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,129
It would not be a bad idea...

76
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:45,639
to have your foolish father die
in the hands of his daughter.

77
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,139
Stop pulling your tricks!

78
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,939
Why do you think
you were kicked out?

79
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:53,779
Because...

80
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,350
you possessed my father's body...

81
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,449
and took control...

82
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,350
This was your father's decision.

83
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,389
What?

84
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,819
You were a sacrifice given to me...

85
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,889
from the day you were born.

86
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,860
Your father offered...

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,300
this body to me
in order to save you.

88
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,180
Bring the mountain spirit to me.

89
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,449
If you do, I'll let your father go.

90
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,490
As long as I possess his body,

91
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,820
he won't live longer
than three days.

92
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,779
Fine.

93
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,580
I will bring Lee Yeon to you.

94
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,049
However,

95
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,120
the mountain spirit
belongs to his mountain...

96
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,389
and cannot leave it.

97
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,299
- What did you say?
- Let father go...

98
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,629
and come with me.

99
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,899
You may...

100
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,309
have my body.

101
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,019
First, I'll take him out
of the palace.

102
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,019
As for what'll happen afterward,
I'll trust Yeon.

103
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,500
This woman means nothing to me.

104
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,409
- That is absurd.
- Do you think you've used her...

105
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:05,740
as bait to get to me?

106
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,850
Did you not think that I could've
used her as bait to get you?

107
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,129
Help me!

108
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,460
I do not want to die.

109
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,370
You promised...

110
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,700
that you'd never change.

111
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,480
- Lee Yeon.
- Get out of there!

112
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,600
Did you see it?

113
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,570
Answer me. Did you?

114
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:22,710
Look at me, please.

115
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:29,919
What did you see?

116
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,759
I...

117
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,190
was murdered in my previous life.

118
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:42,870
You...

119
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,200
killed me.

120
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,870
From the beginning,

121
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,710
you were only determined
to kill the Imoogi.

122
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,679
Lee Yeon.

123
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,220
I was only...

124
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,159
a sacrifice to you.

125
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,059
Is that really...

126
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,029
who you are?

127
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,639
It is.

128
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,500
The reason you saved me
numerous times...

129
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,440
The reason you couldn't forget
your first love...

130
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,840
for hundreds of years...

131
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,210
You're right.

132
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,480
I killed you.

133
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,590
I killed you with my own hands.

134
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,129
Why?

135
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,299
Are you willing to undergo
that tragedy once again?

136
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,929
One of you...

137
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,899
will die.

138
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,649
That's who I am.

139
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,950
Is that all you can say?

140
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,860
After making me fall for you,

141
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,259
that's all that you can say?

142
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,200
At least come up with an excuse!

143
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:23,669
Please...

144
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:31,480
You were just cost-effective.

145
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:36,450
By sacrificing you,
I was able to save countless lives.

146
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,080
After all, I'm a mountain spirit.

147
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,289
Why am I...

148
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,259
so heartbroken?

149
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:56,600
Why was I worrying about you
until the very moment I died?

150
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,669
Why...

151
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,539
am I crying because of you?

152
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,080
Don't be mistaken.

153
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,820
The emotions you're feeling
right now aren't yours.

154
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,360
You just saw a glimpse
of your previous life.

155
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,759
Don't act like you were her.

156
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,860
You're a scumbag.

157
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,070
You're right, so don't fall
for this scumbag.

158
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,740
Don't make the same mistake
this time around.

159
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,870
Only then will you live
for a long time.

When will that punk grow up?

What do you say?
Should I open a single malt whiskey?

166

Don't bring any alcohol.

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,230
She did. What did she say?

170
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,339
Tell me, already. I won't be able
to sleep in peace tonight.

171
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Rang.

172
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,339
What?

173
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,950
If you can, what do you want
to reincarnate as?

174
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,180
What nonsense are you spewing?

175
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,220
Tell me.

176
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,160
I don't really care.

177
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,059
But if I must pick, a Dokdo shrimp.

178
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,890
I like how they look good
in whiskers, a mustache,

179
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,559
and they're sophisticated.

180
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:41,799
If I am reincarnated,

181
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,440
I would like to live
as a human for once.

182
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:47,670
What a pathetic wish you have.

183
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,240
I wish my life is full
of beginnings and ends.

184
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,480
The first time I walk,
my first picnic,

185
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:01,420
and my first love.

186
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,420
What are you blabbering about?

187
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,460
It's just...

188
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:08,160
I can't remember when we had
an honest talk like this.

189
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:09,460
Are you feeling ill or what?

190
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:12,359
Did you lose your mind
after fighting with her?

191
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,430
Imoogi.

192
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,839
Where is it?

193
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,339
Do you think I'll tell you?

194
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,769
I thought so.

195
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,339
I see that's your choice.

196
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,630
(Preparing for business)

197
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
How about a game?

198
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,140
We used to play often.

199
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,309
It's boring playing with you.

200
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,140
You never beat me.

201
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,150
Are you going to play or not?

202
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,130
I got you!

203
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,099
Yeon, why is the sky blue?

204
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,240
I don't know. I'm not the one
who colored it.

205
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,869
Then why do owls go " hoot-hoot"?

206
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:33,339
I don't know. I'm not the one
that makes them cry.

207
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,180
Why do azalea flowers taste sweet?

208
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,519
Why do flowers bloom in spring?

209
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:39,650
Shut up.

210
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,319
Why are you hitting me?

211
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,319
Why do you have so many questions
for a little kid?

212
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,119
It's just... I just like hearing
your voice.

213
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,519
You're rushing too much.

214
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,359
I told you to get rid of your tail.

215
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,470
I told you not to think too much.

216
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,440
I won!

217
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,869
- Darn it.
- I won again!

218
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:40,009
How frustrating.

219
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,950
You're pretty good, little man.

220
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,519
I'm not little.

221
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,500
How will he fly it running so slow?

222
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,470
I did it! Yes!

223
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,750
It's so hard to raise a child.

224
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,819
You're too slow. Again.

225
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,630
Doesn't it feel strange?

226
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,970
How did you always beat me
when you were this pathetic?

227
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,000
Shut your mouth.

228
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,180
I was letting you win.

229
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,910
There were no exceptions.

230
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,390
I told you to shut your mouth.

231
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,289
I have no intention
of letting you win anymore.

232
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,660
I called you to say this.

233
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:10,930
Hey, stop.

234
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:15,839
If you leave like this,
it's really over between us.

235
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,049
Sorry?

237
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,559
What are you sorry about?

238
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,519
For...

239
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,630
saving you when you were abandoned
by your human mother.

240
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,259
Then at least...

241
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,769
we wouldn't have met as brothers.

242
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,960
Mom?

243
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,839
Go away! Let go!

244
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:23,369
No!

245
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,019
Mom. Mom...

246
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,190
Mom.

247
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,230
Mom.

248
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,700
Are you that thing?

249
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,569
The thing my father had
with a human woman?

250
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,700
Are you a fox too?

251
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,609
I heard you shared my father's blood
and came to see you.

252
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:33,380
I'm disappointed.

253
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,279
You don't even have the willpower
to live.

254
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,079
I came for nothing. I better leave.

255
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,750
Over there. It's still alive.

256
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,619
It's a starving ghost.
It never dies.

257
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:49,829
The resent of those who died
from hunger...

258
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,630
is worse than you think.

259
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:56,099
But I like that thing better
than someone who gives up easily.

260
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,009
I don't care if you live
as a human or a fox,

261
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,880
but always remember this, kid.

262
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:10,809
There's no salvation for someone
who doesn't save himself.

263
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,369
Take me with you.

264
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,539
Let me go with you, big brother.

265
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,759
I'll wait for you here.

266
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,099
Here? All day long?

267
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,970
I'm used to waiting,
more than anything else.

268
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,339
24 hours is nothing.
I could sit here for 24 years.

269
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,369
Gosh.
You'll end up living longer than me.

270
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,079
Do you want one? You look pale.

271
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,079
I'll pass for today.

272
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:05,880
A human's soul leaves a bad stench
whenever you consume it.

273
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,420
I can't sleep well since I absorb
their unnecessary memories too.

274
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:13,519
But it's thanks to borrowing their
lifespans that I'm still alive.

275
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,690
Both me and you.

276
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,700
Why ground cherries of all things?
They look disgusting.

277
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,869
I heard they look the most similar
to the shape of souls.

278
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:26,039
Is Imoogi home?

279
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,900
Let me see his face.

280
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,240
Right now is not a good time.

281
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:38,109
He didn't have to do a thing
until now.

282
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,150
It's only right for him to say hello
and repay my kindness.

283
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,119
If not, he'd be a mere gold-digger.

284
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,190
- You can talk with me.
- I don't want to.

285
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,359
I'm just afraid my important guest
might get hurt.

286
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,660
What?

287
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,269
I played along until now,

288
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,309
but I'm no puppet.

289
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,079
Did you just smile?

290
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,250
You should let him go.

291
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,869
Are you Imoogi?

292
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,009
Nice to meet you.
I wanted to see you too.

293
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,420
What are you doing here?

294
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,519
You wouldn't answer
my texts or calls.

295
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,589
I have something to discuss with you
regarding the dog you brought me.

296
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,529
Did he die?

297
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,160
No.

298
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,099
About him...

299
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:07,599
He doesn't have a name.

300
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,769
Just pick anything.

301
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,640
I can't.
A name is like his identity.

302
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,109
Then you can pick one out carefully.

303
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,180
But you're the mother.

304
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,549
"The mother"?

305
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,460
I'm the mom?

306
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,390
Let's go with Anastasia.

307
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,490
"Anastasia"?

308
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,059
That's a pretty name.

309
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,099
It suits him although he's a male.

310
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:37,670
Of course.

311
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,609
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

312
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,910
You're really the kind of person
I thought you were.

313
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:51,349
If you ever look at me
with those eyes again,

314
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,579
you won't ever get to see again.

315
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
I don't care how you lived.

316
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,160
I also don't care
why you approached me.

317
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,329
I'll show you.

318
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,730
How the world
isn't just full of spite.

319
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,339
I'll make sure you regret
what you just said.

320
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:14,299
I'll look forward to it.

321
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:17,140
What?

322
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:21,180
What? I'm going to kill you!

323
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,349
See you later.

324
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,759
I thought you'd still be a child.

325
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,059
I guess you ate a lot.

326
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,029
Can you give us some privacy?

327
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:42,900
- Would that be...
- It's fine.

328
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:52,440
Why are you so sad?

329
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,380
- What?
- You were heartbroken. Severely.

330
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:58,650
Stop it.

331
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,720
Was it your big brother?

332
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,720
I can see...

333
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,329
that there's an underworld
in your heart.

334
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,329
You're more annoying than I thought.

335
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,970
Don't you think we're similar?

336
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:19,839
I personally loathe the kinds
that shed their skin.

337
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:24,170
Listen carefully.

338
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,109
I'm going to go at my pace
no matter what your goal is.

339
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,779
I can't wait for you any longer.

340
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,279
You want to kill that woman,
don't you?

341
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,319
That'll be difficult.

342
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,960
Why is that?

343
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:43,359
She was originally an offering
given to me.

344
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,329
She'll become my bride.

345
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,900
Congratulations on your promotion.

346
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,910
Thank you, thank you.

347
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,710
- Are you crazy?
- That's what I mean.

348
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,250
Ms. Nam, our senior manager
became a general manager.

349
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,880
How can he get a promotion
when he didn't do anything?

350
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,150
Just say so if you're jealous.

351
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,849
I guess the higher-ups don't know
that you spend...

352
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,690
most of your office hours
on self-development.

353
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,030
At the billiard, the gym,
the karaoke...

354
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,900
I only went to karaoke once
on the day I got my divorce.

355
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,329
- He sang "She's Gone".
- Hey!

356
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,800
Who wants cake?

357
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,150
Why are you feeling down?

358
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,420
- I'm not.
- Don't lie.

359
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,289
We worked together for too long
to not notice.

360
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,349
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

361
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,119
You should make up with him.

362
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,690
You won't be able to date
another man if you two break up.

363
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,699
Gosh. Wake up.

364
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:56,099
Aside from the fact that
you're young, he's the better catch.

365
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,530
That's not true.

366
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:00,300
What did she do to you
for you to put her down?

367
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,239
It's the truth.
I'm just telling her the truth.

368
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,139
If anyone's going to put her down,
it'll be us.

369
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,980
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

370
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,579
You deserve it after
going around with your nose up high.

371
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,219
- Did you get a new story?
- Yes.

372
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,150
Just now.

373
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,119
What is it about?

374
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,829
Previous lives.

375
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:41,579
Should I give you a hug?

376
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,679
- Go away.
- I'm glad.

377
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,320
You're still your normal self.

378
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:53,260
I made some fried tofu rice balls.

379
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,590
You didn't eat or sleep, right?

380
00:35:58,659 --> 00:35:59,730
Forget it.

381
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:03,929
Just one. It's sour and sweet.
It's really delicious.

382
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:05,369
I'm not a kindergartener.

383
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,039
My goodness!

384
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,179
- Hey.
- Eat it.

385
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,750
You must eat to protect her
and to fight.

386
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,760
By the way, why didn't you tell her?

387
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,789
That it's a misunderstanding.
You could've told her...

388
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:33,059
what she saw wasn't everything.

389
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,400
All of it is starting again.

390
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,739
If the past repeats itself,

391
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,909
that's more of a reason for me
to remain as a bad guy to Ji A.

392
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,110
You're afraid...

393
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,619
that she'd sacrifice herself
to save you.

394
00:36:58,019 --> 00:36:59,159
Just like Lady Ah Eum did.

395
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,360
Are you sure you won't regret this?

396
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,130
No.

397
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,099
And yet, you're going to protect her
from afar?

398
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,039
- Yes.
- After waiting all those years?

399
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,579
Yes.

400
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,840
Is that really the truth?

401
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:24,610
It's my resolution.

402
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,260
Keep an eye on her.

403
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,329
The fried tofu rice balls
were tasty.

404
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,070
Let me tag along.

405
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:55,079
It's okay. I know the doctor.

406
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,010
- What about lunch?
- Eat first without me.

407
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,730
Sir!

408
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:19,900
Sir.

409
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,710
Why are you ignoring me?

410
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,909
Because I don't want to say hi.

411
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,239
I've been waiting for you.

412
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,349
Why would you?

413
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:35,349
I thought long and hard
about what I want to become.

414
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,719
When I was six,
I wanted to become a triceratops.

415
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,789
But when I turned seven,

416
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,800
internet cafe owners looked so cool.

417
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:50,269
But then, when I was eight...

418
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,599
Cut to the chase.

419
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,440
I'm going to become like you
when I grow up.

420
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:57,710
You're handsome and brave.

421
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,309
And you have superpowers!

422
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:02,909
You and I have
completely different roots.

423
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,849
- Why?
- I like to give punches.

424
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:11,219
Judging by your face,
you must've been beaten up.

425
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:14,260
At school? Or at home?

426
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,590
It's not like that.

427
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,429
I don't care if you land punches
or get hit.

428
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,829
But someone said that
there's no salvation for someone...

429
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:27,840
who doesn't save himself.

430
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,519
I heard they were half-brothers,

431
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,250
but I guess
there's more to the story.

432
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,460
I was moved.

433
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,960
His wounded spirit
smelled so fragrant.

434
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,929
Should we do an experiment?

435
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,469
Whether he's another Achilles' heel
for Lee Yeon?

436
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:00,739
How?

437
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:04,639
A guest will be here.

438
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,210
Goodness. Let me.

439
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,480
Come on, take them.

440
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:14,050
- Here.
- Thank you.

441
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,989
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

442
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:17,889
What is this?

443
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,590
The plum smells wonderful.

444
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:25,630
They're organic plums from Hadong.

445
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,559
Hadong. No wonder.

446
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,500
I once went there to cover...

447
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,130
the Japanese apricot flower
festival.

448
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,099
- Back then, it was...
- Ma'am.

449
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:36,909
The flowers were falling down,

450
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,510
and...

451
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:41,480
I'll take you there one day.

452
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,349
All right. Goodness.

453
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,449
What? What is it?

454
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:51,719
You've never covered
a festival like that before.

455
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,199
Why are you here?

456
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:02,800
Isn't it obvious? To eat.

457
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,170
I already know
how good of a cook you are.

458
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,639
Leave.

459
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,679
I may give my leftover food
to the mice,

460
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,579
but I have nothing for you.

461
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,980
Look at this wench.

462
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,849
After centuries of being a widow,

463
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,989
have you lost the sense of fear?

464
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,590
Or...

465
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:28,590
do you not remember me at all?

466
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,329
How could I forget you?

467
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,170
Thanks to you,
I lost my only husband.

468
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,170
Goodness, Snail Bride.

469
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:44,340
Have you still not forgotten
about that foolish farmer?

470
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,980
Why did you do it?

471
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,349
Everyone has a painful past...

472
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,219
that they bury in their heart.

473
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:59,690
I just did my job and dug up
your husband's traumatic past.

474
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,320
He was the one
who couldn't recover from it,

475
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,230
so you should blame
his lack of mind power instead.

476
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,929
Why? Why did it have to be him?

477
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:11,369
To be more exact,

478
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:13,739
you should ask why it had to be you.

479
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,409
What?

480
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:17,809
You see,

481
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,110
I hate people like you.

482
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,980
Famous characters
from traditional fairy tales.

483
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,420
On the other hand,
no one even remembers me.

484
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:33,090
Are you okay?

485
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:42,099
Do you need help?

486
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:45,699
- Don't worry about me.
- How could I not?

487
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,239
Hey, lady.

488
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,670
If you don't like the service here,
go to another restaurant.

489
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,179
You could appear on the news
for being an obnoxious customer!

490
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,349
What is your biggest fear?

491
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:03,289
Pardon?

492
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:08,059
You can't ride planes.

493
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,190
What is this?

494
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:16,070
Hold on. Why are you here?

495
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:19,400
Get out this instant.

496
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,579
I'll see you next time.

497
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:45,960
Is she a shaman?

498
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,769
Does my face scream aviophobia?

499
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:03,550
(Cheonhwa Rice Wine)

500
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,449
Today is
your son's death anniversary, right?

501
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,050
You remembered.

502
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,260
Where's Granny?

503
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,190
She probably locked herself
somewhere...

504
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,929
and is throwing a fit.

505
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,670
Your son's death...

506
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,110
carved permanent scars
in your hearts.

507
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,170
That is why...

508
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:35,210
she's so strict with you.

509
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:40,780
Yes, she used to tell me this
all the time.

510
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,449
"Love..."

511
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:46,719
"is like sand. It's intangible."

512
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,530
"And yet,
you guys risk your lives for it."

513
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,559
Because if you willingly sacrifice
yourself,

514
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,769
you won't be able to reincarnate.

515
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:01,070
Just like our Bok Gil.

516
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:29,230
I would like to ask you for a favor.

517
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:37,239
I'm going to do whatever it takes...

518
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,480
to save both her and me.

519
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,269
I'm sorry, Mother.

520
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:07,800
If you're sorry,
why did you die in the first place?

521
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,460
- How have you been?
- Great, of course.

522
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,460
You really did quit drinking.

523
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,360
Your complexion looks much better.

524
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:12,400
Hey, I just wish my son
would be interested in me...

525
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,769
as much as you do.

526
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:18,039
So, what kind of story
are you digging into this time?

527
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,309
"Is this really our first life?"

528
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:25,510
Our previous lives.

529
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:27,849
"Previous lives"?

530
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,719
I'm thinking of doing a case study.

531
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,989
I heard there are many children
who claim to remember...

532
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:34,820
their previous lives
all over the world.

533
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,929
Well, it's just what they say.

534
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,829
I don't know if it's true, but...

535
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,380
("Boy Who Remembers His
Previous Life Solves a Murder Case")

536

"A Syrian boy who remembers
his previous life"?

537
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,349
It's a case of a boy that claimed
how he was...

538
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:03,320
a man named Muhammad in his
previous life since he was four.

539
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:05,550
In a city he had never
been to before,

540
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,159
he found the house he lived in
during his previous life,

541
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:11,690
and even pointed out his neighbor
as the murderer that killed him.

542
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,630
It's interesting.

543
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,900
Can I borrow this?

544
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,210
But...

545
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,179
why are you curious about
previous lives?

546
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,250
Well, it's just so hard to think of
new subjects nowadays.

547
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,119
Why?

548
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,650
She sat there and asked me
the same thing.

549
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:41,119
- Who?
- Your mom.

550
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,989
What?

551
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:48,159
I gathered those materials
with your mom.

552
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:53,840
My mom is a surgeon.
Why did she want to know this?

553
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:59,070
You really don't remember anything?

554
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,340
Remember what?

555
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:04,079
When you were nine,

556
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:06,110
your mom asked me...

557
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,920
to do hypnotherapy on you.

558
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,429
Do you believe in previous lives?

559
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,730
Yes, I do.

560
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,929
Why?

561
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:24,000
The thing called "deja vu".

562
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:28,400
You know, when a stranger feels like
someone I know,

563
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:32,110
or when an unfamiliar place oddly
feels familiar like my home.

564
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,539
You felt something like that before?

565
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:34,980
When I went backpacking
across Paris.

566
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,650
- At the Palace of Versailles.
- Come on.

567
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,309
What about you?

568
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,179
Regardless of whether
I believe it or not,

569
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,190
I wish there's no such thing
as reincarnation.

570
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,849
- Why?
- We're struggling so much already.

571
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,690
What if I'm born as a mosquito
in my next life?

572
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,030
Then I'll be born
as a mosquito repellent.

573
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,630
Don't get obsessed with me
just because I held your hand.

Slowly, very slowly.

It was the grave
for patients of a plague,

and the dead and the living
were tangled up with each other...

all of our livestock died!

00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:48,230
You should have...

660
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,400
never been born.

661
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,010
I tried everything I could...

662
00:58:57,809 --> 00:58:59,210
to miscarry you.

663
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:01,710
I tried drinking tea
made out of poisonous plants,

664
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,980
rolled down a hill,

665
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:08,380
and even struck my belly
on a boulder.

666
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:13,320
But your beast-like life
was so tenacious.

667
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:17,260
How could you survive through
a beating by young men too?

668
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,460
You're...

669
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,269
a monster, my child.

670
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,610
Let's go. Let's go together.

671
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:39,210
Don't touch me!

672
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:57,530
Is this not a dream?

673
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:15,650
Don't tell me... Is this
the Forest of Starving Ghosts?

674
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:19,550
It's a starving ghost.

675
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,170
I won't die no matter what.

676
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:34,469
Because this was the time when...

677
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,670
I'm sorry. For saving you...

678
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:40,039
when you were abandoned
by your human mother.

679
01:00:40,809 --> 01:00:41,840
Yeon...

680
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,949
won't come to rescue me anymore.

681
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:13,639
I need you,

682
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,909
Yeon.

683
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:18,349
(I need you, Yeon...)

684
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:24,989
Miss. Have some of this.

685
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:26,750
This one's on me.

686
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,460
Okay.

687
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:31,590
Did the person in charge
of our company change?

688
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,929
I've never seen you before.

689
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,900
We have a special event today.

690
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,829
"An event"?

691
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:41,400
You'll find out soon.

692
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,610
Miss, what is your biggest fear?

693
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,880
I guess it must be Yeou Gogae.

694
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,159
Ma'am.

695
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:30,150
It's your birthday present.

696
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,360
(Yeou Gogae)

697
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,900
"Yeou Gogae"?

698
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:16,329
Forest of Starving Ghosts
of all places, right?

699
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,409
You...

700
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,710
I'll offer you
my condolences in advance.

701
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,239
This would be the final stage
if this was a game.

702
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,610
Was it your doing?

703
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:36,349
For your information,
you'll really die...

704
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:37,820
if you die here.

705
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:39,119
I'll rip you apart.

706
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,090
Should I tell you something
more interesting?

707
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:45,760
I'm going to tell this news
to your brother right now.

708
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:49,960
Don't get so excited.

709
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:53,369
Your brother's girlfriend is also
in a similar situation.

710
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:12,190
Dad.

711
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,789
Dad, can't you hear me?
I said, stop the car.

712
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,630
Mom.

713
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,829
Dad, stop the car.

714
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,130
Dad, stop the car!

715
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:43,650
Say that again.

716
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:47,860
Here are two doors.

717
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:51,789
One leads you to your brother,
and the other to your girlfriend.

718
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:54,860
Which one will you choose?

719
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,460
I choose number three.

720
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,329
I want to break your neck.

721
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:00,599
Go ahead and try.

722
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,110
If you break the rules, the two
won't ever get to escape.

723
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,440
Did Imoogi send you?

724
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:12,210
I'll just say we're partners.

725
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:15,780
Lady.

726
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,619
You just wait.

727
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:21,360
I'll make sure to pay you back
what I owe.

728
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:22,889
You better hurry.

729
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,460
Neither of them has much time.

730
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:08,269
Mom! Dad! Stop the car!

731
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:11,610
Stop the car! I said, stop it!

732
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,800
Mom!

733
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:31,989
I knew it. He only cares about her.

734
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,760
Hey, kid!

735
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,900
Yeon?

736
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,840
I just heard you badmouthing me.

737
01:07:53,539 --> 01:07:54,579
Move.

738
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:57,880
I don't think this is the time
to play hard to get.

739
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:35,720
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

740
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,949
Will I be able to save both of them
from this Underworld?

741
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:43,189
I'm pretty sure I was at work
until a minute ago.

742
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,090
Don't be terrified. Think.
What do you fear the most?

743
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,560
Being abandoned.

744
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:50,800
- I...
- No!

745
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,369
never abandoned you.

746
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,170
Yeon knew...

747
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,100
what he was up against.

748
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:00,010
I'm not alone. I believe in Yeon.

749
01:09:00,409 --> 01:09:03,439
I truly hope
I've made the right decision.
