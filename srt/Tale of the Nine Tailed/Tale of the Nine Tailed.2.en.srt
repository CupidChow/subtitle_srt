(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

8
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,729
This was during my prime days.

9
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:09,739
I was the master of Baekdudaegan...

10
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,409
and a mountain spirit who controlled
the wind and the rain.

11
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,920
I'm not like those lowly foxes
in the Korean ghost stories,

12
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,650
I was a nine-tailed fox.

13
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,799
Do you want to die?

14
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,670
How strange.

15
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,239
Our shaggy dog loves it
whenever I pet him like this.

16
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,739
Watch it. Who do you think I am?

17
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:44,640
You're a fox, right? I'm Ah Eum.

18
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,650
If I could fix up my past just once,

19
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,549
I'd go back to this time
without a moment of hesitation.

20
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,250
So that the child
would never find me.

21
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,420
Lee Yeon.

22
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,090
Don't you ever lose your way?
How can you come here every day?

23
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,909
Here.

24
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,180
Some people say...

25
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,120
it was a scandal
unheard of at Baekdudaegan.

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,719
How can a mountain spirit
give his heart to a human?

27
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,419
If it happened now,
I would be called to a hearing,

28
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,620
but I didn't mind.

29
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,300
I liked having her in my forest.

30
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,819
As you might have predicted,

31
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,159
this love story ends tragically.

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,500
Someone stole her life.

33
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,419
Once she crosses the Styx,
I would never see her again.

34
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,229
I couldn't hold onto her,
or let her go.

35
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,740
So I decided to abuse
my governmental authority.

36
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,199
How dare you!

37
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,300
Be born again.

38
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,899
I'll...

39
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,740
make sure to find you.

40
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,310
I met her lookalikes several times.

41
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,819
Excuse me.

42
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,290
What is it?

43
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,089
But none of them had
the fox marble I gave her.

44
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,560
Pardon me.

45
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,100
Are you Ah Eum?

46
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,379
You're not Ah Eum.

47
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,610
Forget everything you saw today.

48
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,920
If you don't...

49
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,089
I'll kill you.

50
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:32,889
I've been waiting for you.

51
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,129
Maybe I should've
just killed her then.

52
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,310
(Episode 2:
I've Been Waiting for You)

53
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,259
Do you want to die?

54
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,060
Would I be drinking a flower tea
if I was scared to die?

55
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,300
Do you want some?

56
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,509
After making such dramatic trouble,

57
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,579
your next move is having some tea?

58
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,910
When a man and a woman
get physically close like that,

59
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,679
they drink tea
and have meals together.

60
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,789
People don't like pure
and noble characters anymore.

61
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,620
Whether people like it or not,

62
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,389
since you're the one who wants
something out of this,

63
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:44,830
you should give up on your pride
or dignity and show good manners.

64
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,600
Let's hear the full story to see
who should show good manners.

65
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:52,970
But if I don't change my mind,

66
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,070
you'll have to pay a cost
for testing me.

67
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,580
A cost?

68
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,080
Your eyes.

69
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,620
I'll take away the eyes
that saw what they shouldn't have.

70
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,789
Deal.

71
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,399
(Eunha Funeral Hall)

72
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,309
Do you want everyone to know
that you're a fox?

73
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:30,809
- Sorry?
- Your tail.

74
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,509
My gosh!

75
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,750
I'm sorry.

76
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,220
Aren't you Director Ki Yu Ri
of Moze?

77
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,259
Oh, you're right.

78
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,059
I'm here to visit the bereaved
families of the bus incident.

79
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,029
How could someone like you
come all the way here?

80
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
This... This way, ma'am.

81
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,370
(Eunha Funeral Hall)

82
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,539
Mr. Lee, how much should
a conglomerate daughter give...

83
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:01,769
for the condolence money?

84
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,039
Think of why are we here.

85
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,909
Because you killed them.

86
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,649
We're here to watch
how miserable they are.

87
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:15,190
Shouldn't you pay the right amount
for such a good sight?

88
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,860
Then I want to pay this much
and watch them all night long.

89
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,669
You look the same as 21 years ago.

90
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,179
I doubt you want to know
how I stay young.

91
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,309
- What are you?
- A nine-tailed fox.

92
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:45,519
You're a fox in the body of a human.

93
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,649
What kind of boring reaction
is that?

94
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,320
If you're a human,

95
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,759
- you should at least scream.
- No.

96
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,629
I knew...

97
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,230
that beings like you would exist.

98
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,000
I dedicated my life
in directing ghost stories...

99
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,230
so that I could catch one of you.

100
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,870
We'll find out which one of us
has been caught...

101
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:11,980
at the end of your story.

102
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,220
What happened 21 years ago
on the day we met...

103
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,889
at Yeou Gogae?

104
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,629
I smelled blood
and saved a little girl.

105
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,269
But now, that little girl
is being hostile...

106
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,600
toward her savior.

107
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,100
You had saved me?

108
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,309
Why?

109
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,240
You looked like someone I knew.

110
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,409
But then again, I was mistaken.

111
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,950
What about my parents?

112
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,419
- They're probably dead.
- Their bodies were missing.

113
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,090
You're the only lead that I have.

114
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,860
So please...

115
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,200
So you lost your parents.

116
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,269
I'm sorry to say this,
but I have no interest...

117
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,899
in your childhood memories.

118
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:18,139
I'm sorry to say this,

119
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,009
but you'd be in a pickle
if the world finds out about you.

120
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,620
If things go as planned,

121
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,350
this will be aired
next Wednesday evening.

122
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,190
And your handsome face
won't be blurred out.

123
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:36,529
You didn't forget to hold tightly
to that USB even while falling.

124
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,360
What are you trying to do?

125
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:41,700
I can't beat you physically.

126
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,169
And you don't seem
too law-abiding either.

127
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,570
But I'm desperate.

128
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,879
I'm pretty old-fashioned.

129
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,240
For your information,
only the powerful can make threats.

130
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,009
Like this.

131
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:28,450
You're wrong.

132
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,820
I wasn't threatening you.
I was just taking my chances.

133
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,360
Doesn't a fox always repay...

134
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,230
- one's kindness?
- Darn it.

135
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,669
I don't care what you are.

136
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,269
I'll erase everything
that I've seen and heard.

137
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,409
But only after I find my parents.

138
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,820
(Rest in Peace)

139
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,850
You must be devastated.

140
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,259
This way, please.

141
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,730
(Rest in Peace)

142
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,419
Why are you here?

143
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,090
- Who are you again?
- Moze Department Store.

144
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,559
Don't you remember?

145
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,559
Oh, right.

146
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,700
(Fountain of Luck:
Your wish will be fulfilled.)

147
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,210
I'm sorry.

148
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,509
It's all right.

149
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,250
Thank you.

150
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,070
Thank you.

151
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,740
- What did you wish for?
- What about you?

152
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,840
I have an older brother.

153
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,840
I wished that he'd spend...

154
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:41,679
the rest of his life
feeling miserable.

155
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:44,350
He's really a scumbag.

156
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,980
I thought not seeing him
would make things better,

157
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,090
but it didn't.
I can't sleep at night.

158
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,159
So I'm going
to continue pestering him...

159
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,690
until one of us dies.

160
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,360
What was your wish?

161
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,799
I wished that my girlfriend and I
would get married.

162
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,000
That's a very humble wish.

163
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,039
My parents
are vehemently against it.

164
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,240
Oh, my. Do you want my help?

165
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,179
Who are you to be able to help me?

166
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,350
A miracle, if you will.

167
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,429
Anyway, congratulations
on your marriage.

168
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,559
You no longer have any parents
who are against it.

169
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,700
Did you do it?

170
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,000
- Did you harm my...
- No way.

171
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:39,940
That's quite an imagination
you got there.

172
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,309
Then what about those coins
you tossed?

173
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,509
I guess it was Lady Luck.

174
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,309
She was on both of our sides.

175
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,850
That woman had it.

176
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,820
My goodness. Anesthetics?
This is downright attempted murder!

177
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,159
Sit down. Don't overreact.
There are people here.

178
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:06,259
Okay. I'll make sure
I keep my belongings safe.

179
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:11,940
By the way, why do you think
her memory wasn't erased?

180
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,670
It's rare, but there are some humans
who are immune to our skills.

181
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,579
Take those old female shamans
for example.

182
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,250
And you just let her go?

183
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,549
And gave her vision back?

184
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,250
Rules are rules.

185
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,319
We're not like that magpie
that repaid a favor.

186
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,490
How much longer do we need
to be chained...

187
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,890
to that outmoded contract?

188
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,420
"We repay what we must."

189
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,990
It's old but romantic.

190
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,089
It also proves our dignity.

191
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,259
It's a curse as well.

192
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,299
The more we owe,

193
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,099
the more we become like puppets.

194
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,869
Does she concern you?

195
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,170
Because she looks like Lady Ah Eum?

196
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:53,940
I've met countless lookalikes
for centuries.

197
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,380
And I was there to witness them
until the day they died.

198
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,680
But none of them had the fox marble.

199
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
The deities are so heartless.

200
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,430
Sin Ju, don't make that face.
You look extremely ugly.

201
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,960
Give her some gimbap.

202
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,099
Here.

203
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,000
Your dad's bored.

204
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,940
Done.

205
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,109
58 seconds. That was close.

206
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,220
You should stop now
and play with your dad.

207
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,750
I'm going to beat his record.

208
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:36,720
All right, then. Will you be able
to beat me? Here.

209
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,160
Go!

210
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,960
Will you succeed?

211
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:42,829
Will you?

212
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,230
Ta-da.

213
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,930
Mom, he cheated!

214
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,099
I'm truly sorry.

215
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,640
This is from my heart.

216
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,369
Please accept it. I made it myself.

217
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,940
Please accept it. Here.

218
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,609
Isn't it tasty?

219
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,250
One for Mom too.
I made this myself. Here.

220
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,490
Honey, I know that you're doing it
just for the camera.

221
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,420
Was I so obvious?
It is embarrassing.

222
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,200
One for dad as well.

223
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:20,630
It is so good.

224
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,869
Give your daddy a present.

225
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,500
Look here, Ji A.

226
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,240
You are so pretty.

227
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:47,819
Mom?

228
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,769
You guys have died...

229
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:35,240
from the bus accident at Yeou Gogae.

230
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,769
I will skip on that part...

231
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,579
since the grim reaper must have
explained it already.

232
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,079
From now on, you guys will be seeing
the afterlife judges...

233
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,880
to be judged for sins you have
committed in your lifetime.

234
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,920
You don't have to be scared
if you've been good.

235
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,319
You should know about King Yeomra.

236
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,430
My wife over there is a sister of
King Yeomra.

237
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,160
Not so terrifying, right?

238
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,829
But she is so terrifying to me.

239
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,910
- That old fogy...
- Have you...

240
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,980
I should do plowing on his tongue.

241
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,180
- Check this one out.
- Let's have a talk for a second.

242
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,720
It has done a pretty good background
research on the afterlife.

243
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,279
That is the point.

244
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,750
- Hello, Ms. Nam.
- Hello.

245
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,289
I am on the first floor.
Who wants to have a cup of coffee?

246
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,900
Ah Eum has reincarnated, right?

247
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,140
So I am right.

248
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,240
What are you going to do
with her after all this time?

249
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,250
I want revenge.

250
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,750
Thanks to her, I have been
in service for 600 years.

251
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,490
You will go to fire hell if you lie.

252
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,390
Do you want to get yourself
barbecued with hell fire?

253
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,720
No way. Men are all about the hair.
My red-brown hair.

254
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,029
What has happened to you who
used to be a mighty mountain spirit?

255
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,359
Let's stop talking about the past.

256
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,130
- Where is she?
- How should I know?

257
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,670
You have your clairvoyance power.
You can see everything.

258
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,779
Could it be possible for her
to reincarnate...

259
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:19,910
with the same face?

260
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,049
Reincarnation happens randomly.

261
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,049
You should wish that she has not
reincarnated as a boy.

262
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,319
Oh, my god.

263
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,900
It doesn't matter
whether she is a boy or a girl.

264
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,799
Or if she is pretty or ugly.

265
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,339
I just hope she's not over
60 years old.

266
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,769
Even if she is over 60 years old,
she is a baby compared to you.

267
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:49,769
I don't like that.

268
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,240
I don't want her to die so soon.

269
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,650
It has been such a long time since
we have last met.

270
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,130
You don't look so well.

271
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:11,660
I saw a corpse in my dream.

272
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,299
- It is an occupational disease.
- By the way,

273
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,299
in my dream last night,

274
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,970
some lady in a black mourning dress
was crying.

275
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,400
- A virgin ghost?
- No.

276
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,569
It was you.

277
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,309
Stop jinxing her.

278
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,250
- Was it really me?
- Yes.

279
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:36,420
I had a dream of losing a tooth.

280
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,259
Isn't that a bad dream?

281
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,430
You said you don't trust in ghosts,
but you are so superstitious.

282
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,500
Don't worry. They say losing a tooth
can also mean wealth.

283
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
That is so fortunate.

284
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:51,230
Darn you.

285
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:54,970
Ms. Kim. Can you sell that dream
to me?

286
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,470
Pardon?

287
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:58,680
I want to buy a lottery.

288
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,049
Yeon.

289
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:09,190
- Don't look for her.
- What?

290
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:12,019
It would turn over your life again.

291
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,259
It doesn't matter.

292
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,700
Stop being so harsh on your husband.

293
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,029
Cut down on delivery food.
It is bad for your skin.

294
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,640
I found this on the street.

295
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:28,910
I can't visit for a while.

296
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:31,609
A lipstick?

297
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,150
Help me take care of one problem.

298
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,819
Yes?

299
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,390
My parent's birthdate?

300
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,190
I will text it.

301
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:58,170
(Dad: Nam Jong Su, May 3, 1958
Mom: Lee Young Seon, June 26, 1960)

302
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,279
It is neither good nor bad news.

303
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,250
Let's meet,

304
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,480
1pm at the Korean restaurant,
Snail Bride.

305
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,319
(Snail Bride)

306
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,549
(Traditional Korean Food:
Snail Bride)

307
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:34,569
You are here to meet
Lee Yeon, right?

308
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,140
Yes.

309
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:38,339
Follow me.

310
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,710
Thank you.

311
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:43,710
You are lucky.

312
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,950
- Excuse me?
- It is the first time...

313
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,890
he invited a human.

314
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,000
Hello.

315
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:06,099
About my parent's birthdate
you asked...

316
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,240
They were not on the list.

317
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,069
What does that mean?

318
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,869
It means your parents are not dead.

319
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,680
You mean they are alive?

320
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,779
Where?

321
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,210
I don't know about that.

322
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,250
Have some. You are buying.

323
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,009
It was not an appetizing story,
was it?

324
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,210
No. I am grateful enough.

325
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,220
Are you sure you are okay?

326
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,730
I am going to find them.

327
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:07,960
I said they could be alive.

328
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,630
But nobody trusted me.

329
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,099
Nobody.

330
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,779
I am really sorry
about that anesthetic.

331
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:28,119
So you know how to apologize.

332
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,750
Even I think I was a jerk.

333
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,359
I will not ask for your
understanding.

334
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:39,000
No. I can understand you.

335
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,029
I can.

336
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,440
Is that so?

337
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,980
Why did you eat that?

338
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:55,079
It is enteritis, right?

339
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,779
Did you order tteokbokki last night?

340
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:58,849
Pardon?

341
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,250
- Yes.
- She ate the leftovers.

342
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,259
That was spiciness level five!

343
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,920
Kong!

344
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,319
I will prescribe you
diarrhea medicine.

345
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,130
Don't feed her anything
but water and medicine.

346
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,329
Don't try to fight me.

347
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,470
Of course, no snacks as well.

348
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:20,269
You can tell what she ate
just at a glance?

349
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,670
I can understand
what they are saying.

350
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:31,650
It might be rude, but...

351
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,579
I don't take rude questions.
Especially, personal questions.

352
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,920
Okay. I will change the question.

353
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,319
There are foxes other than you,
right?

354
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,430
Are they all in human forms?

355
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,509
They are roaming around this city.

356
00:28:58,609 --> 00:28:59,740
Just like you guys.

357
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:04,309
Worrying about real estate crises
and current economic risks.

358
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,380
How about the payment?

359
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,750
Here.

360
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,390
I'll give you a discount
if you pay in cash.

361
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,130
Then what about Shin Don?

362
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,160
Is it true the monk from
Koryo Dynasty was a fox?

363
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,930
My goodness.

364
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:23,970
- What about the others?
- The bill.

365
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,769
Right.

366
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,569
Are there anything else
other than foxes?

367
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:33,910
Yes. Usually at places
you can't imagine.

368
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,710
How was your meal today?

369
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,920
Not bad.

370
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,289
Let's go eat.

371
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,930
How about Korean food
at Snail Bride?

372
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:54,930
I'm sick of samgyetang.

373
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,170
Can we change the menu?

374
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,470
Samgyetang with some ginseng liquor
would hit the spot.

375
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,769
It's really good for your health.

376
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:02,210
Be honest.

377
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,009
You have feelings
for the owner there, right?

378
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:06,740
What? That's ridiculous.

379
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,109
It's Korean chicken. Did you see it?
Just hurry up and follow me.

380
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,049
Let's go.

381
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:17,390
Hello?

382
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:22,630
What is it?

383
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:26,029
My mom...

384
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,069
- passed away.
- What?

385
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,940
I had a dream of losing a tooth.

386
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,740
By the way, in my dream last night,
some lady...

387
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,640
in a black mourning dress
was crying.

388
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,740
It was you.

389
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,150
Okay. Let's part ways here.

390
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:51,690
I hope
we never see each other again.

391
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:55,690
What? That's it? Telling me
my parents are alive somewhere?

392
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,660
Firstly, I don't have time to kill.

393
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,799
Secondly, we live in the same world
because I have no choice,

394
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,529
but the worlds
we belong to are different.

395
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:04,799
I know that. I do.

396
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,039
There were people before you...

397
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,400
who looked into the secrets
of the different worlds.

398
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,269
Most of them went insane
or had their lives shortened.

399
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:13,710
I don't care. I won't be a nuisance.

400
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,109
Just don't get out of my sight.

401
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,019
Goodness.

402
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,130
Just pick up your phone first.

403
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,269
Jae Hwan, I can't talk on the phone
right now...

404
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,970
Okay.

405
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:48,009
My colleague's family passed away.

406
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:50,779
She said she had a dream
of losing her tooth.

407
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:53,950
- A dream?
- Me and another colleague...

408
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,490
also had bad dreams too.

409
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,259
A contagious nightmare?

410
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,000
Do you really want to see...

411
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:08,970
the world I live in?

412
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,240
Did you say studio number three?

413
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,240
Yes. I swear I left my equipment
there, but they're gone.

414
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,049
Producer, is it this one?

415
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,039
What is this?

416
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,590
What is this?

417
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,079
Hey...

418
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,210
Hey. When did you get discharged?

419
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,250
Didn't you promise to become clean?

420
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,250
- I'm innocent.
- Really?

421
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,050
Then I must be the bad guy.

422
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,789
Please don't kill me.

423
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,460
Tell me one reason why I shouldn't.

424
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,030
- I...
- There isn't one, right? Die.

425
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,030
Wait, wait! Wait...

426
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:10,469
Your little brother told me...

427
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,679
I could eat
to my heart's content here.

428
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,110
Rang told you that?

429
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,179
What is that?

430
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,619
A bulgasalyi.

431
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,219
"A bulgasalyi"?

432
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,019
The legendary creature
that feeds on nightmares?

433
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,760
Yes. They like broadcasting studios
where there are many people.

434
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,329
If you feed them metal,
they'll show their true selves.

435
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,539
Darn it.

436
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,400
Now, here's a question.

437
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,269
Don't come. Don't come!

438
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,070
I'm not talking to you.

439
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,809
Answer me, hostage.

440
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,980
Other than being a nuisance,
what else can you do...

441
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,409
at a time like this?

442
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,420
I...

443
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:29,949
You can't do anything.

444
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,300
Go back to the world you belong to.

445
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,510
A human tamed by darkness...

446
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,309
will no longer be human or anything.

447
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:00,449
Hey. Get up. I know you're not dead.

448
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,650
(Jangsan Point, Yellow Sea)

449
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,889
Pull, pull.

450
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:08,320
Pull.

451
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,389
Great.

452
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,000
I got you.

453
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,199
You're bad at your job,

454
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,030
but you always get hungry on time.

455
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,869
It's way past lunchtime.

456
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,900
I get seasick
if I have an empty stomach.

457
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,510
You're useless. When will you
ever do your job right?

458
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,179
He's useless just like your goods.

459
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,480
Darn you.

460
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,710
Gosh.

461
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,920
Is this a person?

462
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:37,219
Hey, it's a body!

463
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:40,360
Watch your mouth. You can't
say that out loud on a boat.

464
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,989
Captain, it's a Yain.

465
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,929
- Be respectful.
- Yes, sir.

466
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,000
Are we taking it with us?

467
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,800
Let's just throw it over.

468
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,599
Once you find a Yain, you have
to bring it back to the shore.

469
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,900
If we don't, it'll chase
our boat around as a ghost.

470
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,869
That's just a myth.

471
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:59,480
"A myth"? Don't you know
about the other guys...

472
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,579
who lost all their fortune
by ignoring it?

473
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,650
You must have gone through
a lot in the heavy waters.

474
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:16,190
That front tooth...
The shape of the gold casing...

475
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:18,429
Could it be Mr. Seo?

476
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,630
Hey.

477
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,869
Whose skull is it?
Has it been identified?

478
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:30,570
Can I eat first?
This is my first meal.

479
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,480
Do you dig around every case
in Korea?

480
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,710
This time,
it's for a personal matter.

481
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,750
Don't tell me...

482
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,719
you're still searching
for your parents.

483
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,380
Wake up, Nam Ji A.

484
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,150
Let's stay on the subject.
You can keep the scolding for later.

485
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:47,159
It's going to take some legwork
this time.

486
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,889
We know the owner of the head, but
the coast guard took over the case.

487
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,860
- What's the cause of death?
- We don't know yet.

488
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:56,170
They identified the victim.

489
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:58,070
Who is it?

490
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:10,010
Please let me see my dad's face.

491
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,619
Please let me see my dad's face!

492
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,579
Dad!

493
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,360
Dad!

494
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,519
Are you still waiting
for your dead girlfriend?

495
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,630
I heard an interesting rumor.

496
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,429
Should I tell you or not?

497
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,130
If you don't find her until
the end of next month, she'll die.

498
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,840
Are you still contemplating?

499
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,610
Please let me live.

500
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,179
I told you I will.

501
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,219
Just tell me where Rang is.

502
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,820
I don't know.

503
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,949
You're so stubborn.

504
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,460
How can you live
in the 21st century like this?

505
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:31,989
Dying this way or that way
won't make a difference.

506
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,070
Where's Rang?

507
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:38,670
I'm a better fighter than him.

508
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,170
Call him.

509
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,780
- Tell me if you change your mind.
- Wait.

510
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,510
Wait, wait.

511
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,650
I'll do it. Okay?

512
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,730
Yes, it's me.

513
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,760
Things kind of went wrong.

514
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,150
Were you drinking?

515
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,719
- Give me a drink too.
- Was that call from you earlier?

516
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:36,889
No wonder his voice
got me the creeps.

517
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:40,400
You're a grownup now.
You couldn't eat fishy foods before.

518
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,329
Don't act like you're relaxed.

519
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:45,130
You came all the way here
at this hour.

520
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,840
You must feel anxious.

521
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:48,670
Am I right?

522
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,239
That woman reincarnated, right?

523
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,780
Guess if she's dead or alive.

524
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,380
She's alive.

525
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,690
If you were planning to kill her,
you would've brought her body.

526
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,059
Also, you'd die for bets.
You wouldn't give up such a chance.

527
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:12,829
But what if that special prize
gets a scratch?

528
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:17,800
Don't you dare touch a hair on her.

529
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,500
What will you do?

530
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,269
Tell me. I'm so eager to know.

531
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,210
You're acting
like you lack affection.

532
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,239
Why don't you know?
You have a brother complex.

533
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,050
Shut your mouth.
It's all your fault.

534
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:32,349
- How?
- Just because of a girl,

535
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:34,750
you gave up on being a spirit and
turned your back on the mountain.

536
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,050
Yes. I gave up on you.

537
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,829
Isn't this what you wanted to hear?

538
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,940
Get out of my sight right now.

539
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,570
Are you mad at me?

540
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,809
This is where the joke ends.
The woman is in my hands.

541
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,650
How rude.

542
00:44:06,219 --> 00:44:07,449
Don't stay out so late.

543
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:10,119
You'll get a tummy ache
if you drink too much, so watch it.

544
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,889
You're out of your mind. Do you
even know where the woman is?

545
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,929
Should I tell you or not?

546
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:18,929
I don't need it.

547
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,659
You're in this place,

548
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,500
and there was only one case
in this town today.

549
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:36,250
It's okay, I can go alone.
I'm just going to scan the place.

550
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,179
Did you pack all the equipment?

551
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:41,349
Yes. Take good care of Ms. Kim.

552
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,650
Call me
once the funeral home is set.

553
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:45,920
Okay.

554
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:55,699
Did you see the breaking news?
A head...

555
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:59,030
Me and another colleague
also had bad dreams too.

556
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:01,369
It can't be a coincidence.

557
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:20,659
I didn't notice before,

558
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:23,329
but is that patch
for motion sickness?

559
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:30,199
Who did you say
you were searching for? A person?

560
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:31,929
Or a fox?

561
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,900
Let's go our separate ways.

562
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:37,369
Tell me. Since I have this job,

563
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:39,170
I have my ways of finding people.

564
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,610
I'll decline your offer.

565
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,610
Why are you going to this island
of all the places?

566
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,710
What about finding your family?

567
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,619
While we're on that,
are all the dreams...

568
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,619
from that legendary animal
bulgasalyi, really true?

569
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,960
They cleverly mix truths and lies.

570
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:56,130
They're just waiting for you
to be fooled by it.

571
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,659
So there's some truth in it.

572
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,230
If that's the reason,
you should go back.

573
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:07,039
You shouldn't be so reckless
in listening to it.

574
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:09,610
What to do? I'm already here.

575
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,650
Same boat. Same island.

576
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:22,119
A woman with the same face as her.

577
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,820
My instincts keep on telling me...

578
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:29,360
that this combination means
something's wrong.

579
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,429
What could be waiting
on that island?

580
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:50,150
Gosh,
why did you only get streusels?

581
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,050
I told you to get some bread
with red bean paste.

582
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,849
Just eat what I get you.

583
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:55,519
Darn you.

584
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,690
I won't buy any for you next time.

585
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,260
No, no. Please buy me some more.
They're delicious.

586
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,260
I've been waiting for you.

587
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,300
Are you Mr. Seo Ki Chang's daughter?

588
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:11,730
Pardon me.

589
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:13,739
I'm Producer Nam Ji A.
I was the one who called you.

590
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,070
Is he with you?

591
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,380
- No. He's...
- Yes. We're together.

592
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:23,710
- We work at the station together.
- What?

593
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,349
- Let's go to my house.
- Okay.

594
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:48,800
Please come in.

595
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:50,670
Do you want some barley tea?

596
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,039
I thought you wanted
to go separate ways.

597
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,380
I can do whatever I want.
Mind your own business.

598
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,710
What's wrong with you?

599
00:47:58,849 --> 00:47:59,880
What a shabby place.

600
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,079
Hey, am I supposed
to take off my shoes?

601
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,590
- I guess your father lived alone.
- Yes.

602
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,099
I lived in Incheon and worked
at a semiconductor factory.

603
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:17,969
My dad fished.

604
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:21,539
Don't be nervous. Just relax.

605
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:25,070
Was the disappearance an accident?

606
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,980
They said the boat capsized
because of the wind and waves.

607
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:31,250
Hey.

608
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,389
What did the police say?

609
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,349
They don't know the cause
because it's badly decomposed.

610
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,619
When the body gets caught...

611
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,760
in a boat propeller,
it can get ripped apart by accident.

612
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,309
When was the last time
you talked to your father?

613
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:04,179
He called me in the morning,
on the day of the accident.

614
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,110
I missed the call though.

615
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,550
(Voice Mail 1)

616
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,719
Pyung Hee?

617
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:14,090
Are you eating well?

618
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:17,559
If you aren't busy,
come and visit me.

619
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,559
I got your favorite fish and conch.

620
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,900
I keep seeing your mother
in my dreams.

621
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:30,940
She was holding your hand
and was in a hurry to go somewhere.

622
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,380
Maybe she misses you.

623
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,039
Where is your mother?

624
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,880
She died of cancer.

625
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,449
Why did he have such a dream?

626
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,750
She came to greet you.

627
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:50,030
Seeing a dead person in a dream
means she's coming to meet you.

628
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,960
It was probably you
who was supposed to die that day.

629
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,530
- Stop it.
- Pardon?

630
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,230
Your father saved you.

631
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:03,909
I'm just saying that there could be
a theory like that.

632
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,610
You don't have Americano, do you?

633
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,940
Don't drink too much and leave.

634
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,250
Why did the TV network
come all the way here from Seoul?

635
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,789
That girl probably
told them something.

636
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:21,789
I should throw her into the sea,

637
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:24,489
- and make her a fish bait.
- Quiet down.

638
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:36,940
The more I think about it,
the more I feel uneasy about it.

639
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:41,039
Why did that skull
get caught in our net?

640
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,550
Since we caught the skull,

641
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:47,349
we haven't seen Jin Sik at all,
have we?

642
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,800
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

643
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:05,429
I had no choice.
There was no choice.

644
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:09,739
You can stay at my place
instead of going to a guest house.

645
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:11,309
Thank you.

646
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,909
This is your room.

647
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,849
- I have to run errands.
- Sure.

648
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,679
If you insist.

649
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:27,090
I knew it'd be shabby.

650
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:30,230
I'm okay with it because I'm used
to staying at such places.

651
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,690
I'm not okay with it.

652
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,599
There's only one room,
and I need to stay by her side.

653
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,670
What about me then?

654
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:40,500
There's a mountain over there.

655
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,269
From the documentary that I saw,
digging burrows was your specialty.

656
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,809
I'm sorry. I'm a modern fox.

657
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,309
I can't sleep without a heater.

658
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,010
I'll never let you out.

659
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,150
Digging a burrow is my specialty.

660
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,659
Excuse me.

661
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,030
- Who are you?
- I'm a customer.

662
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,829
Why don't you have
mint chocolate chip ice cream?

663
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,070
Just take whatever is there.

664
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,969
You have terrible customer service.

665
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:15,570
Hello.

666
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:19,309
You're the ones
who found the skull, right?

667
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,710
Did someone report it
to the TV network?

668
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,880
No, I saw the news.

669
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,250
May I sit down for a minute?

670
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,880
Sure.

671
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,860
Were you close with Mr. Seo
who passed away?

672
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,730
Close with him?
We all lived in the same village,

673
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:42,000
so we'd bump into each other.

674
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,869
We were just neighbors.
No more, no less.

675
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:49,869
I heard you fished on the same boat
for a long time.

676
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,010
I won't talk for free.

677
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,849
Let me drink a shot
poured by a young lady.

678
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,750
I haven't smelled perfume
for so long.

679
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:12,690
- Hey.
- What the heck are you doing?

680
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,300
Well, I'm just overly friendly.

681
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,670
You're an outsider. How dare you!

682
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,599
If you're going to hit me,
could you please turn your body...

683
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:22,300
a little bit this way?

684
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,369
I'm not getting a good angle.

685
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,909
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

686
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,690
You're pretty gutsy.

687
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:43,289
It's nothing new.

688
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,300
Why are you following me?

689
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:53,369
I'm not.

690
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,269
I'm covering a story.

691
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,269
I'm doing something similar to that.

692
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,510
Do it then.

693
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:04,780
I'm going to do it
by stealing what you get.

694
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:08,250
You do it.

695
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,019
Excuse me, ma'am.

696
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,769
Ma'am, may I ask you
a question please?

697
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,110
Let me ask you a question please.

698
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:36,340
It'll take only a minute.

699
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,949
Please spare me a minute.

700
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,079
Ma'am.

701
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:45,849
Ma'am. Please spare me a second.

702
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,219
Why are you working
so inefficiently?

703
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,730
Do you think it's easy
to make the elderly open up?

704
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,530
When I ask people, they just talk.

705
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:55,960
What's your secret?

706
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,769
I break their fingers one by one
until they talk.

707
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:02,070
It looks like I can't really
smooch off you.

708
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,309
You aren't that good
at covering stories.

709
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:07,210
- I'm off.
- Where are you off to?

710
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,380
People aren't the only ones
that have eyes and ears.

711
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:21,690
How can he walk so fast?

712
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,170
Do you hear something?

713
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:38,670
Shush.

714
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,420
It's a dead forest.

715
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:52,449
What?

716
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:55,690
All the spirits have left the woods.

717
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:57,960
Why?

718
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,800
Because they were forgotten
and abandoned by people.

719
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:10,269
Who's there?

720
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,960
Greetings to the old master
of the forest.

721
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,900
- Do you know me?
- I've seen you from afar once.

722
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,800
You're the spirit
of the sacred tree.

723
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,070
What happened here?

724
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:48,210
I do not know.

725
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:51,949
- You don't know?
- The island has changed.

726
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,550
The house guardian deities
and spirits...

727
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:56,920
have all left,

728
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,320
so no one can tell me
about the village happenings.

729
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,889
- Since when?
- Since the Korean War ended.

730
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:07,360
Something evil entered the island
when there was a storm.

731
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,469
I couldn't see it
nor could I stop it.

732
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,969
You must've been very lonely
on your own.

733
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:15,170
I can't leave even if I want to...

734
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,969
because my feet are tied
to the tree.

735
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:29,679
Is it because of this?

736
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,050
Yes. Can you untie that?

737
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:48,440
It's a spirit.

738
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,710
It's a ghost.

739
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:55,579
Yes, welcome.

740
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,750
The dead that went
to the waters today.

741
00:57:57,909 --> 00:58:01,349
Has become a spirit, a ghost

742
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:04,820
Thank you.

743
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,219
I'm free now.

744
00:58:07,289 --> 00:58:09,090
I don't quite understand you,
but I'm proud I was of help.

745
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:13,190
By the way, you should wear
a pair of shoes.

746
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:15,400
There are so many cuts
on your pretty feet.

747
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:19,670
I can see that you've been
in my forest before.

748
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,269
This is my first time coming here.

749
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:27,139
Go north.
You'll find your first answer there.

750
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,320
I can see that you've been
in my forest before.

751
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,289
This is my first time coming here.

752
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:39,150
Go north.

753
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,159
You'll find your first answer there.

754
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:58,409
She vanished.

755
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:00,239
Good job.

756
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,650
The people who had tied this
around her had strong desires,

757
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,920
so only another human being
could cut it.

758
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,400
Dear Dragon King!

759
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,099
Grandmother of the Sea!

760
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:25,369
- Please return my dad's body.
- Grandmother of the Sea!

761
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:28,369
Please allow me to give him
a proper funeral.

762
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:31,769
Please take pity
on this young girl...

763
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,710
and return her father's body!

764
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:38,880
I pray to you!

765
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,780
I pray to you like so!

766
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,050
I pray to you!

767
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,090
- What's wrong?
- He's not there.

768
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:50,019
He's not in the water.

769
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,500
His body washed up ashore
before his head did!

770
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,130
Your father!

771
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,420
"Jangsansa Cave"?

772
01:00:17,849 --> 01:00:19,519
I've never heard of it before.

773
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,929
(Jangsansa Cave Entrance,
Don't enter during the rising tide.)

774
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,900
I'm going to have some food.

775
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:30,130
Don't move.

776
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,340
Hold on. Stay there.

777
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,800
What is it?

778
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,079
I've seen this place before.

779
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:00,599
This is it.

780
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:04,769
This was where they took this photo.

781
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:06,199
So you have been here before.

782
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:12,010
My mom had just gotten pregnant.

783
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:16,809
This was it.

784
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:21,420
I came here while I was still
in my mom's womb.

785
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,800
Why did my parents...

786
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,929
come to this island?

787
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:51,150
This blanket smells.
I don't think she washed it.

788
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:55,179
So why were you so stubborn
about not going to a better inn?

789
01:01:57,849 --> 01:01:59,090
That's none of your business.

790
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,260
You know what?

791
01:02:09,929 --> 01:02:11,769
I have a fatty liver.

792
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,440
- It's chronic.
- Why do I need to know this?

793
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:20,579
You're a nine-tailed fox.

794
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,309
Just in case
you crave for a liver...

795
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,480
I don't eat such things.

796
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:27,619
- Really?
- Heard of Chinese liver fluke?

797
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,800
Don't laugh with that face of yours.

798
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:53,170
What about my face?

799
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,550
You're ugly. That's why.

800
01:02:58,679 --> 01:02:59,679
Oh my gosh.

801
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:03,150
He went to the island
to find the reincarnated woman?

802
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:06,690
That's right. He may not look so,
but he's a romantic.

803
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,320
They say foxes stay loyal
to their partners forever.

804
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:11,630
How romantic.

805
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,159
Romantic, my foot.
You know what he had to go through.

806
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,730
Once in your lifetime,

807
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:19,730
you could meet someone
whom you would give your life to.

808
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,469
I will never sacrifice myself
for love.

809
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:24,039
I'm going to protect Mr. Lee.

810
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,780
I guess that's also love.

811
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:13,650
What was I expecting?

812
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:42,280
That woman reincarnated, right?

813
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:44,750
Guess if she's dead or alive.

814
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,090
Could it be possible for her
to reincarnate with the same face?

815
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:48,289
Don't look for her.

816
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:52,230
If you don't find her until
the end of next month, she'll die.

817
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:55,460
It would turn over your life again.

818
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:28,900
Goodness.

819
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,900
What do you say?
You want them, don't you?

820
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,469
My goodness.
These are precious wild ginseng.

821
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:36,900
- How much are they worth?
- Goodness.

822
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,139
- No.
- Wait.

823
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:40,639
Talk with her first.

824
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,409
Don't talk casually toward them.

825
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,449
They're 74. They're babies.

826
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:48,320
What are you so curious about?

827
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,349
Right.

828
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,349
Well...

829
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:56,260
Why do you all refuse
to talk about the skull?

830
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,960
That's because...

831
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,760
- Tell her yourself.
- What?

832
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,030
Goodness.
You must never tell anyone...

833
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:09,300
that we told you this.

834
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,599
You have my word.

835
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:14,409
Well... So...

836
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,780
This wasn't the first time.

837
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:18,179
Yes.

838
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,679
I'm talking about human heads.

839
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,820
- Hey, Jae Hwan.
- Ms. Nam, brace yourself.

840
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,659
There were other similar cases?

841
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:34,960
- Who were the victims?
- There were four Jane Does.

842
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:35,960
When did they happen?

843
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,199
The first incident happened in 1954.

844
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:41,570
1954...

845
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,869
What in the world happened
on this island?

846
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,409
That's...

847
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:52,610
Excuse me.

848
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,579
Weren't you on the same boat
with Pyung Hee's father?

849
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,190
Sir!

850
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,550
Please talk with me!

851
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:02,360
Wait up!

852
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:08,030
Why are you running away from me?

853
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,400
Get away from me, you ghost!

854
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:28,219
Don't kill him!

855
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:36,559
Yu Ri, there's something I want.

856
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,489
Here?

857
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:42,099
We just opened...

858
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,369
a haunted house.

859
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:09,320
It's not that bad.

860
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,800
- What is this?
- It's a home remedy.

861
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:28,939
- It's burning.
- Don't be a baby.

862
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:31,279
Your hand feels too hot.

863
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:33,109
It's scorching.

864
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:34,850
What?

865
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:45,859
What is that?

866
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:57,270
It's been a while, Lee Yeon.

867
01:08:57,939 --> 01:08:58,970
Who are you?

868
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:02,640
It's me.
The person you've been waiting for.

869
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:04,949
What?

870
01:09:06,949 --> 01:09:08,550
By the way,

871
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:11,550
why did you...

872
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,119
kill me?

873
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,930
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

874
01:09:58,869 --> 01:10:00,170
Something's coming.

875
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:03,100
That thing's asleep here?

876
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,510
A dragon without legs.
What do you think it is?

877
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:07,239
You've fallen head over heels
for a woman.

878
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:09,840
You also fell for a woman
and ruined your life.

879
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,850
- What did you say, you punk?
- This feels ominous.

880
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:14,720
I need to find out
why my parents came here.

881
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:16,649
She'll be an offering.

882
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,289
You won't be able
to leave this place.

883
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:22,289
I told you to kill.

884
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,029
That's the only way she'll live.
