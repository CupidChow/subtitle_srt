(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

8
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,280
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

9
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,250
The woman you just kissed...

10
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,219
Was that me?

11
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,120
Or...

12
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,129
was it your dead first love?

13
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,870
It wasn't me, was it?

14
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:18,900
- I...
- I'm...

15
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,270
not the shadow of your past.

16
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,150
So make up your mind here and now.

17
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,379
Keep holding onto your expired past,

18
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:31,620
or...

19
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:34,990
Or what?

20
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:41,960
Look at me properly.

21
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:53,539
I'm pretty good-looking.

(Episode 6: Destiny)

23
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:15,990
What's going on between you two?

24
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,600
What does he do for a living?
How old is he?

25
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,569
Where are you right now?
Are you going to ignore me?

26
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,399
Who was that man?

27
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,339
She's ignoring me completely.

28
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,569
He must be a source.

29
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,740
No way.

30
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,879
The way he looked at Nam Ji A...

31
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,680
made my heart flutter.

32
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,089
Ms. Kim, tell this to your heart.

33
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,660
Tell it not to act rashly.

34
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,529
By the way, wasn't she a virgin?

35
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,730
- What?
- I'm talking about Ji A.

36
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,300
She has zero dating experience.

37
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,439
It's hot, isn't it?

38
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,410
I like summer.

39
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,540
Don't foxes get hot?

40
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,079
It's when the forest gets
the noisiest.

41
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,420
I don't have to go around
asking how everyone's doing.

42
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,850
Every stalk of flower
and every tree...

43
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,589
are given fair amounts of sunlight
and rain,

44
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,689
and they'll bloom simply
but brilliantly.

45
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:25,000
In the city, you don't get
fair amounts of sunlight.

46
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:28,370
Someone who lives in a basement
will get much less sunlight...

47
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,069
than someone who lives
in a penthouse.

48
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,569
Whether you're a human or a plant,
the one that gets more sunlight...

49
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,339
will grow bigger.
It's like a well-known formula.

50
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,540
Your eyes were looking at
a bigger scope than I expected.

51
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,480
Why won't you make eye contact
with me?

52
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,089
- Did I?
- Even now. You're looking...

53
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,259
beyond my right shoulder.

54
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,430
Gosh, there's a carp.

55
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,100
How cute.

56
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:05,500
Right?

57
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:07,639
How cute.

58
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,009
Yes.

59
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
What are you looking at?

60
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,750
You.

61
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,689
You told me to look at you properly.

62
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,759
Don't. Stop looking at me.

63
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,029
You'll wear my face out.

64
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,740
Darn it.
I shouldn't have said that earlier.

65
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,040
Wait for me.

66
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,209
By the way, Ms. Kim.

67
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,540
Didn't that man look familiar?

68
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,180
- He did.
- Right? Where did we see him?

69
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,620
At the tournament matches
for my dream man.

70
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,889
When my ideal types are mixed
together, it'll look like him.

71
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:55,519
I'm talking about our show.

72
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:56,620
No, no.

73
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,790
I would have never skipped over
such a face.

74
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,259
He looks familiar. Trust me.

75
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,360
Are you guys
still talking about him?

76
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,500
If you don't want to work,

77
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,800
at least act like you are.

78
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,699
It's so embarrassing.

79
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,970
Ms. Kim says if we're reporters,

80
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,110
we should always focus on faces.

81
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,610
- Why are you telling on me?
- Unbelievable.

82
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,379
By the way,

83
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,750
what did Ji A say? Did she reply?

84
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,050
Not yet. We're dying to know too.

85
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,920
He looks like a con artist
with that pointy face of his.

86
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,230
- Is that what you want to believe?
- What?

87
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,990
That the world...

88
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,399
can't be so unfair.

89
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,129
Hey!

90
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:43,329
Get to work!

91
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,170
Don't act like you're working,
and concentrate on your work.

92
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,379
Who are you searching so hard for?

93
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,350
- A district magistrate.
- "A district magistrate"?

94
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,420
Apparently, that person knows
who took away your parents.

95
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,250
Really?

96
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,259
Who is this district magistrate?

97
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,329
He will look like a human,
but he's not a human.

98
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,399
He was 1 of the 4 mountain spirits
that guarded this country.

99
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:14,870
"Mountain spirit"?

100
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,399
Don't forget one of them
is in front of you.

101
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,769
Right. You're an ex-mountain spirit.

102
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,269
You said you were expelled, right?

103
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,009
No, I quit on my own.

104
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,079
It's awkward for me
to say this myself,

105
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,110
but the other three were minor ones.

106
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,819
I had Baekdudaegan.
I was a major one.

107
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,949
Okay?

108
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:33,649
Okay.

109
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,519
By the way, why is a mountain spirit
at a folk village?

110
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,429
Not just mountain spirits.
All legendary things gather here.

111
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,789
There's no better place to hide.

112
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:46,429
Should I say it's a retro craze?

113
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,700
The place brings back memories.

114
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,899
Is anyone here real?

115
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,409
Perhaps.

116
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:57,740
Really?

117
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,679
They stayed here with the tourists
for a long time,

118
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,149
and now you can't
smell their scents.

119
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,250
Then how will we find him?

120
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:06,850
We don't have to.
We just have to enjoy our time.

121
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,690
They'll come to find us first.

122
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,720
The fortune-teller is over there.
Let's go.

123
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,940
All right.

124
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,879
Goodness.

125
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,750
- Hello.
- Goodness, you're here!

126
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,590
You're finally here.

127
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,259
Let's see.

128
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,299
Your fortunes, physiognomy,
compatibility, or past life.

129
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,559
Which one is it?

130
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,570
Why would you be part-timing here
if you're that competent?

131
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,600
It's just for fun.

132
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,309
Here.

133
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,980
Past life, please.

134
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,679
Past life.

135
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,909
Where's that app?

136
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,779
All right. Past life.

137
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,990
Right. Young people these days...

138
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,549
tend to ignore their past lives.

139
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,419
But your past life
is very important.

140
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,860
Stay still.

141
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,200
- Good.
- Are you using an app?

142
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,500
It's obvious.

143
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,799
The moment you stepped foot in here,
I knew you were different.

144
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,100
Tell me.

145
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,039
You were part of the royal family.

146
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,509
You were a princess.

147
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,950
Did you get that from the app?

148
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,750
What about me?

149
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,320
You were...

150
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,289
So...

151
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:57,330
You were a manual laborer.

152
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,230
You passed away
while building the Hangang Bridge.

153
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,870
If you're going to spew nonsense,
make it favorable at least.

154
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,539
You should purchase a talisman.

155
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,200
Talisman, my foot. Let's go.

156
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,440
You shouldn't be together...

157
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:14,279
unless you want one of you to die.

158
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,580
Sorry?

159
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,820
You two shouldn't have met
in the first place.

160
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,659
- Hello.
- Hello.

161
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:33,460
- You're so beautiful.
- I already know that.

162
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,529
Hello.

163
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,200
Oh, my! You should take a bath
with me at the valley.

164
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:38,600
Hello.

165
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,539
I guess you're still looking
for the woodcutter.

166
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,909
- Hello.
- Hello.

167
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,809
Welcome.

168
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,110
- He's a mountain spirit.
- That's right.

169
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,350
- Where's the fortune teller?
- The fortune teller?

170
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,049
You have to walk all the way
to that end.

171
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,120
That far? In this heat?

172
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,320
Are there no taxis around here?

173
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:01,960
No.

174
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,389
But we have that.

175
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:06,730
(Taxi)

176
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,120
Gosh, I just wasted my money.

177
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,450
On what grounds, did he say
such things? It's uncomfortable.

178
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,559
My team manager
went to a fortune teller...

179
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:33,419
to find out about his compatibility
with his future wife,

180
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,259
and the fortune teller wondered
why they hadn't met sooner.

181
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:37,159
They were perfect for each other.

182
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,029
So?

183
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,000
They vowed to love each other
for 100 years, but after 1 year...

184
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,269
- Did they get a divorce?
- Yes.

185
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,370
I don't believe in compatibilities.

186
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,639
If that were true, why are there
so many divorced couples in Korea?

187
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:57,720
Who shot that?

188
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,080
Who do you think would send
a love letter...

189
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,590
in such an outdated way?

190
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,250
"Come to the government office."

191
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,590
"From the district magistrate"?

192
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,789
Let's go.

193
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,970
1, 2.

194
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,620
Great.

195
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,820
Good.

196
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,419
Good. That's it!

197
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,259
Who is it?

198
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,539
- Want to get your fortunes read?
- No, it's something else.

199
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:53,070
Do you need a talisman?

200
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:55,409
That's enough.

201
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,110
I know who you are.

202
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,129
Did all the nine-tailed foxes agree
to gather at this folk village?

203
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,200
- What?
- Never mind.

204
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,639
Yeon was here.

205
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,440
Just cut to the chase.
I need to work.

206
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,840
You have the item that shows
one's past life, right?

207
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,759
Let's see.

208
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,789
The tiger's eyebrows, you say?

209
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,559
Oh, this is obviously...

210
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,600
not the right one.

211
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,330
Where is it?

212
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,470
Goodness, this is a goblin's cap.

213
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,539
Show me some gold

214
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:05,740
Let's see...

215
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,110
Ta-da.

216
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,679
This sack contains
every single missing item...

217
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,389
in this world.

218
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,220
Give that to me.

219
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,059
Not for free.

220
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,200
What do you say?

221
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,299
Goodness.

222
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:36,440
Goodness. What a fool.

223
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,039
- What?
- If they could be bought,

224
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,309
why would these items disappear
from this world?

225
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,019
What? It's gone again.

226
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,090
Nothing has changed.

227
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,740
Come on out.

228
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,460
- It's been a while.
- Lee Yeon.

229
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,029
You've become quite haggard.

230
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,330
Why are you here?

231
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,840
I'm looking for someone.

232
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,370
Yeou Gogae is your turf, right?

233
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,779
You're doing this for a human?

234
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,750
I'm willing to do more for her.

235
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,080
I heard that a female fox died.

236
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,549
Word has it
that an ex-mountain spirit...

237
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,519
had killed her
who was about to get married.

238
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,889
I heard that despite her
consuming many men's livers,

239
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,389
the one who helped hide her
was also an ex-mountain spirit.

240
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,629
It was already difficult for them
to survive in this tough world.

241
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:06,529
Those poor souls had nowhere to go,
yet you dared to harm them?

242
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:08,099
Those who caused chaos
in this world...

243
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,599
and those who couldn't coexist
with humans.

244
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,140
Those were the only ones
that I hunted.

245
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,180
You and I
just have different beliefs.

246
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,619
Then I'm afraid
I have nothing to say to you.

247
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,950
I beg to differ.

248
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,509
I think now you should focus
on getting out of here alive.

249
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,529
These items are priceless.

250
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,990
What if I use violence?

251
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,930
Then you'll be sucked
into this sack.

252
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:21,569
Try me if you're curious.

253
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,009
If not?

254
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:32,920
We'll barter.

255
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,589
I'll swap this
for the most valuable item to you.

256
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,259
The most...

257
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,559
valuable item to me?

258
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,920
Wait here for a bit.

259
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,750
Give me five minutes.

260
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:10,819
Be careful and don't get hurt.

261
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,190
I'm tired of trying to
keep this fight PG-13,

262
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:50,190
so shall we make it Rated R now?

263
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,230
I won't tolerate any deaths.

264
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,200
I won't tolerate punks like him
with no manners.

265
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:56,299
Accepted.

266
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:00,670
Don't make this into a nasty fight.

267
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,410
You can come this way.

268
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,049
- Why?
- I'm not weak enough...

269
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,349
to need a hostage.

270
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
It's okay.

271
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,289
He always acts like he's so cool.
You can relax.

272
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,059
That's what you call
someone with pride.

273
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,450
(Tax Defaulters)

274
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,400
Have you fallen in love
with that fox?

275
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,910
Or are you possessed by him?

276
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:17,809
I...

277
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,720
What does Lee Yeon mean to me?

278
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,930
I am using Lee Yeon.

279
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,869
I made a deal with him
to find my family,

280
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,670
and put him in danger
to get information from you.

281
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,309
I like that you're honest.

282
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,940
But that doesn't matter anymore.

283
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,049
I just wish he gets rid of you
and your minions so we can leave.

284
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,359
He gets hurt everywhere we go...

285
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,589
because of me.

286
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,059
It's obvious the path you've chosen
will be bumpy.

287
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,099
It doesn't matter.

288
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:11,329
If the path is bumpy, I can
sprinkle flower seeds on it.

289
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,039
You are quite funny.

290
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,740
The rumor was true indeed.

291
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,240
"Rumor"?

292
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,109
However, you will regret
coming to see me.

293
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,319
Who on earth did it?

294
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,349
What kind of idiot brought a phone
to The Underworld of Darkness?

295
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:06,960
I'll leave the tteokbokki here.

296
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,759
That darned...

297
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,829
How can a grim reaper say that?

298
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,630
Shut your mouth and torture him
this instant!

299
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,299
Everyone lacks discipline
these days.

300
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,750
What is this?
It isn't spicy at all.

301
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,250
Honey!

302
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,650
Honey?

303
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,619
Where did he go now
when I'm so busy?

304
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,869
The mirror of the moon?

305
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,670
Are you trying to use
one of the four shields...

306
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,039
of the mountain spirits
meant to protect all creation...

307
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,869
to kill someone?

308
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,809
Then did you use your fox marble
to protect all creation?

309
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,509
Or merely one person?

310
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,890
How about we get rid of
all our items and skills...

311
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,119
and fight bare-handed?

312
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:45,759
Sure.

313
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,210
She seems to be sad
seeing you get hurt.

314
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:04,269
What does she mean to you?

315
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,680
What are you saying? You should
ask something like that...

316
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,480
after drinking
two bottles of soju with me.

317
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:09,750
Isn't that common sense?

318
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,819
I guess you really like her,
seeing you all worked up.

319
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,990
- Shut your mouth.
- You're foolish, Lee Yeon.

320
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,099
How could you have affection
for a human again?

321
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,130
Stop using that lame accent!
It sounds so cringy.

322
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,890
Do you always have to go this far?

323
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:53,190
Since this is how I've lived
all this time...

324
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,759
Goodness, you're so stubborn.

325
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,990
Let me see you.
I told you not to get hurt.

326
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,460
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

327
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,430
Hold on.

328
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:06,000
Get up. Let's go get
some iced Americanos.

329
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,809
I don't drink iced coffee.

330
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,539
What's going on here?

331
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,009
Let me introduce him.
Like I said, he's a mountain spirit.

332
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,319
And also my best friend.

333
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,950
He's originally a black bear.

334
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:29,190
(Granny)

335
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,400
You should answer it.

336
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,869
- I can't live like this anymore.
- There you go again.

337
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,609
I get startled in my sleep
and wake up late.

338
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,339
My heart pounds like crazy
when I think of my wife...

339
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,980
- and I have to go pee.
- Come on.

340
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,309
I don't want to know about
your bladder problems.

341
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,720
When a couple lives together
for thousands of years,

342
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,549
it's natural to grow weary
of each other.

343
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:57,220
- Is that true?
- Those two lovebirds...

344
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:00,720
Gyun Woo and Jik Nyeo
are even thinking of breaking up.

345
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,990
So that's why.

346
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:07,660
No wonder I didn't feel a spark
between them like before.

347
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,869
Why don't you
just tell her honestly?

348
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,740
No way, I'm scared!

349
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,470
What on earth was I thinking...

350
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:20,109
to get married with
King Yeomra's sister?

351
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,079
Why should I eat this?

352
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,049
Since it's samgyetang.
It's healthy and delicious.

353
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,690
Exactly. Why are you buying me this?

354
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,660
I think I misunderstood you.

355
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,700
What if it was not
a misunderstanding?

356
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,869
Out of experience, there aren't
any villains who pity weak animals.

357
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:49,410
I don't like you.

358
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,480
Are you deaf? I don't like you.

359
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,750
Even if you don't like me, I'm sure
you'll like samgyetang. Try it.

360
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,519
Why are you smiling so stupidly
when I said I don't like you?

361
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,789
I heard you can be
as cruel as you want...

362
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:08,759
to those who can't say it's hurt
when they get bitten.

363
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,329
You're just like
the stray dogs I met.

364
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,269
What?

365
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:16,970
Dogs that have been abused
and abandoned...

366
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:19,569
bite people's hands that feed them.

367
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,670
It's because they don't know
how to accept love.

368
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,509
Shut your mouth.

369
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:41,990
Something precious to me?

370
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:44,829
What could that be?

371
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,450
(Lee Rang)

372
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,089
The person you have reached
is not available.

373
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,789
- Is he ignoring me?
- Please leave a message...

374
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,430
He even eats macarons.

375
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,539
It's crispy like a gangjeong,
while chewy like a yakgwa.

376
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,309
Yes. How are you doing these days?

377
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,710
I know you have
a truckload of people to feed.

378
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,349
The minimum wage increased,

379
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,779
and I also bought a house
although I had to get a mortgage.

380
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,079
Except for
the fairy tale characters...

381
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,619
complaining about their
panic disorder, I'm okay.

382
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,859
That sounds tough.

383
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,960
I need to leave soon
to give a performance...

384
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,430
to celebrate
the district magistrate's birthday.

385
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,569
Hey. Have you seen these people?

386
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,609
They went missing 21 years ago.

387
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:13,779
Even something small will be
of help, so if you know anything...

388
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,190
Was it March 3?

389
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,490
Yes. The day of the car accident
was March 3, 1999.

390
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,589
Early that year, a man wearing
a navy suit came to see me.

391
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,160
He told me an accident
would happen on March 3...

392
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,160
at Yeou Gogae.

393
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,470
"A navy suit"?

394
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,299
Do you mean he caused the accident
on purpose?

395
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,009
So?

396
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,140
I don't get involved
when it's about hurting people.

397
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,450
Of course, I didn't send
my men, either.

398
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:44,809
Who was that man?

399
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,180
At first, I thought someone
was in disguise,

400
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,390
but I was wrong.

401
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,049
- Then who?
- It was a human.

402
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,559
- Are you sure?
- He smelled like a human for sure.

403
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,230
Please tell me more in detail.
Everything you remember about him.

404
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,259
My memory of him is so blurry...

405
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,930
that I'm not sure
if I would recognize him now.

406
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,269
He was an ordinary middle-aged man.

407
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,500
But...

408
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,140
his forehead...

409
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:11,539
- "His forehead"?
- It was faint,

410
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,410
but there was a trace of a tattoo
he received as punishment.

411
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,650
(A tattoo marked on criminals
as punishment.)

412
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,880
Do you mean...

413
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,180
a tattoo to mark him as a criminal?

414
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,460
- What did it say?
- West capital.

415
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,259
"West capital".

416
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:30,289
If he got a tattoo on his forehead,

417
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,859
that means he must have lived
before the Joseon Dynasty.

418
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,000
Where could he be right now?

419
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,599
I bet...

420
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,339
he's not too far away.

421
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:43,470
What do you mean?

422
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,940
The target of that accident
wasn't the parents.

423
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,180
- What?
- The target was the daughter.

424
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,690
You're saying no to everything.
What do you want to do?

425
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,029
(Granny)

426
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,599
Darn.

427
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:18,880
Honey! I'm so busy right now.
Hurry up and come over.

428
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,779
Okay, honey. I'm on my way.

429
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:23,079
Please wait. Okay.

430
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,180
- I want a divorce.
- What?

431
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,990
Yes.

432
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:33,160
I'm going to get a divorce!

433
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:34,720
Hey, over there!

434
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,359
"Over there"?

435
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:41,099
- Me?
- You look like...

436
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:42,500
you're old enough to die.

437
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,170
No one cares if you get a divorce,
so can you shut your mouth?

438
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,039
What...

439
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:50,710
Don't you have any manners?

440
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,579
Does she want to get killed?

441
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:57,849
You should let it go.
She's from abroad.

442
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,779
What is the world coming to?

443
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:03,390
Where on earth did he find
that impudent woman?

444
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,390
Don't even bow.

445
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,329
Sir.

446
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,700
- Don't you know who he is?
- I don't care.

447
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,569
He's the gatekeeper of the Styx,

448
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,109
and King Yeomra's brother-in-law.

449
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:25,809
Is it okay to yell in a restaurant
if you're related to King Yeomra?

450
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:29,150
Hurry up and eat.

451
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,019
Gosh, it's hot.

452
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,049
Let me see.

453
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:40,460
Let go of my hand.

454
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,180
About the dog you brought,
her food and house...

455
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,279
I can't take her home.

456
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:08,989
- Then what?
- You should keep her.

457
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,059
If you put her to sleep,
you'll face a painful death.

458
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,329
Does your family not like pets?

459
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:19,230
Not my family. Someone
who rescued me from the zoo.

460
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,030
- They must be your savior.
- Of course.

461
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,170
He just ripped the zookeeper apart.

462
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,340
He killed a human?

463
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,070
Who is your savior?

464
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,409
There is such a person.
You'll get to meet him soon too.

465
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,159
Don't keep that woman near you.

466
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,460
Why not?

467
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,530
According to the man
that came to me,

468
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,000
the girl...

469
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,000
is the king's scale.

470
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,369
The king is nesting inside her.

471
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,789
It's been a while, Lee Yeon.

472
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,329
It's me.
The person you've been waiting for.

473
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,030
Our ill-fated relationship
would've ended there...

474
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:34,239
had you not stopped the boat...

475
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,170
that was crossing the Styx.

476
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,539
Could that have been Ah Eum?

477
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:43,480
Or...

478
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,639
Who is that man?

479
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:53,449
If he's around me,
maybe it's someone I know.

480
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,650
A scar on the forehead?

481
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,889
There isn't anyone like that.

482
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,699
I'll look into it, so...

483
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,059
I don't understand.

484
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:09,929
Why is that man targetting me,

485
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:12,170
and why must our family go through
such a thing because of me?

486
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,340
I'm a nobody.

487
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:20,179
Yeon. Why do you always protect me,

488
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,579
and why won't you...

489
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,510
tell me anything?

490
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,019
I don't...

491
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,659
want you to get hurt.

492
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:43,800
I don't want you
to do anything for me.

493
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,440
I want your life...

494
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:51,139
to have a happy ending.

495
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:52,840
And...

496
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,880
I hope you trust me.

497
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,420
Shall we catch that man first?

498
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
How?

499
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,429
We have quite a strong link.

500
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,539
Why do you keep calling me?

501
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,510
Did you see 22 missed calls or not?

502
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,780
Am I your lover?

503
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,409
I probably didn't pick up
because I was busy.

504
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,510
We need to meet right now.

505
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,550
I wonder what you have
up your sleeve this time.

506
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:36,389
I just miss you.

507
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,989
I'm 99.9 percent sure
that it's a scheme. I'm busy. Bye.

508
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,519
Why are you so busy?

509
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:44,360
Where are you right now?

510
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:50,199
By the way, do you think
your brother will talk that easily?

511
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,130
- Of course not.
- Then?

512
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:55,670
We'll have to make him
find that man himself.

513
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:58,010
How?

514
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:04,579
Hey, Mr. Artist.

515
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,179
Let me borrow this.

516
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:20,429
Does that mean "to find"?

517
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:24,570
Find the man who has
the sinner's symbol on his forehead.

518
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,940
What was that?

519
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,710
You can call it a talisman.
This will guide Rang to that man.

520
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,289
There's only one chance.

521
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,159
Today, you must not lose sight
of Rang no matter what.

522
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:50,360
Okay. I won't.

523
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,539
Go in.

524
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,190
Hi.

525
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,000
Why are you ignoring me?

526
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,329
Have you forgotten
about the funeral hall?

527
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:35,400
Thanks to you,
Yeon returned as a wreck.

528
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,940
That's how brothers are.

529
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,210
By the way, the hanbok suits you.

530
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,219
That suit looks horrendous on you.

531
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:50,250
You're rather cranky today.
You're giving me butterflies.

532
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:53,159
You always look like
you need a urine test.

533
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:54,389
You look worthless.

534
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:58,090
What are you doing here?

535
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,260
Well, I'm definitely not here
on a field trip...

536
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,400
for performance assessment.

537
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,860
If you are, you'll definitely fail.

538
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,070
Hey, geezer.

539
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,239
I had to check something.

540
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,239
You're back.

541
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,369
What are you scheming?

542
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,239
I doubt you actually took him
for a real fortune teller.

543
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,519
He's obviously a scam
wearing a fake mustache.

544
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,789
It's real.

545
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,820
He only spewed nonsense.

546
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:27,420
That's his disguise, you fool.

547
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,760
Appraise him. I doubt
he's of any value to me, though.

548
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:02,420
You're right. He's the most
valuable thing you have.

549
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,760
Your brother.

550
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:08,599
Darn it.

551
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:19,070
Bye.

552
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:20,980
What is this?

553
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:25,409
Call it human trafficking,
if you will.

554
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,420
You're impossible.

555
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,880
I'll explain later.

556
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,590
After all, all you have is time.

557
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,860
I'll see you again later.

558
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:36,929
Should I go?

559
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,539
- Where are my shoes?
- I don't know.

560
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,280
Is he a child or what?

561
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,780
He becomes immature
when I least expect it.

562
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,510
You're not going anywhere.

563
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:27,639
Go first.

564
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,110
Okay.

565
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,579
- Let me go.
- You're mine.

566
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,449
- Says who?
- This was a deal.

567
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,619
It's an unfair one.

568
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:45,429
Hurry.

569
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,000
If you're trying to deceive me,
you should at least...

570
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:08,079
Leave. I'm closing down.

571
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:09,920
What about Yeon?

572
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,250
He's part of my collection now.

573
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,199
Will you be here tomorrow?

574
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,570
I only come when I want...

575
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,300
and go where I want to go.

576
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:28,739
There's only one chance.

577
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,639
Today, you must not lose sight
of Rang no matter what.

578
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,389
Early that year, a man wearing
a navy suit came to see me.

579
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,119
This will guide Rang to that man.

580
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,960
Have you fallen in love
with that fox?

581
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:55,199
I want your life
to have a happy ending.

582
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,099
I hope you trust me.

583
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,309
- Let him go.
- No.

584
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,909
We have rules.

585
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,139
- Please. sir.
- What is that?

586
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:12,110
- Wait.
- There's no use in this.

587
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,420
Tell me how I can get him back.

588
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,489
The rules are the same.

589
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:20,190
I'll swap him
for your most valuable possession.

590
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,590
I'll buy him.

591
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,730
I'll buy Yeon.

592
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,780
What will you offer?

593
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,880
If you don't return by 9pm,
this deal...

594
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:20,250
will be terminated.

595
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,289
I have 1 hour and 40 minutes
until then.

596
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,019
What could it be?

597
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,260
What is the most valuable item
to me?

598
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:55,179
Think.

599
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,449
Find it.

600
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,360
When the sun sets

601
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:10,530
I get off work

602
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:14,400
So why am I still here?

603
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:30,619
Excuse me. Please open the gate.

604
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,949
Excuse me!

605
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,960
Excuse me.

606
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,239
Please open the gate! Excuse me!

607
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,769
Is anyone there? Excuse me!

608
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,679
Sir!

609
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,630
The district magistrate?

610
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,199
I recognized your voice.

611
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,030
It seems urgent.

612
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,340
Thank you.

613
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,110
Thank you!

614
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,190
Wait.

615
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,260
Good.

616
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:45,929
So what is the most
precious thing to you?

617
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,130
This.

618
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,300
A broken music box?

619
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,369
It still works though.

620
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:09,949
It's the last birthday gift
my parents gave me.

621
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,989
Is that all?

622
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,639
It's been exactly 21 years...

623
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,269
since they went missing.

624
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:34,139
To be honest, my memory
keeps fading every year.

625
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,949
I'm confused about whether...

626
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,750
what I experienced was true
or merely a dream.

627
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:44,550
There's blood on it.

628
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:46,320
That's why I was able
to endure it...

629
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,329
thinking what I saw that day...

630
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:52,289
might not be a dream,

631
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:55,099
so they may be alive.

632
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,699
So it's the last item that
connects you to your parents?

633
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,510
I'll appraise its value.

634
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,710
What brings you here at this hour?

635
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,110
Wait a minute.

636
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,119
Why am I here?

637
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,320
What do you mean?

638
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:56,119
No, it's nothing.
Sorry for disturbing you.

639
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:09,199
Don't tell me that punk...

640
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:16,039
(To find)

641
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,460
The deal...

642
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,699
- is off.
- What?

643
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,130
This won't be enough.

644
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,500
Why? Why not?

645
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,340
I'm not the one
that judges its value.

646
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:46,340
Please tell me.

647
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,210
What do I have to do?

648
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,949
And what can I do?

649
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,550
My goodness, you're so bothersome.

650
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,590
I promise I'll repay you.

651
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,989
- Please?
- Okay, fine.

652
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,860
Do you think
you're still a princess?

653
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,300
You think whining will
get you anything. Goodness.

654
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,110
Your hand.

655
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,010
Give me your hand.

656
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,710
- Your left hand.
- Here.

657
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,090
You were born
with a very special destiny.

658
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:38,690
Water and fire are mixed.

659
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:43,059
And it's covered by dirt,
but you can see gold on it.

660
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,000
Although it's pitch dark everywhere,

661
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,769
your sky will be lit by the moon.

662
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,840
What does that mean?

663
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:51,539
You have the fox marble.

664
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,949
That is your moon.

665
00:52:57,449 --> 00:52:58,550
What?

666
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,050
Give me the marble.

667
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:04,590
Give me the marble.

668
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,559
Even without the moon,
you are already fortunate.

669
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,630
- So...
- I'll give it to you.

670
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,429
I don't believe in destiny anyway.

671
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,429
The deal...

672
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,730
is done.

673
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,570
What? Already?

674
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,969
The lines on your palm.

675
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,210
They have changed.

676
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:59,340
The fox marble has disappeared.

677
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,750
How could you beat up that old man
as soon as you came out?

678
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,849
He deserved it. How dare he treat me
like that when he's younger than me?

679
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:12,090
I'm much older than him.

680
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,059
How did you do it?

681
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,630
What do you think? I bought you.

682
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,360
With what?

683
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:28,199
Don't tell me you gave up
10 years of your life or something.

684
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,869
No. I bought it
for quite a cheap price.

685
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,179
So you're mine now.

686
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:43,050
I'm quite the materialistic type,

687
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,349
so I won't gift you freedom
so easily like Aladdin.

688
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,829
You're even worse than Jafar.

689
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:07,610
Why didn't you go after Lee Rang?

690
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,510
It must've been a precious chance
to find your parents.

691
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,750
To be honest,
I was caught in a dilemma.

692
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:20,190
It could've been my last chance,

693
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,789
and I wasn't sure
if I wouldn't regret it.

694
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:25,929
- So why did you choose me?
- Because I was sure about it...

695
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,630
and you seemed reliable.

696
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:32,769
Seemed like you will
bring my life a happy ending.

697
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,349
What are you thinking about?

698
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,219
In life,

699
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,090
there are many moments in life
when a child needs their parents.

700
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,199
For example,
when they first start to walk.

701
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,070
Who else gets so excited
besides their parents...

702
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,940
when they start getting up
to take a few steps?

703
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:10,739
When was that moment for you?

704
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,480
For me...

705
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:19,710
When I was the only one who didn't
have gimbap on a picnic...

706
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:22,219
or when a friend of mine said...

707
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,550
she'd tell her mom
after fighting with me.

708
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,960
I couldn't beat anyone
who had a mom.

709
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,260
Too bad. I could've beat them up
for you.

710
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,929
I blamed them so much.

711
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,400
Why did they leave me behind?

712
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:42,070
Why aren't they coming back?

713
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,869
But it turned out it was
all because of me.

714
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,539
That accident happened
because of me...

715
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,949
and my parent's lives were ruined
because of me.

716
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,519
You can cry if you want.

717
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,860
No. I want to eat chicken feet.

718
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:09,860
Are you okay?

719
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:12,369
I'm not okay.

720
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:15,170
I'm going to eat spicy food
and weep.

721
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:19,110
I want to be confused about
what caused my tears.

722
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,480
It could be because
my body and soul are tired,

723
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,739
or it could be
because of the spiciness.

724
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,309
That's pretty cool.

725
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,349
What?

726
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,389
I was worried that you
would act like you're okay.

727
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,420
I'm glad.

728
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:39,429
I was worried I might look cute
when I wanted to look cool.

729
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,630
- You should eat.
- Is it good?

730
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:49,699
- It's not as spicy as I thought.
- I see.

731
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,579
Is this spicy to you?

732
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,349
No.

733
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,679
Something just went in my eyes.

734
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,489
You can't eat spicy food, can you?

735
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,619
Of course I can.

736
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,260
Do you think I'd be weak
with spicy food?

737
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:20,369
Just leave it. This is a fight...

738
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,739
between chicken feet and me.

739
00:58:51,429 --> 00:58:53,099
Where are you going at this hour?

740
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,340
Well...

741
00:58:57,269 --> 00:58:59,639
I have somewhere to drop by.

742
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,679
Goodnight, then.

743
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,320
Hey, Yeon.

744
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:19,730
Don't be so nice to me.

745
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,429
It scares me.

746
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:27,769
If you're nice,
I'd want to rely on you.

747
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,039
If I rely on you,

748
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,480
I think I'll become too weak.

749
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,650
Is this how you have been living?

750
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,530
I'll promise you.

751
00:59:57,699 --> 00:59:59,730
All you have to do
is find your family...

752
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,699
and live like nothing happened.

753
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,909
When the time comes,

754
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:08,340
you'll forget about meeting me...

755
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:10,809
and seeing my world.

756
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,050
You'll be able to live...

757
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:20,150
like an ordinary person.

758
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,969
You scared me.

759
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:33,170
Make a sound when you come,
will you?

760
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,610
Granny, you know the truth
about everything, don't you?

761
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,880
About what?

762
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:49,380
Imoogi.

763
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,659
It didn't die.

764
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,300
Everything is determined by
the principle of cause and effect.

765
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:17,670
Enough with the nonsense.

766
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:23,110
She woke him up from his long sleep.

767
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:26,150
And you're the one who went
looking for her...

768
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,420
when I told you not to.

769
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:28,780
You mean he's alive.

770
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:31,719
He is.

771
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,420
Then...

772
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:40,090
what did I fight for back then?

773
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,230
Why did Ah Eum
have to risk her life?

774
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,599
That's what the two of you chose.

775
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:53,570
Where is he right now?

776
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,980
I warned you.

777
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,949
A human and a spirit
can't be together.

778
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,190
- Tell me.
- Your obsession...

779
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,190
- will call for trouble.
- I said, tell me!

780
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:28,110
Hello.

781
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:46,590
The one that came out
from the well...

782
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:49,329
vanished as soon as he came out.

783
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:55,469
We just found a piece of him.

784
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,510
What?

785
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:47,590
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

786
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,659
I promised. I'm going to protect her
with my life.

787
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,489
The thing about love is,

788
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,530
you could get swallowed up
when you let your guard down.

789
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:58,769
Yeon became important to me too.

790
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:04,239
Imoogi is definitely related
to Rang.

791
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:07,809
If you touch her,
I'll kill you this time.

792
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,050
Don't get involved. Do you
want the tragedy to repeat itself?

793
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,510
If I don't go, she'll get hurt.

794
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:16,449
Whether it's you or her,
one of you will die.
