I knew it.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,659
He only cares about her.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,329
Hey, kid!

11
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:05,400
Yeon?

12
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,579
I just heard you badmouthing me.

13
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,480
Move.

14
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,680
I don't think this is the time
to play hard to get.

15
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,150
You're not him.

16
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,290
There's no way Yeon would come
to rescue me.

17
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,560
That's true.

18
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,819
Show me something to prove
you're Yeon.

19
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,430
A proof? Do you need me to show you
my ID or something?

20

The first full moon of
the lunar new year. Jwibulnori.

21
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,329
We had fun playing
with fire that day,

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,340
and you wet the bed that night.

23
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,370
- For three years after that...
- Be quiet.

24
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,170
I called you a bed wetter!

25
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,189
- I'll kill you.
- Kill these guys first.

26
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:16,539
Run!

27
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,669
Mom?

28
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,810
Dad?

29
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,080
Ji A received...

30
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,120
hypnotherapy today.

31
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,289
What did Dr. Kang say?

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,689
They've never seen
a case like this before.

33
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,689
I know I shouldn't be like this,

34
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,530
but I'm scared.

35
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,370
Will we be able
to protect our daughter?

36
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,569
Will I do a good job?

37
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,750
Mom.

38
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,360
Mom?

39
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,389
Did you wake up, Ji A?

40
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,639
I was going to give this to you
once we get home,

41
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,469
but here.
It's your birthday present.

42
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,389
"Birthday present"?

43
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,759
The music box...

44
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,399
No way.

(Yeou Gogae)

46
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,579
"Yeou Gogae"?

47
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,319
We can't go there.

48
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,959
Do you like your present?

49
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,189
We'll get into an accident
if we keep going this way.

50
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,730
- Stop the car!
- Once you get all better,

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,500
the three of us will go
and ride the merry-go-round again.

52
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,500
Dad, can't you hear me?

53
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,370
I said, stop the car.

54
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,170
Dad.

55
00:04:58,569 --> 00:04:59,639
Mom.

56
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,819
They keep on coming back to life.
Were starving ghosts always strong?

57
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,459
- I think it's us who got weak.
- What are you saying?

58
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,009
I can't bring the thunder
and lightning,

59
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,269
and rain won't budge either.

60
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,980
Do you mean your powers
aren't working?

61
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,779
Where could we be right now?

62
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,990
Don't you know where?

63
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,990
We're at
the Forest of Starving Ghosts.

64
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,290
I'm not sure.

65
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,680
Dad, stop the car.

66
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,350
Dad, stop the car.

67
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,019
Stop the car. Dad!

(Episode 9: Ouduksini)

69
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,180
This was unexpected.

70
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:54,949
I thought he'd run over to the girl,

71
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,120
but he went to his little brother.

72
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,959
I thought the two of them
hated each other.

73
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,490
Mountain spirits
shouldn't be looked down on.

74
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,660
What?

75
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,129
He's playing mind games with me.

76
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:11,040
Don't tell me
he went there on purpose.

77
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,769
He probably noticed.

78
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,839
It looks like we're testing
the two of them with it,

79
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,850
but it's also a test on Yeon.

80
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:29,949
This is driving me crazy.

81
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,230
Hey, how do you think
that vegetable juice lady knew...

82
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,360
I can't ride planes?

83
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,860
- You really can't?
- What happens if you do?

84
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,730
At first, I couldn't breathe,
then I got cold sweats.

85
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,300
After I put on my seatbelt,
I lost consciousness.

86
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,439
What did she say exactly?

87
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:49,439
She asked me what I fear
the most in the world.

88
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,639
What you fear the most?

89
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,110
Could it be...

90
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,180
My gosh.

91
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,379
What is it?

92
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:00,949
A similar ghost story has been
going around on the Internet.

93
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,189
(Do you know about the ghost story
of the vegetable juice lady?)

94
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:04,420
"Vegetable juice lady ghost story"?

95
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,660
It has a similar pattern, right?

96
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,129
She gives out vegetable juices
and asks you what you fear.

97
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,759
We believe it's another city myth...

98
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,600
like the Hong Kong Granny Ghost.

99
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,670
What's interesting is that if you
get bewitched by this lady,

100
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,040
you can hear music.

101
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,040
- "Music"?
- Did you hear one?

102
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,740
- No.
- This is the song.

103
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,649
♪Gatekeeper, open the gate
I don't have a key♪

104
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:30,509
Hey, this is a part
of "Ganggangsullae".

105
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,149
When you keep on listening to it,
the lyrics are terrifying.

106
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,990
One asks for the gate to be open,
while the other says there's no key.

107
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,360
The whole song
is just these two lines.

108
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,490
This is good.

109
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,960
Did anyone actually hear this song?

110
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,360
We couldn't cover it
since we couldn't find anyone.

111
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,500
Why not?

112
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,470
They say once you hear the song,

113
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,769
you can't wake up.

114
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,909
- Forever?
- Forever.

115
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,340
No way.

116
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:00,610
- You surprised me.
- Is this the ghost stories team?

117
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,879
- Ji A! What's wrong?
- Ms. Nam!

118
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,279
- Hey. Open your eyes.
- What's wrong?

119
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,889
Ji A, what's wrong?

120
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:11,120
Call for help.

121
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,070
Mr. Lee. Wake up.

122
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:29,570
Mr. Lee.

123
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,379
Mr. Lee!

124
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,590
Mr. Lee!

125
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,159
Mr. Lee!

126
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,399
She's probably passed Yeou Gogae
by now, right?

127
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,299
Will I be able...

128
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,970
to save both of them
from this Underworld?

129
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,110
I truly hope
I've made the right decision.

130
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,659
This is the only way...

131
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,559
you can say thank you
for saving your life, isn't it?

132
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,370
What are you scheming?

133
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:03,970
Isn't it obvious?

134
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,470
Why are you here?

135
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,009
I doubt you came
to actually save me.

136
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,940
I just had some free time.

137
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,480
I thought I'd swing by
to see my one and only brother...

138
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,149
go to the Afterlife.

139
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,720
Don't be ridiculous.
Why did you choose me over her?

140
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,190
That's a great question.

141
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,259
I got the doors mixed up.

142
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,330
You liar.

143
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,259
I swear I was on my way to Ji A.

144
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,970
But when I arrived,
I saw a bed wetter dying.

145
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,889
- What happened?
- They bit me.

146
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,690
I guess I looked delicious.

147
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Not only are you bleeding,
but you're running a high fever.

148
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,600
I guess the poison has spread.

149
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,250
It'll take a maximum of one hour
until the poison consumes his body.

150
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,450
I need to get him out of here
before then.

151
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,820
I told you...

152
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,590
not to hang with that Imoogi.

153
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,659
Don't act like a big brother now.
It's despicable.

154
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,360
You scumbag!

155
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,070
Run for your life.

156
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,750
How can we wake him up?

157
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,049
We can't.

158
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,250
I tried everything I could,

159
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:05,360
but I couldn't wake
my late husband up.

160
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,029
- Are you sure it was the same one?
- Yes.

161
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,399
Back then, she was disguised
as a peddler.

162
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,299
She'd carry
twinkling items around...

163
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,340
and ask what people's fears were.

164
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,970
She bewitched them.

165
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,009
My late husband feared tigers
the most.

166
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,309
Were those not hallucinations?

167
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,519
I thought he was seeing
and hearing things.

168
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,190
But Sin Ju,

169
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,659
I witnessed it.

170
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,990
I saw him get attacked by a tiger.

171
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,730
It ripped into his bones and flesh.

172
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,529
Oh, no.

173
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,840
Mr. Lee, please wake up.

174
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,940
Mr. Lee!

175
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,379
What should I do?

176
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,059
Her name.

177
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:17,389
What's her name?

178
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,629
Ouduksini.

179
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,529
Ouduksini?

180
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,269
It feeds off...

181
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,940
our darkest fears.

182
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,909
Ji A.

183
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,710
Ji A?

184
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,250
Ji A.

185
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:49,429
Mom?

186
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,029
Sweetie, get up
and have some breakfast.

187
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,370
Why are you here?

188
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,539
What do you mean? It's Sunday.

189
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:05,409
Did you work overtime
last night too?

190
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,580
What kind of company sends you
on a business trip...

191
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,179
then makes you work late hours
right afterward?

192
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,850
Company?

193
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,860
What kind of company do I work for?

194
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,090
- Are you still half asleep?
- Answer me.

195
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,860
You're a television producer...

196
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,200
who gets dragged around
by the Press Arbitration Commission.

197
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,639
Why did I become a producer
in the first place?

198
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,070
- That's because...
- To find my parents.

199
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:39,139
At Yeou Gogae in 1999, my life...

200
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,149
No. My family...

201
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,279
was torn apart.

202
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,350
What are you talking about?

203
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,519
You're not my mom.

204
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,659
You won't fool me twice.

205
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,669
Cut this nonsense
and come have breakfast.

206
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:07,169
You're having so much fun
teasing me.

207
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:10,139
What?

208
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,240
At least, leave that accident
out of your jokes.

209
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,179
Seeing you in a coma for years...

210
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,110
broke our hearts.

211
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,350
I was...

212
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:22,789
in a coma?

213
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,919
Every time I went to the hospital
to get injections,

214
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,919
what did you give me?

215
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,259
Strawberry candies.

216
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,599
Now, come out and eat.

217
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,500
Wait.

218
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,410
What is it this time?

219
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,539
I want...

220
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,349
some walnut cakes.

221
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,450
Walnut cakes?

222
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:34,960
Mom, I want...

223
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:36,890
some walnut cakes.

224
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,130
We don't have any walnut cakes.

225
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,329
I'm allergic to nuts
and was hospitalized before.

226
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,269
Right. I forgot.

227
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,009
You're not my mom.

228
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,809
Where's my mom?

229
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,240
I am your mom.

230
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,269
Walnut cakes, my foot.

231
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,039
Goodness, you.
You're allergic to nuts.

232
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,259
A family reunion.

233
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,700
That's nice.

234
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,029
I guess those are her real parents.

235
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,839
It just means
that there's something else...

236
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,970
that she's more afraid of.

237
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,910
Then and now,

238
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,240
her family has always been
her weakness.

239
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,549
Is it getting colder?

240
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,789
We're inside her subconsciousness
right now.

241
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,319
I guess we're not welcomed...

242
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,630
since we are strangers here.

243
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,529
Let's get out of here.

244
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,609
Gosh, it's cheese cake.

245
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,779
Did you see it?

246
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,180
It didn't go as planned.

247
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,319
Lee Yeon didn't show up.

248
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,390
Why are you already back then?

249
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,230
No matter how hard he tries,
he won't get out alive.

250
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,460
Once it's out in the open,

251
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,230
a person's heart
is much vulnerable than they think.

252
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,029
Since it's a world made by
the wounds...

253
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,299
they kept buried in their hearts
all their lives.

254
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,900
But if they die in there,
will they really die?

255
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,680
Do you want to try it too?

256
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:09,380
Let go!

257
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,180
- Ouduksini.
- Yes?

258
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:14,420
Don't touch my things.

259
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,319
I was kidding.

260
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,089
Please forgive me.

261
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,400
You just said something
inside your head after that.

262
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:31,400
"Even if he's Imoogi, he's been
asleep for more than 600 years."

263
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,170
"I'm sure he is not
as good as before."

264
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,440
"Go on...

265
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,309
and test me."

266
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,150
I'm curious too.

267
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,420
How dare I think such a thing?

268
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,890
Please forgive me.

269
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,000
Please forgive me.

270
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,140
Can you please hug me?

271
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,150
Mom.

272
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,349
My lovely mom.

273
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,390
It's okay if this is a dream.

274
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,859
Don't leave me.

275
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:30,930
Please don't leave me here alone.

276
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,400
Did you have a nightmare again?

277
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,730
Yes.

278
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,940
I hope it's all a dream.

279
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,849
What did you dream about?

280
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,049
I dreamed about...

281
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,480
losing you and Dad.

282
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,390
Why are you crying
when it's just a dream?

283
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,460
I'm sorry...

284
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:10,400
for surviving on my own.

285
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,579
I endured it all this time
so bravely,

286
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,049
but actually,
I was so scared and lonely.

287
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,519
I didn't want to go home,
so on some days,

288
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:35,059
I just sat at the bus stop
for hours.

289
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,859
I'm sorry, Mom.

290
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:43,369
To be honest,

291
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,410
sometimes I blamed you and Dad.

292
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:51,539
You left me all alone...

293
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:55,049
and no matter how much I waited,
you didn't come.

294
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,450
You didn't forget about me, did you?

295
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:07,559
How could I forget...

296
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,460
such a pretty daughter?

297
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,630
I missed you, Mom.

298
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,259
We're going around in circles.

299
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:45,630
I don't have time to waste.

300
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:48,369
Is Ji A safe?

301
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,670
Please hang in there a bit longer.

302
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,339
Let go.

303
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,240
It's not the time to be stubborn
because of your pride.

304
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,549
I'm a dead man without my pride.

305
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,849
You practically look dead already.

306
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,490
Have you heard of the term
"phantom limb"?

307
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,930
The symptom when a soldier
who lost his leg during the war...

308
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:22,170
imagines that his leg hurts
all night?

309
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:24,700
The moment he feels pain
even without a leg...

310
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,539
is when the real pain starts.

311
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,970
And when the pain starts,
the door is already gone.

312
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,579
This is the world she shows you.

313
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:40,250
♪Gatekeeper, open the door♪

314
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,089
♪I don't have a key♪

315
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,990
- What is it?
- I can't walk anymore.

316
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,400
The poison has spread already,
and I can barely see.

317
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm tired of dragging this leg along
with me.

318
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:58,470
So?

319
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,269
You'll sit here and get eaten
by starving ghosts?

320
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:06,079
Go to your woman.
I'm hopeless anyway.

321
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,490
You haven't changed a bit.

322
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,420
It's the same as
when I first met you.

323
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,859
You still give up easily
and whine like a baby.

324
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,200
How could life and death
be so simple to you?

325
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,569
Since nothing's precious to me.

326
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,740
I don't have a first love
I must protect like you...

327
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:36,509
nor a family that she's
desperately waiting for.

328
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,309
I have nothing.

329
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,549
I came for nothing.

330
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,690
Back then, and now.

331
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:58,559
I heard you shared my father's blood
and came to see you.

332
00:25:58,859 --> 00:25:59,859
I'm disappointed.

333
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,000
You don't even have the willpower
to live.

334
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,930
I came for nothing.

335
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,839
See you.

336
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,809
If I die,

337
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:15,680
bury me in the forest
near Baekdudaegan.

338
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,150
Am I your will or what?

339
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,799
I want to go back to that time.

340
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,099
The land was full of azalea flowers.

341
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:43,769
It's strange.

342
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:48,039
I can't remember the taste
of those flowers...

343
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,210
I used to pluck and eat back then.

344
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,190
If you can't remember the taste,

345
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,089
survive and go pluck some more,
you idiot!

346
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:07,829
You should at least make an effort
to live!

347
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,839
Tell me the truth.
Why did you come here?

348
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:18,309
To save you and Ji A.

349
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:20,910
- You expect me to believe that?
- Then don't believe me!

350
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,849
I almost died after you stabbed me.

351
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,789
You slaughtered everyone
in a whole village.

352
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,519
- You deserved it.
- I know.

353
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,190
Why are you trying to save someone
you tried to kill?

354
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,299
Listen carefully.

355
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:50,039
My sword has never missed.

356
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,339
I...

357
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,609
have never missed a target.

358
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:02,950
Think carefully about
how you survived...

359
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,990
with that stupid head of yours.

360
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,329
I'm leaving,
and I'm never coming back.

361
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,680
Boat number four just left the port
on the Styx, right?

362
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,849
Tell the captain to turn back.

363
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:11,619
Yes. An elderly person
in the ICU with a respirator...

364
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,990
just died.

365
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,799
Where were we?

366
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,630
- Ouduksini.
- "Ouduksini"?

367
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,500
Is it still wandering in this world?

368
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,210
After seeing Ouduksini,
Yeon and Ah Eum...

369
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,670
I mean Yeon and Ms. Nam
both fainted.

370
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:36,180
Please tell me how I can save them.

371
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,319
You're not capable.

372
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,220
The woman is with her family,

373
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,990
and Yeon went
to the Forest of Starving Ghosts.

374
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,160
"The Forest of Starving Ghosts"?

375
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
He probably went
to save his brother.

376
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,359
- Is Rang in trouble too?
- By the way,

377
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,970
were the two of them this close?

378
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:00,700
That's not important right now.

379
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,109
- To me, that's important.
- Honey.

380
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,640
He makes trouble for himself.

381
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,880
He tends to dig his own grave.

382
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:12,349
That's why he was a mountain spirit.

383
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,279
A mountain spirit takes
even a single clump of grass...

384
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:16,720
growing on his mountain personally.

385
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,250
Rang is still his brother.

386
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,319
Sure, they're related by blood,
but that doesn't matter.

387
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,660
Rang committed too many crimes.

388
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,160
How can you be so...

389
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,099
Please save them, ma'am.

390
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,400
You can take my life instead.

391
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,869
What a show.

392
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,079
Why would you give up your life
for Yeon and Rang?

393
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,839
If you tell me the way to save them,

394
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:46,250
I promise to do everything you ask.

395
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,720
"Everything"?

396
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:10,210
Your life isn't that long.

397
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,910
How could you exchange your life
for that piece of cloth?

398
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,849
This must be what Yeon wants.

399
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,250
Both you and Yeon are crazy.
Is it a fox thing?

400
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,089
I don't get it.

401
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:29,230
Why did he go to Rang
instead of Ms. Nam?

402
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:34,029
This world was made through
the knots in our hearts.

403
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,130
And for both sides,
that means family.

404
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:40,539
If she met her family
she was desperate to find,

405
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,710
there would be no space
for anyone else to barge in.

406
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,980
Even if he goes there,
there's no way he can get in.

407
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,519
Do you mean...

408
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,019
Yeon knew what he was getting into.

409
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:04,259
He knows who he's dealing with.

410
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,500
Is there even an exit?

411
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,470
If there's a way in,
there must be a way out.

412
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,569
I came in through a closet.

413
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,710
When I opened the closet door,
I was at our old thatched house.

414
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:23,779
You weren't
at the Forest of Starving Ghosts?

415
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,750
No.

416
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:28,279
Tell me everything you saw there.

417
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:32,559
At first, our neighbors swarmed in
with bats.

418
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,529
Mom was watching me get beat up.

419
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,859
- After that...
- You were in the forest.

420
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,730
Yes.

421
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,769
No wonder. I see.

422
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,700
That's why
we couldn't find the door.

423
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,440
What do you mean?

424
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,880
- Don't you know who that lady was?
- Do you know her?

425
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,079
She prepared a party for you
with your most painful memories.

426
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,150
Could she be...

427
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,190
What was the name again?

428
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,349
Ouduksini.

429
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:05,890
"Ouduksini".

430
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,289
(Missing after a car accident
at Yeou Gogae in 1999)

431
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,529
This place...

432
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,500
looks like my room, but it's not.

433
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:54,569
Where...

434
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:56,970
am I right now?

435
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,779
What is that sound?

436
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,039
Ms. Kim.

437
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,980
What did the doctor say?

438
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,420
They ran all kinds of tests,
but they don't know what it is.

439
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:45,960
What on earth is going on?

440
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:49,989
Ji A. Open your eyes.
Please, wake up.

441
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,340
I was at the office...

442
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,840
just a moment ago.

443
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,719
(Office lounge)

444
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,119
The vegetable juice lady.

445
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,690
Miss, what is your biggest fear?

446
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,800
I guess it must be Yeou Gogae.

447
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,000
Yes. After I met her,

448
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,869
I jumped to Yeou Gogae.

449
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:41,610
(Where is this place?)

450
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,380
Then, this place must be...

451
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:53,860
Hey. Are you going to starve
your parents to death?

452
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:57,360
- Dad?
- We're hungry.

453
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,429
Dad.

454
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,400
Gosh, princess.

455
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,800
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

456
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:08,969
Let's go.

457
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,349
(Where is this place?)

458
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,360
There's no way out.

459
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,460
Go over it.

460
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,670
Not with this leg.

461
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,769
There's a path and a door
where our fears end.

462
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,010
- I don't see any doors.
- Don't be a coward!

463
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,679
Don't be a coward and think.
What do you fear the most?

464
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,619
Me?

465
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:55,079
What I fear the most...

466
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:58,550
is being abandoned.

467
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:02,559
Mom abandoned me,

468
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,030
and so did you.

469
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,869
You're driving me crazy.

470
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,570
I...

471
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,670
never abandoned you.

472
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,460
I see it.

473
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,739
Let's go.

474
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,860
You have to survive.

475
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:20,170
Climb!

476
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,119
Don't look at her!

477
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:42,090
She's not your mom! Don't look!

478
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,400
Mom?

479
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,539
Darn it.

480
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,769
Darn it!

481
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,219
No!

482
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,219
Mr. Lee!

483
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,760
I have to go.

484
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,960
Where?

485
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,760
Where are you going?

486
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,099
To Yeon.

487
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,400
To Yeon.

488
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,630
To Yeon.

489
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,139
Where are you going?

490
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:02,539
To Yeon.

491
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:04,539
I have to go to him.

492
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,039
Gimbap.

493
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,679
Dad made them.

494
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,949
You're right.
It's gimbap once again.

495
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,650
The ends are the tastiest.

496
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,519
- Have them first.
- Shall I add some sesame seeds?

497
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:20,090
Let's eat.

498
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,389
All right. This is the best part.

499
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,760
Is it good?

500
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,260
It's good.

501
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,800
Sweetie.

502
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,500
Thank you for the meal.

503
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,440
This is really good.

504
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:56,730
Spinach, carrots, cucumber, ham,
and pickled radish.

505
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,530
What's wrong? Is it not tasty?

506
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,400
That's not why.

507
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,900
The ingredients are nothing special,
but it's strange.

508
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,940
This is unlike any other gimbap
out there.

509
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:12,039
That's a compliment, right?
It is, right?

510
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,380
My daughter
just complimented me. Yes.

511
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,809
I feel so happy.

512
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:20,579
- Eat up.
- Okay.

513
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:23,289
I think it's really tasty.

514
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:24,320
Really? Thanks.

515
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,920
Suddenly, a thought crossed my mind.

516
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:32,429
Perhaps, the life I've led
up until now...

517
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:33,760
was just a long nightmare...

518
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,969
and this was reality.

519
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:43,170
If this is just a dream,

520
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,010
please don't wake up.

521
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:55,219
(Office lounge, vegetable juice,
Yeou Gogae, where is this place?)

522
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,829
What's going on?

523
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,130
- Is something wrong?
- Hey.

524
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,599
- Ji A, wake up.
- Hey. Hold on.

525
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,570
Doctor!

526
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,369
- Wait.
- Is there a doctor?

527
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:13,769
Where's the doctor?

528
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:16,309
- This way.
- Okay.

529
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,940
This is good.

530
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,780
I spilled some.

531
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,409
Look at your dad. My gosh. There.

532
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,579
Thank you.

533
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,219
This is good.

534
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:33,489
Whose face was that?

535
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,159
Who was that?

536
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,829
Is this tastier than the ones
I made before we got married?

537
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,460
I can't remember.

538
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:45,429
Why can't you?
I've made so many for you.

539
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,170
You made them
because you had no money.

540
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,639
Don't be late.

541
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,210
If you are, they'll be lost
in that world forever.

542
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,650
We didn't do anything.
We were just watching her.

543
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,159
Where did she go?

544
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,119
- What's going on?
- What is this?

545
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:27,710
This is the best I can do.

546
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,579
Please come back.

547
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:46,099
You had made your first carnation
in kindergarten.

548
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,960
You know, that safety pin...

549
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:50,170
You pricked my chest with it,

550
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,199
and I bled profusely.

551
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,599
- I did that?
- Yes.

552
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,039
You were such an amazing daughter.

553
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:58,170
Don't you still have it?

554
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,579
I kept it safe with me.

555
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,780
Ta-da.

556
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:05,710
"I love you, Mom and Dad."

557
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,119
You kept it all along?

558
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:09,349
Of course, it's our family heirloom.

559
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:11,090
Goodness. Let me see it.

560
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,219
It's still in great quality.

561
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,030
Of course. It's precious to me.

562
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,659
- What else is there?
- It fits perfectly...

563
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,170
- around your finger.
- Someone's calling.

564
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,429
- How cute.
- Look at her hands.

565
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,769
- I know. I feel nostalgic.
- Goodness.

566
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:29,769
- Do you not hear that?
- She looked so pretty.

567
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,170
Look at all that baby hair.

568
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:32,980
I know, right?

569
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,510
- Here too.
- I know.

570
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,150
- How adorable.
- How long ago was this?

571
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,389
Hello?

572
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,760
It's me.

573
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:27,260
Who?

574
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,599
Lee Yeon.

575
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,670
Lee Yeon?

576
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:36,170
I'm sorry I couldn't go.

577
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:39,369
Who are you?

578
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,010
You sound familiar,
but I can't seem to remember you.

579
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,480
You must.

580
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:50,849
Be aware of your surroundings
and why you're there.

581
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,489
Only then will you be able
to come back to reality.

582
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,230
What do you mean?

583
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,929
Come back, Ji A.

584
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,170
I'll be waiting
until the end of time.

585
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:05,929
Don't hang up.

586
00:46:34,929 --> 00:46:36,269
You must come back.

587
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,510
Who was that?

588
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,250
I can't remember,

589
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,880
but it feels like I've left behind
something very important.

590
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,199
You got me a mugwort bouquet.

591
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,869
It's special enough.
At least it is to me today.

592
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,849
I'm sorry I couldn't go.

593
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,619
What if I'm bewitched?

594
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:35,559
Hi.

595
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,760
You must.

596
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:41,800
Be aware of your surroundings
and why you're there.

597
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:44,630
Come back, Ji A.

598
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,369
Did you sleep well?

599
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,570
I'll be waiting
until the end of time.

600
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,409
You'll be able to find your parents.

601
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,239
I'll make sure that happens.

602
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:56,650
Thanks, Lee Yeon.

603
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:00,420
Lee Yeon.

604
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:12,090
He's been poisoned by
starving ghosts.

605
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:15,230
Do something.

606
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:18,000
Mr. Lee has not returned yet.

607
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:23,940
No, you can't go anywhere.

608
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:26,110
If Me. Lee dies, I will die too.

609
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,809
I promise to repay you.

610
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,349
Please...

611
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,590
Please.

612
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,989
Please help him.

613
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,690
- Look at this hat.
- How adorable.

614
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:11,019
Isn't it pretty?

615
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:12,289
- Did you knit this?
- Yes.

616
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:15,519
Look how small Ji A is.

617
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:16,929
My gosh.

618
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:18,730
- She's so tiny.
- I know.

619
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:23,429
Oh, Ji A. Look at this.

620
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,739
This is when
you first made a cooing sound,

621
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:29,039
and you threw up on Mom's chest
after taking this photo.

622
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,340
It's because I switched
her powdered milk.

623
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,480
How can you still remember that?

624
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,280
Goodness, since we love you.

625
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,349
From your gestures
to your gurgling noises...

626
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:41,849
and even when you cried
so loudly,

627
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:43,789
we loved everything about you.

628
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,519
I see.

629
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,420
You must've really loved me.

630
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:53,030
How cute. Look at her face.

631
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,500
How pretty.

632
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:57,599
Look at this.

633
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,239
You know what?

634
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,510
How do you think you'd feel
if you lost me?

635
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,179
Why would we lose you?

636
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:12,550
You know, you just don't know
what will happen in life.

637
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,380
Don't you worry about that.

638
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,789
We promise to find you
no matter where you are.

639
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:19,420
- Of course. You're my baby.
- Yes.

640
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,730
I will too.

641
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:28,760
I promise I will find you.

642
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:30,869
What are you talking about?

643
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,039
Someone asked me...

644
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,469
what my biggest fear was.

645
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,809
My biggest fear is...

646
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,750
losing you two.

647
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,480
What's wrong with you?

648
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,920
I'm sorry, Mom.

649
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:53,719
I'm sorry, Dad.

650
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,460
I have to go.

651
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,659
Ji A, where are you going?

652
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:02,860
- Honey, stop her!
- Ji A!

653
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,500
If you open that door and leave,

654
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,710
you might never see us
for the rest of your life.

655
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:12,909
Ji A.

656
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,880
Why are you trying to abandon us?

657
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,480
I'm not abandoning you.

658
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:23,750
Ji A.

659
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,889
Let's live here.
Just the three of us. Okay?

660
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,590
This isn't real.

661
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,360
Why does that matter?

662
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:36,260
Our family is happy here.

663
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,070
Isn't that enough?

664
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,900
Why do you keep trying to be alone?

665
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,469
We're right here for you.

666
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:46,940
I'm not alone.

667
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,880
Lee Yeon is by my side.

668
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:51,579
Ji A.

669
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:55,550
- Please.
- Please, Ji A. Please.

670
00:51:57,849 --> 00:51:59,190
I trust Lee Yeon.

671
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,289
- Ji A!
- No!

672
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,510
That girl woke up too!

673
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,449
Isn't this cheating?

674
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:30,349
To me, it seems pretty fair.

675
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:32,349
What shall I do now?

676
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,989
- That's enough.
- What?

677
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:40,059
I just wanted to look
deep into her heart.

678
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,929
And I caught Lee Yeon too.

679
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:47,840
Lee Yeon.

680
00:52:49,969 --> 00:52:51,610
You woke me up.

681
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,510
You said you'd always wait for me.

682
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,460
Where are you?

683
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:11,590
Where have you gone?

684
00:53:57,469 --> 00:53:59,539
This is my underworld.

685
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,210
Living in a world without her...

686
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,849
is in endless solitude...

687
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,320
waiting to die.

688
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,219
How is Mr. Lee?

689
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,820
It'll take a few days
for the poison to lose its effect,

690
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,789
but he'll be fine soon.

691
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,860
Why aren't you asking me anything?

692
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,500
He's right here in front of you.

693
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,199
The reason why I approached you.

694
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:06,809
You already knew?

695
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,409
I saw you with him coincidentally.

696
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,250
And he dragged me to a junkyard
and beat me up.

697
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,150
- Mr. Lee beat you up?
- Yes.

698
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:21,960
Then why did you treat him?

699
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:28,159
Because I don't want you to cry.

700
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:45,510
Sin Ju.

701
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,579
Mr. Lee.

702
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:54,719
What about Lee Yeon?

703
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,289
Did he come back?

704
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:43,610
Mr. Lee, please...

705
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:45,769
wake up.

706
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,320
What if he doesn't wake up?

707
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,380
I wonder...

708
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:31,650
if Ji A returned home safely.

709
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:10,019
I wanted to tell her...

710
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,929
she was really beautiful
when we ate chicken feet.

711
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:18,800
I wanted to be able to say...

712
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:23,170
something really ordinary
like "goodnight" to her.

713
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:27,909
I wanted to walk...

714
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,010
the same period with you
for a while longer.

715
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,519
I wanted to be there to protect...

716
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,889
every day and night of yours.

717
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,460
But I can't go back.

718
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,730
I miss you,

719
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:55,300
Yeon.

720
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:11,579
You're a nine-tailed fox
who used to be a mountain spirit,

721
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:13,980
but I guess you're nothing much.

722
01:00:17,019 --> 01:00:18,889
Hey, don't die.

723
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,260
It's no fun if you die.

724
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,800
I guess you're not dead.

725
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,840
This beautiful body of yours
will go to Imoogi...

726
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:43,079
and be used to make a mess
of this world.

727
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,289
Ouduksini.

728
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,599
You startled me.

729
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,000
Are you awake?

730
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:06,800
Did Ji A return safely?

731
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,969
Who cares
when you're as good as dead?

732
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,710
Please.

733
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,440
Please tell me.

734
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,820
I don't want to, I don't want to.

735
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:35,630
Please, I'm begging you.

736
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:38,329
Please tell me.

737
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:40,670
Stop it. It's unsightly.

738
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:47,610
Yes. She exited.

739
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:51,409
But it would've been better
to stay in.

740
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:54,050
She lost her parents, and now you.

741
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:57,150
She's only living because
she can't die.

742
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,590
So she left?

743
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,719
Are you smiling?

744
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,900
Then should I cry?

745
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,039
It was so hard
to get you to come here.

746
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:21,739
What?

747
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:35,389
Do you think I fell...

748
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,590
from that cliff because of
a single starving ghost?

749
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:41,000
Don't tell me you did it on purpose.

750
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,059
Ouduksini.

751
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,099
I'll pay you back with your
signature line.

752
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:47,769
"What is your biggest fear?"

753
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,710
I'm the darkness and your fear.

754
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:55,679
Of course I fear nothing.

755
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:57,079
You're dying, aren't you?

756
01:02:58,309 --> 01:03:00,449
People forgot about you
and abandoned you.

757
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,679
There are no fairy tales about you.

758
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,389
That's why you were begging
for attention...

759
01:03:05,389 --> 01:03:06,849
while giving out vegetable juices,

760
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,389
and you took it out on stars
like the Snail Bride.

761
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,460
How dare you?

762
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:16,059
My brother even forgot your name.

763
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,130
Be quiet!

764
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:19,769
You'll be stuck...

765
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:22,769
in the underworld
you made for yourself...

766
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,309
and live a torturous life.

767
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,789
Where do you think you are going?

768
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,829
You forgot something important.

769
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,000
This isn't
the Forest of Starving Ghosts.

770
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:58,610
This is
a mountain spirit's subconscious.

771
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,210
To make it clear, this is my turf.

772
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,050
I can't see anything.

773
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,530
What do you want?

774
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,130
Not the likes of you.

775
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:31,909
I found him.

776
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,179
I'll come and get you soon.

777
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:42,980
You better wait.

778
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,079
You're a nine-tailed fox
who loved a human.

779
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,050
You'll end up...

780
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,289
making that woman die
with your hands.

781
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:22,519
That's your destiny.

782
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:26,030
Hey, lady. You should worry about
your own destiny.

783
01:06:58,719 --> 01:06:59,789
Don't come.

784
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,389
Stay there.

785
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:05,789
This time,

786
01:07:06,929 --> 01:07:08,329
I'll come to you.

787
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:35,789
I have been...

788
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:38,860
waiting for you.

789
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:52,069
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

790
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:54,270
Return the favor, Yeon.

791
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,670
No.

792
01:08:56,539 --> 01:08:58,109
It was I who should've been...

793
01:08:58,109 --> 01:09:00,739
the mountain spirit
and stayed by her side.

794
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,909
You got up late.

795
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:03,810
I want to break the promise.

796
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:05,710
There is one way.

797
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:08,119
You must kill your own brother.

798
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:09,619
I'll do it.

799
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:13,949
Hand over the mountain spirit,
and you'll have your parents back.

800
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:15,989
Yeon, if you give me your body,

801
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,930
I'll spare everyone else.
