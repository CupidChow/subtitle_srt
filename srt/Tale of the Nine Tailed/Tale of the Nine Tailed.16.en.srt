(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,890
If you fall into the Styx,

9
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,149
you will never be able
to reincarnate.

10
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,789
No...

11
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,170
I love you.

12
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,570
No! Please!

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,739
No!

14
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,939
Lee Yeon!

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,169
Don't leave me.

16
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:45,099
Lee Yeon!

17
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:48,439
I can hear her cries.

18
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,909
Lee Yeon!

19
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,310
I have to tell her...

20
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,020
that it's nothing
to be so sad about.

21
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,990
That a love story between
a human and a nine-tailed fox...

22
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,520
was bound to end like this.

23
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,000
From the start,

24
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,000
we belonged to different worlds.

25
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,439
I wanted to use the word "love"
as a bridge...

26
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,810
to get across to the world
she lives in.

27
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,050
I wanted to walk with her
a bit longer.

28
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,659
I wanted to become a human.

29
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:42,430
My dream...

30
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,729
never came true,

31
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,270
but my death...

32
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,439
is my most passionate love letter...

33
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,969
to the human...

34
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,379
who was my first love
as well as my last love.

35
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:03,919
I hope...

36
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,389
she won't wait for me.

37
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,289
I don't want her to cry too much
because of me.

38
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,329
I want to see her
just one more time.

39
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,610
I can't...

40
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,209
see her face anymore.

43
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,769
Ms. Kim.

44
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,300
Ms. Kim.

45
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,410
- What?
- Are you all right?

46
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,709
I'm all better.

47
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,709
Could there really be miracles
in this world?

48
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,579
The mysterious illness
that put many of us...

49
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,920
in fear disappeared into thin air...

50
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,550
last night.

51
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,689
No one knew the cause
of this strange illness,

52
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,860
so the patients and the families
were suffering helplessly.

53
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,730
They all embraced
and shed tears of joy.

54
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,600
Finally,
everything's where they belong.

55
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,930
I couldn't...

56
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,639
protect Yeon.

57
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:18,079
I lost another sound child.

58
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,910
No. You did your best...

59
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:24,449
for Yeon.

60
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,120
That's why I came back to you.

61
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,129
I wonder if Yeon went in peace.

62
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,899
I'm sure he did.

63
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,439
He protected that girl
just as he wanted.

64
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,750
Hyuneuiong.

65
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,319
Hyuneuiong.

66
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,560
It's me, Ji A.
Please open the door for me.

67
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,000
What should I do?

68
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,199
Don't open it.

69
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,600
Still...

70
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,269
She should forget about Yeon...

71
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,209
and get along
with ordinary people now.

72
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,709
Please tell me...

73
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,149
what I should do to save him.

74
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,980
Tell me what I can do.

75
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,490
Can you just...

76
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,820
tell me how?

77
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,669
Hyuneuiong.

78
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,509
Please open the door.

79
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,110
Please.

80
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,940
Rang!

81
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,600
Mr. Lee, would you like
some naengmyeon?

82
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,129
Get out.

83
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,070
You've been only drinking alcohol
for the past three days.

84
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,639
I said, leave.

85
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:37,980
It's not your fault.

86
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,909
Your brother told you to do it.

87
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,120
One more word, and I'll kill you.

88
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,450
Do you want some stickers?

89
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,990
I also have a nice car.

90
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,429
Get out of my sight!
Or just move out.

91
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,769
Thank you for allowing me in.

92
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,200
I don't have time to console you,
so I'll just cut to the chase.

93
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,669
Lee Yeon is dead.

94
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,210
There's no way for you
to bring him back.

95
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,840
I may not have a chance, but you do.

96
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,549
You're in charge of life and death,
so I'm sure you can...

97
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,580
There are rules in our world
as well.

98
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,480
There are things
that just won't happen.

99
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,250
Then at least allow him
to reincarnate.

100
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,490
I don't care
if he can't recognize me.

101
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
He can forget everything
about me so...

102
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,090
He's the one who willingly jumped
into the Styx.

103
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,659
He made that choice,

104
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,129
knowing he wouldn't be able
to reincarnate.

105
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,629
So quit protesting
in front of my workplace.

106
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,200
Begging like this
won't bring him back.

107
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,240
No. I'm sure there's a way.

108
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm sure he can come back somehow.

109
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,580
Such a thing...

110
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,149
won't happen.

111
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,480
I wanted to tell you this.

112
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,519
Ma'am.

113
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,059
Ma'am!

114
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,360
It's so dark.

115
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,299
The streetlights are broken.

116
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,970
If you fix all the lights
with your superpower,

117
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,769
it'll be so cool.

118
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,039
Ask the borough office in charge.

119
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:28,580
Are you okay?

120
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,149
They're back on.

121
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,149
I called the borough office.

122
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,960
Why would you?

123
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,730
Because Mr. Lee will be enraged
if you get hurt.

124
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,929
Are you...

125
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,129
okay?

126
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,070
I have to be okay
even when I'm not.

127
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,909
I have a lot of work to do.

128
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:00,240
I met the lady of the Styx.

129
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,309
She said there's no way to save him.

130
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,220
He knew from the beginning.

131
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:10,960
Despite that, he chose to save you
instead of himself.

132
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,830
What should I do?

133
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,870
Live as if nothing happened.

134
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,970
Forget about Mr. Lee...

135
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,409
and everything you've seen
in that world. Live like a human.

136
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,840
That's what he wished for.

137
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,389
Sin Ju.

138
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,399
- Is he still in there?
- He won't budge.

139
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,769
I'm so worried
that he might collapse.

140
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,470
I'll talk to him.

141
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,649
- Why are you like this?
- Is that seriously a question?

142
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,149
Doing this won't bring him back.

143
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,159
Look at you talking.

144
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,500
You look completely fine.

145
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,559
I thought you were devoted to him.

146
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,500
What an ingrate.

147
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,070
I don't care what you say,

148
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,570
but I must tell you this.

149
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,509
Quit lecturing and give that back.

150
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,840
"Wake up."

151
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:39,080
You lunatic.

152
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,840
"Stop acting like a baby
and live properly."

153
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,450
- Do you want to die?
- This is what...

154
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,379
Mr. Lee wanted me to relay.

155
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,259
Do you want to find out yourself
what else he said?

156
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,919
Is it working? It is.

157
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,090
It's me.

158
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,990
We just had naengmyeon together.

159
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,129
And you ate my egg.

160
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,169
If you're watching this,

161
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,539
it means I'm dead.

162
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,139
Gosh.

163
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,639
This is so cringy.

164
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,509
It looked cool in the movies.

165
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,149
This is going to look nice
since you can reminisce.

166
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:58,490
Say I'm right.

167
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,330
Nice, my foot.

168
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,289
Rang,

169
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,829
are you drinking?

170
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,269
And is it wine?

171
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,940
Is he a ghost or what?

172
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,369
Soju suits you better than wine.

173
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,410
Being a volunteer suits you better
than being a villain.

174
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,880
Ever since you were little,

175
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,720
you always stopped
to help injured puppies.

176
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,019
I wondered
where that side of you went.

177
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,220
But you never changed.

178
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,559
Not even one bit.

179
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,230
So...

180
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:45,500
you'll be able to live well
even though I'm gone.

181
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:48,569
You scumbag. How could I?

182
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,740
You must.

183
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,880
Because now, you have a family
you must protect.

184
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,779
I don't need them.

185
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,819
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.

186
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,319
I can hear you.

187
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,829
Remember what I told you
at the Forest of Starving Ghosts?

188
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:09,559
That I...

189
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,529
That I...

190
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,140
had never abandoned you.

191
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,009
So don't...

192
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,119
treat yourself so harshly.

193
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,490
Live hard for my sake.

194
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,829
This is my last favor I ask of you.

195
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,329
Take care.

196
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:02,079
And this message will self-explode
in 10 seconds.

197
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,779
Just kidding.

198
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:08,950
I always wanted to try this.

199
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,940
Lee Yeon.

200
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,539
You told me to forget everything,

201
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,769
but I'm going to wait for you.

202
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,210
If I desperately wish for it
over and over again,

203
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,980
don't you think we'll reunite
one day?

204
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,349
In the next life, no...

205
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,190
Even in the next, next life.

206
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,799
That's why I've decided to
remember you...

207
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,930
and record what we've done.

208
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,140
Since that's what I'm good at.

209
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,109
I didn't see you for a while,
but you're coming often lately.

210
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,809
I saw on the internet that
coming to the hair salon...

211
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,349
is the best way to get over
a breakup.

212
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,019
Did you break up with someone?

213
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,049
There's nothing better than
listening to sad music.

214
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,450
I've already done that.

215
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:27,289
I listened to ballad songs,
binge-watched dramas,

216
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:28,329
and ate spicy food.

217
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,690
Shall I dye my hair?

218
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:32,200
It's been a long time.

219
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,240
I'm not interested in
how you've been. Cut to the chase.

220
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,339
You'll make what?

221
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,839
A story of the nine-tailed fox.

222
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,380
"Story of the nine-tailed fox"?

223
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,480
The title isn't catchy.

224
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:52,220
How about "A Story of
the Nine-tailed Fox Brothers"?

225
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,650
No, thanks.

226
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,349
You're not going to make
a TV show out of it, are you?

227
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,650
It's just for myself.

228
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,089
I'm going to meet all of
Lee Yeon's acquaintances.

229
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,759
You're the first.

230
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:05,700
Well, there's no one who knows
Lee Yeon better than me.

231
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,630
Okay. Then why don't you start...

232
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,500
telling me everything you know
about Lee Yeon?

233
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,269
Do you know that he was
a bit narcissistic?

234
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
What?

235
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,440
All sorts of things
came to our forest...

236
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,509
in order to see Lee Yeon's face.

237
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,579
He already had so much pride
in his face.

238
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,619
Imagine how worse
it would've become.

239
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,650
He always said this while watching
his reflection in the water.

240
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,259
If the word "beauty" were to be
embodied,

241
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,190
it would be my face.

242
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:41,829
I can't even imagine it.

243
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,740
It's as shocking as when he became
a victim of voice phishing.

244
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,200
He was scammed?

245
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:48,470
For 20,000 dollars.

246
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,369
My goodness, how could a
nine-tailed fox fall for that?

247
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:56,509
Do you know that he's scared
of spiders and their hairy legs?

248
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:01,019
He loved playing go with me.

249
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,750
Although he always lost.

250
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,059
I won!

251
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:09,460
I won again.

252
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:13,000
You two must've been very close
back then.

253
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,200
Of course.

254
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,799
He spent much more time with me
than you.

255
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,210
Did he ever cook for you?

256
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,809
He can't cook.

257
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,109
He doesn't have much talent,
but he knew how to cook rice.

258
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
Just rice.

259
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,849
He sent me a video message.

260
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,990
These are the shoes he bought me.

261
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:41,759
He carried me on his back
all the time.

262
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,390
He waited for me every day.

263
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,529
You're annoying.

264
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,410
Come to think of it,
all we did was...

265
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,609
receive from Lee Yeon
all the time.

266
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,509
Do you know what his wish was?

267
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:05,920
A human.

268
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,789
He wanted to become human.

269
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,170
My dear brother.

270
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:29,940
There are exceptions
to rules sometimes.

271
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,740
No.

272
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,579
He didn't commit suicide.
He sacrificed himself...

273
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:38,380
to save tens of thousands of people.

274
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:43,250
You can't even do that when
there are ten afterlife kings?

275
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,259
Was King Yeomra always
this pathetic?

276
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,890
Hello? Hey.

277
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,460
Hey!

278
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,190
Hey!

279
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,630
Darn it! My goodness.

280
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,670
You should stop now.
You've tried hard enough.

281
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,539
It would be better to just speak
against a wall.

282
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,740
No matter how many times
I ask him,

283
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,180
all he babbles on is about
his official interpretation.

284
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,410
Is he a parrot or what?

285
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,940
You might be punished
if you keep saying that.

286
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,480
How could he be so inflexible?

287
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,220
- Why did you scoff?
- I just can't believe...

288
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,160
you talking about "flexibility".

289
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,829
Stop acting up.
Was I too easy on you lately?

290
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:26,599
Well, then.
Why don't we have some tteokbokki?

291
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:29,069
It's a combination of
a mild and spicy taste.

292
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,170
Here you go.

293
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,039
Oh, gosh. They even gave us
free dumplings.

294
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,869
♪Whenever I look at you♪

295
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:06,000
♪I want to kiss you♪

296
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:10,940
♪Whenever I'm with you♪

297
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,779

00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:19,150

00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:23,190

00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:27,160
♪I love you♪

00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:32,930
♪I love you more than myself♪

302
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,640
Are you crying?

303
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,740
It's so embarrassing.
Don't talk to me.

304
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:44,369
Yu Ri.

305
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,240
Marry me.

306
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,420
A fox loves just one mate
for all its life.

307
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,359
Will you accept my love
until the day we die?

308
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,559
A ring won't cut it.

309
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,630
I even have an apartment
that's just been built.

310
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,500
If you want,
we can be joint owners... No.

311
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,299
You can be the owner if you want.

312
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,210
That doesn't matter.

313
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,380
We may have to spare room
for someone else...

314
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,910
if that's okay with you.

315
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,380
Is that a yes?

316
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,079
I was going to propose
if you didn't.

317
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,559
Congratulations!

318
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,230
You know that if you make
Yu Ri cry,

319
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,970
I'll kill you, right?

320
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,940
Mr. Lee.

321
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:51,539
You can go. Since you lived
so happily next to me all this time,

322
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:53,480
you can suffer with Sin Ju now.

323
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:57,109
I took care of your fake parents,
so they won't wait for you now.

324
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,420
I'll live happily.

325
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:00,920
Congratulations, Dr. Gu.

326
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,049
Today's meal is on the house.

327
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:05,990
Thank you, everyone.

328
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,789
Yu Ri, thank you.

329
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,630
And although he's not here,
I want to thank Mr. Lee.

330
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,470
I'm grateful, and I miss him.

331
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,269
He needs to be the officiant
for our wedding.

332
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,339
It would've been so nice
if he was here too.

333
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:40,859
Mr. Lee...

334
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:42,430
Gosh.

335
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:56,109
Hyuneuiong, please say something
to Yeon.

336
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,710
Hey, Yeon.
Granny finally quit smoking.

337
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,349
It's pretty much thanks to you.

338
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,549
I wish she'd quit nagging at me too,

339
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,180
but I don't think
it's going to happen.

340
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,180
You're at it again.

341
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:10,190
You should say something too.

342
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,589
Mr. Lee.

343
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,859
When I fell in love
with a human farmer,

344
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,730
you were the only one
who cheered me on.

345
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,230
You told me you were
also in a love like mine.

346
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,670
That lady...

347
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,170
is waiting for you so bravely
right now.

348
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,140
I hope you two will meet again...

349
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,539
just like me and my husband.

350
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,680
- You're here.
- Yes.

351
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,119
- Let's go in.
- Hey.

352
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,190
Yes?

353
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,589
- Have this.
- What is it?

354
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,220
It's honey rice cakes.

355
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,960
I know you like them.

356
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,130
He's really handsome, right?

357
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:56,170
Please sit down.

358
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,430
Okay.

359
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,769
This is delicious.

360
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,700
- Sir, have some of this.
- Thank you.

361
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,339
Thank you.

362
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,910
Even on the days I was in pain
because of Yeon's absence,

363
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,609
I no longer cried.

364
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,549
Because if I cried, this story...

365
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,880
might really end as a tragedy.

366
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,119
(Six months later)

367
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,460
♪Love♪

368
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,089
And finally on the day I finished
"Tale of the Nine Tailed",

369
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,400
("Tale of the Nine Tailed")

370
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,269
a message from Yeon came.

371
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,529
The end.

372
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,569
Come in.

373
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:35,099
Ji A, hurry up and come down.

374
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,140
- Why?
- Hurry up. It's urgent.

375
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,150
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

376
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,619
Happy birthday, Ji A.

377
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,019
Is it my birthday today?

378
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:48,849
I totally forgot.

379
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:54,420
Happy birthday.

380
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,329
This is a gift from me.

381
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:01,259
- This was handmade.
- It's so pretty.

382
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,200
- It looks nice.
- It's pretty.

383
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,569
Mine's from a factory.

384
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:06,539
Thank you.

385
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,079
How did you know my watch broke off?

386
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,079
- I saw it.
- You're so considerate.

387
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,549
Thank you.

388
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,150
Who is that from?

389
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,880
Open it.

390
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,730
And on my birthday...

391
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,740
What do you want?

392
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:44,240
Buy me something
I've never had before.

393
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,910
Something like a proposal gift.

394
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,650
Okay, I'll get it for you.

395
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,750
It's from Yeon, isn't it?

396
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:57,750
Did he come?

397
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,019
It came by courier.

398
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,359
Here. A letter came too.

399
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,009
(Whenever I have a hard time,)

400
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,480
(I tell my members.
I tell them we should talk it out...)

401
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:23,509
(or go out together.)

402
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,720
(I try to make it fun.)

403
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,849
(Actually, meeting the members...)

404
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,349
I told you
not to eat snacks on the couch.

405
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,490
Give me food.

406
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:36,160
You could use a tray at least.

407
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,789
Move. You're in my way.

408
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:40,559
(Yes. I'm confident.)

409
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:45,400
Honey. I told you to put used socks
in the laundry basket.

410
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,470
I forgot.

411
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,339
That? Here's the other one.

412
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,650
How is it that the only one
who cleans after himself is Soo Ho?

413
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,349
(I've been practicing singing.)

414
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,220
Your soup is salty today.

415
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,329
Mr. Lee. How much longer
do you plan on living here?

416
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,630
What are you saying?

417
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,539
We're a package.

418
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,970
Fine. But why do I have to do
all the housework...

419
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,880
when the house is under my name?

420
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,680
I ordered a kimchi refrigerator.

421
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,220
The one we saw
at the department store last time?

422
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,119
Mr. Lee bought it for us.
It'll arrive this afternoon.

423
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,460
- I love you, brother!
- "Brother"?

424
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,289
I'll just treat you like
my big brother from now on.

425
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,829
How nice.

426
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:46,759
It feels like we're a family now.
Doesn't it?

427
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,170
(Dear Ji A...)

428
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,469
Do you like your present?

429
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,809
I hope you like it.

430
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,880
I wonder how beautiful you'd look
in that dress.

431
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,050
I wonder...

432
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,389
who will be standing beside you.

433
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,829
Whoever it may be,

434
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,130
I hope he's someone nice.

435
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,969
I wish I could be cool enough
to say that,

436
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,099
but what should I do?

437
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:05,039
I don't even know his face,
but I already hate him.

438
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,409
I liked you.

439
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,449
I liked your attitude
toward the world.

440
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:18,820
Even with such a dreadful fate
on your back,

441
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,059
I liked that you didn't
fall in despair so easily.

442
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,260
Having coffee with you,

443
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,869
watching you sleep,

444
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,539
all the streets we walked together,

445
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,239
and all the moments
I waited for you...

446
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,340
I liked everything like crazy.

447
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,610
Ji A.

448
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:48,619
Whenever I called that soft name...

449
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,820
of yours,

450
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,789
my heart would flutter.

451
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,630
Although you'll have to walk...

452
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,530
the road we used to walk
on your own,

453
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,170
you'll get used to it.

454
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,940
You'll endure it well.

455
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,769
So...

456
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,079
please let me go.

457
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,480
You must.

458
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,250
I don't want to.

459
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:22,619
I can't let you go.

460
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,329
Please come back.

461
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,199
I miss you so much.

462
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,489
Mr. Lee.

463
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,800
Are you off to find
your nine-tailed fox brother again?

464
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,159
Hey. I told you not to say
"nine-tailed fox".

465
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,530
Did you hear any updates?

466
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,269
No. I'm just beating
whoever isn't a human to find out...

467
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,000
if there's a way to revive him.

468
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,039
- I'll drive you.
- It's okay. It's cold out.

469
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,110
Hurry back.

470
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,949
The four of us should barbecue
some pork belly.

471
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,579
Drive safe.

472
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:48,869
The doll.

473
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,289
What are you doing here?

474
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,429
What about you?

475
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,239
I heard some rumors,
so I came to see that guy.

476
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,449
(Fate, physiognomy, naming,
compatibility)

477
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,530
Is it true...

478
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,360
that you're one
of the afterlife kings?

479
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,530
I'm King Odojeonryun.

480
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,500
I'm the 10th king who reigns
over The Underworld of Darkness.

481
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,340
I am...

482
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,480
the final judge.

483
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,550
I'm the one
who'll decide on your afterlives.

484
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,190
Aren't you going to sit properly?

485
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,360
By afterlife,

486
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:19,059
do you mean...

487
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,329
That's right.
I deal with reincarnation.

488
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,070
Reincarnation?

489
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,670
Are you here because of Lee Yeon?

490
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,039
Well, this is a tricky subject.

491
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,739
But I have one of his belongings.

492
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:37,679
You have the fox marble.
Give me the marble.

493
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,480
The fox marble.

494
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,150
Can you bring him back with that?

495
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:44,389
Don't get your hopes up just yet.

496
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,059
I only came here
because King Yeomra's sister,

497
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,360
who reigns the Styx,

498
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,130
had been incessantly calling
the afterlife kings.

499
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,329
But you see, we're not charity.

500
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,670
You know the rules, don't you?

501
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,610
We need to give you something
that's the most precious, right?

502
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,639
I'll do it. I can.

503
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,909
Anything to bring Yeon back.

504
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,780
What if I bring him back,

505
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,050
but you can't meet him?

506
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:16,289
- What?
- Reincarnation is done randomly.

507
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,420
Your paths may not cross.

508
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,019
He could enter this world
after you two are dead,

509
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,889
or he may look different.

510
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,469
I don't care.

511
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,769
Let's begin our deal.

512
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,179
All right.

513
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,579
Bring me something to my liking...

514
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,489
before the sand runs out.

515
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,670
- What's wrong?
- King Odojeonryun is here.

516
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,809
I was wondering why it was snowing
in April. He's finally here.

517
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,289
A crow's cawing.

518
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,469
It cawed three times.

519
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,940
Our customer will be wearing
mourning garments.

520
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,840
Someone will die.

521
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,280
I'll do it.

522
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:55,320
Tell me.

523
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,559
For me, Yeon is the most precious.

524
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:03,460
Since he's no longer here,
I'm only left...

525
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,090
with memories of him.

526
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,269
I'll give you all those memories.

527
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,469
I don't buy such things.

528
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:12,639
Not memories.

529
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:17,139
You have something priceless
from him.

530
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:18,969
You can have anything. Just tell me.

531
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,809
For example,

532
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,050
your remaining life.

533
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,719
If I sacrifice my life,

534
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:38,460
- will Yeon be able to reincarnate?
- Hey.

535
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,070
A life for a life.

536
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,230
What else can I say?

537
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,309
It's yours.

538
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,880
Hey, do you think Yeon saved you
so that you could waste your life...

539
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,119
like this?

540
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,889
Was his sacrifice a waste?
How pathetic are you?

541
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:10,960
Then would you like
to sacrifice yourself instead?

542
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:22,940
Fine. I stole this life.

543
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:25,610
- I have no regrets.
- Hey.

544
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,380
- This isn't concerning you.
- However,

545
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:31,579
you never had a desire to live.

546
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,280
Will your life have any worth to me?

547
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,150
First, let me appraise you.

548
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,900
What?

549
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,809
You have a family.

550
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:02,179
Your life has become
quite meaningful to you.

551
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:08,019
You pass.

552
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,090
A deal has been made.

553
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,019
I'm down.

554
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:14,559
- No!
- Wait.

555
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,400
There's still some time left.

556
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,269
Can you call them over?

557
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:31,469
Let me say my last goodbyes.

558
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,989
This way.

559
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,550
Mr. Lee!

560
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,059
Mr. Lee!

561
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:22,829
Mr. Lee!

562
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,510
Oh, no...

563
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,940
What should I do?

564
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:19,309
(Lee Rang Lies Here)

565
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:42,400
(Lee Rang Lies Here)

566
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:20,500
(Lee Rang Lies Here)

567
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,480
- Ms. Nam.
- Yes?

568
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,610
Use this.

569
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,289
Where did you get this umbrella?

570
00:49:44,289 --> 00:49:46,659
I'm not sure.
Someone left it for our team.

571
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:47,719
He asked us to give it to you.

572
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:50,030
- When?
- It was before my shift,

573
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:51,559
so about five minutes ago.

574
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:02,900
Wait...

575
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,269
Lee Yeon.

576
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,440
I'm sorry.

577
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,800
I told you not to walk in the rain.

578
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:36,030
Lee Yeon.

579
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,530
Is it really you?

580
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,409
It's not someone disguised as you?
Is this not a dream?

581
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:46,909
Is it really you?

582
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,409
But why are you just standing there?

583
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,519
Why aren't you coming to me?

584
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,849
I'm not the same as before.

585
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,590
What do you mean?

586
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,019
I can't fly now.

587
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:08,599
If you fall from somewhere,
I can't save you anymore.

588
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:13,130
Even if you walk on a dark road,
I can't send fireflies.

589
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,869
I feel pain when I'm hit,

590
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:19,309
and I get hurt if I'm stabbed.

591
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,650
There's nothing I can do for you.

592
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:45,929
It doesn't matter.

593
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,469
That doesn't matter at all.

594
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:51,610
I became human.

595
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,980
Human?

596
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,219
You're in trouble now.

597
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,260
I won't let you go now
until the day we die.

598
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,199
I missed you so much.

599
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:23,139
I missed you like crazy.

600
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,739
I was so scared
that I'd never see you again.

601
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,030
How did you do it?

602
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,269
Do what?

603
00:53:56,769 --> 00:53:59,710
To me, 6 months felt like 6 years.

604
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:02,340
How did you wait for 600 years?

605
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,480
If you keep waiting,

606
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,980
do you get used to it
and get better at it?

607
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:11,590
I didn't get used to waiting.

608
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,519
I just couldn't get used to
being apart from you.

609
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,570
I wanted to wait bravely like you,

610
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,800
but small things kept
bogging me down.

611
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:30,070
Like what?
What made it so hard for you?

612
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,510
For instance...

613
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,949
The night air when you used to
walk me home.

614
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:40,880
The beeping noise our
rice cooker made.

615
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:45,519
The warmth of your hands
whenever we used to take walks.

616
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,420
You know,
just small memories like that.

617
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,360
That's why...

618
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,559
you found me this time.

619
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,670
You found me.

620
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,610
You really have human hands now.

621
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,309
Yes. And a human body.

622
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,949
And human lips.

623
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:39,239
Come on. No way.
I doubt he'll start to sing.

624
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:42,909
- He won't...
- ♪Whenever I look at you♪

625
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:46,980
♪I want to kiss you♪

626
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:51,219
♪Whenever I'm with you♪

627
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:55,519
Hyuneuiong, please say something
to Yeon.

628
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:59,829
Hey, Yeon.
Granny finally quit smoking.

629
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,400
It's pretty much thanks to you.

630
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:02,900
You should say something too.

631
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:06,329
When I fell in love
with a human farmer,

632
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,869
you were the only one
who cheered me on.

633
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,369
You told me you were
also in a love like mine.

634
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:14,480
That lady is waiting for you...

635
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,139
so bravely right now.

636
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:19,210
I hope you two will meet again.

637
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,320
Here, try this.

638
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,349
I want some fish too.

639
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,989
- I'll get you another one.
- Hey, I want...

640
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,420
Let's go on a walk
and eat chicken soup.

641
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,489
Are you happy?

642
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:04,760
(Sinju's Animal Hospital)

643
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,429
Mr. Lee... Mr. Lee!

644
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:12,969
Mr. Lee.

645
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:15,369
Mr. Lee.

646
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:29,849
How's the apartment?
Is it good enough?

647
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,519
Don't even mention it.
Everything you'd want is inside.

648
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:33,860
There are a sauna and a gym.

649
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:36,219
I think it's undervalued.

650
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,690
On top of that,
there are two subway stations here.

651
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:40,260
How does a fox know so much?

652
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,030
I'm the manager
of the homeowner's association.

653
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,840
So, Manager Gu.

654
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,900
Did you realize my preciousness
during my absence?

655
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,409
I was so happy with my wedded life
that I hardly noticed you gone.

656
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:54,539
I'm going to leave.

657
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,050
I'm just kidding.

658
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,519
Ever since I became a human,
my mood swings have been severe.

659
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:04,320
I felt a sense of inferiority
for the first time in my life.

660
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,489
People will throw rocks at you
if you say that with such a face.

661
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,059
I'm glad you're back.

662
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,230
We dealt with your death
in our own ways...

663
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,530
while waiting for you.

664
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,539
We'd whine and lean on each other
from time to time.

665
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,809
What about Rang?

666
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,820
He was totally dejected
after you died.

667
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:43,519
He cried all night once. He got
better after moving in with us,

668
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,289
but he constantly went out
to look for you.

669
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:51,670
Did you see his last moment?

670
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:04,110
He must have been scared by himself.

671
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:10,889
He's a coward, unlike his looks.

672
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,489
This is his phone.

673
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:20,599
Take a look.

674
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,599
It's me.

675
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,940
I'm dying soon.

676
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,449
If you were around,
you'd come to rescue me,

677
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:13,150
but I have no one to rely on.
I'm ruined.

678
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:18,619
You'll get to see how it feels...

679
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,619
to watch someone's will live.

680
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:25,530
I thought I'd feel something huge
just before my death,

681
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,199
but like you said, maybe
I'm someone who gives up easily.

682
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,900
I just feel bittersweet.

683
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:35,940
So...

684
01:00:36,869 --> 01:00:39,769
don't be a loser who cries.

685
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,849
I didn't cry once after you left.

686
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,880
I just drank a bit, that's all.

687
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:48,150
You're a liar.

688
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,920
I tortured you
for a really long time,

689
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:57,929
but I won't apologize
because you're worse than me.

690
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:02,699
Even when we shared
a piece of fruit,

691
01:01:02,699 --> 01:01:04,369
you always gave me the bigger piece.

692
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:08,539
I know you're obsessed with eggs,

693
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,539
but you always gave them to me.

694
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:17,280
If you leave me for your love
after raising me like that,

695
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,880
of course I'll go wrong.

696
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,619
I'm going to reincarnate
as a shrimp near Dok Island.

697
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:28,059
Don't eat shrimp just in case.

698
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:40,440
You should...

699
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,639
reincarnate too.

700
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,119
I hope you'll be really ugly.

701
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,530
And...

702
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:09,829
And...

703
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,769
if it can be helped,

704
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,900
let's meet again.

705
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,880
Yeon.

706
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:05,420
Hey, Kim Soo Ho.
You don't have any parents, do you?

707
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,389
I heard your mom ran away.

708
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,920
That's not true.

709
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,590
He lives in a poor house too.

710
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,989
I saw it when we were
in the same class.

711
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,230
- ♪You're homeless♪
- ♪You're homeless♪

712
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:19,199
- ♪You're homeless♪
- ♪You're homeless♪

713
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:20,400
Soo Ho.

714
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,469
Let's go home.

715
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,539
We're not homeless.

716
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,280
Let's go.

717
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,420
It was good timing, right?

718
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:43,860
Rang's unintentional
volunteer work...

719
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,900
was unintentionally handed down
to the next generation.

720
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,010
And while loving someone...

721
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:02,739
in a somewhat crooked way.

722
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,679
Gosh, my hands are just
automatically wrapping around you.

723
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:41,780
Yeon!

724
01:04:53,429 --> 01:04:54,929
I missed you, Granny.

725
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:57,630
Don't act so emotional.
It's out of style.

726
01:04:58,199 --> 01:04:59,730
I heard you used your connections
to bring me back.

727
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,440
Me?

728
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:04,969
I bet she made at least 200 calls.

729
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:07,510
Her brother blocked her number.

730
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:13,150
You couldn't live without me, right?

731
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:14,550
Go away.

732
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:17,920
I'm going to leave soon anyway.

733
01:05:18,489 --> 01:05:21,360
Today will be the last time
you see my face.

734
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:23,789
Why?

735
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,530
I can't come here anymore.
I'm a human now.

736
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:29,059
I should live among humans.

737
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:32,800
I guess you'll only see Yeon
after he dies.

738
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:35,469
Gosh. Why would you say that?
It's unlucky.

739
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:36,769
Don't you know how I brought him
back to life?

740
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:42,010
Thank you for always loving me
although I've been so rude.

741
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:46,280
You kept me busy
until Ji A came back,

742
01:05:46,849 --> 01:05:48,380
so I didn't have the time
to lose my mind.

743
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,489
It was thanks to you
and Hyuneuiong...

744
01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:56,219
that I'm here today.

745
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:59,789
Live a good life.
It won't be that easy...

746
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,230
living as a human,

747
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,400
but I'm sure you'll do well.

748
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:06,400
I will.

749
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:10,170
I hope you two will remain healthy
for a long time.

750
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,010
I'll get going.

751
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:19,780
Hey!

752
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,320
Since you're here,
have some tteokbokki before you go.

753
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:30,019
Do I have to go buy tteokbokki?

754
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:31,889
- Isn't it obvious?
- Okay.

755
01:06:37,469 --> 01:06:38,769
It's so spicy.

756
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:43,400
This isn't spicy at all.
You're too big to whine.

757
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,610
The spicy level is medium,
but it's still spicy.

758
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,440
Their soondae is good.

759
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,780
Granny said
she's still a workaholic.

760
01:06:51,809 --> 01:06:54,449
- The only thing that changed...
- The fish cake is delicious.

761
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:58,420
is that the couple stays up
all night once in a while...

762
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,349
to talk about their dead son.

763
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,760
- This is delicious.
- As for tteokbokki,

764
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,289
they say
the medium spicy level is not bad.

765
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:12,869
How spicy.

766
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,670
I can't really say things like...

767
01:07:47,369 --> 01:07:49,170
that I'll love you forever.

768
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:53,670
But you like drumsticks,
and I like chicken breasts.

769
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:57,809
You prefer the yolk,
while I like the egg whites.

770
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:01,250
Therefore,
we're perfect for each other.

771
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,349
You're probably the first woman
on earth to confess your love...

772
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:06,190
by mentioning chicken and eggs.

773
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:13,760
I can't believe
we're getting married.

774
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:19,199
And you're finally a human.

775
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:24,970
The Korean word for "human"
is quite fascinating.

776
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:29,880
If you carve the last consonant,

777
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,710
you get "love".

778
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,350
You see,

779
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,890
I neither have
a great personality...

780
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,359
nor am confident...

781
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,829
about living as a human.

782
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:49,359
But I know I can love you.

783
01:08:57,369 --> 01:08:58,470
I love you.

784
01:08:58,909 --> 01:09:00,039
Me too.

785
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,699
What? A flower shower in fall?

786
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:27,939
They're congratulating him.

787
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:31,340
The flowers, the trees,
and the wind...

788
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,770
that cherish
their former guardian...

789
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:36,180
are saying goodbye to him.

790
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,609
They're thanking him
for protecting them.

791
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:44,109
The extremely handsome
nine-tailed fox...

792
01:10:44,109 --> 01:10:46,010
lived happily ever after.

793
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:48,850
Hey, be more sincere
with your narrations.

794
01:10:49,819 --> 01:10:52,449
I'm the husband of a journalist,
so I only state the facts.

795
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:55,020
- Let's see from the front.
- Okay.

796
01:11:08,899 --> 01:11:10,199
Do you want a baby?

797
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:19,109
I'm all for it,

798
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,520
but I do have one concern.

799
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:23,220
What is it?

800
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:25,590
What if our daughter
is ashamed of me...

801
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:27,319
for not going to college?

802
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:34,460
Then you can tell her that you did
something much more amazing.

803
01:11:37,699 --> 01:11:41,239
- And what's that?
- That you saved her mom.

804
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,170
And even though no one knows this,

805
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,770
that you even saved the world once.

806
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:47,170
That is the truth.

807
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:52,180
By the way, why did you decide
that it'd be a daughter?

808
01:11:53,779 --> 01:11:55,420
- Did I?
- Yes.

809
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,649
That can't be.

810
01:11:58,289 --> 01:12:00,989
(Sinju's Animal Hospital)

811
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,590
Be honest.
How does it feel to become human?

812
01:12:07,729 --> 01:12:09,000
Is it better than being
a nine-tailed fox?

813
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,470
I thought everything would be great,
but I was wrong.

814
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,399
How should I put it?

815
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,239
There seems to be
countless variables.

816
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,439
"Variables"?

817
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:26,609
I have astigmatism,
and they're of different levels.

818
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:29,180
Check this out.

819
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,619
In the blink of an eye,

820
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,760
I become very ugly.

821
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,600
Right now, I bet...

822
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:45,970
I look better than you.

823
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,270
- You're wrong.
- You're right.

824
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:54,010
And that's not the only problem.

825
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:59,579
Did you just deceive me?

826
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:01,750
I thought we were having ice cream.

827
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,689
I didn't. I told you
we'd be stopping by somewhere.

828
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:08,489
I'd rather get stabbed by a sword...

829
01:13:08,489 --> 01:13:10,060
than get anesthetized again.

830
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,489
- Be a good boy.
- Let me go!

831
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,560
How could your love change?

832
01:13:15,829 --> 01:13:17,529
What kind of nonsense
are you spewing?

833
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:21,640
Getting a root canal
was excruciating.

834
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,739
I realized that being human meant...

835
01:13:24,739 --> 01:13:26,670
you'd encounter unexpected pain
throughout your lifetime.

836
01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:28,810
Ta-da.

837
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,220
How is it? Is it good?

838
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,550
You cook the best ramyeon.

839
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:40,390
Honey, where's the soju?

840
01:13:40,819 --> 01:13:42,159
It's right here.

841
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:43,689
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

842
01:13:49,329 --> 01:13:51,369
Good work today.

843
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:52,729
You too.

844
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:56,100
Ramyeon and soju. This is what
being human is all about.

845
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,460
Next time when you fall,

846
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,960
try to get up on your own, okay?

847
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:00,369
Here you go.

848
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,670
Thank you.

849
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,989
- Hey, did you fall?
- Yes.

850
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,130
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am.

851
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:30,859
You should've been more careful.

852
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,670
Does it not hurt?

853
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:34,800
No. A man helped me get up.

854
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:39,869
I guess you couldn't reincarnate
as a shrimp near Dok Island.

855
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:01,159
How was your day?

856
01:16:01,159 --> 01:16:02,960
Same old.

857
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:08,199
Right. I saw someone strange
at the police station today.

858
01:16:08,739 --> 01:16:11,640
- What do you mean?
- He was wearing a Hahoe mask,

859
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:13,970
but the mask just wouldn't come off.

860
01:16:14,109 --> 01:16:16,039
It seemed to be glued to his face.

861
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:17,109
A Hahoe mask?

862
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:21,149
Did you step on bird poop today?

863
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:24,350
Not the bird poop.

864
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:26,420
But I did step on the gum.

865
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,090
Darn it.

866
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:29,220
Why?

867
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:31,460
He was a Samjae.

868
01:16:31,789 --> 01:16:32,960
"Samjae"?

869
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,600
(Disasters that are said to occur
in cycles of nine years)

870
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:42,800
"It's possible that some beings
that we're not aware of..."

871
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:45,470
"are living with us in this world."

872
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,010
"The recent ghost stories
that are being told lately..."

873
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:51,479
"might be because of them."

874
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:55,119
I have taken a peek at...

875
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,979
the secrets of this world.

876
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,899
Living as a human being...

877
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:17,199
means your life will be
filled with...

878
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,039
firsts and lasts.

879
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,939
The first time you see snow,
the first time you walk,

880
01:17:23,779 --> 01:17:24,979
the first time you go on a picnic,

881
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:27,810
and the first time
you receive endodontic treatment.

882
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:36,420
And your first love,

883
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,729
whom you'll love forever.

884
01:18:48,329 --> 01:18:49,399
Hey.

885
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:00,670
Are you Samjae?

886
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,279

887
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:11,850
