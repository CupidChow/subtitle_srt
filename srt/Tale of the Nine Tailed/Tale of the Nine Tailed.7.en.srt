(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

8
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,219
Hello.

9
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,930
The one that came out
from the well...

10
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,260
vanished as soon as he came out.

11
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,139
We just found a piece of him.

12
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,110
"A piece of him"?

13
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,139
Don't tell me...

14
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,939
It's stuck on her.

15
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,879
The fox marble
you gave her disappeared.

16
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,590
Because of that, something woke up
from inside her.

17
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,830
What?

18
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,509
Why...

19
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:59,780
is that there?

20
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:02,650
She reincarnated only after...

21
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,689
600 years.

22
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,960
Her only dream...

23
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,939
is to live an ordinary life
with her family.

24
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,340
Why?

25
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,680
Why is that inside Ji A?

26
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,180
It's her fate.

27
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,050
"Fate"?

28
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,120
Says who?

29
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,219
What did she do to deserve this?

30
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,360
How dare a spirit...

31
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,460
try to disgrace the skies?

32
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,960
You knew everything, didn't you?

33
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,969
That's why you kept on telling me
not to see her.

34
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,000
It feels like...

35
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,199
I've saved up 600 years...

36
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,469
only to have a swindler
steal my money.

37
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,580
So?

38
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,020
I'll need you to pay me
part of the principal.

39
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,750
I took you in
when all you had was debt.

40
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,279
So how dare you act so impudent
and demand a principal?

41
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,560
That's enough!

42
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:03,269
Calm yourself down.

43
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,240
You too. That's enough.

44
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,810
Listen carefully.

45
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,550
If Ji A ends up dying early,

46
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,790
I'm going to destroy both this world
and the afterlife.

47
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,620
I don't want to see your face.
Take him away.

48
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,529
Did you see her?

49
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,829
I'm curious how it feels.

50
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:28,500
It makes me want to cry.

51
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,569
I've waited all these years...

52
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,240
just to meet her.

53
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,620
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

54
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,519
- Pardon?
- I must seem strange to you.

55
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:51,220
Am I not the same Imoogi
from the past?

56
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,930
If I've changed,
it's only because this world has.

57
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,360
Imoogis and nine-tailed foxes
only exist in games these days.

58
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,839
I don't need to be old-fashioned,
do I?

59
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,170
They will begin
searching for us now.

60
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,610
I hope they do.

61
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,709
I can't wait to see her.

62
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,189
She may have sounded heartless,
but she probably didn't mean it.

63
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,089
She may be cold to the world,
but she cherished you...

64
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,930
like her own.

65
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,529
Don't try to comfort me.

66
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,569
I already want to cry as is.

67
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,269
Yeon, don't be swayed.

68
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,709
Just turn a blind eye.

69
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,610
Don't jump into the obvious fire pit
in front of you.

70
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,709
If I don't go there,
she'll get hurt.

71
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,879
Are you willing...

72
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,220
to undergo that tragedy once again?

73
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,759
If you get involved, one of you...

74
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:00,759
will die.

75
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,430
The moment the Imoogi wakes up
once again,

76
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,399
that'll be your fate.

77
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,079
No. Ji A will never die.

78
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,250
I promised...

79
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,350
to make sure that she'd live
this life to the fullest.

80
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,750
I'm going to protect her
at all costs.

81
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:50,069
(Episode 7: Trap of Samsara)

82
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:05,560
There are many moments in life
when a child needs their parents.

83
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:08,389
For example,
when they first start to walk.

84
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,899
Who else gets so excited
besides their parents...

85
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:13,629
when they start getting up
to take a few steps?

86
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:17,170
When I was the only one who didn't
have gimbap on a picnic...

87
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,600
or when a friend of mine said...

88
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,740
she'd tell her mom
after fighting with me.

89
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,279
I couldn't beat anyone
who had a mom.

90
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,779
I wish they had been mean to me.

91
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:31,420
If so, I wonder if I would've gotten
over everything...

92
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,850
and lived like everyone else.

93
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,820
What made you wait so long
for your parents?

94
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,090
It's simple.

95
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,490
Because I miss my mom and dad.

96
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:58,580
The fox marble?

97
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,250
Was that something important?

98
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,620
It was that fortune teller,
wasn't it?

99
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,320
He talked about my fate...

100
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,419
then said he'd let you go
if I gave that to him.

101
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:13,620
Still. How could you say yes
right away?

102
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,330
As if you were trading something in
for some candy.

103
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,360
I couldn't bear to lose you.

104
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,940
I'll be here for the time being.

105
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,269
You're going to stay here?

106
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,610
At my house?

107
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,080
- You're eating and sleeping here?
- Yes.

108
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,210
How could a nine-tailed fox
be this liberal?

109
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,519
If you're uncomfortable,
do you want to come over instead?

110
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,120
That's not what I meant.
Why all of a sudden?

111
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,590
This is the least amount
of protection I can offer.

112
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:47,220
Can you please stop forcing me...

113
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,960
to sacrifice my life for you
all the time?

114
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,210
I'm asking
if the sofa would be fine.

115
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,909
You've put your own life
on the line,

116
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,450
so I have no choice.

117
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,480
By the way, why are you awake?
You were asleep when I had left.

118
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,419
I had a nightmare.

119
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,320
- A nightmare?
- I saw a boy,

120
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,029
and he said hello to me.

121
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:26,059
- And then?
- That's it.

122
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,870
At first, I got goosebumps.

123
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,600
But after I woke up,

124
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,309
I felt strangely happy to see him...

125
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,340
as if I had known him already.

126
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,289
You're right. He's the most
valuable thing you have.

127
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,730
Your brother.

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Coke for me.

129
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,909
Why Coke?

130
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,539
Last time, I got drunk...

131
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:11,539
and killed all the pigeons
in my neighborhood.

132
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:12,710
So I'm being careful.

133
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:13,909
I suffered from enteritis.

134
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,250
Were you the one who left
that pigeon on my front door?

135
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,419
Did I carry one all the way there?

136
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,820
I can't remember.

137
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,820
You're not a cat, you know?

138
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,559
Did you find the item?

139
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,600
So these are the tiger's eyebrows.

140
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,799
So if you wear these,
you can see one's previous life?

141
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:42,940
Why do you look sad?

142
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,440
- I'm not sad. I'm mad.
- Why?

143
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,980
Because pathetically enough,
I still feel human emotions.

144
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,019
Could it be
because my blood is tainted?

145
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,519
You said your mom was human.

146
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:00,460
Did she hug and carry you?

147
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,190
Did she catch chickens for you...

148
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,399
and place pieces of meat
on top of your rice?

149
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,399
Don't make me lose my appetite.

150
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm just curious. I want to know
how it feels to be loved.

151
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,039
Loved?

152
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,190
Mom.

153
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
Wait here for a minute.

154
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,639
I don't want to. I'm scared.

155
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,309
Let me quickly gather
some Asian hazelnuts.

156
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:54,610
I want to tag along. I want to.

157
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,480
Why are you making this
so difficult?

158
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm only living because of you!
Do you want to die together then?

159
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,950
Mom?

160
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,049
If you're in love,

161
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,460
you could be sacrificed.

162
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,730
The one who loves more becomes prey.

163
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,759
I don't want that.
I'd rather be the predator.

164
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,700
Is it Sin Ju?

165
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:55,210
What has he done to you...

166
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,440
that a naive carnivore like you
is asking questions about love?

167
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:00,980
He's done nothing to me.

168
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,850
Even if the world falls apart,

169
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,720
your enemy will always be mine
as well.

170
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,850
Leave.

171
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:10,590
I want to be alone.

172
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,570
(Ki Yu Ri, Gu Sin Ju)

173
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:35,850
It's a 99.

174
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,049
Mr. Lee and Ms. Nam are only a 25.

175
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,220
Did you see that?

176
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:46,419
According to scientific proof
also known as probability,

177
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,860
I'm certain we feel attracted
to each other.

178
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,700
I know she's from abroad
and not the conventional type,

179
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,230
and she kissed me on the cheek
when we first met.

180
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,009
What are you saying?

181
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,669
Why would I get neutered?

182
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,409
In heat? No way, don't say something
like that.

183
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,379
Anyhow, although your mom...

184
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,820
pretended not to like it, she ate
all the samgyetang I bought her.

185
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,720
She may be a bit feisty,
but she's actually not that mean.

186
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,919
You know too, right?

187
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,629
You want samgyetang?

188
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,889
It's only been 30 minutes
since I fed you.

189
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,299
You don't remember?

190
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,070
You're really driving me crazy.

191
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:30,269
Hey!

192
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,549
How long are you going to
stand there like that?

193
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,490
- All night long.
- All night?

194
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,289
Don't mind me.

195
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,919
How could I not mind
when you're staring at me...

196
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,429
with those blazing eyes?

197
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,889
Then shall I stare at you
from outside?

198
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,200
You look horrifying.

199
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,440
How could I protect you when
you have so many complaints?

200
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,970
Go sleep on the couch.

201
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,210
No, that's beyond my visibility.

202
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,480
Then sleep here.

203
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,580
No, not on the bed,
but in this room.

204
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:21,490
Like I told you before,

205
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,720
I'm more modern than you think,
so I can't sleep on the floor.

206
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,820
You go down
if you're uncomfortable.

207
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,220
Who says I'm uncomfortable?

208
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,210
Aren't you going to sleep?

209
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,710
I'm not sleepy.

210
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,649
There's something my dad taught me
a long time ago.

211
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,389
When you're having trouble sleeping,

212
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,889
imagine something that makes you
happy just thinking about it.

213
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,500
Something like
mint chocolate ice cream?

214
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:14,299
I think about the smell
of fresh-cooked rice.

215
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:20,009
The sound of a pencil
being sharpened in the sharpener?

216
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,680
New shoes.

217
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,049
The professional baseball season.

218
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,890
A collection of world literature.

219
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,490
A puppy's paws.

220
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,660
The gimbap my dad made for me.

221
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,369
Although we hardly say it now,

222
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,769
the word "letter".

223
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:52,609
It's your turn.

224
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,609
Are you sleeping?

225
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,720
Yes, I'm thinking of...

226
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,490
a red umbrella.

227
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,019
No!

228
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,329
What's with that reaction?

229
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:50,829
Why are you smiling?

230
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,640
Wasn't I so cool just now?

231
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,809
I ran fast like Spider Man
and saved you.

232
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,950
The type of human I hate the most.

233
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,390
Look at his runny nose.

234
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,019
Do you like Spider Man?

235
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,720
- No.
- Why not?

236
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,930
- I just don't like him.
- I do.

237
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,390
I didn't ask.

238
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,130
Stop talking to me.

239
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,329
I'm in a lousy mood already.

240
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,640
What am I doing, waking up
at 4:30 in the morning?

241
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:01,509
It's almost finished, I think.

242
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,410
- You're here.
- What are you doing?

243
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,710
- Is this dried pollack soup?
- Yes, dried pollack soup.

244
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Did you burn all of this?

245
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,250
My goodness, how unbelievable.

246
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,680
I didn't burn it.
I just... What shall I say?

247
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,150
I'm making dried pollack soup...
Hey, I used too much.

248
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,220
Go get some more dried pollack.
I used everything.

249
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,259
You used all of this?

250
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,759
I added sugar by mistake.

251
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,000
I'll just do it. Move over.

252
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,230
Good morning.

253
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,170
Hey, did you sleep well?

254
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,869
Yes.

255
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:09,509
Let's have breakfast.

256
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:13,410
Dried pollack soup is the best
for a hangover.

257
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,309
You made all of this on your own?

258
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,250
That's not important.

259
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,480
- What's important is that I tried.
- This is amazing.

260
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,960
Good morning, Ms. Nam.

261
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,529
What? What are you doing here?

262
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,400
I heard you're living together.

263
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,170
I brought some clothes
for Mr. Lee to change into.

264
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:40,569
Where's the bleach?

265
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,769
What for?

266
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:43,640
You have so much water stains
on your sink.

267
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,180
I rubbed the tiles with
baking soda and vinegar.

268
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,509
But I have to get rid of the hair
stuck in the drain. Also,

269
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,650
stop stuffing your fridge with
delivery food. It's full of germs.

270
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,890
- What are you, my mother-in-law?
- Goodness.

271
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,849
I'm sorry to nag you
about your housekeeping skills,

272
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,519
but Mr. Lee has never done
any kind of work in his home...

273
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,589
and he's even a neat freak.

274
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,630
- What did you say?
- Enjoy your breakfast then.

275
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,029
Where is the bleach?

276
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,269
It's in the drawer in the bathroom.

277
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:12,200
He should've just kept looking
for it. Why come here...

278
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,140
Wait.

279
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,650
- You burned this?
- Well, not actually.

280
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,920
I just failed to control the heat.

281
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,089
Are you trying to look cute
in this situation?

282
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,460
Dried pollack has taken over
my body.

283
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,799
Cute? I'm more than 1,000 years old.

284
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,970
- Let's eat.
- Yes, let's eat.

285
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,799
This is a soft-boiled egg.

286
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,420
Do you like it?

287
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,359
Yes?

288
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,230
May I?

289
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,769
Come in.

290
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:18,339
Here.

291
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:20,569
Thank you.

292
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,170
Well... Ms. Nam.

293
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,940
I know this may sound strange,

294
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,609
but please stay safe.

295
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,549
If you get hurt, Mr. Lee...

296
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:37,289
will get hurt twice, no,
ten times worse than that.

297
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,089
I envy Lee Yeon.

298
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,059
He has a friend who worries
about him so much.

299
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:46,960
He's very precious to me.

300
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:50,430
I give you my word.

301
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:53,069
I'll try my best to be safe.

302
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,309
He has become...

303
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,009
precious to me too.

304
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:01,609
Let's go.

305
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,779
You're going to be late.

306
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,849
I'm coming!

307
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,869
Where are you going?

308
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,630
Me? I'm going to work.

309
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,150
When you say you're going to work,
do you mean my office?

310
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,250
Yes. Of course.

311
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,049
You can't enter the building
without a pass.

312
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,259
I'm a nine-tailed fox.
No one can stop me.

313
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:47,319
I'll take care of it.

314
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,589
Why are you dressed like that?

315
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,900
Well, I'm dressed like this
so that I won't stand out.

316
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,430
- Do you not like it?
- It's not that.

317
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,400
People don't wear ties
unless they're an executive.

318
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,099
- Really?
- Yes.

319
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,009
Should we take off that tie?

320
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,339
I don't want to.
I'll just be an executive.

321
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:12,519
- Hello, Chief Director.
- Good work, everyone.

322
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,819
What was that?
Did you hypnotize them?

323
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:18,890
Yes.

324
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,759
Why the chief director
of all people?

325
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,630
Usually in dramas, the handsome
and the rich are often in that role.

326
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,329
What will you do now
as the chief director?

327
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,869
I'll wait for you here.

328
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,240
Here? All day long?

329
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,670
I'm used to waiting,
more than anything else.

330
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,980
24 hours is nothing.
I could sit here for 24 years.

331
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,250
Here.

332
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,000
I'll see you later.

333
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:02,769
Call me right away
if anything happens.

334
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,569
Okay.

335
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,539
Thank you for being there for me,
Yeon.

336
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,819
If you get involved, one of you...

337
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:27,789
will die.

338
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,289
The moment the Imoogi wakes up
once again,

339
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,930
that'll be your fate.

340
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,430
Maybe this will be my last life.

341
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:48,349
It's not so bad.

342
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:01,619
Shoot. I forgot to take off
the rhinestones.

343
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,309
Hello. I'm the babysitter
scheduled to start working today.

344
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,980
I don't need you to do
anything else. Just feed the boy.

345
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,880
Today's the day.

346
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,990
Today, Imoogi will be fully grown.

347
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,519
He'll get a new face and a new body.

348
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,740
(A scene of someone getting
a tattoo punishment in the Edo era.)

349
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:54,480
A man wearing a navy suit
came to see me.

350
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:56,750
He told me an accident
would happen on March 3...

351
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,349
at Yeou Gogae.

352
00:27:58,349 --> 00:27:59,480
It was faint,

353
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,890
but there was a trace of a tattoo
he received as punishment.

354
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:04,319
West capital.

355
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:07,720
A tattoo punishment on the face...

356
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,990
was the harshest of all punishments
that did bodily harm.

357
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,460
Those with the tattoos were
despised and looked down on,

358
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,599
and they could not mingle
with others.

359
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,140
By "west capital", they must mean
the current Pyongyang.

360
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,079
(West capital)

361
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,180
Why "west capital" of all places?

362
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,920
(West capital, tattoo punishment)

363
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,390
"The leading members who started
the Rebellion of Myocheong..."

364
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,390
"during the Koryo Dynasty..."

365
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,690
"were given tattoo punishments
before being exiled"?

366
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:43,630
"The Rebellion of Myocheong".

367
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,160
"A group of people who brought chaos
to the period with prophecies."

368
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,470
"The text that was engraved
on the forehead of the criminals..."

369
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:54,640
"was 'west capital' or
'west capital traitor'".

370
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,240
That jerk was a traitor.

371
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,430
The target of that accident
wasn't the parents.

372
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:23,730
The target was the daughter.

373
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:34,410
Where are you?

374
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:36,849
I just started to tail him.

375
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,089
He seems to be in a rush.

376
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,690
- Is he by himself?
- Yes.

377
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,359
Keep on watching Rang's movements.

378
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:55,470
Are you telling me to find a man
with a tattoo on his forehead?

379
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:57,400
And that man is on the same side
as Imoogi.

380
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,599
Yes. Imoogi is definitely related
to Rang.

381
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:08,680
Shoot.

382
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,920
Did he lose his wallet or something?

383
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,130
Find those glasses.

384
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,430
Find them no matter what.

385
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,630
"Glasses"?

386
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,369
Who is he speaking to?

387
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:38,410
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

388
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,339
- You're back.
- Let's start.

389
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,750
Time out.
Jae Hwan, let me see your forehead.

390
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,549
What? Why?

391
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,819
It's nothing.

392
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,490
Who was that man?

393
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:54,119
- Who is he?
- Is he your boyfriend?

394
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,730
- He's a source, isn't he?
- How much did you bet?

395
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,500
- 50 dollars.
- Tell us. What is he to you?

396
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,529
I don't know. I wonder...

397
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,299
what our relationship is too.

398
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:08,569
- What do you mean?
- When you're curious,

399
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,980
you should check his heartbeat.

400
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,009
The body doesn't lie.

401
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,950
Why is his heart beating so fast?

402
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:22,789
Maybe his body lies.

403
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,619
Did you hold hands with that man?

404
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,089
No, not yet.

405
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:38,099
Did you hold something else
other than his hand?

406
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:39,269
What did you hold?

407
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,339
Did you find new items?

408
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,009
Gosh. What a rare item.

409
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,150
What? Why? What is it?

410
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,779
I'm just trying to see
your forehead.

411
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,299
No!

412
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,549
I found the person
who found the glasses.

413
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,619
- Who was it?
- It was a young child.

414
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,559
"A young child"?

415
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,529
You must've had
too many drinks last night.

416
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,269
Not my family.

417
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:19,170
Someone who rescued me from the zoo.

418
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,299
- They must be your savior.
- Of course.

419
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,410
He just ripped the zookeeper apart.

420
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,640
You'll get to meet him soon too.

421
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,529
Bye.

422
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:29,769
Did you think I didn't know?

423
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,090
Leave your dinner schedules
empty today.

424
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,960
The president wants to see us.

425
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,489
What are we having?

426
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,860
We'll be going over to his place.

427
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,070
His place?
Gosh, I feel so uncomfortable.

428
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,329
Why would you feel uncomfortable?

429
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,670
He only invites those
who are close to him.

430
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,710
But this time, he invited us.
Do you know what that means?

431
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:05,880
Do you?

432
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,349
Anyway...
Fine, let's all get samgyetang.

433
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:15,449
What is this?

434
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,550
I'm sorry, but I think
there's a misunderstanding.

435
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,789
We were just about to order
some samgyetang.

436
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,489
Enjoy. It's on the house.

437
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,289
- On the house?
- On the house?

438
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,300
Why are you giving us free dishes?

439
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,670
Because we have
a very special guest.

440
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,739
I guess it's not an overstatement
to say that I've brought...

441
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,980
80 percent of our employees here.
Am I right?

442
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:43,050
I know I'm a VIP guest,
but you might go broke...

443
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,380
if you keep giving us free dishes.

444
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,880
Do you lack magnesium?

445
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,420
Your eye keeps twitching.

446
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,159
Please enjoy.

447
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,059
As you know from legend,

448
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,230
our ancestors have laughed and cried
over every piece of vegetable...

449
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,599
and every flower petal
in our traditional food.

450
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,300
Just like you.

451
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,670
Isn't she so eloquent?

452
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,239
Eat up, guys.

453
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:13,539
It's all thanks to me
that you can enjoy such luxury,

454
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:14,679
you peasants.

455
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,079
What do you keep looking at?

456
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,590
What?

457
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:24,989
Nothing.

458
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,059
That guy.

459
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:34,699
It's him, right?

460
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,139
It is. Goodness, you.

461
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,599
Come eat with us.

462
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,739
Me?

463
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,449
It's a small world, isn't it?

464
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,380
Whether it is a coincidence or not,
we've all gathered here.

465
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,420
It's not.

466
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,889
Then why are you here?

467
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,820
Because she is.

468
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,559
What kind of relationship is this?

469
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,130
Jae Hwan.

470
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,260
It's not mutual,
but I'm hitting on her.

471
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,360
A one-sided love?

472
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,670
Is that how you're going to waste
that handsome face of yours?

473
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,469
He is hitting on me,
and it's mutual.

474
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,289
Why were you tailing me?

475
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,289
Why did Yeon tell you to do that?

476
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,300
Do you think...

477
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,170
I'm still the naive, young boy
who used to follow Yeon around?

478
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,670
I know you're not.

479
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:53,940
I also know that you can kill me
in the blink of an eye.

480
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,050
Then answer. Why did you tail me?

481
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:00,949
I'm sure...

482
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:04,289
you know the answer
better than anyone else.

483
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,219
Are you playing twenty questions
with me?

484
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,659
I've lived my entire life
for Mr. Lee.

485
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,530
I could live this long
thanks to him.

486
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,670
Even if I die right now,

487
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,340
I refuse to do anything
that could harm him.

488
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:35,349
Are you doing this
out of loyalty or sympathy?

489
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,690
Or are you just dumb?

490
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:40,659
It's the same reason...

491
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:44,059
why you're dying to kill him.

492
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,460
Because I like him.

493
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:56,840
Excuse me, but what do you do?

494
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,039
- What's your job?
- I don't have one.

495
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,610
I knew it.

496
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,750
He has all the time in the world
and has never experienced the world.

497
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,150
That's why
he's head over heels for her.

498
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,389
Can I give him one good punch
in the ribs?

499
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,320
No. Hold it in.

500
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,360
Are you really jobless?

501
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,300
- He receives monthly rent.
- Gosh, do you own a building?

502
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,969
It's only around 30 million dollars.

503
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,099
I do?

504
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,409
Do you have any brothers?

505
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,980
- I do have a younger brother.
- Hello, brother-in-law.

506
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,550
Well then, how old are you?

507
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,690
I'm a bit old.

508
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:46,960
- I'm a thousand...
- He's older than he looks.

509
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:51,289
- I guess you've had a family then.
- What do you mean?

510
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,030
He's asking if you're divorced
like he is.

511
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,670
Is he the one who divorced
in less than a year?

512
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
That's right!

513
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:00,940
You already knew.

514
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,710
He's a bachelor.

515
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,309
He's like a protagonist
in a fantasy drama.

516
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,920
What's his problem?

517
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:15,019
He always does that.

518
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,449
Mr. Choi.

519
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:20,190
- There he goes again.
- Mr. Choi.

520
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,389
- Just eat.
- By the way...

521
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,869
I need to stop by somewhere.

522
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,380
Hey, kid. Are you okay?

523
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,960
You're so pretty.

524
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:55,829
I am?

525
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,090
Kids these days have bad eyesight
because of smartphones.

526
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,329
- A eunuch.
- What?

527
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,829
What is a eunuch?

528
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,539
- It's a sad story.
- No, I'm not.

529
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,710
- I wish I could show you.
- Hey, watch it. He's a kid.

530
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,269
He called me a eunuch.

531
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,380
Kids can't lie.

532
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,780
Hey, kid. Are you feeling ill?

533
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:25,789
You're scary.

534
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,920
- What?
- Your face...

535
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:31,559
looks very frightening.

536
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,110
- So I'm that ugly?
- Yes.

537
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,440
You know how kids can't lie.

538
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:51,150
Hey, you're here.

539
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,219
- Where's Sin Ju?
- He's still breathing.

540
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,820
Leave him out of this
and just talk to me.

541
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,760
I guess you cherish him a lot.

542
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:04,960
I do cherish him much more
than I do you...

543
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,130
who has been going through puberty
ever since the Joseon Dynasty.

544
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:12,539
Why did you tail me?

545
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,369
I'm not the type
to beat around the bush.

546
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,909
Why the Imoogi?

547
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,679
You finally found out.

548
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,409
There must've been countless ways
to kill me.

549
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,849
So why the Imoogi?

550
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:28,519
I was just curious
about what would happen...

551
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,519
if your past affairs
repeated themselves.

552
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,949
As you know, I'm an aesthete.

553
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,289
Does he have something on you?

554
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,860
He does.

555
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,929
To be precise,
there's give and take,

556
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:40,960
so it's an agreement.

557
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:44,630
Listen to me carefully.

558
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:49,039
There are some in this world that
you should never make deals with.

559
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:50,309
I need to make a living.

560
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:51,639
Step back.

561
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:55,880
If not, you'll pay heavily for it.

562
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,150
You know what?

563
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,849
If that was the case...

564
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,420
and my life was really in danger,

565
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,820
would you come save me?

566
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,860
You can save yourself.

567
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:19,469
You seem to be having fun
with your first love.

568
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,739
But do you think...

569
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,440
she'll want to be with you...

570
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,170
if she finds out what happened
in your previous lives?

571
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,380
If you mess with her,

572
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,980
I will really kill you this time.

573
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,159
Mr. Lee, I found that kid.

574
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,730
I'll happily...

575
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,929
let you kill me.

576
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:59,510
Give me Sin Ju.

577
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,909
You owe me for letting him live.

578
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,039
Mr. Lee.

579
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,280
Give me my glasses.

580
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:40,019
No, they're my magic glasses.

581
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:58,400
I don't go easy on children.

582
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,409
Gosh, stop it.
I hate the sound of people crying.

583
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,449
I would've killed you
in the old days.

584
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:13,719
I'm letting you live thanks to
the low birth rate recently.

585
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,239
No way.

586
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:38,239
It can't be.

587
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:44,050
A black puppy?

588
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:46,219
I'm so excited!

589
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,420
Faster!

590
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:54,219
Blackie...

591
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,570
I won't get attached to
a creature like that again.

592
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,400
I will never...

593
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:29,989
Why did you follow me?

594
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,030
Are you Spider Man?

595
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,929
You moved super fast
like Spider Man.

596
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,070
You seriously annoy me.

597
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,500
Why are you buying me this bread
if I annoy you?

598
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:42,739
I'm just repaying a debt.

599
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,139
You can eat this and get lost now.

600
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,309
A debt?

601
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,980
Is that something you use
to brush your hair?

602
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:50,309
You're even stupid.

603
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,320
How could you be born
as a lowly human being?

604
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,480
Let's go in.

605
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,340
Ms. Nam, come on.

606
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:50,110
Hurry up.

607
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,269
- Come on.
- Okay.

608
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,110
It's a two-story building.

609
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,949
How much do you think
this place costs?

610
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,619
Why? Are you going to buy one?

611
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:05,090
It's not bad, but it's too far from
the subway station.

612
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,519
My goodness.

613
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,559
I didn't expect to see
ground cherries in Seoul.

614
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,670
These are ground cherries?

615
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,400
They look like lanterns.

616
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,800
We used to dig the insides out
and blow it like a pipe.

617
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:25,409
- It makes a sound?
- Sure.

618
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:29,539
My mom used to beat me up
saying I might attract snakes.

619
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,849
Goodness.

620
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,019
Don't touch that.

621
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,690
- It's very special to me.
- I'm sorry, sir.

622
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,760
There are just two rules
in my house.

623
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,360
Number one, don't touch
the ground cherries.

624
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,300
- And don't blow it like a pipe.
- I might attract snakes.

625
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,570
And second, never go upstairs.

626
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:57,210
Oh, is someone up there?

627
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,670
No, I'm the only one here.

628
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,809
And the people from
the catering agency.

629
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,650
Well, anyhow, don't go upstairs
like he told you.

630
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,780
Are you hungry?

631
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,650
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

632
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,059
Water.

633
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:15,559
What?

634
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:17,090
- Water.
- Water?

635
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:25,329
Here.

636
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:27,599
- The lid.
- The lid?

637
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,309
You want me to feed you water?

638
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,480
I'm injured.

639
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,679
Fine, here.

640
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,199
- Where is Ms. Nam?
- At a dinner appointment.

641
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:56,900
Don't you have to go?

642
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,800
She went with her colleagues.
She'll be back later.

643
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:05,340
Why isn't the chicken coming?

644
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,909
Oh, the chicken.

645
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:10,179
It's on its way.

646
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:12,150
- One garlic chicken, right?
- Garlic drumsticks.

647
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,619
- You ordered the original?
- Yes.

648
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:19,860
Seriously.

649
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,360
I'll let it slide
since that tastes good too.

650
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,099
Go feed the dog
before the chicken arrives.

651
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:29,159
Okay.

652
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,730
Wait a minute.

653
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,170
Are you really hurt?

654
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,039
Are you just pretending
to order me around?

655
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:38,239
My body hurts...

656
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:40,579
and so does my heart.

657
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:43,809
See? What did I tell you
from the beginning?

658
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:46,110
I said that necklace thief
seemed fishy.

659
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,750
Stop calling her a thief.

660
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,719
She has a pretty name, Yu Ri.

661
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:53,960
Yu Ri or whoever she is,
Lee Rang ordered her to use you.

662
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,260
We started on the wrong path,
but our score is a 99.

663
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,559
99? What are you talking about?

664
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:01,760
Here.

665
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:07,769
It's a matchmaking score
based on names.

666
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,639
(Ki Yu Ri, Gu Sin Ju)

667
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:13,739
(Nam Ji A, Lee Yeon)

668
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:16,949
Nam Ji A and I are 25?

669
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:20,219
My back, my head, my legs, my heart.

670
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:22,920
Wait, I'll do it again.
Something's wrong here.

671
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,789
Let's have a drink.

672
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:30,960
"Searching for Ghost Stories
in the City" Team.

673
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,030
I hope you grasp the viewers
with your content...

674
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,860
and become a long-running program.

675
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,030
Thank you.

676
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,570
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

677
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,039
- Tell us about it.
- When we shot in Gonjiam,

678
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:45,110
we brought a cross, rosary,
and even a talisman.

679
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,280
He's right. He even takes
relaxing pills.

680
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,710
Even when he went so well-prepared,

681
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,579
the camera shook so badly
because of his trembling hands.

682
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:54,619
Ji A almost killed him.

683
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:55,949
That's when I realized...

684
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,389
a person can be scarier than
a ghost.

685
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,159
Ji A has always been bold.

686
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:04,429
I noticed it during the interview
and didn't let her go anywhere else.

687
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,659
I remember. You told me...

688
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:09,360
to work at this company
no matter what.

689
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,269
I remember something too.

690
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:13,570
It was when we went to
that workshop together.

691
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:16,469
We were at the training institute
and the mic was broken.

692
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:19,639
- So he...
- Did we go to a workshop together?

693
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:21,210
Yes, we did.

694
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,650
By the way, do you believe in
ghosts or ghost stories?

695
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,949
I almost died a long time ago.

696
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,789
I miraculously survived.

697
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:38,860
What I met at that moment
wasn't a person.

698
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,530
Then what was it?

699
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,429
It was a miracle.

700
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:46,900
My gosh.

701
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,780
- Where is the restroom?
- Go inside and go straight.

702
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,179
I'll be right back.

703
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,380
Sir, don't you remember...

704
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:05,349
when we went to that award ceremony
for the producers' association...

705
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:15,099
Is someone upstairs?

706
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:27,639
Am I just hearing things?

707
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,590
What am I doing
at a stranger's home?

708
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,639
A nail?

709
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,400
Champagne sits well with me.

710
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:32,300
Stop him.

711
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,369
- Stop drinking.
- How dare you?

712
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:36,139
Champagne isn't real alcohol.

713
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,639
What's taking Ji A so long?

714
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:41,880
- Should I go check?
- No, you're a guest.

715
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,380
I'll see you later.

716
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,099
Welcome.

717
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,570
- Yes?
- What time will you be done?

718
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,170
In about 30 minutes.

719
00:57:14,469 --> 00:57:16,400
- Are you still at the vet?
- Yes.

720
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,639
Give me the address.
I'll come to get you.

721
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:22,679
No, I said I'd take a taxi
with Jae Hwan and Ms. Kim.

722
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:25,349
Okay. I'll see you at home later.

723
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:26,820
See you later.

724
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:33,760
Sir.

725
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:35,590
I told you.
The second floor is off-limits.

726
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:37,860
I'm sorry.

727
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,159
But is there someone inside?

728
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,869
I keep hearing sounds from inside.

729
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:46,030
It must be the wind.
I left the window open.

730
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,699
Let's go and have dessert.

731
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:50,869
Okay.

732
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:24,670
Why are you crying?

733
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,610
I haven't seen you
with such a happy face for so long.

734
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:37,250
Yes.

735
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:39,320
You should take a good look at it.

736
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,260
If you can, only remember this face.

737
00:58:43,489 --> 00:58:45,329
Why do you sound like
you're going to leave?

738
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:46,929
Where would I go?

739
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:49,659
I hope you live long.

740
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:54,840
You should be as happy as you want
while Ms. Nam is alive.

741
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,579
I'm glad you're back.
Do you think ghosts are bad?

742
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,610
Do you go around catching them
because they're bad?

743
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:06,349
If that's the case,
you should arrest them.

744
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,320
Sir, this is what I think.

745
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:10,449
I believe we're a community.

746
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:14,289
A ghost might be supernatural
or a psychological phenomenon.

747
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:17,989
Even if that's the case,
when we meet ghosts...

748
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,960
Thank you. Thank you for feeding us.

749
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,800
Thank you. Even if I keep on
talking nonsense...

750
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,900
We should be begging on our knees!

751
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,579
So you found this at his house?

752
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,909
- Yes.
- It's disgusting.

753
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:43,050
It's an artificial nail that was
glued on. It has cheap rhinestones.

754
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,119
Whose could it be?

755
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,219
It doesn't belong to you or me,

756
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:48,489
and the catering staff
had clean nails too.

757
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,289
His wife died
more than 20 years ago.

758
00:59:51,289 --> 00:59:55,260
You should've asked him
if he has a girlfriend.

759
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,460
To the president?

760
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,900
How can you have a social life
with that mind of yours?

761
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:04,510
It would make more sense to see it
as his secret hobby.

762
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,670
Nail art?

763
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,739
Why would he do nail art as a hobby?

764
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:17,690
Your rice is ready.

765
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:29,659
Are you home?

766
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:34,800
Did you make rice? I already ate.

767
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,940
I know. But you said you like
the smell of fresh-cooked rice.

768
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,940
I'm not very good at cooking,

769
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,440
but I'm really good at adding
the perfect amount of water.

770
01:00:45,949 --> 01:00:48,219
So this is what it feels like
to come home...

771
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,619
to the smell of fresh-made rice.

772
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:52,719
I'll let the smell welcome you
every day while I'm here.

773
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:56,590
Here.

774
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:58,559
What is this?

775
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:00,130
I found it on my way home.

776
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:05,369
- Mint chocolate?
- Let me go get changed.

777
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,510
I thought it was recycling
since she found it on her way home.

778
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,889
What do you normally do at night?

779
01:01:27,789 --> 01:01:28,820
Did you say you watch
American dramas?

780
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:32,230
I read books or watch the news.

781
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,630
I usually watch movies.

782
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:37,929
Should we watch a movie?

783
01:01:39,769 --> 01:01:40,869
Shall we?

784
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,340
(- What was that?
- What is it?)

785
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,760
(Hey. Can we escape that way?)

786
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,590
(This is not a joke.)

787
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:05,989
(What they said on the Internet
is true.)

788
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,500
(Did you film it?)

789
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,960
(- What?
- Did you get it?)

790
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,269
(This place is much scarier.)

791
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:25,349
What's wrong? Is the movie boring?

792
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,619
No, it's fun.

793
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:35,260
It's so fun that I wish
time would freeze right now.

794
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,929
Me too.

795
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:45,760
I think about the smell
of fresh-cooked rice.

796
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:47,929
New shoes.

797
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,280
(Nam Ji A)

798
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:22,829
Wear them and look in the mirror.

799
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:26,070
The answer to your curiosity
lies there.

800
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:38,880
New shoes.

801
01:04:39,949 --> 01:04:42,280
Which women's shoes
are supposed to be pretty?

802
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:54,900
Excuse me...

803
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:56,230
Gosh.

804
01:04:58,570 --> 01:04:59,670
Gosh.

805
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,739
- What is it?
- I sent your woman a gift.

806
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,710
I think it was called
the tiger's eyebrows or something.

807
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,119
(Lee Yeon)

808
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:20,150
(Wear them and look in the mirror.)

809
01:05:21,219 --> 01:05:22,719
(Nam Ji A)

810
01:06:02,429 --> 01:06:03,829
Oh, come on.

811
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:05,699
Gosh.

812
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,079
This woman means nothing to me.

813
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:51,050
Did you not think
that I could've used her as bait...

814
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:52,110
to wake you up?

815
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:53,349
Lee Yeon.

816
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:28,119
Did you see it?

817
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:33,650
Answer me. Did you?

818
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,469
Look at me, please.

819
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,380
What...

820
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,550
did you see?

821
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,980
I...

822
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:07,349
was murdered in my previous life.

823
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:13,159
You...

824
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,560
killed me.

825
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:20,430
From the beginning,

826
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:23,869
you were only determined
to kill the Imoogi.

827
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:27,710
Lee Yeon.

828
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,350
I was only...

829
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:37,279
a sacrifice.

830
01:09:16,989 --> 01:09:20,060
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

831
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,199
If I am reincarnated,

832
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,470
I would like to live
as a human for once.

833
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:28,069
I refuse to yield to you anymore.

834
01:09:28,069 --> 01:09:30,539
Where is the Imoogi?

835
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:34,510
You were a sacrifice given to me
from the day you were born.

836
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,180
She's going to become my bride?

837
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,579
What do you fear the most?

838
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:40,149
Yeou Gogae.

839
01:09:40,449 --> 01:09:43,449
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

840
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,390
Mom!

841
01:09:45,619 --> 01:09:48,159
Hang in there just a little longer.
