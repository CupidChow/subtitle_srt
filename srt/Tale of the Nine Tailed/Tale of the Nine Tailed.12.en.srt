10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Mom?

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
Dad?

12
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
This is real, right?

13
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,150
Are you really my mom and dad?

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
Mom.

15
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,040
Don't you recognize me?

16
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,510
Dad. It's me, Ji A.

17
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,709
Your daughter.

18
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,359
I guess it's no surprise.

19
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,430
It's been over 20 years.

20
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,530
My daughter...

21
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,629
grew up so much.

22
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,270
But...

23
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,879
you're still a crybaby.

24
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,550
Can you...

25
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,650
recognize me?

26
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,490
A parent would never have trouble
recognizing their child.

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,460
Mom.

28
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:35,289
I'm sorry
for making you wait so long.

29
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,930
Mom is sorry.

30
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,599
I missed you.

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,969
I missed you so much.

32
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:01,719
You brothers did something huge.

33
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,460
She will finally get a good night's
sleep after 20 years.

34
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,990
You know I always do
what I put my mind in to.

35
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,689
- Was Rang's contract broken?
- Completely.

36
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:08,729
That's so awesome.

37
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,229
You can keep going.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,699
The world is so unfair.

39
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,069
Not only are you handsome,
you're good at everything.

40
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,069
You're blinding me.

41
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,509
Did you make up with Yeon?

42
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,840
I wouldn't say we made up.
I just forgave him.

43
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,250
I don't like Yeon.

44
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Why not?

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Because he harassed you
for such a long time.

46
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,860
You're not going to live with him,
are you?

47
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,090
I'm not crazy.

48
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,189
You can't ignore me just because
you two are on good terms now.

49
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,530
What are you going to do about it
if I do?

50
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,159
I'll bite you.

51
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:49,629
I raised you wrong.

52
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,439
(5 years ago)

53
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,529
This is how you do it.

54
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,069
When someone bites you,
bite them back just the same.

55
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,110
The world is a cruel place to those
who don't scream about their pain.

56
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,480
I never asked you to save me!

57
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Right.

58
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,680
Some people rescue, feed, and love
others when they never asked for it,

59
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,850
and even end up throwing them away.

60
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,750
I hate people like that too.

61
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,459
So when you finish your food,
get out of my house.

62
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,730
What?

63
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,519
I told you not to follow me.

64
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,420
Try wielding it.

65
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,029
Again. Here, here,

66
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,829
and here are the vital points.
Memorize them.

67
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:04,939
Again.

68
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,370
Again.

69
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,069
Again. Again.

70
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:25,490
Mr. Lee.

71
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,790
I stabbed someone's vital point
in one go.

72
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,300
Good work.

73
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,379
Should I buy you some pigs' feet?
It's been a while.

74
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:51,680
No. It reminds me
of my garbage-like past.

75
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,250
How about boiled pork instead?

76
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,160
No. Today's perfect for pigs' feet.

77
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,430
He always does what he wants to do.

78
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,300
Don't do that.

79
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,870
Let's eat half and half.

80
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,029
I'm in.

81
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,110
(Searching for Missing Parents)

82
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,339
My goodness.

83
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,449
What are all these?

84
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,149
At first,
I tried handing out flyers,

85
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,250
but no one believed me.

86
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,829
That's why I decided to become
a producer myself...

87
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,430
to find you.

88
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,100
That's how I found you right now.

89
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,000
Ji A.

90
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,040
I'm so proud of you.

91
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:50,470
How do you feel?
Does it hurt anywhere?

92
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,009
We're not hurting anywhere,
so don't you worry.

93
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,709
We should still get you checked
just in case.

94
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,550
This is that music box.

95
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,920
The accident at Yeou Gogae...

96
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,120
feels like just yesterday.

97
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:09,029
Everything's all in their places,
but it's been 20 years.

98
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:11,329
- Gosh.
- Where have you been...

99
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,100
all this time?

100
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,730
I don't know.

101
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,540
It just feels like
I've been sleeping for a long time.

102
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,269
- Is it the same for you?
- Yes.

103
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:27,509
Then...

104
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,220
what is this?
Isn't this your writing?

105
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,190
"Ji A, why aren't you coming
to rescue us?"

106
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,590
I woke up from my sleep once.

107
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,590
A young man with a white and
clean face appeared and told me...

108
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:46,659
that I'd be able to see you
if I wrote this.

109
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,600
It must've been that man.

110
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,370
No, it's not him. It was Yeon.

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,539
Yeon saved you two.

112
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,809
- Was he the man from before?
- Yes.

113
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,240
What's he like?

114
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,149
He only cares about me.

115
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,820
He waited a very long time for me...

116
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,519
and is willing to sacrifice himself
to save me.

117
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,360
Is he your boyfriend?

118
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,200
- You've really grown up.
- Gosh.

119
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,230
I'm so sad.

120
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,139
I wanted to be the first to find out
that you had a boyfriend...

121
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,899
and nag you so much.

122
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,070
Do nag. I really wanted to hear it.

123
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,179
There were so many things
that I wanted to do for you.

124
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,580
You can do them
starting from now on.

125
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,620
I'll do that.

126
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,789
I'm so proud of you.

127
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,029
You've grown up so well
and have become an amazing producer.

128
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,840
(Ji A)

129
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,179
A video call out of the blue?

130
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,450
It's been a while since my puppy
slept by himself, so I was worried.

131
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,519
- "Puppy"?
- Let's do everything...

132
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,559
that couples do.

133
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,860
Let's make nicknames,
wear matching rings,

134
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,200
and do ridiculous things
while talking on the phone.

135
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,360
"Ridiculous things"?

136
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,029
Things like this.

137
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:33,039
You must be on cloud nine.

138
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,210
Yes, I am. I could fly.

139
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,610
Don't fly away.

140
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,610
Your puppy will cry.

141
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,279
Thank you, Yeon,

142
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,990
for keeping your promise
about finding my parents.

143
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,919
I wish every night was like today
for you.

144
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,830
I'll make sure that happens.

145
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,500
Ji A, let's go to bed.

146
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,730
I should go.

147
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,000
Goodnight.

148
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,039
Goodnight. Dream of me.

149
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:25,220
(Episode 12: Tail-Chasing Game)

150
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,830
I almost died
because of those darn foxes!

151
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,909
I was just about to call you.

152
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,879
I was 99-percent done with my work,
but then they fooled me.

153
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,049
It's a small hiccup.

154
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,590
I've lost my ground cherries
and my hostage.

155
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,960
Thanks to you,
I don't have many cards to play.

156
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,399
I can put everything
back in its place. Trust me.

157
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,799
Speaking of which,

158
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,100
where are you right now?

159
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,470
I'm on the road.

160
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,500
I can hear...

161
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,870
your troubled heart over the phone.

162
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:19,379
Come here and find out...

163
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,610
if what awaits you is life...

164
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:23,480
or death.

165
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,659
I refuse to die. Never.
After surviving for all these years?

166
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,899
No, I refuse to.

167
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:26,710
Why am I here?

168
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,950
Welcome.

169
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,889
Imoogi.

170
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,429
I prefer Terry to Imoogi.

171
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,059
That's what you first called me by.

172
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:22,899
It was you.

173
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,700
How did you bring me here?

174
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:29,139
It wasn't me. You called me.

175
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:31,940
- What?
- This is your dream.

176
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,549
And we're communicating.

177
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:36,350
I don't want to do anything
with you.

178
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,789
We're fated to be together.

179
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:43,820
Disappear. Get lost!

180
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:52,360
Look closely. I'm you.

181
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,029
How can I catch the Imoogi...

182
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:11,309
without causing any harm to Ji A?

183
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,750
Then...

184
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,149
where do I begin?

185
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,789
It's me, Yeon.

186
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
I know. I'm not happy
to call you either.

187
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,600
I was wondering if you wanted
some ground cherries.

188
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,269
If not, never mind.

189
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,309
Is that so?

190
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,679
Then let's meet.

191
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,179
Right. Who cares?

192
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:52,919
All that I need
are those ground cherries.

193
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,049
It doesn't matter whether I side
with the Imoogi or Yeon.

194
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:04,130
(I've rushed toward you.)

195
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,160
Ta-da.

196
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,000
What is this?

197
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,299
It's a new phone.

198
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,670
Someone ordered it for me...

199
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,609
because he knew
I'd be too busy to get one.

200
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,039
"Ordered"?

201
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:17,880
You can get phones delivered too?

202
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,940
Once you order one,
you can receive it in an hour.

203
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,750
- How fascinating.
- All right.

204
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,579
You can call me by pressing this.

205
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,549
(My Lovely Daughter, My Lovely Mom)

206
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,289
Don't pick up any calls
unless they're from me.

207
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,059
Don't open the door
for anyone either.

208
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,759
Don't you worry and get going.

209
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,140
It'll take a while for us
to adjust to 2020,

210
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,170
but we're not kids.

211
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,009
Please lean on me.
You're more than welcome to.

212
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,079
Ji A.

213
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,710
Let's have dinner with that guy.

214
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,019
Who?

215
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,619
Lee Yeon?

216
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:02,220
"Fate"? "Communicating"?

217
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,720
He said that to you in your dream?

218
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,390
I don't think
I should take it lightly.

219
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:13,759
My face was covered
in hideous scales.

220
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:18,000
If something inside me
is summoning him,

221
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,640
what should I do?

222
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:23,740
Why me?

223
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:26,980
I'll catch him at all costs.

224
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
You trust me, right?

225
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,019
I do.

226
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,059
Right.

227
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:44,029
Do you have time tonight?

228
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,160
Tonight?

229
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,569
My parents want to meet...

230
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,200
my boyfriend.

231
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,869
That's me.

232
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,970
Yes.

233
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,750
Can you check this cat?

234
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,319
I was just about to leave.

235
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:12,220
- Is it hurt?
- It's a stray cat,

236
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,559
and I think it was caught in a trap.

237
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,160
I'll pay all the expenses,
so can you please check?

238
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,359
People like you are
hard to find lately.

239
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,099
Let me see it.

240
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,329
Here.

241
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,009
Gosh, did it hurt?

242
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,109
It's okay.

243
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,680
Luckily, the wound isn't too deep.

244
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,480
Really?

245
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,589
Poor thing, who did this to you?

246
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,700
What?

247
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,700
Who? Who did it?

248
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,710
Why? Did the cat talk to you?

249
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,680
Where did you say you found it?

250
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,279
The trail near this place.

251
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,720
It's Imoogi.

252
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:24,029
This is...

253
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,299
Imoogi.

254
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:31,069
It's rib patties with lotus leaves.

255
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,940
It's on the house,
since today's a special day.

256
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:34,809
Thank you.

257
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,809
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

258
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:40,809
Let's eat.

259
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:42,710
So what's this about
a part-time job?

260
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:45,950
Tell us how much
we'll be paid first.

261
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,920
We're professionals, you know.

262
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,990
I'll add another zero
to the current minimum wage.

263
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,220
85.9 dollars?

264
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,190
Where shall we start?

265
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,289
It's something...

266
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,529
people who work at the
broadcasting station are best at.

267
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,230
Digging into someone's background.

268
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:02,630
Who?

269
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,940
Imoogi.

270
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,809
It doesn't matter if it's
a folktale, legend, fairy tale,

271
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,109
or even a comic.

272
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,839
Bring me every single story
you can find on Imoogi.

273
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:17,309
- May I ask why?
- His weakness.

274
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,319
I'm going to find his weakness.

275
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:29,690
Your hand is trembling.

276
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:36,900
Is that okay for a vet?

277
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,170
I'm sorry. Give me a second.

278
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,019
If you touch that, you will die.

279
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,529
You know who I am, right?

280
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,440
Gu Sin Ju.
Lee Yeon's right-hand man.

281
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,710
You have the ability
to communicate with animals.

282
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,309
What do you want?

283
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,650
I'm playing a tail-chasing game
with Lee Yeon right now.

284
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,410
"A tail-chasing game"?

285
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,119
That being said...

286
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,920
Will you be a useful hostage?

287
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,119
Just kill me instead.

288
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,990
I'd rather die...

289
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,259
than become Mr. Lee's weakness.

290
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,569
I see what type you are.

291
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,910
I'm not afraid. Kill me.

292
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,480
I'll give you a hint.

293
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,750
One day,

294
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:00,680
when the Imoogi inside her
calls for you,

295
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:02,619
you will...

296
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,140
Imoogi killed us
in our previous lives?

297
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,309
And that Imoogi is our intern?

298
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,549
This is just wrong.

299
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,509
Why are all the handsome guys
around me...

300
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,279
either a nine-tailed fox
or Imoogi?

301
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,279
Sorry about that.

302
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,089
Well, then. Have a good time.

303
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,259
- Where are you going?
- I'm submitting the edited video...

304
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:40,420
and going home.

305
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,259
I'm going grocery shopping
with my dad.

306
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,660
Do you need a ride?

307
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,900
It's okay. I'll see you later
at home. Come dressed up.

308
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:55,240
- Then we better get going...
- Sit.

309
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,869
Sit down.

310
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:06,779
I have something more important
to say.

311
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,890
I need some know-how...

312
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,890
on how to flatter Ji A's parents.

313
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,369
There. Mom, put it over there.

314
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,240
That's the perfect spot.
It's so pretty.

315
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:29,069
- Thank you.
- It's almost ready.

316
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:30,269
- Open your mouth.
- Is it good?

317
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,250
Do you like it?

318
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,920
I think you're just pretending
not to like it.

319
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,250
How about if I unbutton it more?

320
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,089
My goodness, get back in there.

321
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:54,099
- Does it look okay? This?
- It's this.

322
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,000
So this is what humans like.
Thanks, part-timers.

323
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,950
You're here.

324
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,180
- Hello.
- You saw him yesterday, right?

325
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,490
I'd like to introduce myself.
My name is Lee Yeon.

326
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,460
It's nice to meet you. We just
wanted to have a meal with you.

327
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:22,390
- Well, let's go inside.
- Wait.

328
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,960
Don't forget what we told you.

329
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,529
"Thank you for inviting me.
This is a token of my gratitude."

330
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,670
Go with red ginseng,
a bellflower snack,

331
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,670
or herbal cosmetics at least.

332
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,599
Do you mean I have
to show off my wealth?

333
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,970
Thank you very much for inviting me.

334
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:39,380
This is a small token
of my gratitude.

335
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,579
A lighter? But I don't smoke.

336
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,750
It's one of my favorite models
that I myself drive.

337
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,259
I hope you enjoy it.

338
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,430
He's quite generous.

339
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,799
Let's go in.

340
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,299
Please come inside.

341
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,700
- Okay.
- Go in.

342
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,309
It's been such a long time
since I cooked with Ji A.

343
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:14,579
I'm not sure if it'll fit
your taste.

344
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,809
To be honest, it's not my taste.

345
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,650
The bulgogi is a bit salty.

346
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,890
It's really delicious.
Everything is delicious.

347
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,519
You're quite an honest lad.

348
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:28,589
Don't drag your response
when they ask you something.

349
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,990
- Just be honest.
- Be honest.

350
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,559
How old are you?

351
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,930
Oh, you'll be surprised
if you hear my age.

352
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,670
How old?

353
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:39,269
Well, contrary to my looks,
I'm much older than...

354
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,440
He became 36 this year.

355
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,180
He lived abroad for a long time.
Right?

356
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,309
Did you study abroad?

357
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,309
We met while studying abroad too.

358
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,619
Did you graduate
from a foreign university?

359
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:53,779
I didn't go to university.

360
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,490
Well, I'm not saying
that's necessary.

361
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,789
I didn't go to high school either.

362
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,420
I never went to school, period.

363
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,259
Then what do you do?

364
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
Nothing much.

365
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:11,599
I guess you're a very liberal type.

366
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,170
I have a lot of money though.
I bought you a car.

367
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:21,579
Stop it.

368
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,519
I thought you told him
you wanted to break up.

369
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,390
- Yes.
- But you met him again?

370
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,759
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

371
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,430
Did you really break up with him?

372
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,730
This is so annoying.

373
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:41,599
- You should block his number.
- Right, but...

374
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:43,799
May I take your order?

375
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:48,170
Before that, it's too loud in here.

376
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,170
Sorry?

377
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:54,079
I'm so sleepy.

378
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,480
I want to go to sleep.

379
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,789
You're the Snail Bride, right?

380
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,900
- Why are you here?
- To eat.

381
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:14,329
Take my order.

382
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,299
Well... What will you have?

383
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,539
What does Lee Yeon usually eat here?

384
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:24,470
I'll have the same.
Something Lee Yeon likes.

385
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,680
You're a college professor...

386
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,549
and you're a doctor, right?

387
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:37,720
Ji A is a producer who graduated
from a prestigious university.

388
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,359
It feels like I don't have anything
to brag about.

389
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,859
But still, I like her a lot.

390
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,730
What do you like about Ji A?

391
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,680
I went through a lot in my life,

392
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:01,440
much more than
what you might assume.

393
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,650
Those days were very difficult.

394
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,279
But strangely,

395
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,890
a meal beside Ji A...

396
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,420
makes me delude myself
as if I became a part of a family.

397
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:17,990
It just greatly comforts me.

398
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,200
Same with me.

399
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:27,339
I struggled to live alone
in this house without you,

400
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:29,670
then I realized it
after meeting Yeon.

401
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,109
A person has to live
in the shadow of someone...

402
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,450
you can rely on.

403
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:38,279
I want to become such a person too.

404
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,390
You grew up well. Both of you.

405
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:51,559
It may be a little salty,
but please enjoy it.

406
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,559
Thank you for the food.

407
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:03,009
You're good at cooking.

408
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,539
Why are you targeting Mr. Lee?

409
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:10,079
He lived in solitude
for countless years.

410
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,119
He's finally about to become happy.
Why?

411
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,420
There are different variations
of the Snail Bride fable.

412
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:22,759
But...

413
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,000
it doesn't change the fact
that the ending is tragic.

414
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,960
That's how it is for me and Yeon.

415
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,440
This story will only end
if one of us dies.

416
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,509
Listen carefully.

417
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:39,579
You...

418
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:52,720
Look at this. Isn't she cute?

419
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,130
- This is when she was 100 days old.
- How adorable.

420
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,289
How can her hands and feet
be so small?

421
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,759
She was small,
but she definitely had an attitude.

422
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,930
- Who does she take after?
- Not me.

423
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,799
What? Usually,
the one who feels guilty is guilty.

424
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,809
She takes after her personality,
but she got her looks from me.

425
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:11,069
Hey, what was that?

426
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:14,640
How can you show him my pictures
without my permission?

427
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,609
You looked good throughout.

428
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,750
Of course.

429
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,880
Oh, my goodness.

430
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:22,619
- Here it is.
- What?

431
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:25,589
What is this? Not this, Dad.

432
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:27,319
Why not? You look cute.

433
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,730
- You were pretty.
- Just look at the nice ones.

434
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,740
Darn it.

435
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,410
I want to kill him.

436
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,029
Are you back?

437
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,170
You always drink americano.
Why did you get a latte?

438
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,549
To remember today.
It will never come again.

439
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,559
I've had a bitter life,

440
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,359
but sometimes it gets smooth
like this latte.

441
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,829
Were you that happy?

442
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:19,599
While looking at your family album,
I imagined for a moment.

443
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,109
About getting married one day...

444
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,109
and having a child
that looks like us.

445
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,150
We'd go to Han River and eat
the gimbap I made.

446
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,250
We'd get into a fight
while eating it.

447
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:33,549
Although, I'd lose if we ever fight.

448
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:36,849
In reality I don't age,

449
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,019
but in my imagination
I had grey hair...

450
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,829
and you were still beside me.

451
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,970
If I was a human...

452
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,849
It would've been so nice
if I was an ordinary person.

453
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,269
Does your life taste bitter again?

454
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:27,739
- Should I make it sweet for you?
- Yes.

455
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,519
- What is this?
- Ta-da.

456
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,289
Matching rings?

457
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,789
I really wanted to have one.

458
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:47,360
- Really?
- I was going to buy you one.

459
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,030
I already received enough from you.

460
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,989
All I did was receive from you.

461
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,630
Do you like it?

462
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,179
You...

463
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,920
Why would you...

464
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,519
No. I didn't do it.

465
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,920
I didn't do this.

466
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,739
What happened?

467
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,139
I did it.

468
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,809
I... I stabbed Mr. Lee
with my hands.

469
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,880
- I must be crazy.
- Why would you do that?

470
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:54,579
I don't know either.

471
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,619
Why did I do that?

472
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,289
I really don't know why.

473
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:02,389
Yu Ri.
Calm down and think carefully.

474
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,900
I received Mr. Lee's call
and was on my way here.

475
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,400
I bumped into a man
in front of the house.

476
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,039
That man said...

477
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,809
"I want to kill him" or something.

478
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,409
I can't remember after that.

479
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,309
- What kind of man?
- Imoogi.

480
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,820
The man you saw...

481
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:32,889
must have been Imoogi.

482
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,360
He hypnotized you
and controlled your thoughts.

483
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,369
It wasn't a coincidence.

484
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,309
He was looking for you.

485
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,239
Why would he?

486
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,280
He wanted...

487
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,550
to warn me...

488
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:04,289
that if I gained something,
I'd have to lose something as well.

489
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:07,059
He knew Rang was cautious
of everyone,

490
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,059
so he used the one person
he trusted.

491
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,130
That's why...

492
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,769
Rang was blindly attacked
by someone so young and weak.

493
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:18,869
What a coward. I ought to kill him.

494
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,670
You're of no match for him.

495
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,320
So what'll happen to him?

496
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:36,820
He'll survive, right?

497
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:39,019
I've stopped his bleeding,
but he has shallow breathing.

498
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,059
I can barely get a pulse.

499
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,329
So?

500
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:48,630
He's too weak right now.
We have no choice but to wait.

501
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,369
Just do something, will you?

502
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,110
What about the ground cherries?

503
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,869
We have them.

504
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,210
I've agreed to hand them over
to Granny.

505
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:03,949
We can use a few beforehand.

506
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,849
People's souls
are in those ground cherries.

507
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,219
You want to kill others
to save Rang?

508
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,659
What's so bad about that?

509
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
I'll do it. I can do it.

510
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:18,659
Mr. Lee.

511
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:21,929
His life is on the line.

512
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,969
You are not allowed to kill humans.

513
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,909
However,

514
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,010
he won't wake up unless you do so.

515
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:39,650
What kind of choice will you make
this time, Yeon?

516
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,190
Where are they?
Where are the ground cherries?

517
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:53,599
At my house.

518
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:55,659
Is that so? Let's go.

519
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,139
You can't.

520
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,469
What?

521
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,809
One thing kept bugging me.

522
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,409
"Why were Ji A's parents..."

523
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,980
"the only ones
who could become human again?"

524
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,849
It's as if he wanted me
to use the ground cherries.

525
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,420
Is he testing you?

526
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:21,719
I'm forbidden to kill humans.

527
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,090
If I do, I'll be taken
to the Underworld.

528
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:26,630
It could be days or weeks.

529
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,500
I won't be able to protect Ji A.

530
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,130
He wants me...

531
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,639
to be away from her.

532
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,110
We won't use the ground cherries.

533
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,309
I'm going to catch the Imoogi first.

534
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:54,119
And I'll save my brother
in my own way.

535
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,789
Give them to me!

536
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,199
- Yu Ri!
- Give them to me right now!

537
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,260
No!

538
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,369
What is this?

539
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,880
Hello, Mr. Fox.

540
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,550
Should I become your friend for you?

541
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,949
- No.
- Why not?

542
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,619
Your nose. I'm not interested in men
with runny noses.

543
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:24,690
Runny nose?

544
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,760
Why are you here?

545
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,929
Do you also think
that I'm a pushover?

546
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,070
Not at all. A pushover? Never.

547
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,139
Then why...

548
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,309
did you give me flowers
and buy me drinks?

549
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:46,710
I'm a widow
who runs her own restaurant.

550
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,980
Giving me flowers
or buying me drinks...

551
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,809
pretty much means that you want
to get in my pants.

552
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:52,949
That's a sad thing to say.

553
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,519
To me, flowers and drinks...

554
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,219
are such radiant...

555
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:01,090
and wonderful words.

556
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,760
Thanks to them,
I'm able to sit here with you.

557
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,659
What?

558
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,300
Why me?

559
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:14,099
You're a decent man with a good job.

560
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,769
To me,
it has to be you no matter what.

561
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:20,409
In my eyes, you're not a widow
who runs a restaurant.

562
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:23,610
You're anything but ordinary.

563
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,250
I have a question.

564
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,590
What are you hiding...

565
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,460
behind those majestic eyes?

566
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,829
Yu Ri, you should get some rest.

567
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:49,409
Can you persuade him
to give you some ground cherries?

568
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,269
He'll listen to you.

569
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:54,139
Let's trust him and be patient.

570
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:56,550
I'm sure he'll find a way.

571
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:57,849
He's a scumbag.

572
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,920
He's heartless.

573
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:02,119
This is all because of Yeon.

574
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:05,590
To be frank, it isn't.

575
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:08,190
He had warned Mr. Lee
several times that he'd suffer...

576
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,590
if he joined hands with Imoogi.

577
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,460
Whose side are you on?

578
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,730
Mr. Lee.

579
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,539
Mr. Lee...

580
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:25,739
Mr. Lee...

581
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:27,280
Yu Ri.

582
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,050
Yu Ri...

583
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,349
Is he sick?

584
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,150
Get out.

585
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,659
Soo Ho, come with me.

586
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,860
Is he a nine-tailed fox too?

587
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:46,900
Who said that?

588
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,260
He's the younger brother
of that man from before.

589
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,170
That other man is a nine-tailed fox.

590
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:01,510
His life is on the line.

591
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,320
We can use a few beforehand.

592
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:11,989
Give them to me!

593
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:14,559
- Give them to me right now!
- Yu Ri!

594
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:48,389
Which one's the disinfectant?

595
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:52,230
It's this one.

596
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:55,429
Don't act so arrogant.

597
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,599
That's not how you do it.

598
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:04,369
How would you know?

599
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,260
What are you?

600
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,070
Whenever my stepdad hit my mom,
she'd get hurt.

601
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:33,469
I used to treat her every day.

602
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,809
Really? Then keep treating him.

603
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:39,210
If something happens to him,
you're dead meat.

604
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,409
Where are you going?

605
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,059
Mr. Lee, I'll save you.

606
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:46,309
No!

607
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:16,639
Mr. Lee!

608
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:19,170
Mr. Lee!

609
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,019
Please forgive Yu Ri.
I should've stopped her.

610
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:34,619
She stole them,
but they all withered away?

611
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:37,090
- That's right.
- And Rang?

612
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,829
He's still the same.

613
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,469
Keep an eye on Yu Ri.

614
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:45,570
She might do something rash.

615
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,840
I'm sorry.

616
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,739
Shall I take the remaining
ground cherries to the Styx?

617
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,639
- No.
- Then?

618
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:54,440
Not yet.

619
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,349
I'm playing a tail-chasing game
with him right now.

620
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,429
It looks like you've been
on the run for a decade.

621
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,039
I don't know how I can avoid him.

622
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:22,400
I'm already as good as dead.

623
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:25,269
You deserve it.
I would've done the same.

624
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,780
If my right-hand man messed up
and ran away.

625
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,150
Please help me.
I'll do anything you want.

626
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,650
Please give me a ground cherry.

627
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:35,079
My ground cherries!

628
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,650
Not so fast.

629
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,760
- Tell me what you want.
- Help me catch Imoogi.

630
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,030
Based on the information you have,

631
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,289
I might give you
more ground cherries.

632
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,889
I'll tell you everything.

633
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,869
But how can I trust you?

634
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,199
When I watched you all day
disguised as Lee Rang,

635
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,500
your whole life was based on lies.

636
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,269
I know you can't trust me.

637
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,809
I would be the same.

638
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:04,510
But it's not something
I wanted to do.

639
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:06,349
Isn't that an excuse?

640
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,380
I wanted to live.

641
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:12,349
I just wanted to live.

642
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,360
Although I'm barely clinging onto
my life, I'm still human.

643
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:19,460
I used to be a normal person.

644
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:23,070
He killed my family.

645
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:25,599
I want to get revenge if I can.

646
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:28,369
Please give me a chance.

647
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,110
I want to live a new life.

648
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,949
Okay, fine.

649
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,179
Stop crying now.

650
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,829
If you cry like that
with a gun on you,

651
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,829
do you think it'll seem sincere
or not?

652
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:58,630
You even rubbed an evening primrose
from the grave on it.

653
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,239
How did you know?

654
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,710
People don't change easily.

655
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:06,010
You're smarter than I thought.

656
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,440
But do you think you can kill me
with this?

657
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,780
It's not loaded.

658
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,150
I just wanted to check...

659
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:19,219
if the almighty
ex-mountain spirit...

660
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,659
would be dumb enough
to be fooled by my tears.

661
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,559
I can't put my life
in a dummy's hands.

662
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:28,099
Now we're talking.

663
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,699
The records of Imoogi begin from...

664
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:34,099
the famous legend by Kim Yong Seok
of Jeju Island.

665
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,800
And they all have similar patterns.

666
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,710
They were all written
in different areas and times,

667
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:40,840
but they all end in a creepy way.

668
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:44,980
I know. When a beautiful woman
is offered as a sacrifice,

669
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:48,449
a warrior appears out of nowhere
and kills the Imoogi.

670
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:51,719
But the stories never end happily.

671
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,059
Even in Kim Yong Seok's story,

672
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,320
the protagonist kills
Imoogi with a sword,

673
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:59,059
but it says he was killed
by the dead Imoogi.

674
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:03,099
He killed Imoogi, but it didn't die?

675
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:04,670
Maybe it's not one person.

676
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,139
It might've been two Imoogis
from the start.

677
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,659
You're going to attack the Imoogi
directly?

678
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,929
What do you think?

679
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:39,000
If I like your answer,

680
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:41,599
I'll give you all of them.

681
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,010
This is something only I know.

682
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,210
That female shaman from the island
told me that he doesn't die.

683
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:51,380
He merely falls asleep.

684
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,010
I know that too.

685
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,349
What's important is how we get him
to fall asleep.

686
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:56,789
It's the same as waking him up.

687
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:59,150
Don't you remember?
That well he was born in.

688
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,090
Can you clarify?

689
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,590
You want me to throw him back
into the well or what?

690
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,530
It doesn't matter
as long as there is water.

691
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:08,000
What's important
are the ingredients.

692
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,559
"Ingredients"?

693
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,670
The body of a living human
and the blood of an offering.

694
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:18,139
And the power of a being
as strong as the deity.

695
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,849
My power? As a mountain spirit?

696
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,849
You were the last ingredient
that woke him up.

697
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,699
There are many records
of Imoogi's battles,

698
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,030
but I can't find any
particular weapons used against him.

699
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:46,500
- I found something.
- What is it?

700
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,269
Look. This is the folktale
about a serpent.

701
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:54,280
The protagonist fought Imoogi
inside a swamp,

702
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,039
and he covered his body
with horse blood.

703
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,449
It seems like Imoogi hates
horse blood.

704
00:52:58,449 --> 00:53:00,780
Great, let's send him this.

705
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,159
Ms. Kim, shall I add
an emoticon or not?

706
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:11,760
Ms. Kim?

707
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,170
(Imoogi hates horse blood...)

708
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:29,280
Well, it's nothing much.

709
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:32,610
We just need those three ingredients
and water.

710
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,280
But the problem is,
he won't just stand there...

711
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,289
and let you make him fall asleep.

712
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:42,719
(New Message)

713
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,159
(Imoogi hates horse blood,
and this can be used...)

714
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:45,630
("An Intensive Study on the
Traditional Korean Monster, Imoogi")

715
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,900
("An Intensive Study on the
Traditional Korean Monster, Imoogi")

716
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:52,869
I'll make him fall asleep.

717
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,699
So, I was thinking...

718
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:57,670
What? What do you want?

719
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,579
I need the body of a living human.

720
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,159
Yes, sir.

721
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:17,530
You want us to come take
the ground cherry pot?

722
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,829
Okay, leave that up to me.

723
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,969
What? Really?

724
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,909
Okay, sure. Watch yourself. Okay.

725
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,110
What did he say?

726
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,980
He said he can catch Imoogi.

727
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:38,409
I think he found out something...

728
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,219
by luring his minion
with the ground cherries.

729
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,750
I'll go get the ground cherries.

730
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:43,920
No.

731
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:49,860
No? Then shall we give him
the ground cherries?

732
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,989
No. I mean Yeon.

733
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,530
Yeon cannot catch Imoogi.

734
00:54:58,269 --> 00:54:59,630
What do you mean?

735
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:02,400
Because it's Lee Yeon.

736
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:07,639
The Lee Yeon we know
will never be able to do it.

737
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:19,250
Don't be afraid and think.
What do you fear the most?

738
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:20,960
The thing I fear the most...

739
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,489
is being abandoned.

740
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,460
Mom abandoned me...

741
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:32,869
and so did you.

742
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:51,920
I will never abandon you.

743
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,889
I promise I'll save you.

744
00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:08,300
I will catch...

745
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:10,710
Imoogi.

746
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,989
Jae Hwan! Sae Rom!

747
00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:36,000
- Can you hear me?
- It's useless.

748
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,869
I've put them in a trance.

749
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,530
Don't touch them.

750
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,840
I'll kill you.

751
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,739
Do you want to go on a date?

752
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:44,139
Then maybe I'll let them live.

753
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:46,110
What?

754
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:48,079
Wear the outfit I sent you.

755
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:50,809
Hello? Hey!

756
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,920
Ji A, this was in front of
the door...

757
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,190
with your name on it.

758
00:57:50,809 --> 00:57:52,039
What do I do?

759
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,539
Sae Rom and Jae Hwan
are in trouble because of me.

760
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:56,909
Should we report it to the police?

761
00:57:57,809 --> 00:57:59,579
They'll be safe. I'll find them.

762
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:03,150
I asked Sin Ju to follow
their scents already.

763
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:05,250
You don't have to see him today.

764
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:08,519
No.

765
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,530
I'm going to go.

766
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,260
I'll meet him.

767
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,030
Let's catch him today.

768
00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:51,969
It suits you.

769
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,400
The dress, the necklace, everything.

770
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:56,469
When you write
your resume next time,

771
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,670
make sure you say your hobby is
dressing dolls instead of reading.

772
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,710
I love your face
when you talk like that.

773
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,079
Let's eat.

774
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,489
I missed you.

775
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,789
You shouldn't even touch a dog
when it's eating.

776
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:18,690
I hope you'll be
more friendly with me.

777
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:29,070
One word from my mouth
and they'll really be done for.

778
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:32,570
Why me?

779
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:34,539
Because I feel like...

780
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,250
you'd be able to find
what I really want.

781
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,119
What you really want?

782
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:42,780
Something only I don't have.

783
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:47,860
Perhaps, something I lost
the moment I was born.

784
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,199
A long time ago
during the Silla Dynasty,

785
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:59,530
a famous family gave birth
to their ninth son.

786
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,969
The baby didn't even make a peep,

787
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:05,340
but the mother cried sadly.

788
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:09,940
The limbs of the baby were like
a degenerated snake.

789
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,780
His eyes, ears,

790
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:16,619
and even his voice weren't normal.
He was a monster.

791
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,760
What happened to that child?

792
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,500
The father who was a nobleman...

793
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,829
tried to get rid
of the infant himself,

794
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,269
but the midwife stopped him...

795
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:35,639
saying he could get cursed.

796
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,739
Thanks to that, the child lived
locked up in a beautiful chest.

797
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:43,139
Aside from the midwife who fed him,
his parents nor his siblings...

798
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,550
looked for him.

799
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:49,820
A baby who doesn't cry
becomes forgotten.

800
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:53,250
You were a human.

801
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:59,460
You were a human, not a monster.

802
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,429
The child was thrown into a cave
full of people with plagues,

803
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,199
and...

804
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:08,900
he was eaten.

805
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,610
So this is horse blood?

806
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:20,949
Yes.

807
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:40,440
After some time, the cave turned
into a tomb for those with plagues,

808
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:44,010
and a white snake
crawled out from it.

809
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:48,380
People called it "Imoogi"
and found it unlucky.

810
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:50,650
It's just another story.

811
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:54,880
I know the answer.

812
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,489
I know what you really want.

813
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,090
You want to be loved by someone.

814
01:02:03,789 --> 01:02:04,889
Will you find it for me?

815
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,530
What if I decline?

816
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:07,860
I'll kill.

817
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,360
I'll kill Yeon,

818
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:13,230
then I'll kill the people
precious to you.

819
01:02:14,769 --> 01:02:16,000
After that, I'll kill you.

820
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,010
Then, a plague will go around
the world.

821
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:25,750
No one will dare to be happy.

822
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,340
("Searching for
Ghost Stories in the City")

823
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,449
The night air is nice, right?

824
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:43,559
Yes.

825
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:46,030
Are you waiting for someone?

826
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,360
- No.
- But...

827
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,969
I didn't get an answer from you yet.

828
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:54,800
Do you love me?

829
01:03:57,409 --> 01:03:59,840
I'm sorry, but I don't have
any love left.

830
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:03,110
Every single ounce of my love
was given...

831
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,179
to Yeon already.

832
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,010
Who is he to you?

833
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:12,849
Tell me.

834
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:21,760
How dare you touch her?
I'll cut off your wrist.

835
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,530
This is no place for you to butt in.

836
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:25,769
We're on a date.

837
01:04:25,769 --> 01:04:27,239
You should have a date with me now.

838
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,940
I don't like it
when promises are broken.

839
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,659
I want to fly.

840
01:05:03,469 --> 01:05:04,469
Found you!

841
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,309
It looks like they couldn't fly.

842
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,849
Imoogi befits water more than land.

843
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,130
This is horse blood.

844
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:32,400
I used some money
to find out your weakness.

845
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:45,079
This is my blood.
Our date ends here.

846
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:58,090
No, Yeon. It's not him.

847
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:14,980
What is this?

848
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:18,150
What went wrong?

849
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,079
You got the wrong tagger.

850
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:21,980
What?

851
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,849
The Imoogi you're looking for...

852
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,289
I'm not the main one.

853
01:06:28,289 --> 01:06:29,320
Then...

854
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:38,800
I'm burning.

855
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:43,670
- What's wrong?
- My body is burning.

856
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:46,070
Does it hurt?

857
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,710
It's blazing hot.

858
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,679
It's all right.
You'll be okay soon. Please.

859
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,809
Does it not hurt anymore?

860
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:21,840
Look at me.

861
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,519
It's been a long time, Yeon.

862
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,230
She's mine.

863
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,739
Get out of there!

864
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:33,710
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

865
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:36,819
I may not be myself...

866
01:08:37,789 --> 01:08:39,189
for much longer.

867
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:42,760
Take me and save Mr. Lee.

868
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:47,289
I'm about to end
this never-ending fight.

869
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:50,229
This dagger pierces one's sins.
It'll pierce the Imoogi's soul.

870
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,270
You must get out
of this fight alive.

871
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:54,939
- No.
- Move.

872
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,699
You altered the register?

873
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:59,840
No one can take Ji A.

874
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:01,310
Come at me.
