- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

11
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,219
- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,689
- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

13
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,099
Please don't die.

14
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,340
Don't die...

15
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,799
because of me.

16
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,740
I found you.

17
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,650
I...

18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,629
I was waiting for you as well.

19
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,060
(Episode 5:
I Was Waiting For You As Well)

20
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,009
I know I'm the cause of all this.

21
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,280
But I didn't think I should take you
to a hospital.

22
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,080
Since my mom was a doctor,
I learned how to give first aid.

23
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,490
Open your mouth.

24
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:42,789
What?

25
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,259
Your mouth.

26
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,300
It's a candy.

27
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,210
Every time I got injections
at the hospital when I was young,

28
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,979
my mom would always give me
strawberry candies.

29
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,610
After that,
I wasn't afraid of hospitals.

30
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,580
Every time I thought of them,
I could smell strawberries.

31
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,530
Keep going.

32
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,029
Right. When I was nine,

33
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,829
I was admitted
to a children's psychiatric center.

34
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,370
Because after my parents
went missing,

35
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,639
I had testified that the culprit
wasn't a human being.

36
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,850
I wanted to get discharged,

37
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,649
but the doctor in charge
wouldn't let me.

38
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,720
I wouldn't have either
if it were me.

39
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,949
I consistently kept an eye on him.

40
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,120
I saw him steal some propofol.

41
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,689
So?

42
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,189
I negotiated with him.

43
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,060
"Should I scream
and gather attention?"

44
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,560
"Or will you let me get discharged?"

45
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,199
I can't forget the day
I left there...

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,370
in my uncle's car.

47
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,170
Mom.

48
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,040
Dad.

49
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,490
I returned home
after three months.

50
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,899
I didn't want to be alone,

51
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,769
so I was sitting outside the gate.

52
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,100
It felt like those two fireflies...

53
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,209
were my parents.

54
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,279
I...

55
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,250
I was waiting for you as well.

56
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,740
(Abstract algebra)

57
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,049
Mr. Lee!

58
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,460
Mr. Lee!

59
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,360
You've become a mess.

60
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,799
You're impossible!

61
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,799
- Be quiet.
- Okay.

62
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:25,200
But why?

63
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,269
The vet.

64
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,269
Dr. Gu Sin Ju?

65
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,480
Ms. Nam?

66
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,409
Do you know each other?

67
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:38,549
Don't tell me...

68
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,820
The fact
that you're together means...

69
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,720
Mr. Lee.

70
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,690
You've done it.

71
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,029
You've been waiting like a fool
for the past 600 years. Finally...

72
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,129
What did you say?

73
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,700
Goodness.

74
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,570
I'm so emotional right now
that I'm blabbering.

75
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,169
I can finally die with no regrets.

76
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:05,179
- Are you crying?
- Why am I getting teary-eyed?

77
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,740
Excuse me.

78
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,450
Let me formally introduce myself.

79
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:20,990
I was his loyal right hand
ever since he ruled Baekdudaegan.

80
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,460
I'm also his doctor, bodyguard,

81
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,129
and housekeeper.

82
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,200
Mr. Lee here doesn't even know
how to wash his own underwear.

83
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,929
But he's managing to live
like a decent human being...

84
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,269
thanks to me.

85
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,370
Shut your mouth.

86
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,679
No wonder you knew everything
about animals.

87
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,539
You were a fox in disguise?

88
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,580
Don't check me out like that.

89
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,679
There's really no one I can trust.

90
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,450
I've interviewed you numerous times.

91
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,019
He thinks he's a star now.

92
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,990
He practices writing his autograph
and takes selfies.

93
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,759
This was all bound to happen.

94
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,000
Darn it.

95
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,700
I'll take this one.

96
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,740
The bezel is made of red gold,

97
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,370
so it's on the pricey end.
It's 35,000 dollars.

98
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:07,740
Will you give me a discount?

99
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,570
- Sorry?
- That was a joke.

100
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,610
Was that not funny?

101
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,110
I've never seen you
joke around before.

102
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,179
How do I look in your eyes?

103
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,549
You're all men's wannabe...

104
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,320
from head to toe.

105
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,419
All I see is a wreck.

106
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,990
I hate getting up every morning.

107
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:31,899
No matter what I buy or eat,
I feel no emotions.

108
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,230
I think I've lived for too long.

109
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,840
How much is that?

110
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,970
It's a cheap one.

111
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,740
Why would you wear
something like that?

112
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,580
It belonged to my late father.

113
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,679
Then it must be precious to you.

114
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,590
Yes. It's the most precious thing
in the world to me.

115
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,519
Let me see it.

116
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,960
Aren't the letters so cute?

117
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:10,070
My dad didn't know how to write,
so I taught him.

118
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,870
Give me this.

119
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:15,470
- Sorry?
- I'll give you mine instead.

120
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:19,480
You're joking, right?

121
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,549
No. I'm curious about
what you'll choose.

122
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,379
Is it family?

123
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,490
Or...

124
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,110
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

125
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,080
Okay, okay.

126
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,779
Have some chicken soup.

127
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,049
I'll blow it for you
so it's not too hot.

128
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,730
Hey, I'm not some kid. Get lost.

129
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,870
You patched up his wound very well.

130
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,840
Oh, yes. Does he need anything else?

131
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,169
He recovers faster than
ordinary human beings.

132
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,269
Still, he should rest
for at least a month.

133
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,580
Please take good care of him.

134
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,009
I think it would be better
if you take care of...

135
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:32,720
"Power of love". There's no medicine
that can top that.

136
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,789
- What?
- I know Mr. Lee...

137
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,519
is cranky, awkward, and mean,

138
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,720
he's one of the most romantic guys
in the world.

139
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,559
He also owns 30 million dollars
worth of real estate.

140
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,460
He's handsome and has no
chronic illnesses.

141
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,769
His life expectancy is
disgustingly long as well.

142
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,070
You should go now. Go.

143
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,740
I will. See you.

144
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:55,809
But...

145
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:58,909
One more thing.

146
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:01,409
Give him his ice cream
after he finishes his soup.

147
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,250
No matter how much he whines.

148
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,850
Also, he loves it when you give him
three rubber ducks for his bath.

149
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,590
- Hey, I told you to go.
- Oh, I will.

150
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:11,889
Goodbye!

151
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,309
What are you doing?

152
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,740
That was...

153
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,779
someone's most precious belonging
until a while ago.

154
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,509
He doesn't have anything
like that anymore.

155
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,750
Just like me.

156
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,269
Why? What?

157
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,840
Give me a bite.

158
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,049
What are you thinking about?

159
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:51,820
It's just...

160
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:55,789
Life can become so sweet
with some ice cream.

161
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,889
That's what I'm thinking.

162
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,470
You know, about your first love.

163
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,909
What kind of person was she?

164
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,340
Don't say something like
she was like a lotus flower.

165
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:14,980
Her name meant a "high sound".

166
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,379
Ah Eum.

167
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,649
That was her name.

168
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,750
Almost everyone had
tacky names back then.

169
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,720
That sophisticated name tells me
she came from a rich family.

170
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,029
How did you meet her?

171
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,759
I will never forget that day.

172
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,100
She treated me like a dog.

173
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,269
Do you want to die?

174
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,309
How strange. Our shaggy dog loves it
whenever I pet him like this.

175
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,850
How dare you?
Do you know who I am?

176
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,450
You are a fox, aren't you?
I'm Ah Eum.

177
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,019
Don't come back here ever again.

178
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,860
- Why?
- This land belongs to the deities.

179
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,289
Why?

180
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,529
Are you stupid?

181
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,930
Why?

182
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,359
I heard a nine-tailed fox can make
the skies tremble.

183
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,759
You're really powerful.

184
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,759
If you know that, get lost.

185
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:41,369
If you don't want to be eaten
by tigers.

186
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,839
You work for me now.

187
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:48,539
- What?
- I'll let you eat rice every day.

188
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:49,940
And give you silk clothing.

189
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,910
I'll let you live happily.
How about it?

190
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,240
How cute.

191
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,710
She was excessively cute,

192
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,319
so I gave her a noogie
and sent her home.

193
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,849
- What did she do?
- She went crying...

194
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,690
and came back holding a bow.

195
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,720
That little kid was feisty.

196
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,119
Who won?

197
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:08,890
I let her win.

198
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,160
Since I was very tolerant back then.

199
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,900
Of course, I still am.

200
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:15,369
Very tolerant.

201
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,269
If you miss again,
I'm going to eat you.

202
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,119
Why can't you do this easy thing?

203
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,420
How many times did I tell you...

204
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,519
that shooting an arrow
is like riding the wind?

205
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,619
How many times did I tell you
that I'm the master of that wind?

206
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,589
- Let's try again.
- You have no talent at all.

207
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,259
Human, go home and
learn embroidery or fly a kite.

208
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,670
How dare you order me around?

209
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:52,069
You better not test my patience.

210
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,140
This is unbelievable.
Who are you to say that?

211
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,539
Throw it.

212
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,619
I actually missed on purpose.

213
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,819
In case you got hurt.

214
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,230
Who are you to worry about me?

215
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,029
I like you.

216
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,339
You little kid, do you want to be
hit by lightning?

217
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,490
It's about time you tell me.

218
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,859
Why I use this bow?

219
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,460
Don't say something like
because it looks cool.

220
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:54,769
I will kill my father.

221
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,970
What? Your father?

222
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,670
Why? Who is your father?

223
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,339
The king of this nation.

224
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,799
Shoot it.

225
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:27,970
As long as I'm with you,
the wind is yours.

226
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,970
What a fabulous love story.

227
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:39,680
It turned out she was
the king's seventh daughter.

228
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:41,849
Although she was
an abandoned princess.

229
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,819
But why would she want to kill
her father?

230
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,690
He was a king, but not a king.

231
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,390
What?

232
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,130
The palace was filled
with screams every night,

233
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,700
and it was an era of
endless droughts and suffering.

234
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,000
A wicked thing had entered
the palace to act like the king.

235
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,099
"A wicked thing"?

236
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,839
People used to call it a "Toryong".

237
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,680
Toryong?

238
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:14,539
A dragon buried in the earth?

239
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,250
Are you talking about Imoogi?

240
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:21,279
My goodness, you look more handsome
in person.

241
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,549
You look dashing.

242
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,220
Thank you.

243
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,019
I want to thank you more.

244
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:29,460
You sent a huge advance payment
in cash.

245
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,099
- Does anyone know you're here?
- Of course it's a secret.

246
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,500
But whose blood flows in that kid?

247
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,299
What's so clandestine...

248
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:42,009
Well, who cares about the blood?

249
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,539
All kids are like angels.

250
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:47,839
The child's room is the last door
at the end of the second floor.

251
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:49,710
I see.

252
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,220
What should I get started with?

253
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,549
I don't need you
to do anything else.

254
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,289
Just feed the child.

255
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:59,859
All right. Okay.

256
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,349
Child.

257
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:36,759
Come out to eat.

258
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,170
Do you have bad hearing?

259
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,549
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

260
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,019
Your hand too.

261
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,720
This isn't contagious, is it?

262
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:07,390
I don't know.

263
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,430
Do you want to guess?

264
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,269
Why did you stop
telling the story midway?

265
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,140
My flashbacks usually stop there.

266
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,539
I said, how did she die?

267
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,779
Your obsession
will call for trouble.

268
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,750
To you and to the child
who was born again.

269
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,079
It has nothing to do with you.

270
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:14,190
Yes, it does. I know it does.

271
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,789
At times,

272
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,130
knowledge could harm you.

273
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,369
You should continue to live on
not knowing anything.

274
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:30,940
I don't intend on living as
someone's past I don't know about.

275
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,619
Don't take it off.

276
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,920
I got enough rest.

277
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,230
Let's go out. Anywhere.

278
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,569
This is an eyesore, right?

279
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:06,809
I like it.

280
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,579
It suits you.

281
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,009
I don't like it.

282
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,980
It's like I'm announcing
to the world that I was at a zoo.

283
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,190
- Who says?
- That vet.

284
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,960
He doesn't throw himself at me
like other males.

285
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,990
He looks at me
with such sad and pitiful eyes.

286
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,700
Then make him stop looking at you
with those eyes.

287
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,059
How?

288
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,369
He can't see you
if he doesn't have any eyes.

289
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,240
Stop the car.

290
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,079
Hey, let's make the bet 10 dollars
instead of 5 dollars.

291
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,509
- I'm in.
- I'm going to throw now.

292
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,049
Here I go.

293
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,849
- Okay.
- Did you see that?

294
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,789
- Okay!
- I'm the ace.

295
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,460
The dog didn't die yet.

296
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,789
Hey, step back.

297
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,000
I won't step on the line.

298
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,000
Are you having fun?

299
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,569
- What is this?
- I'm an adult. Watch your manners.

300
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,109
I said, are you having fun?

301
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,740
"An adult"? What a joke.

302
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,349
Who are you to care
if I'm having fun or not? Let go.

303
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,579
I said, let go.

304
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,589
How could such a weak species
end up at the top of the food chain?

305
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,319
What are you doing?

306
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,160
- Hey.
- Who are you?

307
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,500
Did you just swear at me?

308
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,529
Die. Die.

309
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,000
Hey. You're bleeding.

310
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:42,970
You little...

311
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:56,750
It stings, doesn't it?

312
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:10,900
It's too early to cry.

313
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,940
I have a lot of time
since I'm jobless.

314
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,140
(Youngju Sky Funeral Home)

315
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,019
A morgue?

316
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:30,549
Sure, this is the best place
to take a walk to. It's quiet...

317
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,019
and there are coffins.

318
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,829
Sorry. I'm the type of person
who can't get over it...

319
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:37,430
if something's bothering me.

320
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,700
Okay.

321
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:47,369
Come out.

322
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,539
I said, come out.

323
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,690
- Hey, it's a fox.
- It's a fox.

324
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:04,789
Yes, I'm a fox.

325
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,190
You sisters, come over here.

326
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:10,329
It's okay. Come here.

327
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,529
That's it. Come closer.

328
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,400
Yes. Up to here.

329
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,440
First, you deserve some beating.

330
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,740
Don't cling to humans
when you're ghosts.

331
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:24,640
Especially not to this woman.

332
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,109
You can ask them questions now.

333
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,519
What are your names?

334
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,720
- Min Seo
- Yeon Seo.

335
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,130
Min Seo and Yeon Seo,
do you have something to say to me?

336
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,339
Are you the sisters in this case?

337
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,740
("Neglect Leads To Tragedy
of Two Young Sisters")

338
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,880
(Late Min Seo, Late Yeon Seo)

339
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,589
Hey.

340
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:13,490
Did you see this news article?

341
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:18,059
Are the reporters trying to make it
worse than it is?

342
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,829
Darn it!

343
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,339
(The children fell from the veranda
while playing.)

344
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:32,410
(The trucker father was away
from home for four days.)

345
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,950
(Safety First)

346
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,160
Which one

347
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,529
Should I pick?

348
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:00,170
Let's make a guess.

349
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,769
This one, or this one?

350
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:06,779
I won't bother.

351
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:08,380
Why are you doing this to us?

352
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,980
Who are you to care if I'm
having fun or if this is my hobby?

353
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,450
- Please don't kill me.
- Okay. You can pick.

354
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,190
I made these. Some are penalties
and some are lucky cards.

355
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,859
You have a 50 percent chance.

356
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,859
What are these?

357
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,759
Just pick one already.

358
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,779
I made these. Some are penalties
and some are lucky cards.

359
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,339
You have a 50 percent chance.

360
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,410
What are these?

361
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,549
Just pick one already.

362
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,769
You've picked an interesting one.

363
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,099
(Donation of Talent)

364
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Donation of Talent.

365
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,269
Congratulations!

366
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:13,579
What kind of talent do you have?

367
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,849
We're good at baseball.

368
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:18,450
We're baseball players.

369
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,579
I enjoy baseball too.

370
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,750
If you let us go,

371
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:23,250
- we'll happily teach you.
- Yes.

372
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,019
You see, this kind of donation
is a bit different...

373
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:29,829
from the one you're thinking.

374
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:32,660
You guys won't be able
to play baseball anymore.

375
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,230
Thus the name "Donation of Talent".

376
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:42,069
Are you all right-handed?

377
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:44,710
Is this one left-handed?

378
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,079
I don't know.
Yu Ri, just break both arms.

379
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,480
- Let's go!
- Please spare us!

380
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:54,049
- We were wrong!
- We won't do this ever again!

381
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:56,150
- We won't!
- Please spare us!

382
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,450
- Please!
- We are still young!

383
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:58,759
We won't do it ever again!

384
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,220
Please spare us...

385
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,359
Who... Who are you?

386
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,170
I'm Min Seo and Yeon Seo's friend.

387
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:14,369
I see.

388
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:19,309
I'm a truck driver,

389
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:21,309
so I'm away most of the time.

390
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,410
I know. I also know
that their uncle, who's jobless,

391
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,220
took care of them most of the time.

392
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,589
My brother had a job interview
that day.

393
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,160
There are cherries
in that bag, right?

394
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,599
You must've been very close
with them.

395
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:50,710
These were expensive.

396
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,549
But they never wanted anything
that I got them.

397
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,599
Can you come out with me for a bit?

398
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,369
Help me!

399
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,039
How would it feel
to be burned alive?

400
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,740
They say it's about 1000°C.

401
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:29,309
Gosh, that's scorching hot.
You're making me hot!

402
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,049
Please. Why are you doing this?

403
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,349
You did something
to your nieces, didn't you?

404
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,390
No, I didn't.
Who in the world said that?

405
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,460
- Go inside.
- Wait!

406
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,230
Wait! I did it.

407
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,660
It was me. Please spare me.

408
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,230
You molested them, didn't you?

409
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:49,099
Well...

410
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,000
It was a mistake.

411
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,539
I was so drunk that day.

412
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,640
I didn't mean to kill them.
But the kids...

413
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,009
ran out to the veranda.

414
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,240
That's enough.

415
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,050
You filthy animal!

416
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,449
The police are on their way.

417
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,389
I was their father,
but I had no idea.

418
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,630
I was a complete fool.

419
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,039
Sir, the reason why
the girls didn't touch...

420
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,940
those cherries...

421
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,210
wasn't because they disliked you.

422
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,119
They didn't want to waste them.

423
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,320
They rarely got presents from you,

424
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:45,690
so they greatly cherished them.

425
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,269
I'm sorry.

426
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,440
She must like you.

427
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,639
Despite getting abused,

428
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,909
she still wags her tail at us.

429
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,510
How foolish.

430
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,079
Poor dog.

431
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,380
Can't we take her?

432
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,650
Oh, no...

433
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,590
Why did you come back?

434
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:58,360
I told you to run away
as far as possible.

435
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,500
Are you in pain?

436
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,739
What should I do?

437
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,599
There was only one thing I could do.

438
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,809
I had to end his misery.

439
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:16,050
No...

440
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:17,980
I can't do it.

441
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,320
I don't want to.

442
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,760
Yeon, help me.

443
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,219
Yeon!

444
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,639
Blackie...

445
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:42,840
Here you go.

446
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,210
I'm so happy!

447
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,809
Make sure you cherish him
and raise him well, okay?

448
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,949
I will.

449
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,420
I'm so happy. Aren't you?

450
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,920
Good boy.

451
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,119
Faster!

452
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,489
I shouldn't have loved him
from the beginning.

453
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,960
I shouldn't have named him.

454
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:07,530
I shouldn't have slept with him
by my side.

455
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,840
The day Yeon abandoned the forest,
I lost everything...

456
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:14,940
that was dear to me.

457
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,639
Let's take her. Please?

458
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,239
No.

459
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,510
Why not?

460
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,579
I don't like that they die too soon.

461
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:38,030
Let's go.

462
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,130
Goodbye.

463
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:44,170
Bye.

464
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,929
Hey. Go play over there.

465
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:19,840
Now.

466
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:24,940
Go.

467
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,949
Who were those kids?

468
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:42,789
This used to be a graveyard
where they had secretly buried kids.

469
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,260
They can only leave this earth
once they relieve their grudges.

470
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,429
It's too late.

471
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,630
They must've died a long time ago.

472
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,969
They didn't even have tumuli
over the graves...

473
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:56,909
so that the parents
wouldn't look for them.

474
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,679
That's sad.

475
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:02,510
They wanted the parents to let go
and move on.

476
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:05,650
You could say
that it was a sad custom.

477
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:07,750
Then and now,

478
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,489
all parents who have lost
their children feel the same way.

479
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:27,969
You keep staring at me. Why?

480
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,469
Just because.

481
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,780
You seem different from
the Lee Yeon I used to know.

482
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,909
You're the one who relieved
the sisters' grudge.

483
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,719
Thanks.

484
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,150
For what?

485
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:44,190
Just everything.

486
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,869
Darn it.

487
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:03,739
Food or drinks?

488
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,679
Don't humans treat each other
to something when they're grateful?

489
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,289
I prefer drinks.

490
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,730
I thought you had an umbrella.

491
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,789
I lost it.

492
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,829
- Are you stupid?
- Yes, I am.

493
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,670
No wonder.

494
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,639
You weren't that good
at collecting news.

495
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:54,219
What the? What kind of tree is so...

496
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,489
Let's go.

497
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,000
I noticed you never leave
this umbrella behind.

498
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,829
I hate getting rained on.
It ruins my fur.

499
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:14,340
Oh, it's similar to dogs
hating baths.

500
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,739
- Right. Hey!
- Right.

501
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,780
I caught you
because of this umbrella.

502
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,650
I let you catch me.

503
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,650
No way.

504
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,920
You think I can't lose
a human like you?

505
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,760
No matter how much it rains,
I eat chicken

506
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,960
Sin Ju loves chicken

507
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,059
- You're here.
- Gosh!

508
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:38,960
Where on earth were you
during business hours?

509
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,760
I was bored to death.

510
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,070
What do you want today?

511
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:47,269
Treat her.

512
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:52,170
(Have you registered your pet yet?)

513
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:08,090
How is she?

514
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,289
I think her bones have been crushed.

515
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,630
She has malnutrition
and skin disease.

516
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,630
Her collar is buried too deep
into her skin.

517
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,429
Where is my necklace?

518
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,739
I need to talk to her.

519
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:24,610
Come on.

520
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,079
Darn it.

521
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,190
What happened to you?

522
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,119
Did it hurt bad?

523
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:42,559
Oh, she didn't do this to you?

524
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,329
I see.

525
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,960
She's not an abandoned dog.

526
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,929
I took her. It felt like
she'd be better off abandoned.

527
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:53,000
- Ms. Ki.
- What?

528
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,599
Good job.

529
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,309
I didn't like you
as a necklace thief,

530
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:58,809
but I admire a dog thief.

531
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:01,679
- A dog thief?
- It's hard for me to do.

532
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,449
Since I'm the type
that can't cross the line.

533
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,820
I don't have a line to cross.

534
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:10,119
Can you please wait over there?

535
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,639
It's okay, I got you.

536
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,409
It's okay.

537
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:46,320
How could you not watch
"Toy Story 3"?

538
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,030
"Andy, if that's what you want,

539
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,929
"I'll always stay there,
wherever it is."

540
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,360
"Goodbye, partner."

541
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,500
You don't know this?

542
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,530
Isn't that movie for kids?

543
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,340
It made adults around the world cry.

544
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,909
I hate it when people cry
when they watch movies.

545
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,139
- Then what's your favorite movie?
- I like...

546
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,579
"Mad Max", "Avengers",

547
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,619
and every zombie movie
that exists in this world.

548
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:17,889
Oh. What type of music do you like?

549
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,250
I love idol music.

550
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:22,659
- What about classic music?
- I can't distinguish the singers.

551
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:23,889
They're not singers, but composers.

552
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,530
What about hiking?

553
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,000
I won't even go
if someone carries me.

554
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,300
Single malt whisky?

555
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,800
I'd rather drink a disinfectant.

556
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:35,199
- Korean food or western food?
- Korean food all the way.

557
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,269
Me too.

558
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:44,650
You don't have many friends, do you?

559
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,750
Me neither.

560
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,150
We have a lot in common.

561
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,219
"You Quiz on the Block" or
"Amazing Saturday"? 1, 2, 3.

562
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,630
- "Amazing Saturday"!
- "Amazing Saturday"!

563
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:20,780
What is your dream?

564
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,590
You're asking what I want to do
at this age?

565
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:28,690
You know, things like
retiring and opening a cafe.

566
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:31,289
Coffee tastes best
when it's made by others.

567
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,429
How about traveling around
the world?

568
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:36,969
I like staying at home
and watching dramas better.

569
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,630
How about saving up
a million dollars?

570
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,699
A million dollars?

571
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,539
Tell me your account number.
I'll wire it now.

572
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,739
No, stop that.

573
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:49,010
- Why? I know smart banking too.
- It's okay.

574
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,230
If a dream includes
something impossible,

575
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:07,929
I...

576
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,969
want to become human.

577
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,969
Goodness, this fox doesn't know
how happy he is.

578
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:22,309
If you're curious about
an ordinary human's life,

579
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:24,380
ride the subway during rush hour.

580
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:27,420
The Underworld is closer
than you think.

581
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:31,389
Not only that.
We work all day and night...

582
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,960
and my boss nags me
with that mouth of his.

583
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,159
And there's also the stress
I receive from viewer ratings.

584
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,059
- Shall I get rid of it?
- Get rid of what?

585
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,599
The broadcasting station.
Since it stresses you out.

586
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:47,900
That is a very tempting offer,

587
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,670
but let's drink this
and think about it.

588
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,820
What about you? What is your dream?

589
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,690
For me...

590
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,599
It's okay to live in a cottage,

591
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:23,710
so in the future, I really hope...

592
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,440
I live with my parents.

593
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,590
Do you have a photo of your parents?

594
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:43,929
Send one to me.

595
00:48:58,639 --> 00:48:59,780
Are you okay?

596
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:03,309
It's so dark.

597
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,579
The streetlights are broken.

598
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:09,719
- Can't you do something like that?
- What?

599
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,250
If you fix all the lights
with your superpower,

600
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,719
it'll be so cool.

601
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,559
Ask the borough office in charge.

602
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,960
What kind of nine-tailed fox
are you?

603
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,300
Sin Ju comes running whenever
a light bulb goes out in my house.

604
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,030
You're seriously so spoiled.

605
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,139
Foxes are afraid of electricity too.

606
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,010
- We're here.
- Yes.

607
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,079
- I'll go now.
- Okay, bye.

608
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,719
Wait.

609
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,260
Good night.

610
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,289
You too.

611
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:34,670
It was Lee Yeon...

612
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:36,739
that time too.

613
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:11,710
(When you run a business here,
you can make money for a while...)

614
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,679
(Daehan Myeonok, Gosung Samgyetang)

615
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,349
(Viewer Bulletin Board)

616
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,820
"My mother works as a babysitter,
and I can't get in touch with her."

617
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:29,889
Ms. Kim. Did you read this report?

618
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,260
Can't you see I'm on a roll
with the script? Don't talk to me.

619
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:34,659
- Please just take a look.
- Please leave.

620
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:37,699
But you always copy and paste
the same narration.

621
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,400
Repeat that again.

622
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:43,039
I heard him clearly too.
He said you copy and paste.

623
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,110
Ms. Nam.

624
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,239
A pen is sharper than a knife.

625
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,139
Both you and I will die today.
Come here.

626
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:54,949
I'm beyond sick of them now.

627
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:01,460
All right. Now you guys...

628
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,929
will have to build a stone tower
in the children's underworld.

629
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,929
When you build the tower,
the goblin will show up...

630
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,460
and break it down.

631
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,239
However, you must continue
to build this stone tower...

632
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,469
so you'd be able to reincarnate.

633
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,670
I don't like the underworld.

634
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,380
My sister is good
at brushing her teeth,

635
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,639
and she listens to Dad well too.

636
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,150
It's called an underworld,

637
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,309
but it's the same
as playing with blocks.

638
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,719
You two can play together.

639
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,949
It's going to be so much fun!

640
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:33,789
I don't want to play with blocks.

641
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:35,489
She doesn't want to do it.

642
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:38,789
You have to just bear it.

643
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:42,329
Are there cartoons
in the underworld?

644
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,329
No.

645
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,170
Then can I take this slime with me?

646
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:07,420
You can't take anything
from this world.

647
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:10,230
I'm sorry.

648
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:14,659
You're being so harsh.

649
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:19,900
You have zero flexibility.

650
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:21,900
You shouldn't allow
allowances for the dead either.

651
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,610
That's what I mean.

652
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,269
You step out of this.

653
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:27,909
Have the kids go in.

654
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,480
Okay. Come with me.

655
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:35,150
Okay, come along.

656
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,889
Hey, kid.
Look after your sister well, okay?

657
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,130
Why is he acting so pitiful?

658
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,469
Come on.

659
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:58,269
Are you still running
the children's underworld?

660
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,409
They broke their parent's heart.

661
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,210
They unfairly died early,

662
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,380
and now they're framed
as bad children.

663
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,719
This law was made so the kids
could be reincarnated faster.

664
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,889
We need a turnover
in the underworld too.

665
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:15,619
We should replace everyone
starting with King Yeomra.

666
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,929
Do you want to go
to The Underworld of Tongues...

667
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:21,400
and get that tongue of yours plowed?

668
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,869
You're always on about tortures.
We're not in the Middle Ages.

669
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,599
We're using slides to brief people
on the underworlds.

670
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,869
Why are you talking about
pulling out tongues?

671
00:54:32,139 --> 00:54:34,210
Are you here to give me trouble
first thing this morning?

672
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:35,710
No.

673
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:39,679
Here. Here's an iced Americano.

674
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:47,719
What do I have to do
if I want to look for someone?

675
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,630
Do you work part-time
at a detective agency?

676
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,469
Here.

677
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:02,769
They were the ones you wanted
to check on the register.

678
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,369
They didn't die, but they haven't
contacted in 20 years.

679
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,639
- So?
- Let's use your clairvoyance power.

680
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:11,780
Get it out of my face.

681
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:13,179
You saw it, right? Where are they?

682
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,150
- I don't know.
- Are you trying to abuse the power?

683
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,150
Don't be like that.

684
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:25,090
I can't see them either.

685
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:30,130
- What?
- If I can't see them...

686
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,800
That means they're not in this world
or in the underworld.

687
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,639
I'd ask the ones who took them away.

688
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:40,739
"Took them away"?

689
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:42,909
Who?

690
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,650
Hey. Why am I getting more missions?

691
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,820
It's true we do this
so we could make a living,

692
00:55:51,889 --> 00:55:53,889
but do we have to be so serious
every time we choose our lunch menu?

693
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,320
Stop! Stop, stop, stop.

694
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,429
Our boss is up ahead.

695
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,559
Long time no see, "Searching for
Ghost Stories in the City" team.

696
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,929
Hello, sir.

697
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:09,139
Is work fun these days?

698
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,969
I don't work for fun.
I do it to make a living.

699
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,409
You're still the same.

700
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,480
I heard the ratings were high again
last month.

701
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,710
Yes. Please buy us a meal.

702
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,679
Mr. Choi, let's have dinner
with the whole team soon.

703
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,150
Thank you, sir.

704
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:28,690
Take care, sir.

I miss the boatman's song

708
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,079
That was the case in the old days.

709
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,380
These days, the Daedong River
is all about the beer.

710
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,510
What nonsense are you spewing?

711
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,920
You're Grandpa Jangseung, right?

712
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:57,250
Yes,

713
00:56:57,949 --> 00:56:59,750
but I sell makgeolli not beer.

714
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:04,489
You shouldn't turn your back on me
so rashly.

715
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,599
I hear you're the eldest
at Yeou Gogae.

716
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:12,829
I'm looking for someone.

717
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,739
Have you seen these people or not?

718
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:21,809
Is that a yes or a no?

719
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,110
I don't know.

720
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,280
I won't talk long.

721
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:27,719
I really don't know!

722
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,489
Why didn't you answer me right away?

723
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:37,059
Why do you have a hard time
understanding me when you're young?

724
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:40,030
So, did you say someone else
would know?

725
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:43,329
Who?

726
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:46,099
The district magistrate...

727
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:49,699
Speak louder.

728
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:51,269
The district magistrate!

729
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,340
"The district magistrate"?

730
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:02,920
Hey. Why does the boss
only speak to you?

731
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:04,719
I don't know.

732
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:07,860
What's your secret?

733
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,690
First, don't get scared.

734
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,659
What a simple answer.

735
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,400
You should try becoming
a deputy manager.

736
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,739
Once you have a title,

737
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,670
you'll act the same as me
in front of him.

738
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,110
Why did you order honey garlic?

739
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,079
When your life is a rollercoaster,

740
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,539
something sweet and salty
is the best.

741
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,050
Do you want some?

742
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,480
What kind is this one?

743
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,519
- Blueberry.
- No, not mine.

744
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:39,920
I'll consider it
when you stop smoking.

745
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,219
You're so petty.

746
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,260
Gosh.

747
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,000
Is that a human
or a computer graphic character?

748
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,699
He has a great body,
and he's handsome.

749
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:54,440
Even his car's nice.

750
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,679
But what I see in front of me
is a complete disaster.

751
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,909
What you said is harassment.

752
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:08,619
Let's go.

753
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,250
Why did you come here?

754
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:13,789
Wait.

755
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:15,489
What?

756
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,489
What was that?

757
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,260
- Where are we going?
- Get in. Hurry.

758
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,630
Hurry up.

759
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:33,139
What just happened?

760
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,280
I don't know.

761
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:42,280
Where are we going?

762
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,219
To realize your dream.

763
00:59:45,889 --> 00:59:49,119

- I even have your type of music.

- And so am I.

But here I am,

01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,440
Did you see them or not?

772
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,369
I didn't!

773
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:38,869
Is that so? Then just drop.

774
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:42,739
No! Wait!

775
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:46,210
Wait! Hold on!
