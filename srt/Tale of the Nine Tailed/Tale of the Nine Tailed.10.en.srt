(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

8
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,950
By the way, where are we going?

9
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,719
The place where Ah Eum and my story
started and finished.

10
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,689
This is the mountain
I used to reign over.

11
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,400
It's my hometown,
and it was also my home...

12
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,700
and my workplace.

13
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,200
Did you know that they had
something like Valentine's Day...

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
during the Joseon Dynasty too?

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,430
On the day all living things
woke up from hibernation,

16
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,300
lovers exchanged ginkgo nuts
as a sign of love.

17
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,139
Why ginkgo nuts of all things?

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,210
Male trees and female trees
pair up to bear fruit,

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,340
and they live for a long time.
Over 1,000 years.

20
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,009
This means you're still cherishing
a Valentine's Day gift...

21
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,719
from your ex.

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,150
No.

23
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,719
It was her goodbye gift.

24
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,849
We broke up after I got this.

25
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:31,819
Here.

26
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,400
I'll protect you.

27
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,539
What?

28
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,909
You said a mountain spirit must
protect all that's on the mountain.

29
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,139
Someone should take care
of the mountain spirit too.

30
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,009
Why would you?

31
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,580
Because I like you.

32
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,129
Who are you to say that?

33
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:10,900
You have no power to do that.

34
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,229
What's with you all of a sudden?

35
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:16,370
Just because I let you talk to me
doesn't mean you're someone special.

36
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,240
What a dream you have.

37
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,169
How can you become strong like me?

38
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,080
How on earth
are you going to protect me?

39
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,180
You're just a mere human.

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,780
Do you mean that?

41
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:34,349
I do.

42
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,560
So don't ever come back here again.

43
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,770
You didn't mean it, right?

44
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,280
I was afraid.

45
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:04,280
I was afraid I might love
a human with a finite life...

46
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,080
when I have an infinite life.

47
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,449
How did you two meet again?

48
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,719
Did you go to her?

49
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,289
I was someone who owned
this mountain,

50
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,790
but I was also bound to the mountain
I was overseeing.

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
A mountain spirit cannot escape
from his forest.

52
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,930
What happens if he does?

53
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,740
He becomes weak.

54
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,209
He can't use his powers
as a mountain spirit.

55
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,610
One time, I chased after
some dead spirits...

56
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,110
and accidentally stepped over
the border.

57
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,879
A thousand-year-old
nine-tailed fox showed up!

58
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,120
- "A nine-tailed fox"?
- What?

59
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,120
- Get the nine-tailed fox!
- Get him!

60
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,990
- Get the nine-tailed fox.
- Let's find him.

61
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,089
What is that?

62
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,689
It's his blood!

63
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,790
- Over there.
- Get him!

64
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,160
- Wait for me!
- Let's go this way.

65
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,660
We're getting close.

66
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,410
How shameful.

67
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:03,610
- Let's go that way.
- My goodness.

68
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,980
I'm so embarrassed.

69
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,670
Go on.

70
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,399
Go down that path,
and you will find your forest.

71
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,540
Ah Eum.

72
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,879
I did not see you today.

73
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,389
Thank you.

74
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,430
I will make sure to repay you.

75
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,680
(Chapter 10: Deja Vu)

76
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,420
I found him.

77
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,860
I'll come and get you soon.

78
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,790
You better wait.

79
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,629
Why do you look entertained?

80
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,100
I think the stage
is finally complete.

81
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:36,269
- The stage?
- I found out through Ouduksini...

82
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,240
that Yeon...

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,170
won't be able to kill
that woman this time.

84
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,670
Is there a reason why
you need both of them?

85
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,079
It was I who should've been...

86
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,750
the mountain spirit
and be by her side.

87
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,019
- Does that mean...
- I'll become a mountain spirit...

88
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,990
and take her as my bride.

89
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,870
Gosh, this place is so mesmerizing.

90
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:25,720
Why aren't you asking?

91
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,759
"Why did you repay my kindness
in such a horrendous way?"

92
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,930
"Why did you kill me?"

93
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,660
On my way here,

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,829
I found out
that this gorgeous waterfall...

95
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,129
had a couple legends.

96
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:46,540
It's about a couple
who loved each other so dearly.

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,540
The legend had two versions.

98
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,680
One where the husband dies
and one where the wife dies.

99
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,410
I believe there's a story
I don't know...

100
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,449
regarding the legend
of the nine-tailed fox...

101
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,019
who had to kill his first love
and encounter a tragic end.

102
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:25,810
Ah Eum.

103
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:28,209
Why are you attacking me?

104
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,449
This wench's body is useful,
after all.

105
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,350
I just shot as many arrows
as I wanted...

106
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,049
into the almighty
mountain spirit's body.

107
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,559
Imoogi.

108
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:47,700
It's been a while, Lee Yeon.
I've been waiting for you.

109
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,570
- Where's Ah Eum?
- Right here.

110
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,840
She willingly handed over
her own body...

111
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
in exchange for her father's life.

112
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,169
Come out of there.

113
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,110
I forgot to tell you.

114
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,179
They're evening primroses
I picked from the graveyard.

115
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,559
I said, come out.

116
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,289
- She's mine.
- Get out of there!

117
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,480
Should I come out
after she's killed?

118
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:37,250
This woman means nothing to me.

119
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:39,679
That is absurd.

120
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,519
Do you think you've used her
as bait to get to me?

121
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,919
Did you not think that I could've
used her as bait to get you?

122
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,110
Help me!

123
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,340
I do not want to die.

124
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,879
You promised...

125
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,220
that you'd never change.

126
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:51,460
Lee Yeon.

127
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,240
No. I can't.

128
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,350
Ah Eum.

129
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,419
Is that you?

130
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,789
Don't come near me.

131
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,870
It is you.

132
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,639
I...

133
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,269
killed the villagers.

134
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,409
I killed every single one of them.

135
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,279
It wasn't your fault.

136
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:58,460
Help me, Yeon.

137
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,029
Stop me from harming more people.

138
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,129
Stop me from harming you.

139
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,600
Kill me.

140
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,740
It's okay. You have me.

141
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,509
Everything will be all right.

142
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,600
She's more tenacious than I thought.

143
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:45,299
You can neither kill nor spare me.

144
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,279
I'm the one you want, right?

145
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,580
Take my body instead...

146
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,220
and let her go.

147
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,389
Well, isn't this heart-wrenching?

148
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,529
I won't repeat again.

149
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,730
Would you have
the mountain spirit's body or hers?

150
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,169
Fine. I'll let her go.

151
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,139
However,

152
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,950
I want your heart.

153
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,950
I heard that
a mountain spirit's heart...

154
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,419
contains their quintessence.

155
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Give it to me.

156
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,090
Ah Eum.

157
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,559
You can hear me, right?

158
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,799
Promise me one thing.

159
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:56,240
That you'll forget about me.

160
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,139
Forget about me...

161
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,980
and live for a long time.

162
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:14,929
Be neither sorry...

163
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,230
nor grateful toward me.

164
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,029
My life belongs to you anyway.

165
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,809
You can't die that easily.

166
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Ah Eum.

167
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,720
Let go. I'm really okay.

168
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,330
Yeon.

169
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,570
You told me to forget about you.

170
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,269
But not me.

171
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:02,909
Don't forget about me.

172
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:09,850
- What do you mean?
- If you date another woman,

173
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,320
I'll crawl out of my grave.

174
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:15,490
Let go of this.

175
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,860
Repay me, Yeon.

176
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,330
No.

177
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,009
Kill me.

178
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,720
I promised...

179
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,850
that I would...

180
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,019
protect you.

181
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,039
Thank you, Lee Yeon.

182
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,420
For keeping your promise
about never forgetting me.

183
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,289
And...

184
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,619
I'm sorry.

185
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,089
For making you wait for too long.

186
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,509
That's precious to you.

187
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,549
You are not a shadow of my past.

188
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,849
I'll look at you properly now.

189
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,549
I'll only look at you.

190
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,720
Not as Ah Eum who has been reborn,
but as you.

191
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,019
You're back?

192
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,990
I thought you died
in the Forest of Starving Ghosts.

193
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,220
What are you saying?
I was happy for nothing.

194
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,529
Now?

195
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,160
Whatever. I don't care
if you come or not.

196
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,180
Are you okay?
Shall I ask Sin Ju to come back?

197
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,750
Don't make a fuss. It's nothing.

198
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,880
It's not because of the poison,
is it?

199
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,819
Your life is almost up.

200
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,490
Am I right?

201
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,289
I lived pretty long for a half-fox.

202
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,299
Please eat some ground cherries.

203
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,670
You can steal people's lives
and live as long as you can.

204
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,269
Lee Yeon is coming.

205
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:00,400
I'm going to tell him
what Imoogi really is.

206
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,440
I'm the only one
who knows his face.

207
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:04,640
Then what about you?

208
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:09,710
I've never dreamed of
a future anyway.

209
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,619
Don't do it! Please stop.

210
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:13,680
Why are you willing to go so far
for Lee Yeon?

211
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,490
You must never tell Lee Yeon.

212
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:21,789
Instead of Lee Yeon,

213
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,730
meet Imoogi and ask him to save you.

214
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,099
Or tell me where he is.
I'll go get some ground cherries.

215
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,700
Yu Ri.

216
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,869
Why would you cry because of me?

217
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:35,410
It's so frustrating.

218
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,640
I told you...

219
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,279
to never cry because of someone.

220
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,809
Don't make your life pitiful.

221
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,549
You told me to take,
and not let others take from me.

222
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:46,119
When we first met.

223
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,519
You were bathed in the
zoo keeper's blood.

224
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,319
You told me to live like that.

225
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,130
You know how capricious I am.

226
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,029
Stop sniffing and go get me
some naengmyeon.

227
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,900
I'm craving some
Pyeongyang-style naengmyeon.

228
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,789
I want to go back to that time.

229
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,319
I can't remember the taste
of those flowers...

230
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:29,589
I used to pluck and eat back then.

231
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,240
Hey.

232
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,410
What are you thinking about?
You look so dazed all day.

233
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,549
I'm certain I saw him somewhere.

234
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:50,509
- Who?
- Ms. Nam's boyfriend.

235
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,849
Well, I have to admit
you have a keen eye.

236
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,519
What kind of shows
did we make lately?

237
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,789
"Ghost Story at Work",
"The Cursed Wedding Ring",

238
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:02,990
- "The Haunted"...
- Wait.

239
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,259
I'm certain it was around that time.

240
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,500
This is driving me crazy.
Who was it?

241
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,599
The red umbrella?

242
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,500
What do you mean?

243
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,200
You're right.
The guy you saw that day...

244
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,210
is the guy with the red umbrella
we covered a story on.

245
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,430
Why?

246
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,059
Am I not the guest
you were waiting for?

247
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:49,039
Where did he go?

248
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,140
Lee Yeon?

249
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:56,579
Do you know me?

250
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,519
Where's Lee Rang?

251
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:00,180
I don't know. He was gone
when I came back.

252
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,720
He's not picking up
his phone either.

253
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,589
Judging by how rude you're talking,
you must be her.

254
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,259
The necklace thief
and owner of the dog.

255
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:09,259
You guys are a 99.

256
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,730
- What are you talking about?
- You don't have to know.

257
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,559
Gosh, it's
Pyeongyang-style naengmyeon.

258
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:17,099
It's for Mr. Lee! Don't eat it.

259
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,869
Naengmyeon tastes bad
if it gets soggy.

260
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,809
My gosh, you look so pale.

261
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,609
Can you get away from me?

262
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,380
You smell like a rotting corpse.

263
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,450
It's the smell of death.

264
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,619
Since both of us
have outlived our lives.

265
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,130
Do you want one?

266
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,269
No, thanks.

267
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:50,700
You're willing to trade your life
with your petty pride?

268
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:52,069
Is it really worth it?

269
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:54,569
Do you think I care for my life
so dearly like you?

270
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:55,940
Of course not.

271
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,339
Yet, why do you look so
disappointed?

272
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:03,410
You're not like the Lee Rang I know.

273
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,680
Just cut to the chase.

274
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,789
Are you intending to disobey
our master?

275
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,390
Not our master, but yours.

276
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,559
I know how upset you are
because of Ouduksini. But...

277
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,730
I assure you
it's a misunderstanding.

278
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,700
You shoved me into
the Forest of Starving Ghosts.

279
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,299
But what? A misunderstanding?

280
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,470
We lost a tad bit of control
in the process of catching Lee Yeon.

281
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:27,069
You know I wouldn't have
let you die in there.

282
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,940
Too bad.

283
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,640
I have no intention of listening
to your lies anymore.

284
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,450
You know that no matter
how weak I may have become,

285
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:40,480
killing you is nothing.

286
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,720
Wait. Hold on.

287
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,730
But how strange.

288
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,200
Isn't it time for your master
to show up?

289
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,529
Shall I guess?

290
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
Imoogi...

291
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:06,839
isn't here right now.

292
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,250
That was delicious.

293
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,730
- What are you looking at?
- Leave. Get lost.

294
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:42,049
Do you only have ice?

295
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:44,210
Don't you have any ice cream?

296
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:51,319
I can't believe Rang is raising
a foreign fox as his pet.

297
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,559
I don't like you.

298
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,259
I didn't ask.

299
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,289
Stop approaching Mr. Lee.

300
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,900
- What if I do?
- I'll kill you.

301
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,900
- And who are you to do that?
- I'm Ki Yu Ri.

302
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,099
I didn't ask you
to introduce yourself.

303
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,769
You just asked me!

304
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:09,339
It doesn't look like
you're very bright.

305
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,140
Can you communicate properly
with Rang?

306
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,579
- I know him much better than you.
- I doubt it.

307
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:16,779
When he eats naengmyeon,
he only adds mustard and no vinegar.

308
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,150
When he eats crabs,
he gets sores around his lips.

309
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:21,279
Also, he won't look at a gimbap
with cucumber in it.

310
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,349
It's all about food.

311
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,259
But because of you...
Because of someone like you, he...

312
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:28,990
You must never tell Lee Yeon.

313
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,930
What about him?

314
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:34,759
It's none of your business.

315
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,279
Are you laughing?

316
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,009
I know you can't kill me.
You shouldn't.

317
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,079
- What?
- I'm the one who saved you...

318
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,920
when you were dying
after being stabbed by Yeon.

319
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,859
You have a debt to repay me.

320
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,470
Who are you?

321
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:46,900
I'm just a passerby who noticed that
your life was hanging by a thread.

322
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,210
What a joke.

323
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,039
You smell like a rotten corpse.

324
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,079
I'm a human who somehow
ended up living a long time.

325
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,849
Why did you save me?

326
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,319
Who cares what the reason is?

327
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,549
You should repay me one day.

328
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:04,549
I'm sure the day will come.

329
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,410
You should abide by the rules.

330
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,779
A fox cannot breach a contract.

331
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,049
You were able to revive Imoogi
thanks to me.

332
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,319
No, it was thanks to me.

333
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,220
You just did a performance,
that's all.

334
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,519
You came to me in the first place
so you could use me.

335
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,960
You knew Yeon was my big brother.

336
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,660
Why else would I find value
in an inadequate fox like you?

337
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,339
Have a ground cherry.

338
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,400
You should stay alive to repay me.

339
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,509
What do you want from me?

340
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,579
Give Yeon over to me.
I'll give you two days.

341
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,849
I need his body.

342
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:24,430
I better get going.

343
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,599
Sure. Go ahead.

344
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,440
Rang acted as if he was living
in a tragic tale,

345
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,250
but I guess he wasn't
all that unhappy.

346
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,849
If you're going to be there for him,
stay with him until the end.

347
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,589
Give this to Rang...

348
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,490
and tell him
it's for the naengmyeon.

349
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,029
What's with him?

350
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:08,039
If we sum it up,

351
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,109
the man you're dating...

352
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,079
is the suspect of the criminal case
we've been after?

353
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,519
He's not the suspect.
He's the criminal.

354
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,549
Does he have a criminal background?

355
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:20,089
He was never indicted,
but he probably has several records.

356
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,190
Are you seeing him
despite knowing this?

357
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,589
- Yes.
- Why?

358
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,259
Because he waited for me
until I was born again.

359
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,869
I was his first love
in my past life.

360
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,200
That's just an item for our show.

361
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,339
Could it be a metaphor?

362
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,339
Maybe you like him enough
to feel like that's the case.

363
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:42,380
Do you guys think it was
a coincidence the three of us met?

364
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,279
I believe it was destined.

365
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,680
What a joke. Forget it.

366
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,490
Just tell us the reason.
What is this all about?

367
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,190
You two could fall in danger.

368
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,799
Because you're the closest ones
to me.

369
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,900
In my previous life, and now too.

370
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,569
Why do you keep on talking about
your previous life?

371
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,700
I know talking about it
won't persuade you.

372
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:12,380
Take a look at it yourself.

373
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:15,579
What are these glasses for?

374
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,650
- They're the tiger's eyebrows.
- From fairy tales?

375
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,049
Yes. Do you have a mirror?

376
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:22,119
Gosh.

377
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:25,660
Here.

378
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,470
What? Wait...

379
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,140
Where are we going?

380
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,880
To somewhere far away
from the palace.

381
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,019
Is it just the two of you?

382
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,880
I'm so sorry, Princess.

383
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:56,990
We'll protect you until the end.

384
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,099
Gosh.

385
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,740
- From now on, set just one table.
- Pardon?

386
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,779
We're not at the palace
and no one's looking.

387
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:21,839
Who cares about the customs?

388
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:23,210
Let's just eat together.

389
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,349
- We can't do that. How...
- If you say no,

390
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,619
I'll starve.

391
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:30,849
Princess.

392
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,619
Where are you going?

393
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,460
I'm going to get some fresh air.

394
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,029
- Don't follow me.
- Don't go to the northern forest.

395
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,460
- Why not?
- They say...

396
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,400
there's a thousand-year-old fox
who lives there.

397
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,869
A fox?

398
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:48,970
Princess,

399
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,869
have this. It's fish.

400
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,509
You have a grain of rice on you.

401
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,559
Princess.

402
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,460
- Ta-da.
- How nice.

403
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,660
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

404
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:16,630
You should sit down too.

405
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,339
I'm okay.

406
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:21,200
- Let's do it together. Come on.
- Sit.

407
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,869
Hurry up. This is really pretty.

408
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,410
It'll suit you well.

409
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:30,609
Gosh.

410
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,089
Is this what happened
in our previous lives?

411
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:44,960
Is this a dream or what?

412
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:46,660
Was I bewitched?

413
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,869
This isn't a pair
of VR goggles, is it?

414
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,500
I don't believe it.

415
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,839
If previous lives existed,

416
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,440
I thought I'd be the princess.
Why are you the princess?

417
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,109
You had it better than me.
I was a eunuch.

418
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,279
That kid called me
a eunuch last time.

419
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,720
- These are the glasses.
- This is ridiculous.

420
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,590
We all must be possessed from
running a ghost show for too long.

421
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:14,119
Tell us. I doubt your intention
is to make us all go crazy together.

422
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:16,630
Why did you show this to us?

423
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,360
The one who's targeting me...

424
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,269
might be closer than we think.

425
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,269
Perhaps it might be someone we know.

426
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,010
Just like how you protected me
in our previous lives,

427
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,909
I want to do the same for you
this time around.

428
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,349
What about your boyfriend?

429
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:39,820
Who is he?

430
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,750
Do you want to come in?

431
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:48,320
Hi. I bet you've never met
a nine-tailed fox before, have you?

432
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,429
What? Do you not believe me?

433
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,570
They seemed quite shocked.

434
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,969
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

435
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,139
I understand their denial.

436
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,510
If necessary, just say the word,
and I'll erase their memory.

437
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,150
Did you meet your brother yet?

438
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,050
No. I think the Imoogi
got to him first.

439
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,389
I see.

440
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,920
It kept an eye on us
through Ouduksini and knew...

441
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:24,530
that Rang was unreliable
the moment his heart wavered.

442
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,260
I thought we had finally
found a lead.

443
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,500
Don't be disheartened.

444
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,130
I expected it.

445
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,940
I prepared myself beforehand.

446
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,630
Where have you been?

447
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,239
I want to be alone.

448
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,800
Your body...

449
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,380
Did you eat a ground cherry?

450
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,079
Please.

451
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,980
Let me be alone.

452
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,380
Yeon...

453
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:23,019
left that here.

454
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:44,000
This is unbelievable.

455
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,050
Hello, sir.

456
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:03,619
Why have you called at this hour?

457
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,519
I have a favor to ask of you.

458
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,960
You do?

459
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,130
Anything, sir.

460
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,030
Good. He'll be there tomorrow.

461
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:16,829
Thanks.

462
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:30,550
Rest up.

463
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,489
What about Ms. Nam?
Is she not eating chicken with us?

464
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,460
No, she must be tired. She's asleep.

465
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,170
Will she be staying here
for the time being?

466
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,400
Yes. This place is safer.

467
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,739
Did you see him?

468
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,969
I didn't see the Imoogi,

469
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,110
but I did see the middle-aged man
who took your brother.

470
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,079
Could he be the one
who has that tattoo on his forehead?

471
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,980
We know where he is,
so that's enough for now.

472
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,619
- You should be careful.
- I will.

473
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,719
Here you go.

474
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,599
Why do you always give me
the drumsticks?

475
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,769
Because they're drumsticks.

476
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,610
Thank you for the meal.

477
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:40,119
Thank you for what you did today
and for saving us from Ouduksini.

478
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,849
It was all thanks
to those from the Styx.

479
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,449
That granny...

480
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,159
never gives out
information or items for free.

481
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,130
What did she take from you?
What did you agree on?

482
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,329
To be her slave.

483
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,199
- What?
- I'll row the boat on the Styx.

484
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,800
She wants me to escort the dead
to the Underworld.

485
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:01,869
Due to the aging population,
she needs my help.

486
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:03,110
But you get seasick.

487
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,170
I agreed to do it after I die.

488
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:07,480
I doubt a deceased fox
will get seasick.

489
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,039
They do.

490
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:17,449
This won't do.
Let's transfer you to a desk job.

491
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,050
Let's bribe the higher-ups.

492
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:21,420
I trust that you'll make it work.

493
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,960
But guess what? I still got
a long way to go before I die.

494
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,969
Before then, I hope things work out
with that necklace thief.

495
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,840
She has a beautiful name,
and it's Yu Ri.

496
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:37,010
Did you meet her?

497
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,210
Yes. She was better than I thought.

498
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
You got up late.

499
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,429
Why are you so astounded?

500
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:07,800
You know me, right?

501
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,539
- I'm so hungover.
- Me too.

502
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,010
- Coffee?
- Yes, hurry.

503
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:28,860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

504
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,800
It feels like
I'm at an artistic cafe.

505
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,539
- Isn't it so sweet?
- It's of high quality.

506
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,739
If only life was this sweet,

507
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,909
I'd have nothing to wish for.

508
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:49,139
- About yesterday...
- Yes?

509
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:52,050
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

510
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,050
Wrap that up and come to my office.

511
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,250
Come on!

512
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,349
Hurry up.

513
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,760
Come on in.

514
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,920
I know it's nothing special.

515
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,860
Say hi.

516
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,829
He's our new intern.

517
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,199
I look forward to working with you.

518
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,309
How did you know?

519
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:19,980
That's my trade secret.

520
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,809
I looked everywhere
but couldn't find it. Where is it?

521
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:24,579
I don't know.

522
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,050
I didn't even say what I was
looking for. Why would you not know?

523
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,150
Everyone says that in the beginning.

524
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,219
I really don't.

525
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:35,789
Haven't you heard about me?

526
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,929
Anyone who encounters me
always wants to spill their secrets.

527
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,400
What do you mean?

528
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:42,769
Look.

529
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:48,139
My, my.
It's a great day to torture someone.

530
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:54,380
My name is Terry.

531
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,110
Terry as in Terrius.

532
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,409
Isn't it easy to remember?
You're 22 years old, right?

533
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,219
He's studying
at an elite university in the US.

534
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:02,719
Who pulled the strings for you?

535
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,719
- Sorry?
- All the interns who come here...

536
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:06,860
have connections.

537
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:09,659
Judging by
his enthusiastic reaction,

538
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:11,090
I'm guessing
it's one of the higher-ups.

539
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:14,000
What are you saying?

540
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,429
She tends to be a bit feisty.

541
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:18,829
Watch out. She gets even more feisty
on an empty stomach.

542
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,500
He's not my dad, but my guardian
is indeed a big shot...

543
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:22,639
in this line of work.

544
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,710
Is he a journalist?

545
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,340
Yes.

546
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:27,539
I like your honesty.

547
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,750
My name is Nam Ji A.

548
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,690
Look at how wonderful this is.

549
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,289
I love this friendly vibe.

550
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,800
Treat him well, okay?

551
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:48,929
Send me the files I've requested.

552
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,369
By the way, have we met before?

553
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,579
I'm not sure.

554
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:13,420
Why can't I hear anything?

555
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:20,659
He may be an intern,
but he's way above us.

556
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:21,730
How could he be...

557
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,030
so handsome like that?

558
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,340
If I get on the president's
good side with this,

559
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,909
I'll become the youngest director!

560
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:46,219
It has finally started to make
its move.

561
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,730
The way to stop this disaster...

562
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,170
Is that child's sacrifice
the only way?

563
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,400
(Intensive regulation period
for the dead)

564
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:11,250
Yes, here we go. Here we go.

565
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:13,780
Honey.

566
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,349
You know today is
our wedding anniversary right?

567
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:18,420
You forgot again?

568
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,860
Do you even love me?

569
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,489
My goodness, darn it.

570
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,460
What time is it?

571
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,699
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

572
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:34,599
Where did you use my credit card?

573
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:39,239
I knew it. It's impossible
for one's nature to change.

574
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:43,809
Honey. Do you know what I got?

575
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,179
Before I answer, do you know
what I have behind my back?

576
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,389
I don't know.

577
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:54,420
My gosh, that hurts.

578
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,630
I told you not
to sneak out of the office.

579
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,599
Wait, I paid a lot
for this hairstyle.

580
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,269
My gosh, what is up with your hair?

581
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,099
Is the Afterlife some nightclub?

582
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:07,769
Why you...

583
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,239
Goodness.

584
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:23,119
I would like to ask you for a favor.

585
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:29,460
I'm going to do whatever it takes...

586
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:33,599
to save both her and me.

587
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,539
What do I have to do?

588
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,639
For starters,
you need to persuade Granny.

589
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:50,380
Persuade that stubborn old woman?

590
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,280
Granny probably knows...

591
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:57,289
the way to get rid of Imoogi.

592
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:01,360
She seemed seriously concerned
when Imoogi woke up.

593
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,960
She would've done something
if she really knew.

594
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,900
Maybe it involves breaking
a sacred rule.

595
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:34,090
(Nam Ji A, Terry)

596
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,150
Is there something
on the back of my head?

597
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,250
- No.
- No.

598
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,449
- What is it?
- Well...

599
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,449
Are you really human?

600
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,159
How could you be so calm
after seeing that?

601
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,960
See what?

602
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,260
- It's nothing.
- Jae Hwan, are you lying to me?

603
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:15,199
No, it's really nothing.

604
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:18,170
If it's nothing, just tell me.
What is it?

605
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,840
Gosh, did you see this
breaking news?

606
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,940
Breaking news?

607
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:24,309
They found a mummy
at a construction site.

608
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,940
A mummy? Not in Egypt,
but in our country?

609
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,610
Terry, let me see that.

610
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:30,849
Thanks.

611
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:35,750
Geumran-gu?

612
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,519
Man, this sounds interesting.
I like it.

613
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,960
Hey, Jae Hwan. Get moving.

614
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,289
- I have an interview in an hour.
- Get me the camera.

615
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,159
- I'll go.
- Okay.

616
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,030
Can I go with you?

617
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,500
Listen carefully, Intern.

618
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:56,940
This is an actual case,
not a field study.

619
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,070
It may just be another reference
for your resume,

620
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,179
but this is our profession.

621
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:03,179
If you get in my way
when I'm working...

622
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:04,280
Fire me.

623
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:07,179
Let me check the camera.

624
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,519
Where did you learn to handle
the camera?

625
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,289
I studied on my own. I don't know
if I'll be useful though.

626
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,099
- Can you shoot?
- Yes.

627
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:21,630
Even a dead body?

628
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,070
- I have to shoot a dead body?
- Yes.

629
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,099
To be honest,
I'm not sure if I can do it.

630
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:28,969
Why?

631
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,110
I don't think the dead
will welcome me.

632
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,679
- What do you mean?
- Regardless of the reason,

633
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,550
if I think of my death
being portrayed through a camera,

634
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,889
I would feel sad.

635
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,090
- You deserve to hold the camera.
- What?

636
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,690
I don't think people...

637
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,630
who merely get curious
in front of a dead body...

638
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,530
deserve to hold the camera.

639
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,869
Then did I pass?

640
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,369
Yes.

641
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:04,670
- Why are you smiling?
- Because I'm happy.

642
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,380
About what?

643
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:07,980
To be with you.

644
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,090
Are you searching for your cat?
The female Russian Blue cat.

645
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,530
Check near the bathroom
in Subyeon Park.

646
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,199
The stray cats in this neighborhood
told me, so I'm positive.

647
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:32,829
You can send the 200 dollars
to my account...

648
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:33,969
Hello?

649
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,039
What the...

650
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,340
Hey.

651
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:42,840
What brings you here, Yu Ri?

652
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:46,550
I wanted to have a drink,
but there's no place that's open.

653
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,090
- A drink?
- You don't have to drink with me.

654
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:53,820
What do you want?

655
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,460
Anastasia was waiting for you.

656
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,929
Stop acting like you know me.

657
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,630
Why are you laughing?

658
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,099
He wants that beef jerky
inside that bag.

659
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,710
Can you see through things or what?

660
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:17,610
I'll get you some beef jerky
for dogs.

661
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:23,820
Oh. Yeon, you're here.

662
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,730
What's up with that punk?
He seems depressed.

663
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:51,349
(Wanted, Lee Rang)

664
00:51:58,690 --> 00:51:59,960
Look who's here.

665
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:01,989
I have something to ask you.

666
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,389
Let me ask you something first.

667
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:08,929
What do you think of me as?

668
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:15,170
- What do you mean?
- Answer me.

669
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,179
The master of the Styx who controls
the borders of life and death.

670
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:22,909
With your clairvoyance power,
you can sit there and...

671
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,110
Wrong.

672
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,519
When was it?

673
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,519
I asked the exact same thing
to Lee Yeon...

674
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:34,090
and he answered me like this.

675
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,360
"I hope you get
rheumatoid arthritis".

676
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,329
Show yourself.

677
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,199
Darn it.

678
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,070
You thought you could fool me
with that sneaky move?

679
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,380
I had to try at least.

680
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,110
You've learned nothing but tricks
from your brother.

681
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,349
Lee Yeon doesn't use disguise.

682
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:00,449
He hates it,
saying it's undignified.

683
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:05,449
Both of your faces annoy me
the same way,

684
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,860
but I'm curious...

685
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,130
why this sinful fox...

686
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,230
came to this dreadful place
on his own.

687
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:18,369
Shall I send you to the Underworld?

688
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,670
Can you cut me some slack today?

689
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,210
I'm already on
the top of the list anyway.

690
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,340
Hey!

691
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,340
You jerks.

692
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,280
Do you think the Underworld
is a Michelin restaurant...

693
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,610
you can just go to and fro?

694
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,409
I'm not afraid of the Underworld.

695
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,380
Of course not.

696
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:37,619
Not if you and your brother
are going hand in hand.

697
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,619
What is it? It's what you wanted
for a long time.

698
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:47,000
You want to slaughter your brother
with your own hands.

699
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,699
As expected, you know everything.

700
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,940
Since it came to this,
I'll be straightforward.

701
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:00,510
I want to break a contract.

702
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,210
Why did you save me?

703
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,050
You should repay me one day.

704
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,480
Give Yeon over to me.
I'll give you two days.

705
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:10,590
I need his body.

706
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:32,110
Long time ago, our deity...

707
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,210
gave you foxes more powers
than humans,

708
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,380
but bounded you to a restriction
you cannot break.

709
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,349
It's because the deity despised
arrogant foxes like you...

710
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:45,690
who kill and trample on humans.

711
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:51,230
I don't care how you talk about me
as long as there is a way.

712
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,699
There is a way.

713
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,570
What is it?

714
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,599
Die.

715
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:05,510
Unless you die,

716
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,579
a fox can't escape
from its contract.

717
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,920
Instead of trying to break
the contract,

718
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,929
try to undo what's been tangled.

719
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,500
- What?
- Mark my words.

720
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:30,500
Every contract allows
both sides to benefit equally.

721
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,480
I'm scared Mr. Lee might die.

722
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:50,349
I don't have any friends or family.

723
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:51,789
I don't have anything.

724
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,420
Of course you do.
You have Anastasia...

725
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,219
and me too...

726
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,599
If it wasn't for Mr. Lee,

727
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:07,599
I would've probably died
at that unlicensed zoo.

728
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:11,309
I couldn't sleep during the day
because kids banged on the glass.

729
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:14,579
At night, the tick bites
kept me up from sleeping.

730
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,849
My fur was coming out in clumps and
I was fed something like dog food.

731
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,050
My keeper even beat me.

732
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,449
What? Where is this zoo?

733
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:25,449
I'll beat up that zookeeper.

734
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,619
How could he beat you up?

735
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,289
Are you drunk?

736
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:33,630
What?

737
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:37,429
- Sorry.
- Why would you be sorry?

738
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,030
I like this other kind of you more.

739
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,440
- Do you?
- Yes.

740
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:45,909
You know, my nickname used to be...

741
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:48,710
- Crazy Fox.
- Really? You?

742
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,610
I lost three of my little sisters
at once due to a trap humans set.

743
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:54,119
I went crazy after that.

744
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,219
Tell me more.

745
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:58,719
From hunters, woodsman,
to even salt sellers,

746
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,090
I just bewitched everyone.

747
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:04,429
Many of them
were frightened to death.

748
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,230
You're worse than me.

749
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,130
My mountain spirit was enraged
and wanted to kill me.

750
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,539
So I escaped and ended up
at Mr. Lee Yeon's forest.

751
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:17,070
- And then what?
- My old mountain spirit...

752
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,610
demanded him to hand me over,

753
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:20,880
and Mr. Lee said one thing.

754
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:22,710
Why are you yelling?

755
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,949
No. Everything that comes into
my forest belongs to me.

756
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:31,150
That's when I was determined...

757
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,619
to become Mr. Lee's.

758
00:57:33,889 --> 00:57:36,090
That's why I learned medicine and...

759
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,230
Do you want to sleep with me?

760
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,730
- What?
- Sleep with me.

761
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:43,530
I really like your ragged past.

762
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,300
There are different stages
to say "I like you".

763
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:51,909
For example,
you could ask me to date you.

764
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:56,849
Perhaps we can say that today
will be our first day as a couple.

765
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,449
Let's skip what's unnecessary.

766
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,119
I've never seen
such a strange corpse in my life.

767
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,719
I couldn't sleep a wink
because I felt uncomfortable.

768
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:12,159
- Is it really a mummy?
- Take a look.

769
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,199
Hey. Don't shoot it.

770
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:18,400
You said you can't identify it
because its fingerprint dried up.

771
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,900
We need details to get reports in.

772
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,739
Did I ever release anything
without the police's consent?

773
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:27,510
Even with the island case
when people went missing...

774
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,980
Okay, fine.

775
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,960
Did all of her blood
get drained out?

776
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,730
She's like a tree
without any sap left.

777
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:50,099
I don't see any external injuries.

778
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:51,969
You said she was found
at a construction site, right?

779
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:53,530
The workers found the body.

780
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,599
There were no signs of effort
trying to bury the body.

781
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,539
They weren't trying to hide it.

782
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:00,980
They were trying to show it.

783
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:03,480
What if it was a natural death
and not a homicide?

784
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,579
The construction had stopped
for a moment.

785
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,380
This person could have died alone
then dried out.

786
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,190
In 2002, they found a natural mummy
in Gyeonggi-do.

787
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,719
I remember.
A woman from the Yoon family.

788
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,860
That woman...

789
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:20,860
was buried below something
as thick as concrete.

790
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,599
Because oxygen could not get in,

791
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:25,570
it was in a vacuum state,
allowing it to avoid decomposition.

792
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,639
That would've been impossible
if a body was exposed...

793
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,510
to room temperature
at a construction site.

794
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:33,469
Do you mean someone turned
this person into a mummy on purpose?

795
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:48,719
What are you looking at?

796
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,730
It looks familiar.

797
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,000
Her nails.

798
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,349
Detective Baek, I need to go.

799
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:17,989
- All of a sudden?
- Please share...

800
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,420
the rest of the documents
through him.

801
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,119
Hey. Ji A!

802
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:56,320
Do you know who
this nail belongs to?

803
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,599
Did you see her too?

804
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:06,400
She's just a hide now.

805
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,039
Isn't it phenomenal?

806
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:14,280
What are you?

807
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:21,150
What do I look like to you?

808
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:33,929
A west capital traitor.

809
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:36,329
But there was a trace of a tattoo
he received as punishment.

810
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,269
"West capital."

811
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:45,110
You took my parents, didn't you?

812
01:02:31,989 --> 01:02:34,289
I made this carnation.

813
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,019
Look at the back.

814
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:44,769
(Ji A, why aren't you coming...)

815
01:02:44,769 --> 01:02:48,070
Ji A, why aren't you coming
to rescue us?

816
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:52,469
Are they alive?

817
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,239
Where are they?

818
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,280
Offer me the mountain spirit
and I'll give you your parents.

819
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:53,699
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

820
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,219
(Ji A, why aren't you coming
to rescue us?)

821
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:17,889
You haven't changed.
You're still arrogant.

822
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:20,130
I bet you think
everyone is below you.

823
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:22,460
At least you are.

824
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,400
I have the urge to trample on you.

825
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,630
Your brother, that woman,

826
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,769
and her parents' lives...

827
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,010
are all in my hands.

828
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,110
But what do you have?

829
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,880
This is a reasonable offer.

830
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:40,480
Yeon, if you give me your body,
I'll spare everyone else.

831
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:17,690
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

832
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:20,489
That woman and her parents' lives...

833
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:22,090
are all in my hands.

834
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:25,630
How can I take that out
of Ji A's body?

835
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:27,090
I'm a bit afraid.

836
01:05:28,829 --> 01:05:29,929
I want to kill.

837
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,699
What am I to you?

838
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:33,699
You must've gotten abandoned
once again.

839
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I want to live.

840
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:37,969
So could you die for me?

841
01:05:38,739 --> 01:05:42,239
I want to end this tedious fight
once and for all.
