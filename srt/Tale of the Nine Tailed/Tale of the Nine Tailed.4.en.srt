(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,429
It's empty.

9
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,990
- What?
- No one's around.

10
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,859
What do you mean?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,969
It's as if the whole village
just evaporated.

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,799
There's not a single person around.

13
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,950
(Eohwa Supermarket)

14
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,849
- What about the washroom?
- It's empty.

15
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,180
- What?
- The body from yesterday...

16
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,250
is gone.

17
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,159
It became a deserted island
overnight.

18
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,530
They weren't dragged by force.

19
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,500
There are no traces of resistance
or hesitation.

20
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,959
Maybe they went on a group tour.

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,629
With a corpse?

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,969
They didn't take
wallets or bags either.

23
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,169
It's just their bodies
that disappeared.

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,639
Where could they have gone?

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
They disappeared?

26
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,650
Yes. 22 households?

27
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,449
All 41 of the residents?

28
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,580
Okay. I'll request for backup.

29
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,349
Call me right away if you see
any dead or injured people.

30
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,490
Okay.

31
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,330
What is it?

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,629
That.

33
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,000
Since when was that there?

34
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:59,620
I hear...

35
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,349
bamboo trees call ghosts.

36
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,620
Is that rumor true?

37
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,020
They're empty inside.

38
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,759
There's no better guesthouse for a
lost and wandering ghost than this.

39
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,800
Doesn't this look like
someone created a path?

40
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,830
It's a Dragon King path.

41
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,969
I've seen it when I shot
a folk festival on Jeju Island.

42
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,870
It's a path that welcomes
the Dragon King, right?

43
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,770
Yes. But the direction is wrong.

44
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,580
Now that I look at it,

45
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,810
it's pointing southwest.

46
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,250
It's a ghost path.

47
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,250
(The path of direction
which ghosts take)

48
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,650
It's the direction
which ghosts take.

49
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,590
At least what they were trying
to welcome with this path...

50
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,129
wasn't the real Dragon King.

51
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,900
I'm Hyuneuiong, the Styx gatekeeper
at the Afterlife Immigration Office.

52
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:51,699
Yes.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,539
Is King Yeomra doing well?

54
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:57,439
I'm calling because we don't have
enough shrouds for the dead.

55
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,080
Can you ship some overnight?

56
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,750
You can? Okay.

57
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,810
Great.

58
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,650
Goodbye, then.

59
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,629
- How did it go?
- What kind of misfortune is this?

60
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,360
Are you sure it's the Imoogi
from back then?

61
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,160
And you don't know where it went?

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,170
Did it use a talisman?
It vanished into thin air.

63
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,370
Shouldn't we tell Yeon?

64
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,009
Don't make a scene.

65
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,970
Yeon should never find out.

66
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,040
- But...
- Shut it.

67
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,110
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,149
Is this why?

69
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,060
Is this why I couldn't see
a hint of Yeon's future?

70
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Excuse me.

71
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,670
Last night, I heard a strange sound.

72
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,069
What kind of sound?

73
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,040
It sounded like a baby was crying.

74
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,410
Go on.

75
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,879
It was past 2am.

76
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,519
I got up to drink some water.

77
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,620
At first, I thought it was a cat.

78
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:21,389
But no. I'm certain
it was a baby crying.

79
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,629
There are no pregnant women
on this island.

80
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,500
All the grandmothers are over 70.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,870
- What time was it again?
- It was 2:40am.

82
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,870
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

83
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:35,709
The clocks had all stopped.

84
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:38,740
Both the one on the wall
and the table.

85
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,379
Mine also stopped at 2:40am.

86
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,149
It's chuksi.

87
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,350
(Chuksi: Between 1am and 3am)

88
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,620
It's when the door
to the other world opens.

89
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,860
What in the world was born
last night?

90
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,079
(Episode 4: The Curse of Death)

91
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,889
- Happy birthday, dear Yu Ri
- Happy birthday, dear Yu Ri

92
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:25,019
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

93
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,290
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

94
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,529
- This is from Dad.
- This is from Mom.

95
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,269
Thank you, Mom and Dad.

96
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,379
- Do you like them?
- Of course.

97
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,310
I'm so happy I could cry.

98
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,279
Yu Ri, when will you get married?

99
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,019
She's still young.

100
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:58,660
- 24 isn't young.
- She's 25.

101
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:05,199
No, I'm pretty sure she's 24.

102
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:07,529
You must have dementia.

103
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,699
Didn't that accident happen
when she was 24?

104
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:14,670
She was a senior in college.

105
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,240
What accident?

106
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,439
Yu Ri was trekking in Nepal.

107
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,350
Then she fell to her death.

108
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,250
How dare you say
such a horrendous thing?

109
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,250
No, I'm pretty sure...

110
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,889
I saw her body.

111
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,230
Dad, didn't I tell you to forget
all those useless memories?

112
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,660
Who... Who are you?

113
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,470
Why are you buying me a phone?

114
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,040
It was my brother
who stole your phone.

115
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,240
I'm doing this out of morality,
not goodwill.

116
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,050
So make sure you abide
by the 48-month contract.

117
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,709
You can pay
the cancellation penalty.

118
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,779
I've downloaded an app,

119
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,720
so don't answer unknown numbers
or my brother's.

120
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,990
I didn't know you were tech-savvy.

121
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,430
It was difficult not to be.

122
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:10,329
What?

123
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:13,500
Around this time last year,
I received a call from the police.

124
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,529
Some scumbag had stolen my identity!

125
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,670
Do you mean voice phishing?

126
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,209
He stole 20,000 dollars from me,
so I ripped both of his ears off.

127
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,279
But that wasn't enough.
I couldn't sleep.

128
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,209
Save yours.

129
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,120
Your number. You told me
not to answer unknown numbers.

130
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,820
Haven't you already robbed enough
of my personal information?

131
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,830
I still need to interview you,

132
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,960
and I'd also like to find out
everything about you.

133
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,769
That's good.
You're quite consistent.

134
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,669
I hear that often.

135
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:54,210
See you later then.

136
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,990
It's me.
The thing you love the most.

137
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,690
What was your wish again?

138
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,320
For my daughter, Yu Ri,
to come back to life.

139
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,990
I've already granted that wish.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,100
Who is she again?

141
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,399
My daughter, Ki Yu Ri.

142
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,340
She's 25 years old,

143
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,669
and she'll inherit
my department store.

144
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,210
Okay. You guys can leave now.

145
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:11,220
Mr. Lee, I've missed you.

146
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,289
Have you met that vet?

147
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,120
- Yes.
- How was he?

148
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,419
He was cuter than I had expected.

149
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,690
He was terrified
when I flashed my gun.

150
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,159
It's yours. He'll come for it
when it's time.

151
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:28,169
And then? Can I kill him?

152
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,230
Yu Ri.

153
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,700
Do you know when Manila clams
are the tastiest?

154
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,940
- I'm not sure.
- It's when the peach flowers bloom.

155
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,039
That's when the shell hardens
and the flesh becomes juicy.

156
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,450
You need patience if you want
good-quality ingredients.

157
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,389
Make sure you do your best
when toying with him.

158
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,019
Yeon cherishes him a lot.

159
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:53,720
Okay.

160
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,830
What? Where are you going?

161
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,029
Yeon is probably desperate
to see me by now.

162
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,029
I should give him a visit.

163
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,139
Why here?

164
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,240
I was curious
why you were always here.

165
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,879
- Let me have some mint chocolate.
- Don't touch it!

166
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,480
It tastes like
chocolate and parsley.

167
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,990
Why do you eat this?

168
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,620
I've put up with your antics,
so tell me.

169
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,929
- Tell what?
- Where did all the islanders go?

170
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,299
Who cares?

171
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,730
It's not like you care
about their well-being either.

172
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,500
I'm pretty sure
one of them wasn't human.

173
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,580
I did hear...

174
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,210
that something fascinating
was in the well in the mountain.

175
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,250
- What is it?
- Why?

176
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,090
Do you think it could be that thing
from the past?

177
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,120
That serpent that separated you
from your woman.

178
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,799
I already killed it myself.

179
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,070
You can't always get what you want.

180
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,669
- What do you mean?
- Who knows?

181
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,409
I can guarantee you
one thing, though.

182
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:19,940
Your woman...

183
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,409
will die early this time as well.

184
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,889
Have you heard
of "The Vanishing Effect"?

185
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:37,029
"Vanishing" means "to disappear".

186
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,360
It's when people disappear
into thin air.

187
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:47,200
A similar case happened
on an island in North Carolina.

188
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,980
In 1590,
all the islanders disappeared.

189
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,149
All household items
and valuables were left behind.

190
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,509
Only the people vanished.

191
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,720
Why are you so twisted?

192
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,220
You were the one who abandoned
the forest due to your grand love.

193
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,029
And 600 years have passed
since then.

194
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,299
And I've spent those years
cursing you.

195
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,539
What do you want me to do?

196
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,480
There's only one way to stop me.

197
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,350
Kill me right now...

198
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,450
with your own hands.

199
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,159
Do it.

200
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,559
Just like that day
when you came hunting me.

201
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,820
Please let me live. Please...

202
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,620
Please spare my life.

203
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Rang.

204
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Yeon.

205
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,179
Is it really you?

206
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,730
How long has it been?
You were alive?

207
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,629
I didn't hear from you since
you left for the Styx,

208
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:54,730
and I thought you were dead.

209
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,470
I missed you.

210
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:00,700
I missed you like crazy, Yeon.

211
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,740
Why didn't you come back for me?

212
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,279
I did.

213
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,309
I did go back...

214
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,649
but I couldn't find you.

215
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,120
I lost you.

216
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,460
After you left,

217
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,029
the people set the mountain on fire.

218
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,659
I wanted to wait for you there,

219
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,100
but it was too hot and scary.

220
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,940
Is that why
you killed everyone like this?

221
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,769
Even all the innocent people?

222
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,710
Staying alive and breathing
is a sin for them.

223
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,480
I just cleared out a whole village.

224
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,350
People got down on his knees
and begged for their lives.

225
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,590
I see.

226
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,960
You couldn't even pass by
an injured puppy before.

227
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:03,500
You've changed so much.

228
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,139
Let's do it together.

229
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:08,409
Let's teach the humans who we are.

230
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,710
Rang.

231
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,509
Yes?

232
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Raise...

233
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,000
Raise your sword.

234
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,210
What are you talking about?

235
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,409
The judges from the Afterlife
have ordered me.

236
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,620
For taking numerous innocent lives,

237
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,759
Lee Rang shall pay...

238
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,529
with his life.

239
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,200
You're a real jerk.

240
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,829
You abandoned me
because of a girl...

241
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,500
and betrayed me
keep up with your record?

242
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:49,069
All you do is pile up your miles
so she can be born again.

243
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,940
I was lucky you didn't
hit a pressure point.

244
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:54,680
If I had died back then,
I would be burning...

245
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,509
in the fiery pits by now.

246
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,519
Why? You can't do it twice?

247
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:05,819
Kill me.

248
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,660
That's how you'll save her.

249
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:17,500
Fine. Rather than living
so recklessly,

250
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,799
dying sooner might be better.

251
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,869
Do it.

252
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:53,269
Why?

253
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,369
Why can't you do it?

254
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,410
Stop acting like an abandoned kid.

255
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,509
You're not a kid anymore.

256
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,319
I can do it.

257
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,490
But do you know why
I'm holding back?

258
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,990
Because I want to see it.

259
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,490
What kind of face you'll wear...

260
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,589
when that girl dies
in front of you again.

261
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,329
No matter how cruel
you pretend to be,

262
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,869
I know this isn't your true self.

263
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,470
What?

264
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,799
See you.

265
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,150
Anyhow, don't let the press
find out for now.

266
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,190
I can just keep quiet,

267
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,359
but what about the families
of the missing people?

268
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,829
There are none.

269
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,430
What?

270
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,400
They have no families
or connections.

271
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,000
- All 41 of them?
- Yes.

272
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:59,240
What's even uncanny is that
they weren't natives on that island.

273
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:01,309
- Then?
- In the 1950s,

274
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:02,740
they moved in altogether.

275
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,710
On the same day, in the same boat.

276
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,789
Do you know how it feels
to live with your boss?

277
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,759
Sin Ju.

278
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,829
Don't you ever get married.

279
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't even have a girlfriend.

280
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,369
To a man, marriage is like
an own goal. Never forget that.

281
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,130
Your wife's brother is King Yeomra,

282
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,039
so it's more like scoring a goal
in injury time.

283
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:33,869
Are you a referee?

284
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,809
Are you the judge of my life?

285
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:40,039
Why are you getting angry at Sin Ju?

286
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,779
You should never
get remarried either.

287
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,849
Live the rest of your life
as a widow.

288
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,119
How could you say that?

289
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,660
If it weren't for King Yeomra,
I would've smacked you.

290
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,390
How did you meet your wife?

291
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,000
It was sort of a crime.

292
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,569
When I was taking a bath
in the valley,

293
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:06,000
my wife secretly spied on me...

294
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,869
She fell for you at first sight?

295
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,710
Correct. I was quite muscular
back then.

296
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,579
Hold on. Then...

297
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,549
did your wife ask you out first?

298
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,380
I was kidnapped that night.

299
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:22,190
She put a sack over my head
and took me away.

300
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,160
- What?
- Then she just said two things.

301
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:28,329
"Do you want to live with me
or go to the Underworld?"

302
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,500
"Do you want to sleep with me
or go to the Underworld?"

303
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,670
So I slept with her.

304
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,900
You punk!

305
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:44,069
How dare you forget your place.
and kill a human?

306
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,980
That shaman?

307
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,609
She looked fine, but she was
literally about to die anyway.

308
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,250
Regardless,
she was not on the register.

309
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,619
It was a clear emergency.

310
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,019
Your punishment has been decided
already. What were you thinking?

311
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:58,920
I'll gladly accept
any kind of punishment.

312
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:02,430
So stop worrying about me
so obviously.

313
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,200
Is it because of that girl?

314
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,970
Did you really find her?

315
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:18,609
But...

316
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,079
she didn't have the fox marble
I gave her.

317
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,349
It's the wrong person then.

318
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,619
But she looks too alike.

319
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,390
That face.

320
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,859
I'll protect you.

321
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,990
That voice.

322
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:34,390
It's scorching.

323
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,829
Even his scales that were all over
Ah Eum's body until she died.

324
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:39,299
I advise you to stop.

325
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,700
- What do you mean?
- A human and fox cannot be tied.

326
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,569
Your obsession will bring
a huge disaster.

327
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,240
To you and that girl
who has been reborn.

328
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:57,279
I'm not asking for much.

329
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,150
Then?

330
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,720
Even if we live
for thousands of years,

331
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,220
everyone has their own golden days.

332
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,230
A time that was especially radiant,
and a time you especially loved.

333
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,230
You liked the 1980s the most.

334
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:17,230
You started to have a hobby.

335
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,740
("The Phantom Lover",
"Teenage Dreamers")

336
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,440
When Leslie Cheung died,

337
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:27,309
you drank makgeolli
for four days and nights.

338
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:30,609
So what?

339
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,150
That time was everything for me.

340
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,359
Those short years of when
she was alive.

341
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,170
Even if she is born again,

342
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,539
she's already not the same person
you used to know.

343
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:53,599
It doesn't matter.

344
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,170
I just...

345
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,509
want to watch her age
as she goes through...

346
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,250
all the experiences in life
just like everyone else.

347
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,150
There's something I must do
in order to make that happen.

348
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,569
- Yes?
- What are you doing?

349
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,470
I'm just about to eat.

350
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,099
- Did your food come out?
- Yes. Why?

351
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,369
Just return it right away.

352
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,509
What are you trying to do?

353
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:32,240
I'm saying you should eat with me.

354
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,480
Granny, let me go have a meal.

355
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,549
Hey!

356
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,119
Do our laws look like a joke to you?

357
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,220
I didn't even get
a sip of water today.

358
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,190
This will be your last
extenuating circumstance.

359
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,660
Come back before midnight.

360
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:54,200
Right. Did you see anyone suspicious
leave that island?

361
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,500
Do you think my clairvoyance power
is your dashcam?

362
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,170
I knew you'd say that.
You never tell me anything.

363
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,029
- You're here.
- Yes.

364
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:33,000
- Come in.
- Okay.

365
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,670
- What about the door? Okay.
- You should close it.

366
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:37,839
Yes, I should.

367
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,619
- Don't tell me...
- Yes, I made it.

368
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:49,349
You can just assume
that I'm good at everything.

369
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:51,150
But you're bad at something
really important.

370
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,890
Being modest doesn't get food
on your table like this.

371
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,329
By the way, what's behind you?

372
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,000
- It looks like a bouquet.
- It's not.

373
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,700
You should proudly hand it in.

374
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,109
You got me a mugwort bouquet.

375
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,480
I have to return the favor
if I eat for free.

376
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,609
I'm too lazy to do that.

377
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,180
How is it? Do you like it?

378
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,750
I'll sit on this side.

379
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,490
You're reacting like a robot.

380
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,059
It's a really authentic item
as a housewarming gift.

381
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,329
Should I put it in a vase or eat it?

382
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,230
Mugwort was the first plant
to grow on land...

383
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,470
that was burned down to the ground
by nuclear explosions.

384
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,700
Isn't it just like you?

385
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,539
It's just my taste.

386
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,579
- What are you doing?
- Animals like it when they're pat.

387
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,559
Our shaggy dog loves it
whenever I pet him like this.

388
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:10,829
There.

389
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,049
It's delicious.

390
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,950
Have two bowls.

391
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,359
Why did you suddenly change
your attitude?

392
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:35,130
You know,

393
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,529
people usually feed the other person
to say thank you.

394
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,599
You saved me twice,
and I could only think of...

395
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:46,069
making this simple meal
to pay you back.

396
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,380
It's special enough.

397
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:57,279
At least it is to me today.

398
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,099
("A Professor and Doctor Couple
Goes Missing at Yeou Gogae")

399
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,779
I guess you didn't move.

400
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,849
It's mostly the case with people
who have missing family members.

401
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,509
They have a hard time moving.

402
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,089
It's a way of telling the missing
to remember their way home...

403
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,319
and that family is waiting
for them here.

404
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,660
You must have been lonely
in this big place by yourself.

405
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,059
Why are you laughing?

406
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:48,029
Because I don't dare cry.

407
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,599
When you said I must've been lonely,

408
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,569
I also asked myself
the same question.

409
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,640
I guess I was.

410
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,710
They look like good people.

411
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,819
I guess so.

412
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,849
I wish they had been mean to me.

413
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,390
If so, I wonder if I would've gotten
over everything...

414
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:15,859
and lived like everyone else.

415
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,220
When I do this, my tears go back in.

416
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,890
It's like a spell I figured out
after losing my parents at nine.

417
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,400
You'll be able to find your parents.

418
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,240
I'll make sure that happens.

419
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,039
So go ahead and live
the life you want.

420
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:11,250
Live that boring and warm life...

421
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,650
like everyone else.

422
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,700
About the first love
you talked about...

423
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,769
Dream on.

424
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,640
My first love was as gentle
as a lotus flower.

425
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,170
Fine. I'm a weed.

426
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,539
I'm like a mugwort plant
that survives through radiation!

427
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,009
You grew up well for a weed.

428
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:58,190
I must thank you
for what you did on Eohwa Island.

429
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,299
It was nothing.

430
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,269
It was you who saved me
when I was about to die...

431
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,339
after being cut by Yeon.

432
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,690
I'd say that was fate.

433
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,259
What about the child?
Is the child doing well?

434
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,329
It is asleep.

435
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,099
You amaze me.

436
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,569
How could you serve it
for 600 years?

437
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:40,700
Because I'm human.

438
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,470
I'm an ordinary person
who struggles to avoid death...

439
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,640
although I can only live about
100 years at the most.

440
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:53,180
I haven't seen many happy endings of
people who extended their lives...

441
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,690
by borrowing the power of our world.

442
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,420
What do you plan to do now?

443
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:04,059
I'll feed and let the child sleep
as I wait for it to grow up.

444
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,529
I'll look forward to it.

445
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,630
When the hero finally finds
his lover and falls in love,

446
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,140
the tragedy of the past
will be reenacted.

447
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,740
A funeral hall?

448
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,279
- Do you have to go?
- What is it?

449
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,849
It's bad timing for you to go
to such a place.

450
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,519
What do you mean?

451
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,819
Why do you think your ancestors...

452
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:34,519
showered and threw salt
after visiting a funeral?

453
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:36,930
All kinds of ghosts show up.

454
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:40,930
Thank you for worrying about me,
but I have to go.

455
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,569
You already saw what it's like
in our world.

456
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,970
So? Do you think an evil spirit
will get stuck on me?

457
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,640
Whatever it is, if you can see it,
it means they can see you too.

458
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,109
Also, I won't be in Seoul
for a few days.

459
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,210
Are you going on a trip?

460
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,319
Well. It's something like that.

461
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,720
- So...
- I won't avoid it.

462
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,819
Even more so if that's the world
I'll be living in.

463
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:13,359
Wait here.

464
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,829
What?

465
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,710
Here.

466
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,839
That pocket has the same number
of adzuki beans as your age.

467
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,680
Keep it with you at all times.

468
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,849
Is it like a talisman?

469
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,950
It's old school. But you'll be safe
for a day or two since I made it.

470
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,950
Thanks.

471
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,259
I'll go now. Have a good trip.

472
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:40,690
Okay.

473
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:53,670
I can't seem to leave without her.

474
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:59,680
Will she be okay on her own?

475
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,789
What's your favorite movie?

476
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,730
"Toy Story 3". Why?

477
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,170
(- What's your favorite movie?
- "Toy Story 3". Why?)

478
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,469
I just want to know you
a bit better.

479
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,750
Bye.

480
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,750
Where are the beans?

481
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,719
Here.

482
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,139
You wench.

483
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:08,739
I thought you weren't coming.

484
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,809
I heard you didn't cry once.

485
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,920
You're so coldhearted.

486
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,559
I'm sorry I'm late.

487
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,199
My mom said...

488
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,730
getting a shroud on a leap year
would make one live longer.

489
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,639
She kept asking me to come with her
to a hanbok store.

490
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,670
I kept postponing it
and never got to do it.

491
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,710
Every time she called,

492
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,349
I hung up first,
saying that I was too busy.

493
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,719
Last week,

494
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:52,289
she had made dongchimi,
my favorite.

495
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,929
But I slept in
and ended up not going.

496
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,699
You were a bad daughter.

497
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,230
Right?

498
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,230
Yes.

499
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,309
Her dongchimi is very delicious,

500
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,039
but I won't get to have it anymore.

501
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,579
Cry as much as you want.

502
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:23,150
If you keep it in,
it'll only burden you.

503
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,289
So where am I going?

504
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,000
I prefer somewhere warm.

505
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:36,170
I get cold easily
because of old age.

506
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:37,869
I said, I get cold easily.

507
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,269
This is from the judges.

508
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:48,139
"Former mountain spirit
of Baekdudaegan, Lee Yeon,"

509
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,780
"have killed a human."

510
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,280
"According to Article 24
of the Criminal Law,"

511
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,949
"he deserves to be sent
to the First Underworld."

512
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,989
"However, taking into consideration
of the lives he has saved,"

513
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:00,460
"he will be put on probation
for a week."

514
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,030
Hold on. A week? That's too long.

515
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,659
"However, he will spend
that week..."

516
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,070
"as a human being..."

517
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,570
"and undergo
all four pains of human life."

518
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:15,809
What the...

519
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,929
("Ki Yu Ri Becomes the New Director
of Moze Department Store")

520
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,929
"Ki Yu Ri"?

521
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,619
You're the one
who stole my necklace.

522
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,190
- Hi.
- How did you know to come here?

523
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,460
I thought you'd come for it,
but you didn't.

524
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,719
That's because you had a gun.

525
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,760
Don't worry.

526
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,230
I'm not armed today.

527
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
What do you want?

528
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,269
Let's play.

529
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,610
How is she feeling?

530
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,380
I made her bawl,
so she now feels dizzy.

531
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,159
- Make sure she eats this.
- I will.

532
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,059
This is some tasty yukgaejang.

533
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,230
Why are you here?

534
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:51,800
Don't overreact and just sit down.

535
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,500
Just so you know, I paid
more condolence money than you.

536
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,469
Sit down...

537
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,780
if you don't want her
to meet her mom's fate as well.

538
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:16,960
What do you want?

539
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,989
How's it going with Yeon?

540
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:21,730
It's going great,

541
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:25,670
seeing how his one and only brother
visits me all the time.

542
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,369
Aren't you afraid of me?

543
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,039
I am. I heard that men
with inferiority complexes...

544
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,139
are like ticking bombs.

545
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:37,449
You learned correctly.

546
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,320
Why do you despise your brother
so much?

547
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,889
Well... I guess I'm just bored.

548
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,150
You're lying.

549
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,059
It's because you liked him before.

550
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,230
That's why.

551
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,980
It's true. You were smuggled
from Russia.

552
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,119
What are you doing?

553
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,519
I'm a vet.

554
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,320
I've seen that scar...

555
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,320
on some zoo animals.

556
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,960
You were abused by humans,
weren't you?

557
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,500
Don't look at me that way.
It annoys me.

558
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me either.

559
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,400
I won't give back the necklace
no matter what.

560
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,000
It's precious to me.

561
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,769
That's why I took it.

562
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,980
Who is it? Who's making you
do these things?

563
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,880
Once you retrieve your necklace,

564
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:44,949
I'll tell you.

565
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,730
There was a mountain spirit
who abandoned his own mountain.

566
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:00,429
Then the humans who had come
day and night...

567
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:02,159
to ask him for favors...

568
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,199
determined to kill off all foxes
by setting the mountain on fire.

569
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,809
Every living being
went up in flames.

570
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,480
The puppy I considered my family...

571
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,949
became a lump of charcoal.

572
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,949
Was this all because...

573
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,820
of his first love?

574
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,119
Yeon thinks
you're her reincarnation.

575
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,789
That's why he killed the shaman,
knowing what kind of punishment...

576
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,699
he'd get.

577
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Punishment?

578
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:38,469
Where is he right now?

579
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,340
I'm sure you won't be able
to reach him by phone.

580
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:51,510
(The Snowy Prison)

581
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,849
Where is he?

582
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,090
That's none of your business.

583
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,860
If you want to live,
you better stay awake tonight.

584
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,139
Why is Room Six...

585
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,010
so crowded at this hour?

586
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,079
They all seem like kids.

587
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,650
You tend to be so nosy.

588
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:44,690
The time in the Underworld
passes slower than this world.

589
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,599
One day in reality
equals to seven years in here.

590
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,400
You shall not eat...

591
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,570
or sleep...

592
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:58,539
or...

593
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,679
die.

594
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,789
("A Better Tomorrow")

595
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,659
That time was everything for me.

596
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,329
Those short years of when
she was alive.

597
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,460
I'll gladly accept
any kind of punishment.

598
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,800
I just want to watch her age
as she goes through...

599
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:27,440
all the experiences in life
just like everyone else.

600
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,110
You fool.

601
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,929
The phone is turned off.
You will be directed to voicemail.

602
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:58,070
Please leave a message
after the beep.

603
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,630
Is it a blackout?

604
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,280
Hi.

605
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:22,050
You must be sisters.

606
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:24,989
How old are you?

607
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,889
What are you doing here?

608
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,929
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

609
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:34,000
- Did you see our dad?
- Did you see our dad?

610
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,500
You don't know where your dad is?

611
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,530
Which room is it?

612
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,409
Shall I find him for you?

613
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,019
Let's go.

614
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,420
Wait.

615
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:01,889
Why are you wearing
unmatched shoes?

616
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,760
Ms. Nam!

617
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,559
Yes.

618
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:13,170
She cleared the rice cakes.

619
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:14,739
Good job.

620
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,000
Ms. Kim told us to go home.

621
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,570
She needs to get some rest too.

622
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:20,380
Oh, really? Hold on.

623
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,610
Wait, where did the kids go?

624
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,050
- Kids?
- Yes.

625
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:29,789
They were here just now.

626
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,150
They probably went to their parents.
Let's go.

627
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,219
Okay.

628
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,460
Are you going to take a cab?
I'll drop you off.

629
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,730
It's okay. I'm totally exhausted,

630
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:47,639
but my mom told me to get
some gum from the supermarket.

631
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:49,039
I guess it's meant
to get rid of any demons.

632
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,840
She believes in bad luck?

633
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,780
She's so superstitious
yet she goes to church.

634
00:47:57,579 --> 00:47:59,780
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodnight.

635
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,400
When did this...

636
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,909
Ms. Nam! Ms. Nam!

637
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:07,750
She lost the bean pocket I gave her.

638
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,820
Is it Rang? Or...

639
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,260
Granny. Granny!

640
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,929
I have something to say.

641
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,130
I know you can hear me.

642
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,369
Let me loose.

643
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,199
Granny!

644
00:49:27,739 --> 00:49:29,239
Let me loose!

645
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:32,969
Come on, let me loose now!

646
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,679
Come on, let me loose!

647
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:39,750
Darn it. Come on, please!

648
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,489
What's all the fuss?

649
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:53,199
Granny, I have to get out of here.
Let me loose.

650
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,400
Shut your mouth!
Do you know where you are?

651
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,800
I'll go there.
The Underworld of Knives.

652
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,869
I was headed there anyway
if my sentence wasn't reduced.

653
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,869
Then I can leave
by the end of the night.

654
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,980
Or you may never leave at all...

655
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,309
in that body.

656
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:17,489
It doesn't matter.

657
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:46,150
Hey. Are you okay?

658
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:48,150
Yes.

659
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,289
What happened?

660
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,460
You collapsed
in front of the funeral hall.

661
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,559
- It's so cold.
- Are you cold?

662
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:10,010
Did something happen back there?

663
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,210
I saw two young girls.

664
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,250
Twice.

665
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,809
What did they look like?

666
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,750
They were sisters.

667
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,190
They had pretty dresses on...

668
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,090
and unmatching shoes.

669
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,860
Aren't they ghosts?

670
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:31,059
- What?
- When ghosts pretend to be human,

671
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,530
they do certain things
the other way.

672
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:37,500
- You don't even believe in ghosts.
- Hold on.

673
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,940
("The Secrets of Asian Mysteries")

674
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,780
I did some research.

675
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:52,150
The funeral hall used to be
a graveyard of young children.

676
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,050
A graveyard of young children?

677
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,150
Isn't that where
they temporarily buried children?

678
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:00,760
Yes. They plowed the land
and built a funeral hall there.

679
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:04,590
- But Jae Hwan...
- Yes?

680
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,329
Why have you been...

681
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
holding that book upside down?

682
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:27,849
She saw us.

683
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:59,349
(The Underworld of Knives)

684
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:23,199
Cross the bridge.

685
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:24,969
Once you take a step,

686
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,010
you won't be able to return
midway through.

687
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:33,050
Will I be able to do it...

688
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,619
in my current human body?

689
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,139
Whatever it is, if you can see it,
it means they can see you too.

690
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,639
That pocket has the same number
of adzuki beans as your age.

691
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:00,679
Keep it with you at all times.

692
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:13,050
Lee Yeon.

693
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:06,139
Granny, I'll be back.

694
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:16,579
The criminal will cross
the Underworld of Knives!

695
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:24,389
My phone.

696
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,239
Who's there?

697
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,349
Two.

698
00:56:58,219 --> 00:56:59,219
Three.

699
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,360
Four.

700
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:05,760
Five.

701
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,400
What do you want from me?

702
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:30,250
- Hang yourself. I want this body.
- Hang yourself. I want this body.

703
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:32,889
- Hang yourself. I want this body.
- Hang yourself. I want this body.

704
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:36,159
- Hang yourself. I want this body.
- Hang yourself. I want this body.

705
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,090
- Hang yourself. I want this body.
- Hang yourself. I want this body.

706
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,599
- Hang yourself. I want this body.
- Hang yourself. I want this body.

707
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,230
- Hang yourself. I want this body.
- Hang yourself. I want this body.

708
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,789
- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

709
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,159
- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

710
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:09,159
- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

711
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:11,900
- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

712
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:29,050
Thank you, Yeon.

713
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:33,019
The 9-year-old and 30-year-old me...

714
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:34,920
both survived thanks to you.

715
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,559
You know,

716
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:43,460
I'm not much of a fighter
nor can I start a storm,

717
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:48,199
but one day I'll make sure
to protect you.

718
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,639
I promised...

719
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:52,469
that I'd...

720
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:54,940
protect you.

721
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,809
Your woman
will die early this time as well.

722
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:04,849
It doesn't matter anymore...

723
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:07,519
whether that woman...

724
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,429
is the one
I've been looking for or not.

725
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:15,059
But there's one thing
I know for sure.

726
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:19,800
It's that her death...

727
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:23,800
will pierce deeper into my flesh...

728
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,539
than these blades cutting me now.

729
01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:33,309
I just want to know you
a bit better.

730
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:35,949
So you'd better not die.

731
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:39,349
Please stay alive.

732
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,460
Stay alive until I get there.
Please.

733
01:03:44,829 --> 01:03:46,230
I had nightmares often.

734
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,829
And every time I woke up,
there was no one by my side.

735
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,800
I was used to that.

736
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:54,539
However...

737
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:57,539
So go ahead and live
the life you want.

738
01:03:57,969 --> 01:03:59,210
I'll make sure that happens.

739
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:01,980
Why am I waiting for you?

740
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,710
Lee Yeon.

741
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,099
- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

742
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,800
- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

743
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,599
- Give us your body.
- Give us your body.

744
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:35,400
Please don't die.

745
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:40,909
Don't die...

746
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:43,309
because of me.

747
01:06:12,739 --> 01:06:13,809
I found you.

748
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,079
Be born again.

749
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:25,920
I'll make sure to find you.

750
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:24,750
I...

751
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,750
I was waiting for you as well.

752
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:29,279
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

753
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,550
I was his loyal right hand
ever since he ruled Baekdudaegan.

754
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:39,890
I'm also his housekeeper.

755
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:43,119
What kind of person
was your first love?

756
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:47,729
At times, knowledge could harm you.

757
01:08:49,529 --> 01:08:50,729
I'm looking for someone.

758
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:56,699
I can't forget the way
you look at me and the pain.
