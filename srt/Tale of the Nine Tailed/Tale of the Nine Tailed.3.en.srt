Don't be a baby.

10
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,200
Your hand feels too hot.

11
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,969
It's scorching.

12
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,480
It's been a while, Lee Yeon.

13
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:22,750
I'm thirsty.

(12 hours ago)

15
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,209
Water.

16

Water.

17
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,879
I'm thirsty.

18
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:58,859
Water...

19
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,859
Water.

(Episode 3:
The Secret of the Dragon King)

21
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,030
Is it because he works at sea?
Somehow he died because of water.

22
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:09,930
Do you mean he drowned?

23
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:11,800
In that toilet?

24
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,870
I told you,
I took him out with my own hands.

25
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,599
Just look at how round
his stomach is.

26
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,669
He was drinking water all day.

27
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,210
Could you call the police right now
and have this bathroom closed up?

28
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,349
Human life is so useless.

29
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,650
He lived so hard for nothing.

30
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,889
What do you mean?

31
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:37,460
When that fishing boat called Eunha
flipped over,

32
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,120
he was on it.

33
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,189
Was he on the same boat
as Pyung Hee's father?

34
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,729
Yes, there were four on that boat
including Mr. Seo.

35
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,669
Is this the police?

36
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,409
It must've been
a really special night.

37
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,039
- What?
- It smells fishy.

38
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,509
What's fishy?

39
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,479
That guy smells like rotten fish.

40
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,120
But his body hasn't started
to decompose yet.

41
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,430
Hair?

42
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,170
But he has white hair.

43
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,040
The smell of the ocean and...

44
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,939
this somehow smells faintly
like the blankets from that house.

45
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,149
"That house"?
Do you mean Pyung Hee's house?

("The Missing Crewmen of Eunha
Return Miraculously After 28 Days")

- Look at this.
- What?

48
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,500
The man in there is that man.

49
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,500
There were four crewmen on Eunha,
which sunk.

50
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,199
Three returned alive,

51
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:34,740
- while one of them...
- Returned as a skull.

52
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,439
Please let me see my dad!

53
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,509
Dad!

54
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,050
It looks like this won't end
with just that man.

55
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,050
Are you saying
someone else might die?

56
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,389
We shouldn't stand here like this.

57
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,389
Why not?

58
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,730
We have to stop it.

59
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,629
- I don't want to.
- What?

60
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,230
It's too much of a bother.
It has nothing to do with me.

61
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,160
Also, I don't like how they look.

62
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,230
Come on.

63
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,100
I care about how people look.

Jin Sik.

67
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,959
It's me.

68
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:31,600
Mr. Seo?

69
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,269
Is that you, Mr. Seo?

70
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,000
Jin Sik.

71
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,569
Jin Sik.

72
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,670
I'm so hungry. I'm hungry.

73
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,810
(Third survivor from
the Eunha boat sinking incident)

74

I'm hungry.

75
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,980
I'm hungry.

76
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,339
Who's there?

77
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:03,120
- Who are you?
- Don't act like we're strangers.

78
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,889
Look at how messy this place is.

79
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,430
I heard you were with
the head that day.

80
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,889
Get out of my house. Get lost!

81
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,399
I only leave when I want to.

82
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:13,899
You scumbag.

83
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,899
How dare you come here?

84
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,470
Answer my questions properly.

85
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,110
If not, I'll break your fingers
one by one.

86
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,509
- What did you do on the boat?
- It hurts.

87
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,550
The waves hit the side of our boat.

88
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,679
The forecast was wrong.

89
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,120
But why did only three of you
come back?

90
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,360
Mr. Seo got swept away
by the waves.

91
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,889
The rest of us
were just floating at sea.

92
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:42,659
- And then?
- I don't remember the rest.

93
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,259
I'm telling the truth!

94
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,570
When I had opened my eyes,
I was back on land!

95
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,799
Okay, say bye to your pinky.

96
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,600
Wait.

97
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,740
You were scared, weren't you?

98
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,480
You were on that flimsy lifeboat
without water or food for 28 days.

99
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,580
It's the perfect condition
for someone to go insane.

100
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,789
The scorching sun burned your skin.

101
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:09,750
Due to seasickness,

102
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:11,590
you were nauseous
on an empty stomach.

103
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,490
You could no longer wait
to be rescued.

104
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,990
You were enraged.

105
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,500
"Why me? Why?"

106
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,600
Shut it!

107
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,830
On the fifth day,
you suffered the most...

108
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,870
because it hadn't rained at all.

109
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,169
You probably showed signs
of dehydration first.

110
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,440
Please help us.

111
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,360
Are you crazy?

112
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,159
Do you want to die?

113
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,659
We're all going to die.

114
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,570
I don't want to die.

115
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,940
I don't want to die.

116
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,009
I'm thirsty.

117
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,509
Pyung Hee must be worried.

118
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,080
Pyung Hee...

119
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,889
I'm thirsty.

120
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,259
I'm hungry.

121
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,299
I'm hungry.

122
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,159
I'm hungry.

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,169
It's strange.

124
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,269
Despite starving for 28 days,
you didn't lose very much weight.

125
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,340
I highly doubt that you ordered food
out in the open sea.

126
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,480
- What did you eat?
- Stop it!

127
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:47,250
It... It wasn't me.

128
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,889
No. It wasn't me.

129
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,190
You see,

130
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:00,460
I refuse to die here.

131
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,870
What's wrong with you?

132
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't do this!

133
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,669
I won't die here!

134
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,779
No. It wasn't me.

135
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,320
I was hungry.

136
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,019
I almost went crazy.

137
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,159
There's meat.

138
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:32,700
There's meat. Meat...

139
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,830
There's meat.

140
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,110
Give me my meat.

141
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,080
Meat. My meat.

142
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:49,779
Give me my...

143
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,659
Sir. Wake up.

144
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,399
Sir.

145
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:11,370
Hair?

146
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,110
He's dead.

147
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,090
(Seo Pyung Hee,
Seo Ki Chang's daughter)

148
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,190
Dad...

149
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,700
Dad...

150
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,539
Stop crying.
Your wish has been granted.

151
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,279
There's only one more left.

152
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,419
But what will you give me in return?

153
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,500
Who in the world is messing
with the register?

154
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,740
Honey! What did you say?

155
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,169
What's wrong?

156
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,809
It happened again.

157
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:27,210
(Warning, Kim Gil Sang)

158
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,480
Oh, dear. It's another error.

159
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:32,549
Another person died
when he wasn't even on the register!

160
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,649
Don't be all hysterical, honey.

161
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,350
"Hysterical"?

162
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,220
No. I meant "stressed".

163
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:43,590
I got the words mixed up.

164
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,029
You're definitely stressed
from all the work.

165
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,970
What were you doing
while I was working?

166
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:57,269
- Were you watching a drama?
- No.

167
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,440
I was watering the Uiryeong Tree.

168
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,450
You were watering
a single tree for three hours?

169
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,850
Honey, my laziness shouldn't be
an issue right now...

170
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,220
when the register is acting up.

171
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,690
Let me make a new list
of regional death statistics.

172
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,620
It won't take long.

173
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,889
Right.

174
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,870
What kind of misfortune
is approaching?

175
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,529
I've come across...

176
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,330
numerous traditional drawings
while working.

177
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,000
But I've never seen one that
gave me the creeps like this one.

178
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,169
What is that?

179
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,409
This one is missing something.

180
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,990
(The Dragon King Spirit)

181
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,860
You startled me.

182
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,289
Oh, I'm sorry.

183
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:25,330
How could you possibly eat
right now?

184
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,429
Why not? This is my favorite.

185
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,870
Two people have died.

186
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,269
So?

187
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:33,870
Can you respond
with a bit more common sense?

188
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,570
Do you know how many people
from the Joseon Dynasty...

189
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,879
have lost their lives
in just 50 years...

190
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,940
due to the Japanese colonization
and the Qing invasion?

191
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,179
3.5 million.

192
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,649
I've seen more funerals...

193
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,220
than all the funeral service
companies put together.

194
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,019
Even so,
I'm sure there must've been...

195
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:50,590
at least one death
that pulled at your heartstrings.

196
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:17,820
Look at this.

197
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,690
That house also had this drawing.

198
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,419
This is the portrait
of the Dragon King, right?

199
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:27,490
Yes, but it doesn't look like him.

200
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,029
- You've seen him?
- Yes, when I was a mountain spirit.

201
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,429
I guess you can say
that we took a lecture together.

202
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,899
This drawing glamorizes him.
He's not this handsome.

203
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,370
But you see, this drawing looks
different from the others I've seen.

204
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,480
Look. This is the normal one.

205
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,149
Do you see the difference?

206
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:52,279
Are we playing hidden pictures
or what?

207
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:02,460
It doesn't have any feet.

208
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:04,599
Feet?

209
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,460
You're right.

210
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,069
What's a dragon with no feet?

211
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,269
This is a snake, not a dragon.

212
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,539
Imoogi.

213
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,849
Are you Lee Rang?

214
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,190
I have been waiting for you.

215
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,619
It's really asleep in here?

216
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:07,660
Yes. The spirit of immorality.

217
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,259
The king of the unjust.

218
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,529
It's Lee Ryong.

219
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,630
My goodness.

220
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,700
You sounded so cringy right now.

221
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,470
If you put all sorts of titles
in front of his name,

222
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,069
does it change who he really is?

223
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,309
I heard he fought with Lee Yeon
a long time ago and died.

224
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,740
With that human woman.

225
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,750
Before he entered that woman's body,

226
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,579
he left a piece of his body
to my family,

227
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,819
who were descendants of
female shamans.

228
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,220
I guess he was extra careful.

229
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,990
He's the opposite from me.

230
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,829
Anyhow, did you prepare everything?

231
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,000
A woman born on
the Year of the Sheep,

232
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,200
a human offering,

233
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,630
- and...
- Leave Lee Yeon up to me.

234
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,900
Go to the graves and bring
an evening primrose...

235
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,299
that has fed on the blood and flesh
of the dead.

236
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,339
Let me ask you something.

237
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,650
Aren't you brothers with Lee Yeon?

238
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,319
We are.

239
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,660
A half brother, to be exact.

240
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,859
If he wakes up,

241
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,500
Lee Yeon won't be able to live.

242
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,329
- So?
- Why are you...

243
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,170
helping your brother's enemy?

244
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,839
Come over here.

245
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,250
- What is it?
- Pack up and leave this place.

246
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,119
Leave this darned island
as soon as possible.

247
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,450
What?

248
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,579
I have a bad feeling.

249
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,289
What do you mean?

250
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,920
I mean, this is the perfect place
to die.

251
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:49,960
I thought you didn't come
to save lives.

252
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:51,630
Why are you leaving me out?

253
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,130
Well... It's none of your business.

254
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,640
I can't go home if I don't know why.

255
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,039
So go find the person
you came here for.

256
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,440
I need to know why my parents
came to this island.

257
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,380
Why am I helping my brother's enemy?

258
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,190
It's good to know you don't trust
your partner 100 percent.

259
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,390
It's not that...

260
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,390
Have you seen Lee Yeon
when he was a mountain spirit?

261
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,160
I only heard stories.

262
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,500
Tell me about them.

263
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,769
Out of the four mountain spirits
who ruled the land,

264
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,369
he was the most ruthless.

265
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:36,269
No one dared covet his forest,

266
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,839
so the Baekdudaegan
was always peaceful.

267
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,210
It's true he was a mountain spirit,
but my brother...

268
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,119
didn't care for others at all.

269
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:49,819
However,

270
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,190
even when we shared an apple,

271
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,289
he always gave me the bigger piece.

272
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:00,160
I still remember the sweet taste
of that apple.

273
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,569
Then why?

274
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:05,599
With that kind hand
that he used to give me the apple,

275
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,039
he slashed open my stomach.

276
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,910
The betrayal I felt in my heart
was incomparable to this wound.

277
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,579
- Is that why...
- I'm a fox, after all.

278
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,650
I need to repay him properly.

279
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,450
I will go to the netherworld...

280
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,319
with Lee Yeon.

281
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,109
Ms. Nam, I came to the library
like you asked me.

282
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:52,819
What do I have to find? A body?

283
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,849
So do you mean a dismembered body?

284
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,619
Set Ohwa Island as the keyword,
and search for any incidents.

285
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,660
Call me right away
if you find something.

286
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,960
What are you looking for?

287
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,230
What the elders said to me
keeps bothering me.

288
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,930
You must never tell anyone
that we told you this.

289
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,630
This wasn't the first time.

290
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,700
I'm talking about human heads.

291
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,539
Granny.

292
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,549
By any chance, did you hear
anything about him?

293
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:23,910
Who's him?

294
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,480
Imoogi.

295
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,390
Didn't you...

296
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,390
kill him with your own hands?

297
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,660
- I did.
- Then why?

298
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,259
It's just, I was just curious.

299
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:43,299
If Ah Eum is reborn into this world,

300
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,039
I can't let something like him
live with her.

301
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:48,339
How romantic of you.

302
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,269
- How can I not know if...
- Okay, bye.

303
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,779
That arrogant punk.

304
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,500
- Pyung Hee.
- You're back.

305
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,029
What are you reading?

306
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,380
Why?

307
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,609
You're not Pyung Hee, are you?

308
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,519
How did you...

309
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,529
It's the perfect place to
do some reading.

310
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,630
By the way, I see that you're alone.

311
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,170
He's nearby.

312
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,640
He isn't.

313
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:55,609
I can smell him from miles away.

314
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,109
By the way, I see that you're alone.

315
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,319
He's nearby.

316
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,019
He isn't.

317
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,690
I can smell him from miles away.

318
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,930
It's you. The one who killed
the fishermen.

319
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,529
How could you accuse me?
Do you have proof?

320
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,869
That book.

321
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,769
This? I have quite a classic taste
for books.

322
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,279
"Moby Dick" is a novel
based on a true story.

323
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,049
About a whaling boat
that was shipwrecked...

324
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,109
in the 19th century.

325
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,480
What happened to that boat?

326
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,380
They ate and were eaten
by each other.

327
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,019
Just like Pyung Hee's father.

328
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,789
My goodness. You scared me.

329
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,130
Look at this.

330
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,230
It's in here too.

331
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,170
What are you doing?

332
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,940
I ask the questions.

333
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,940
What do you think you're doing?

334
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,339
I said, I ask the questions.

335
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,880
If you answer wrong,
you'll never be able to fish again.

336
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,519
What is this drawing?

337
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,359
But if I did do it,
there has to be a motive.

338
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,660
What is it? Serving justice?

339
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,630
I was doubtful until just now,
but now I know.

340
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,269
I guess you can consider the death
of the fishermen as fireworks.

341
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:35,240
"Fireworks"?

342
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,670
You want to distract us
with a noisy incident...

343
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,339
and cover our eyes and ears.

344
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,049
- Why would I?
- Probably...

345
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:45,319
in order to hide your real purpose
for coming to this island.

346
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,660
That's impressive. Man,
you are quite smart for a human.

347
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,230
Since you answered correctly,

348
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,630
you deserve a prize.

349
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,400
Are you searching for your parents?

350
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,230
- Give it back.
- Why?

351
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,769
You saw them in your dreams.

352
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,210
How do you know...

353
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,710
Just ask.

354
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,279
Who knows?

355
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,809
I may know the answer.

356
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:22,190
Can you really find them?

357
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:25,759
Yes. Shall I grant you...

358
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:27,859
that wish?

359
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,299
I asked what this drawing is.

360
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,140
It's... The Dragon King.

361
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,240
We asked him to calm
the wind and waves...

362
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
and bring bountiful fish.

363
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,049
We even held festivals
and prayed for rain.

364
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:51,579
- You're lying.
- It's tradition...

365
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,680
to pray to the deities
when you live near the sea!

366
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,750
- Off with the hand then.
- I mean it!

367
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,559
Where did you get this?

368
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,430
An old lady in town
bought it from a market on land...

369
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,930
and handed them out to everyone.

370
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,099
Ask anyone from the village.

371
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,680
Forget everything you just saw.

372
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,019
- How much is this?
- Gosh, when did you come in?

373
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,420
It's a dollar.

374
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:34,519
By the way, how many people
came from the broadcasting station?

375
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,059
A good-looking man
from out of town came in earlier...

376
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,960
and asked about Pyung Hee's house.

377
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,430
A man?

378
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,640
All you have to say is one thing.

379
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,940
Just say yes.

380
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,559
I'll decline.

381
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:09,660
Why?

382
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,400
I hear a fox always returns
one's favor.

383
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,029
In other words,

384
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,799
if I ask for your favor,
it won't be free either.

385
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,000
You're so stiff.

386
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:20,539
Are you going to act like this
between us?

387
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:23,039
Let me give you some advice
since it's between us.

388
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,009
Don't play games by betting on
someone's misfortune.

389
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,880
People call someone like you...

390
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,779
a darned bully.

391
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,720
I hate anything vulgar.

392
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,829
If you dare call me that again,
I'll just kill you.

393
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:45,130
Why me? Why do you keep on
circling around me?

394
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,259
I won't speak to you.

395
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,140
But I'll give you some advice too.

396
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,609
Don't trust Lee Yeon too much.

397
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:58,440
What do you mean?

398
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,279
Once he finds what he wants,
you'll get to see the fiery pit.

399
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,240
He left.

400
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:31,539
It looks like your limbs
are still intact.

401
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,609
What did Rang say?

402
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,349
He said he might be able
to find my parents for me.

403
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:39,680
So?

404
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,690
I'm not the type to get
two flavors of fried chicken.

405
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,420
I always get just one.

406
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,190
What are you saying?

407
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,759
I declined his offer.

408
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,930
I placed my bet on this fox.

409
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,000
You're indeed an educated woman.

410
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,509
Is that all?

411
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,210
Don't trust Lee Yeon too much.

412
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,480
That's all.

413
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,009
I'm hungry.

414
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,180
Why don't you pack up and leave?

415
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:15,690
- What?
- I'm talking about your brother.

416
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,119
I think he's preparing
a special event for you.

417
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,319
That's what I'm waiting for.

418
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,109
Gosh.

419
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,049
That's a new face, isn't it?

420
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:48,950
She's not a native fox.

421
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,519
- Then what?
- She's probably from abroad.

422
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:57,789
Is it because she's from abroad?
She's good-looking.

423
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,430
How much would
everything she has on her cost?

424
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,230
Whose name
is their reservation under?

425
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,240
"Ki Yu Ri"? She's the director
of Moze Department Store.

426
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:11,269
You can tell she's not
a self-made woman.

427
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,079
Maybe she won the lottery.

428
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,849
If a fox has money and power,
it's one or the other.

429
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,250
Someone who's from a rich family
like Lee Yeon,

430
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,950
or someone who stole a human's life
by breaking the taboo.

431
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,150
The food is good, right?

432
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,640
Sitting here like this
makes it feel like...

433
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,680
this morning's incidents
were a dream.

434
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,109
Wouldn't it be nice to live
a dull and boring life like this?

435
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:53,349
Then you should move here.

436
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:57,289
It's you who must miss nature.

437
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,859
Not really. There aren't
any department stores here.

438
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,289
Also, I can't give up on americanos
and mint chocolate ice cream.

439
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:06,099
What kind of fox are you?

440
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,400
We all live the same way.

441
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:11,970
Just because the old ladies here
are wearing floral-print pants...

442
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,740
doesn't mean they'll have
flower-like personalities.

443
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,509
When you dig into it,

444
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:17,769
you'll find the spiteful
and nasty years they've lived.

445
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:22,579
Is it the same for you?

446
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,250
I'm just curious.
What kind of print...

447
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,349
did you live in all those years?

448
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,789
What about you?

449
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,390
What made you wait so long
for your parents?

450
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,960
It's simple.

451
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,369
Because I miss my mom and dad.

452
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,210
Same for me.

453
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,380
I'm waiting for someone I miss.

454
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,349
Your first love? Is it a human...

455
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:02,920
or a fox?

456
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,390
You look like you're regretting it,
so why did you part ways?

457
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,000
You're not going to tell me,
are you?

458
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,099
That first love had to be a human
of all things, and she died.

459
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,309
That's why I foolishly still can't
give up on her. Happy?

460
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:27,140
You said you're waiting.

461
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,579
Do you mean you're waiting
for a dead person?

462
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:37,750
She promised...

463
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,819
to be born again.

464
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,359
Clean up mine too.

465
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,090
That room is for staff only.

466
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:17,030
Gosh, my mistake.

467
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,829
I don't think it was a mistake.

468
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,469
I don't look poor enough
to commit petty theft, do I?

469
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,940
Shall we introduce each other...

470
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,840
since we're the same species?

471
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,710
I'm Yu Ri.

472
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,239
To be clear,
we're not the same species.

473
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,679
What are you? Russian?

474
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,880
- You have a good eye.
- How did you get into Korea?

475
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,349
- Did you...
- You're right. I smuggled in.

476
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:49,789
Have you ever been on a nine-hour
flight in between Makarov pistols?

477
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:54,230
I wanted to shoot the broker
the moment I landed.

478
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,570
It must've been tough.

479
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,670
Exactly. So if someone judges me,
saying I don't look like...

480
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,099
a self-made woman,

481
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,369
how upsetting
would that make me feel?

482
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,510
I just... Well...

483
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:11,579
It's something I need to confirm.

484
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:15,420
Are you curious to learn about
how I succeeded?

485
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,719
- Yes.
- There isn't much to it.

486
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,019
Come here. Come on.

487
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm sweet like this,

488
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:30,630
but also brutal like this.

489
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,980
Thank you for your hospitality.

490
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:53,090
- How could you let her take that?
- I'm ruined.

491
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:57,230
Without the necklace,
I can't understand the animals.

492
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,059
You went around saying you're
a skilled vet, and now look at you.

493
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,800
What? The thief was attractive?

494
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:06,869
Do you know what's the most
pathetic thing one can do?

495
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,639
Be blinded by a woman.

496
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:13,309
But you ruined your life because
you were blinded by a woman too.

497
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:14,539
What did you say?

498
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,809
By the way, what should I do?

499
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,449
What do you mean? You said you know
who she is. Go barge in.

500
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,750
I can't.

501
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,349
She has a gun.

502
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,920
Don't you have any pride as a fox?
Who cares about a gun?

503
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,929
You know I was traumatized
when a hunter...

504
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:30,429
shot off my tail a long time ago.

505
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,159
Hurry up and come back.

506
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,829
Stop whining and go get it back.

507
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,380
Why did that branch break?

508
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,389
It must've hurt.

509
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,610
Eat and grow well.

510
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,650
The wind is blowing from northwest.

511
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,519
Something's approaching.

512
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:07,860
Hey, Jae Hwan.

513
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:11,630
There were other similar cases?
Who were the victims?

514
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,829
There were four Jane Does.

515
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,030
When did they happen?

516
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,269
The first incident happened in 1954,

517
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,539
on August 13.

518
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,869
1954...

519
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:23,840
Since the Korean War ended.

520
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,010
Something evil entered the island
when there was a storm.

521
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,449
Tell me the dates
in chronological order.

522
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,409
August 25, 1961.

523
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,849
September 6, 1979.

524
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,420
September 7, 1987.

525
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,650
The time gaps may be big,

526
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:40,360
but aren't these obviously
a serial killing?

527
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,190
- What were the days?
- In order,

528
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:45,760
they were Friday, Friday,
Thursday, and Monday.

529
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:47,159
It has nothing to do with the days.

530
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,769
From August to September...

531
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,070
Hold on.

532
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:57,909
(Lunar calendar: July 15, 1961)

533
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:59,239
1979.

534
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,210
(Lunar calendar: July 15, 1979)

535
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,980
1987.

536
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,179
(Lunar calendar: July 15, 1987)

537
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,880
Lunar calendar.

538
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,750
They were all July 15
on the lunar calendar.

539
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,150
If my calculation is correct,
they all occurred on the same date.

540
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,760
What?

541
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,090
And today is the same lunar date.

542
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,989
Ms. Nam, leave that ominous island
right now!

543
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,300
What in the world happened
on this island?

544
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,670
Excuse me.

545
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,980
Weren't you on the same boat
with Pyung Hee's father?

546
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,480
Two of the survivors
have passed away.

547
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:40,820
You're in danger.

548
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,889
Sir!

549
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,190
Please listen!

550
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,960
Wait up!

551
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,360
Why are you running away from me?

552
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,269
Get away from me, you ghost!

553
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,690
Don't kill him!

554
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,440
It's not that bad.

555
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,289
- What is this?
- It's a home remedy.

556
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,559
It's burning.

557
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:00,460
Don't be a baby.

558
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,230
Your hand feels too hot.

559
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:04,130
It's scorching.

560
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,840
What?

561
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,480
What is that?

562
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:29,860
It's been a while, Lee Yeon.

563
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,130
Who are you?

564
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,000
It's me.
The person you've been waiting for.

565
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,300
What?

566
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,269
By the way,

567
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,340
why did you...

568
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,809
kill me?

569
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,559
Who are you?

570
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,429
You should've just let me go.

571
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,760
Answer me.

572
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,170
Our ill-fated relationship
would've ended there...

573
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,800
had you not stopped the boat...

574
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,070
that was crossing the Styx.

575
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:27,750
You're wrong.

576
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:31,750
That woman will reincarnate
with a marking that only I know.

577
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,329
And you don't have it.

578
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,400
You truly are...

579
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,869
ignorant, Lee Yeon.

580
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,090
It's hot.

581
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,030
What have you done to me?

582
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,929
It burned.

583
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,670
The scar disappeared.

584
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:20,769
Who are you?

585
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,670
What are you talking about?

586
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:24,309
Answer me.

587
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,510
- What's gotten into you?
- Who are you?

588
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,079
It's me, Ji A.

589
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,019
Do you not remember?

590
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:41,860
You just...

591
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,300
Aren't we a bit too old
to be playing catch?

592
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:53,340
We've drifted apart too much
to do such a thing.

593
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,739
That was actually a dead ball.

594
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,610
The photo.

595
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:21,900
Get out of here.

596
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,269
What is this? Are you guys dating?

597
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:27,539
Go on.

598
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,820
Hurry!

599
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:09,809
- Move aside.
- No, play with me.

600
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,710
This is domestic violence.

601
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,079
They say that a rebellious kid
needs a good beating.

602
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,480
I failed to do that,
so you've grown into a dog,

603
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,519
not a fox.

604
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,420
And who was the one
who kicked him out...

605
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,219
and treated him like a stray dog?

606
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:24,190
I think I'll be getting my brother
a muzzle for this Christmas.

607
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,309
Where's my phone?

608
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,179
Who is it?

609
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,280
You're new.

610
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:21,849
I'm from a broadcasting station
in Seoul.

611
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,849
Do you live here?

612
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:26,559
I do.

613
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:30,230
Which way leads to the village?

614
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,960
The shortcut is that way.

615
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,329
Thank you.

616
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:37,570
By the way,

617
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,539
how long have you been living here?

618
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:46,480
Quite a long time. Much longer...

619
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,809
than you think.

620
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,679
Then perhaps...

621
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:52,349
Have you ever seen them before?

622
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,780
This photo was taken here
a long time ago.

623
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:03,389
Wasn't this woman pregnant?

624
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,130
Yes. Do you remember?

625
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,500
Did you talk to them too?

626
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,369
Why did they come to this island?

627
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:18,809
Have some before it goes cold.

628
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:24,980
Okay.

629
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:37,630
I think she said the baby
inside her was upside down...

630
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,099
or the umbilical cord
was wrapped around its neck.

631
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,400
Anyhow, she came to pray
to the Dragon King...

632
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,400
for a safe delivery.

633
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,599
"The Dragon King"?

634
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:51,170
He was so powerful that our island
was the only place...

635
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,309
that withstood the typhoon.

636
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,010
We used to hold
big ancestral rites back then too.

637
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,780
Was it a type of ritual
for bountiful fish?

638
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,019
You know quite a lot for your age.

639
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:05,690
When was the ancestral rite?

640
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:08,219
Mid July.

641
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:10,659
Mid July?

642
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:12,489
("Dismembered Body Found
on Remote Island!")

643
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:16,099
So it's the 15th of July
on the lunar calendar.

644
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:20,940
And you prepared
the ancestral rites yourself?

645
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:25,340
I noticed just this house
has a five-colored flag...

646
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,280
on this island.

647
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,309
(A flag that represents life, death,
illness, wealth, and ancestors.)

648
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:33,519
That means the homeowner
is a shaman.

649
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:36,789
I make a living with my keen eyes.

650
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:38,690
By the way, ma'am.

651
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:42,519
The pregnant lady in this photo
is a doctor.

652
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,730
She would've gone to a hospital
instead of the mountains...

653
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,130
if her baby was sick.

654
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:51,199
Sit down. I'll explain slowly.

655
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,739
Explain it to the police.

656
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:58,369
You won't be able to...

657
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,280
leave this place anyway.

658
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,280
The tea? I didn't drink it.

659
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:12,219
I don't drink anything
a stranger offers.

660
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:21,099
What's wrong with me?

661
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:34,010
It wasn't the tea...

662
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:37,909
but the scent.

663
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,400
Are you laughing?

664
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,510
I've stalled plenty of time.

665
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:09,409
You still don't get it?

666
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,210
Why that girl came to this island?

667
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,079
- What?
- She'll be an offering.

668
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,050
You don't have much time.

669
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:21,619
For your information,
she won't answer her phone.

670
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:29,159
Why is it?

671
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:32,630
Her smell is completely gone.

672
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,269
The sun will set soon.

673
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,070
Hang in there a little longer.

674
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,989
Your mother came willingly...

675
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,690
to this island, just like you.

676
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:32,630
She said after she got pregnant,

677
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:36,670
she had the same dream every night.

678
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,969
You tricked your own mother...

679
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,980
while you were inside her womb.

680
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,829
I am a mountain spirit...

681
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,500
and owner of
the mountains and streams.

682
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,599
Remove this darkness
and lead me to that woman!

683
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:30,690
I guess it's been too long.
I lost my touch.

684
00:53:39,789 --> 00:53:40,960
Let's go.

685
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,789
It's useless.

686
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:19,090
You were behind it.

687
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,900
The dead female bodies
found on this island.

688
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:27,869
They were all precious sacrifices.

689
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,440
Sacrifice, my foot.

690
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:33,809
Lady, that's just murder.

691
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:38,849
Become an offering.

692
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,519
You are a very special child.

693
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,530
I have waited so long for this.

694
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,340
Die! You must die!

695
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,349
No!

696
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:38,269
Die! You must die. Die!

697
00:55:39,409 --> 00:55:40,539
Stop!

698
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,110
Lee Yeon.

699
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,750
Don't touch her.

700
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,519
I will rip you apart.

701
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:52,090
This has nothing to do with you,
previous owner of the mountains.

702
00:55:52,489 --> 00:55:54,090
Just keep going your way.

703
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:56,929
You're nothing but a living corpse.

704
00:55:58,389 --> 00:55:59,429
Who gave you...

705
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:01,800
the life you don't deserve?

706
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:05,670
I'm asking you, who is it you serve?

707
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:09,369
You can't stop me anyway.

708
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:12,309
We're surrounded
by evening primroses.

709
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:35,630
Die!

710
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:45,440
Die.

711
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:52,769
Return to the earth.

712
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,460
How dare he?

713
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:16,630
What's the matter, honey?

714
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:21,000
Yeon killed a human.

715
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,349
Can you walk?

716
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,650
Yes. Just lend me an arm.

717
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:30,639
Who was that woman earlier?

718
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,769
Just a human.

719
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:35,380
An ordinary woman who was
desperate to live longer.

720
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,380
I really wanted to punch her.

721
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:42,420
Are you still talking big?
You just almost died.

722
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,489
But I didn't.

723
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,460
Mr. Lee, I understand
you were in an emergency,

724
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:22,260
but how are you going to handle
the backlash?

725
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,190
Shut your mouth. Just hang up
if you're going to scold me.

726
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,360
I guess I'll take
whatever punishment I get.

727
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,599
That's why I told you not to get
involved with human females.

728
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,900
This woman knows about
Ah Eum's previous life.

729
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,610
What? She does?

730
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:40,539
I don't know who she is,
but I intend on watching her.

731
01:00:41,409 --> 01:00:44,179
Your love story is super famous
in our world.

732
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,150
I bet your brother pulled a trick.

733
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,349
Our fruit corner will have
a closing sale now.

734
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:49,820
The special price is only for today.

735
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,449
This price is valid just for today.

736
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:53,219
Where are you right now?
Are you at a grocery store?

737
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,389
(Limited quantity, special sale)

738
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:00,030
I was gloomy about
what happened earlier.

739
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,360
This place is like paradise for me.

740
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,030
Did you take my credit card again?

741
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:07,900
Hello? Mr. Lee? I can't hear you.
Hello? Mr. Lee?

742
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,570
Is this organic?

743
01:01:18,349 --> 01:01:19,409
Are you drinking?

744
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,780
I'm a human, so I can't go to bed
sober on a night like this.

745
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:24,750
You should have a drink too.

746
01:01:29,059 --> 01:01:31,929
I stopped myself because I didn't
want to sound old-fashioned,

747
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,059
but you shouldn't speak
so casually to me.

748
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:35,500
Do you know how old I am?

749
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:38,670
Once you pass 60,
you're all grandpas.

750
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,340
Go ahead and talk casually.

751
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,309
Why do you keep on saving me?

752
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,349
You wouldn't bat an eye
even when 3.5 million people died,

753
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,250
so why?

754
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,900
Is there something...

755
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,769
you're looking for in me?

756
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:28,519
There's so much
I feel uncomfortable about,

757
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,280
but I'll skip all of it for today.

758
01:02:31,219 --> 01:02:32,489
Let me just say one thing.

759
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,719
Thank you, Yeon.

760
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:40,860
The 9-year-old me
and the 30-year-old me...

761
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,699
both survived thanks to you.

762
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,099
You know,

763
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:51,809
I'm not much of a fighter
nor can I start a storm,

764
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,539
but one day I'll make sure
to protect you.

765
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,219
I'll protect you.

766
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,239
Hey. Can you do something like...

767
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:27,909
multiplying this bottle of soju
into a crate full of them?

768
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,849
Like the miracle of the five loaves
and two fish?

769
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:35,550
I'm not Jesus.
Just drink what you have.

770
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,909
Are you going to take
the first boat out?

771
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,250
You're limping.

772
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:17,489
Did you avenge your father
by giving up a leg?

773
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,989
How did you...

774
01:05:19,989 --> 01:05:22,019
Your life may have been
luckily spared,

775
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,860
but don't ever curse
another soul again.

776
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:28,760
It'll come back to you.

777
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:35,599
It's empty.

778
01:05:36,469 --> 01:05:38,210
- What?
- No one's around.

779
01:05:38,369 --> 01:05:39,469
What do you mean?

780
01:05:39,809 --> 01:05:43,179
It's as if the whole village
just evaporated.

781
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,380
There's not a single person around.

782
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:00,550
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

783
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:04,590
Spirit Room.
A room where the evil spirits enter.

784
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:08,000
How dare you? Why did you do this?

785
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:11,000
Why do you despise your brother
so much?

786
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,969
If you want to live,

787
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:15,570
stay awake tonight.

788
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,340
What do you want from me?

789
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,349
Your woman will die early
this time as well.

790
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,650
The Netherworld
of the Mountain of Knives.

791
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,150
I can leave by the end of the night.

792
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,380
Or you may never leave at all.
