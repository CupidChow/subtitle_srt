9
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,650
Let me ask you one thing.

10
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,859
Why did you decide...

11
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,760
to join hands with me?

12
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,659
Perhaps, it's the same reason
as yours.

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,010
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:42,909
I can only live if you die.

15
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,109
I'll end everything with my hands.

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,079
Don't do this. If you do this...

17
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,180
Goodbye.

18
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,730
Ji A warned you...

19
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,200
not to harm her.

20
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,700
What? You're not...

21
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,800
Ji A.

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,469
How could you fail to recognize
your own owner?

23
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,110
You vermin.

24
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,710
I saved your life,
and this is how you repay me?

25
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,780
A vermin?

26
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,680
If it wasn't
for the ground cherries,

27
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,509
I wouldn't have served you.

28
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,449
To be frank, you disgust me.

29
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,719
You have an inferiority complex...

30
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,889
since you're neither a deity
nor a human.

31
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,759
You talk too much.

32
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,460
You've lived for too long.

33
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,430
Go to the underworld.

34
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:42,270
Your family must be waiting for you.

35
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,740
- Father!
- When was it?

36
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:52,409
There was a time when I had wanted
to sacrifice myself for someone.

37
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,949
Father, where have you been?

38
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,780
- What did you buy?
- My children,

39
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,650
- my wife, and my mother.
- Father.

40
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,490
I can't even remember
their faces anymore.

41
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,930
Darn it.

42
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:22,710
Did you see that?

43
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,650
This is strange.

44
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,689
Those who had filled up my glass
up until now...

45
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:37,259
had always begged for more time.

46
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,919
They had wanted to live...

47
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:43,330
an extra day or year.

48
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,400
Having no friends
isn't something to brag about.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,599
I don't trust anyone.

50
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,270
Rather, I don't think anyone
believes you.

51
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,770
I just have no one to protect.

52
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,939
And that is why
I'm stronger than you.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,580
I'm stronger than you...

54
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,949
because I have someone to protect.

55
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,050
Is that so?

56
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,789
There seems to be an incident
where Ji A is.

57
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,129
My other half has woken up again.

58
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,360
What?

59
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,230
Sit back down.

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,730
If you leave before I finish this,

61
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,300
our deal is over.

62
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,139
This is my only chance
to drag him to Styx.

63
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,009
Should I let go of this opportunity
and go to Ji A? Or...

64
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,879
Don't worry.

65
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,379
He only appears
when he feels threatened.

66
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,250
Or when he sees blood.

67
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,120
He has a strong instinct
to protect himself.

68
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,060
Everything will be okay.

69
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,990
At least for Ji A.

70
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,800
This is exactly why
you and I are different.

71
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,970
I beg to differ.
You also have someone...

72
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,970
whom you need to protect
at all costs.

73
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,279
What about the Imoogi
inside Ji A?

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Rumor has it that
you'll become worthless...

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,980
if he dies.

76
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,720
I acknowledge the fact
that you were being smart.

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,589
But why did you have to
cause this mess by hiding...

78
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,990
such a precious part of you
in my woman's body?

79
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,560
You have one of my scales.

80
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,100
- And you want it back?
- Will you do that?

81
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,529
- Only if you give Ji A back.
- That granny comes first.

82
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,180
Don't come near me!

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,790
Don't...

84
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:52,860
But I have.

85
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,689
Now, what are you going to do?

86
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:55,860
Are you going to kill me?

87
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:59,129
If you do, Ji A will die as well.

88
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,240
- Do you want to give it a try?
- Do you think...

89
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:06,639
I wouldn't shoot you?

90
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,439
As you already know,
you must end me at once.

91
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,009
If not, it'll be my turn.

92
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,949
All right. I'll count to three.

93
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,019
Make your decision.

94
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,050
- One.
- Do you guys think...

95
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,290
it was a coincidence
the three of us met?

96
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,589
I believe it was destined.

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,230
- Two.
- The one who's targeting me...

98
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,959
might be closer than we think.

99
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,060
Just like how you protected me
in our previous lives,

100
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,800
I want to do the same for you
this time around.

101
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,199
Three.

102
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,339
Darn it. I knew it.

103
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,209
Nam Ji A!

104
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,709
Wake up, you wench.

105
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,149
Why are your hands bloody?

106
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,019
You've ruined my clothes.

107
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,029
Sae Rom?

108
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,060
Yes, it's me.
Do you finally recognize us?

109
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,509
Jae Hwan.

110
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:18,939
I'm okay.

111
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,649
I wasn't hurt.

112
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,560
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,060
I truly am.

114
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,259
It's okay. All of us are unharmed.
It's all right.

115
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,370
You're okay.

116
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,300
What should I do?

117
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,970
- What should I do?
- It's okay.

118
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,579
How will you catch the granny?

119
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,279
How much do you know about her?

120
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,649
I know that one blink of her eye...

121
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:58,379
could easily turn a mountain spirit
into a rock.

122
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,149
And those very eyes of hers
are clairvoyant.

123
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,790
About that power...

124
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,430
How much can she see?

125
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,689
For example, can she see my face?

126
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,660
It's not a CCTV camera.

127
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,670
She can only sense
the flow of this world.

128
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,839
For example, she may not know
what we're exactly talking about,

129
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,069
but she can sense
that we're together right now.

130
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,110
So she doesn't know the details.

131
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,379
We have a chance of winning
if we can block her eyes.

132
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,720
But how?

133
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,360
You wanted to put me to sleep
using this, didn't you?

134
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,000
Rang only put his lips on this,
and it was quite effective.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,769
Would she drink this?

136
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,299
She could...

137
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,639
if we received help
from the only person she trusts.

138
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,970
Who's that?

139
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,879
Hyuneuiong.

140
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,649
Hyuneuiong is extremely obedient
to his wife.

141
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,950
Not anymore.

142
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,860
He proved that
by going against her will...

143
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,620
and saving Ji A.

144
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,230
So he'll put her to sleep
before we arrive?

145
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,840
Once she falls asleep,

146
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,570
you can get rid of her.

147
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,409
- When's the D-day?
- Tomorrow.

148
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,240
Be there by noon.

149
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,509
Once it's all over,

150
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,120
you'll be the owner of Styx
as I've promised.

151
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,090
And you'll no longer appear
in front of Ji A or me.

152
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,220
Sounds good.

153
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,029
Am I just worrying for no reason?

154
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,000
This is unraveling much easier
than I thought.

155
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,639
No. He took the bait.

156
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,480
I just need to take him
to the Styx...

157
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:10,350
Didn't they have a son?

158
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,320
How do you know that?

159
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,990
Just... I just do.

160
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,629
How do you think this will end?

161
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,769
It will be a happy ending for sure.

162
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,570
My president came to see me.

163
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,200
He had the same disease as Ms. Kim.

164
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,940
He said he could live
if he killed me.

165
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,779
Where is he?

166
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,750
He's dead.

167
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,379
I shot him.

168
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,120
I turned into Imoogi and...

169
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,289
He defied his fate
and lived for hundreds of years.

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,200
Even if you didn't shoot him,
he would've died today anyway.

171
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,330
I almost killed Jae Hwan too.

172
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,169
I barely came back to my senses.

173
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,950
It's okay, you held out well.

174
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,419
I'm so scared.

175
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,250
We're almost there.

176
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,129
This will all end tomorrow.

177
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,570
Don't you have to pee?

178
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,299
I don't pee often.

179
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:48,370
Why are you being so shy
when you're lying down...

180
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,370
in the middle of my restaurant?

181
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:56,549
Why are you being so nice to me?

182
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,220
You even closed the restaurant
because of me.

183
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,090
I'm sure my kindness will be
repaid one day.

184
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,220
Did you say you lost your husband
a long time ago?

185
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,929
What kind of person
was your husband?

186
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,629
He was the type of man
who always picked out the bones...

187
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,970
of fish for me when we used to eat.

188
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,470
Oh, on one cold winter,

189
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,009
I said I was craving
honey rice cake,

190
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:28,850
so he walked through the
snowy weather to buy them for me.

191
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,950
He could've just used
a delivery app.

192
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,049
Wasn't that a bit too much
in the snowy weather?

193
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,019
By the way,

194
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,460
why do you keep coming to see me?

195
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,029
Whenever I eat your food,

196
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,230
I keep feeling...

197
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,000
a tickling sensation in my heart.

198
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:52,639
It's a very familiar feeling...

199
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,070
that I've missed.

200
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,409
How many died because of Imoogi
overnight?

201
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,250
903?

202
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,519
Dispatch your emergency personnel...

203
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,649
and tell them to try holding out
for the night.

204
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,570
Honey!

205
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,519
When your eyes feel dry,

206
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,659
when you feel angry,

207
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:47,120
when you have a stomachache!

208
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,799
Is something bothering you?

209
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,269
Her medication for her joints...

210
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,769
will fall short soon.

211
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,539
Whatever! I don't care.

212
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,980
You should go back.

213
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,779
I'm sure you've made a point by now.

214
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,019
- No way.
- You'll regret it.

215
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,120
I do regret it.

216
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,049
Why did I think I could change her?

217
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,190
Why didn't I leave
when we lost our child?

218
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:22,559
- That's because you loved her...
- I did love her.

219
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,629
I thought it was love.

220
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,899
From our personalities to our
tastes, we had nothing in common.

221
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,740
We never even shared
a bowl of tteokbokki.

222
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,340
I always ate the mild taste,
while she enjoyed the spicy taste.

223
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,470
Why didn't you order a medium taste
and share?

224
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,179
Isn't that how couples get along?

225
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,809
We were just too different.

226
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,019
So? Are you just going to sit there
doing nothing?

227
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,649
Lee Yeon might even die...

228
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,220
instead of that young lady.

229
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:56,059
If it wasn't that, there's no way
my wife would've let her live.

230
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:58,830
- You should stop her.
- If I could've stopped her,

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,100
things wouldn't have gotten
out of hand in the first place.

232
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,730
Still, we can't...

233
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,139
lose Lee Yeon like this.

234
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,809
(Lee Yeon)

235
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,220
Yes, what?

236
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,590
We need to meet.

237
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,090
Tell me over the phone.
I'm prepared to hear it.

238
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,629
It's too hard to explain
over the phone.

239
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,029
I just met Imoogi.

240
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:36,370
Really?

241
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay.

242
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,870
What's with his voice?

243
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,539
Is she dead or alive?

244
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,529
What do you mean?

245
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,630
Why would you eat his scale?

246
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:10,200
If I eat that scale,
the Imoogi inside Ji A...

247
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,569
will come over to my body.

248
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,809
- And after that?
- I will take him...

249
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,480
and jump into the Styx.

250
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:24,210
No. Never.

251
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:30,650
There must be another way
besides that.

252
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,589
Right now,

253
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,690
besides Ji A,
the lives of countless people...

254
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,930
dying from a plague lie in my hands.

255
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,569
I thought of
every single possibility,

256
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,839
and this is the only way
to catch him.

257
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,109
I'll do it then.

258
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,950
I'll eat his scale
and jump into the Styx.

259
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,720
You can't handle Imoogi.

260
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,990
Don't do it.

261
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,130
Please don't. You can't even find
your soul if you die like that.

262
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,200
You won't be able to reincarnate.

263
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,500
- I know.
- If you know, can you please...

264
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:16,529
stop saying you will die?

265
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,339
Sin Ju.

266
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:36,619
You...

267
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,359
must understand me.

268
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,759
That's why I'm telling you this
honestly.

269
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,970
You're so mean.

270
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,109
Mr. Lee, you're so mean.

271
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,819
What brings you here?

272
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,930
I got your present.

273
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,430
- Present?
- You sent the president to see me.

274
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,230
If you knew,
why didn't you tell Lee Yeon?

275
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,829
I would've done the same.

276
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,670
If I were you, I would've already
told Lee Yeon.

277
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,940
I didn't, and I'm not intending on
telling him either.

278
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:31,539
Why?

279
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,809
Since Lee Yeon cares for you.

280
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,119
Since he'll be sad if he loses you.

281
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:45,890
Do you know what it means
for Lee Yeon...

282
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,230
to join hands with Imoogi?

283
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:49,829
What does it mean?

284
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:51,960
He's intending on saving you
and dying.

285
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,430
He'll die...

286
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,670
because of you.

287
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,410
Lee Yeon is thinking of saving me
and dying?

288
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,839
Isn't it obvious?

289
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,210
That being said...

290
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:11,349
Tell me one reason why
I shouldn't kill you...

291
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,349
right now.

292
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,589
If it's your wish, I won't stop you.

293
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,990
But I wouldn't recommend it.

294
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,289
You'll get hurt or die.

295
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,400
Someone else tested me earlier.

296
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,140
I'll be straightforward with you.

297
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,210
I have no intention of dying.

298
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,210
At least, not yet.

299
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,740
Not yet?

300
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,450
If I hurt Lee Yeon,

301
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:49,819
I'm thinking of dying.

302
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,359
So if I fail,

303
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,990
you can kill me.

304
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,529
Since Lee Yeon won't be able
to do it.

305
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,069
Are you serious?

306
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,799
It turns out we have a common goal.

307
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,839
To protect Lee Yeon.

308
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,009
If you want to save your brother,
it's time for a truce.

309
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,450
Okay?

310
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,059
I'm in.

311
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,569
What should I do?

312
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,470
Don't get involved in this fight.

313
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,579
I want you to stay safe
and survive...

314
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,779
so you could protect Ji A for me.

315
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,079
Watch over her...

316
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:55,190
in my place.

317
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,720
I'll protect her.

318
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,630
No.

319
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,329
If she gets heartbroken
and becomes crooked,

320
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,140
I want you to nag at her...

321
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,140
to live her life properly.

322
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,109
I'll nag at her a lot.

323
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,910
Make the necklace thief your family.

324
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:28,549
Here. I'm giving you
your wedding gift in advance.

325
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,990
It's a new apartment unit.

326
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,589
I know you had a hard time...

327
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:36,059
being around someone
ill-tempered like me.

328
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:39,829
Mr. Lee.

329
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,930
I won't say...

330
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,470
thank you or sorry.

331
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:50,740
I fed you, clothed you,
and put a roof above your head.

332
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,009
Mr. Lee.

333
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,109
Can I ask you something?

334
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:01,490
A long time ago when I was
being chased by my mountain spirit,

335
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,690
why did you save me?

336
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,519
As revenge.

337
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,859
- "Revenge"?
- I had noodles with him before.

338
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,069
But he stole my only boiled egg
and ate it.

339
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,069
Did you save my life just for that?

340
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:20,200
What do you mean, "just for that"?

341
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,470
I always save my egg
so I could eat it at the end.

342
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,150
What is this supposed to mean?

343
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,720
Does a bowl of naengmyeon
have to have a meaning?

344
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,890
Why are you suddenly
buying me naengmyeon?

345
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:14,119
You're buying.
I didn't have lunch yet.

346
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:17,829
What a joke.
I can read right through you.

347
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:20,430
Stop making me mad
and let's just eat.

348
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,240
You really don't put in any vinegar
and only put in mustard.

349
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,009
What?

350
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:36,549
Was it Ki Yu Ri?
That's what she told me.

351
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,579
She said you only put in mustard
when you eat naengmyeon.

352
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,750
Did she say that?

353
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:45,019
Only someone who cares a lot
about you would know that.

354
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,789
I saved her life.

355
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:51,759
If it wasn't for me, she would've
starved to death...

356
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,930
or beaten to death at the zoo.

357
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,829
Who is that kid at your place?

358
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:00,869
Blackie. The one I used to
take around in my previous life.

359
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,039
I understand he was a dog
you used to take around,

360
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,880
but you can't just take him.
What about his parents?

361
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,279
His stepdad beat him like a dog.
It made me mad.

362
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,319
- Why are you laughing?
- Because I'm speechless.

363
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,259
You were going around everywhere
with a face like the Joker...

364
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,529
but you've been
volunteering so much.

365
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,759
- Be quiet.
- You became a human.

366
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,400
You were a bed wetter before.

367
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,430
I'll kill you.

368
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,339
Give me your egg
if you're not going to eat it.

369
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,029
Why are you so blunt about
being unhappy?

370
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,230
I don't like being with you.

371
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,599
I want to go home.

372
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,269
"Home"?

373
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,869
Is there a home you can go back to?

374
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,740
You ripped Rang apart
with your own hands,

375
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,109
and yesterday,
Sin Ju threw you away.

376
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,250
No one will look for you now.

377
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,619
That's not true.
Mr. Lee must be waiting for me.

378
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,980
I'm sure Sin Ju is waiting too.

379
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,420
No. You suit this place better.

380
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:26,490
You were abused by humans before,
right?

381
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:29,890
You were abused for a long time
until your soul became ragged.

382
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:32,329
I can see darkness in you.

383
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,200
Stop reading other people's minds.

384
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,470
This is why you're creepy.

385
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,410
Someone like you...

386
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,240
will only transmit unhappiness
to Rang and Sin Ju.

387
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,079
Just like me.

388
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:51,250
So don't live your life
with useless hope.

389
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,480
No one will come to rescue you.

390
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,119
I've done it, so I know.

391
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,329
Do you like naengmyeon that much?

392
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:08,730
At least naengmyeon tastes good.

393
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,500
What do you like so much
about that woman?

394
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,240
What do you like so much about her
to sacrifice your life?

395
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,039
Ji A protected me
in my previous life.

396
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,049
She sacrificed her life.

397
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,650
If I don't stop this from happening,

398
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,180
she'll try to protect me...

399
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,589
instead of herself again.

400
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,119
She's also someone
who keeps her promise.

401
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,089
Just ask her to protect you.

402
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,430
It's what she wants to do.

403
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,799
No.

404
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,099
I think it would be embarrassing
if she saves me twice.

405
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,400
You're crazy.

406
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,670
So? Are you going to die
instead of her, then?

407
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,470
You. Come with me tomorrow.

408
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,740
- Where?
- To the Styx.

409
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,309
To catch the Imoogi.

410
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,150
Something unexpected could happen
with my plan.

411
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,680
I want you to stop it for me.

412
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,920
What's your plan?

413
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,789
You don't have to know it in detail.

414
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:08,390
Just become my hands and feet
in case something happens.

415
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:11,930
Let me think about it.

416
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,869
Hey. I saved your life twice.

417
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,369
- That's nothing between us.
- I'm glad you said that.

418
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,539
Can't you react better between us?

419
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:21,970
We don't know what will happen
to your brother,

420
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,269
and you won't even shed a tear.

421
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:24,410
You won't die.

422
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:26,480
You're not a human either.

423
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,609
A nine-tailed fox
wouldn't die so easily.

424
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,990
The sky looks really nice.

425
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,960
It wouldn't be so bad
for the world to end today.

426
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,259
What are you trying to do
with Lee Yeon?

427
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,329
Didn't you hear everything...

428
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:46,130
we talked about?

429
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,670
I see. Are you really going
to become a spirit?

430
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:52,240
What will you do after that?

431
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,539
I'll change the world...

432
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:55,740
and keep Ji A too.

433
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,640
That's different from
what you promised.

434
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,440
That promise can't be kept.

435
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,480
I'm sure Yeon feels the same.

436
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,819
Since we're on that, I want you
to come to the Styx with me.

437
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,279
Why should I?

438
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,920
I need you to bring them down
in case Yeon brings someone else.

439
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,089
- What if I don't want to?
- I didn't ask for your opinion.

440
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,859
Should I call Rang and Sin Ju
right now?

441
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,029
Just a word from my mouth
and they'll die.

442
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,740
You experienced it, so you know.

443
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,640
Just kill me instead!

444
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,180
That's not how it works.

445
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,609
If I kill you,

446
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,210
there's no way
to see you in despair.

447
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,599
What brought you here?

448
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,410
I'm just the owner of a restaurant,

449
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,119
but I can't sit and watch
Mr. Lee Yeon die.

450
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,549
Just watch.

451
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,220
Stay seated.

452
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,660
It's not something
you can help with.

453
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,089
I can't do that.

454
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,200
What did you say?

455
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,740
Snail Bride.

456
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,579
Where are we?

457
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,279
We're at a place that controls
the border...

458
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,880
between this life and the next.

459
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,250
Who am I?

460
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,750
The owner of the Styx.

461
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,650
Then...

462
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:52,619
you must know how disrespectful
you're being right now.

463
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,890
Yes, I do.

464
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,059
But before you're the owner
of the Styx,

465
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,099
you're someone's wife,

466
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:04,099
someone's mother,
and someone's friend.

467
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:07,299
You're neither Bok Gil's mom
nor my wife.

468
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,710
You're just a loyal servant
of the Styx.

469
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:11,440
You're wrong!

470
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,450
I was never...

471
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,880
someone's wife, someone's mother,
or someone's friend.

472
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,460
Will you be okay...

473
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,890
if you lose Mr. Lee?

474
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:33,000
- What?
- Don't say that it was his fate.

475
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,470
Look into your heart.

476
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,029
For a very long time,

477
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,539
he has trusted and relied on you.

478
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,970
That's because you probably
loved him just as much.

479
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,009
Is it because...

480
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,150
he looked like the son you lost?

481
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,619
Is that what my husband told you?

482
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,420
That means you probably heard
what I did...

483
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,690
to my one and only son.

484
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,960
My son...

485
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,829
begged from where you were standing
just like Yeon did.

486
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,869
He begged me to save his wife.

487
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,799
That's right. I refused.

488
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:15,269
That's why...

489
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,069
you haven't been able
to forgive yourself.

490
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:27,349
How dare you?

491
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,390
I apologize for speaking
out of place.

492
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,190
One more word,

493
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:35,789
and I will crush those hands
you use to cook.

494
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,069
(Glucosamine)

495
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:45,940
He wanted you to have this.

496
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,470
Please...

497
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,609
don't abandon Mr. Lee
or your husband.

498
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,359
(Glucosamine)

499
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,359
Where are we going this time?

500
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,930
You don't need to come.

501
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,329
I'll tell you what you need to do
once I return.

502
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:23,740
What? You said that to Yu Ri?

503
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:25,509
That she used you?

504
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,680
It was a mistake.

505
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:29,710
She said she didn't care
whether they died or not.

506
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,849
Ji A's parents have no significance
to her.

507
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,220
You lunatic.
How dare you say that to her...

508
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,519
when she's with the Imoogi
all alone because of me?

509
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,160
I've regretted it.

510
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,230
But she wouldn't pick up.
I can't reach her.

511
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:47,460
You're done for.

512
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,900
Once Yu Ri has a grudge,
she becomes very coldhearted.

513
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,640
How about you explain this to her?

514
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,140
I feel the same way.

515
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,839
I won't allow you two to date.

516
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:04,180
She'll return back safely, right?

517
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,179
This won't do. Let's go.

518
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,849
Go where?

519
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,250
Yu Ri, it's me.

520
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,530
Seeing how your car's here,
you must be inside.

521
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,460
I don't care if you're with him
or not, so just listen.

522
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,630
Once you come back home,
you need a good beating.

523
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,239
How dare you serve
for someone else?

524
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,210
Thanks to you,
I'm living an inconvenient life.

525
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,110
No one can buy me naengmyun.

526
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,710
And that little kid
has been putting stickers on me.

527
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,980
It's driving me crazy.

528
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,250
Don't say that.

529
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,420
What if she's not listening?

530
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:18,420
- Should we just barge in?
- No.

531
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,019
Mr. Lee will be enraged
if he finds out.

532
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,929
Then let me say one thing too.

533
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,260
Yu Ri, don't forgive this jerk.

534
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,800
Yu Ri.

535
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,800
I'll apologize later.

536
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:35,039
Just come back home safely.

537
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,409
Don't take anything that Imoogi says
to heart.

538
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,440
Just think about your own safety.

539
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,849
I was... I was...

540
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:44,150
I was going to propose to you...

541
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,349
- once you returned.
- Come on.

542
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,420
What?

543
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,119
Yu Ri.

544
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,690
I'll save you.

545
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:54,760
Just hang in there until tomorrow.

546
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:00,530
- I will also...
- Let's go.

547
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,199
One minute. Wait...

548
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,039
Guess who?

549
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:50,409
I know who you are
just by looking at your hands.

550
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,380
What if it's someone else
disguised as Ji A?

551
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:57,449
Then there's no way my heart
would be thumping like this.

552
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,030
That was a pretty good answer.

553
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,760
Are you sure you've been all alone
for 600 years?

554
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:08,059
Of course.

555
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,469
You're the only one I see.

556
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,070
It's just you.

557
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,039
So what are we doing today?

558
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,380
Today, we're just
an ordinary couple.

559
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,510
You can look forward to it.

560
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,619
I'll do something ordinary.
Come inside.

561
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,489
Why the claw machine?

562
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,059
This has always been
one of the things I wanted to do.

563
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,300
With the amount of money I have,

564
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,269
I could easily buy
this entire arcade for you.

565
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,440
How should I put it?

566
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,539
I want to give you something
I've worked hard for.

567
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:51,539
Let me show you.

568
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:55,440
Don't fight against the machine.
Coax it.

569
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:57,480
Like this.

570
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,889
It looks adorable.

571
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,690
- Again. Let's get that one.
- Do one more.

572
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Help me.

573
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,059
Like this. Press it.

574
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,170
Press it?

575
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,099
It's working.

576
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,159
It just won't go in.

577
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,159
No, wait.

578
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:48,360
- Hold it with this hand.
- Let go.

579
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,670
This is me against that jerk.

580
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,780
Move aside!

581
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,159
How's the mint chocolate?

582
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,099
It tastes so fresh.

583
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,769
It feels like there's a forest
in my mouth.

584
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,929
How's the vanilla?

585
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,239
It's sweet.

586
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:31,570
It also tastes like honey.

587
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,579
Do you want to switch?

588
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,510
How about mixing them together?

589
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,329
I think I love you a lot.

590
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,039
I've lived for hundreds of years,

591
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,940
so I barely remember
other people's names and faces.

592
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,579
But I remember
every little detail...

593
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,250
when it comes to the moments
I've spent with you.

594
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,480
Don't forget me.

595
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,789
Ever.

596
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:24,690
How can I forget this face?

597
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,070
I love you, Lee Yeon.

598
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:01,530
Is it true?

599
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,769
You weren't the one who abandoned me
and left.

600
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,670
Was I the one who abandoned you?

601
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,280
Is that why I ended up like this?

602
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,050
I promised myself again and again
that I'd never forgive you.

603
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,190
But it turns out...

604
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,860
I couldn't forgive myself.

605
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,159
What...

606
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,829
kind of mom was I to you?

607
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,699
What did you wish for?

608
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,139
For you to be safe.

609
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:25,309
For you to never get hurt or ill.

610
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:27,820
For you to never cry.

611
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,849
What a big wish.

612
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,530
If something we can't control
happens,

613
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,559
I wished for you to
forget everything.

614
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:45,730
No. I'll wait for you.

615
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,210
Just like how you waited for me.

616
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:58,210
No.

617
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:01,380
A human's life is too short
for that.

618
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,989
What did you wish for?

619
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,219
I wished there was
a very kind deity...

620
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:11,329
somewhere in this world,

621
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,429
so he could grant a miracle.

622
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,170
I wished...

623
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,670
for him to save us.

624
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:45,159
Hey, Granny.

625
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:50,230
What? Now?

626
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:58,840
What did you mean earlier?

627
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:05,449
I've smoked for so long.

628
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,019
There were two people on earth
who nagged me to quit smoking.

629
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,590
- One was you...
- And the other was your son?

630
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,630
He was a very kind child.

631
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,800
But...

632
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,739
after his bride died,
he never spoke again.

633
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:32,670
He should've gotten angry
or just resented me.

634
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,050
Then he jumped into the Styx?

635
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:39,550
He left behind the shoes I made him,
neatly lined up.

636
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,550
That punk.

637
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,889
As if he wanted me to see them.

638
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,989
It probably meant
he'd never forgive me.

639
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:49,630
You're wrong.

640
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:53,960
Although he was overwhelmed
with sadness and about to die,

641
00:44:55,699 --> 00:44:58,530
he didn't want to take the shoes
his mom made him to his death.

642
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,099
I know well about this stuff.

643
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,340
I'm thinking of quitting smoking.

644
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,579
Do you really mean it this time?

645
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,650
I've lived long enough,

646
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,719
so I'm thinking of doing something
I've never done.

647
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,820
What do you mean?

648
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:21,519
I mean there is a way to end this...

649
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,789
without you or her dying.

650
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,159
What is that?

651
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,170
Good work.

652
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,539
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

653
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,369
Have a good night.

654
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,010
- Thank you, sir.
- Good night.

655
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,449
- Good night.
- Good night.

656
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:46,750
Let's go.

657
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:51,989
(Restricted Area)

658
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:13,280
When Imoogi comes here tomorrow,

659
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:16,280
slash Ji A with this sword.

660
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,349
Not lightly,
but enough to make her die.

661
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:26,989
- What?
- On the verge of death,

662
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:29,789
that thing inside her
will try anything...

663
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:31,760
to come out of her body.

664
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,530
- What about the scale?
- Do not use it.

665
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Let it go into Imoogi's body.

666
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,739
When the two separate Imoogis
become one,

667
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:42,469
I will turn it into stone.

668
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:47,980
But what if Ji A really dies?

669
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:51,809
I will save her.

670
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,320
I also will pay for breaking
a sacred rule.

671
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,889
Granny.

672
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,199
Don't say anything cringy,
and just bring Imoogi here in time.

673
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:08,699
Imoogi and that girl.

674
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:16,239
You know what? I always knew
you weren't so cold-hearted.

675
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,280
Let go of me.

676
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:49,610
I enjoyed your show.

677
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:51,869
Thank you.

678
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,639
You're not human either.

679
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,349
You have a keen eye.

680
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,679
Whether you're a human or not,
this place is closed.

681
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:05,820
I was looking for something.

682
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,960
If you lost something,
you should go to Lost-and-Found.

683
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,059
It's okay.

684
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,230
I just found it.

685
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:20,840
And what may that be?

686
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:25,570
The mirror of the moon.

687
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:41,090
When my mom passed away,

688
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,989
I felt like I had become an orphan.

689
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:48,599
But thanks to you and Jae Hwan,

690
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,030
I didn't feel lonely at all.

691
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,500
Thank you.

692
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,440
Hang in there a little longer.

693
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:02,340
Please. Please...

694
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,980
Ms. Nam.

695
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,679
Yes?

696
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,150
I think you should take this.

697
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,960
I guess someone is dying.

698
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,960
Where are you?

699
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:28,400
I'm pretty close to you.

700
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,469
You've finally come to see me.

701
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:02,469
Where's the antidote?

702
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:03,670
It's not the time to worry
about others.

703
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:05,409
You're about to die.

704
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:06,679
Where is the antidote?

705
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:08,679
There is no such thing.

706
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:12,650
I was born during a plague,
so all I know is how to kill.

707
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,320
I have never learned
how to save people.

708
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,389
You worthless jerk.

709
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,550
You will die soon.

710
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,619
I hope you fall to the very bottom
of the underworld.

711
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,699
This is why I like you.

712
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:32,030
You're in so much danger
you can't do anything to your body.

713
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,639
Despite that, you won't break down.

714
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:38,539
- You're going to be mine.
- Don't make me laugh.

715
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,610
I'd rather die than go to you.

716
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,179
You're going to really want to die
starting from now.

717
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,980
Come out.

718
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,070
Don't work with Yeon.

719
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,039
I'm sure they're onto something.

720
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,510
It doesn't matter.

721
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,610
There's something you have to do
from now on.

722
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,969
Why are you standing there?

723
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,610
The district magistrate
was attacked.

724
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,409
What?

725
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,349
What are you talking about?

726
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:54,579
By whom?

727
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,019
Imoogi.

728
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:58,250
He didn't die,

729
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:01,190
but he said he lost something
really important.

730
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:09,730
You're him, aren't you?

731
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,199
Here's a quiz.

732
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,840
Guess what
the district magistrate lost.

733
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,809
The mirror of the moon.

734
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,449
You.

735
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:31,090
How did you have that face on?

736
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:38,730
It's a face you missed, right?

737
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,360
The poor child you killed.

738
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:43,929
Your only son.

739
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,070
Bok Gil. My Bok Gil...

740
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:51,369
I decided to pick a shell to suit
your taste when I was reborn.

741
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:55,309
I knew such a day would come.

742
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,679
How did you know who my son was?

743
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:00,619
Here's your second quiz.

744
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:04,590
Why did my other half
go after the mirror of the moon?

745
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:09,960
No. Granny.

746
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,659
- You should stay with me.
- Let go!

747
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:16,199
Sin Ju.

748
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,900
- Why would you?
- Because I was called.

749
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,809
One day, when the Imoogi inside her
calls you,

750
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,679
you'll become my soldier.

751
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:42,159
Bok Gil was a good kid.

752
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,460
Everyone loathed me,

753
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:47,030
but he was the first one
to talk to me.

754
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,130
I felt like I made a friend
for the first time.

755
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:52,199
But did you know?

756
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,539
I was the one who planted...

757
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:58,170
the seed of plaque
in his wife's body.

758
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:03,210
Why?

759
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,909
Why did you do that?

760
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,150
Because he looked too happy.

761
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:28,599
You jerk!

762
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:59,369
Let's go. We need Granny.

763
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,300
- It's already too late.
- Come to your sense, Ji A!

764
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,710
We can both live.
We have hope for the first time.

765
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:11,880
I have a headache.

766
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,719
- Mr. Lee.
- Sin Ju, you stay out of it.

767
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:18,190
Rang, come with me.

768
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,090
- I'm sorry, we were...
- Later!

769
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:24,059
You were just hypnotized.

770
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,559
Take Ji A with you.

771
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:27,829
Wait.

772
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,000
Let go. I'll go on my own.

773
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:52,050
Where's Granny?

774
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:56,460
Where is she?

775
00:55:58,429 --> 00:55:59,460
Did you get her?

776
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,929
No wonder this is one of four
mountain spirits' jewels.

777
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,909
I came with her son's face,

778
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,480
so the great old woman
lost her mind.

779
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,949
They say
she's the spirit of spirits,

780
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:58,690
but as long as she has a heart
of a human,

781
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:01,659
there has to be a weak link.

782
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:14,570
Was this your plan all along?

783
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,239
This is all your fault, Yeon.

784
00:57:16,539 --> 00:57:18,309
You wouldn't give up,

785
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:21,840
so innocent people died,
including the old woman.

786
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,809
Ji A is dying too.

787
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,500
Ji A.

788
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:23,809
Please...

789
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:39,719
He can't even touch a hair
on this body right now.

790
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:43,789
This is why you should
give up that body and just die.

791
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,929
You don't have any other choice now.

792
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:49,059
That's the only way
for Ji A to live.

793
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:25,000
That's enough.

794
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:29,139
Let Ji A go.

795
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:31,809
I'll...

796
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:40,750
Take my body.

797
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,710
What are you doing here?

798
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,380
You're forbidden to enter.
At all costs.

799
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:16,550
Yu Ri.

800
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:19,820
I came here to save you and Yeon.

801
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:24,130
If something happens to Yeon,

802
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,260
I will kill you.

803
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:38,070
Don't.

804
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:44,550
- Ji A.
- Don't move.

805
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:50,949
You're still in there?

806
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,059
Don't do that.

807
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,820
Put that down. Please.

808
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,130
I'll protect you, Yeon.

809
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:04,630
No, let me.

810
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:16,610
Goodbye.

811
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:40,699
No. No!

812
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,309
Get out of her body.

813
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,519
Please forgive me.
I'm doing this to protect you.

814
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,599
Yeon.

815
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,139
Don't come near me.

816
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,440
- Yeon!
- Don't come!

817
01:02:23,179 --> 01:02:24,409
No!

818
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:30,489
The Yeon you know is dead.

819
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:34,019
I've won.

820
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:29,380
What is this?

821
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:33,610
I'm a mess, aren't I?

822
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:38,389
I wanted...

823
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,920
to look the prettiest before I died.

824
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:46,329
Still,

825
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,000
we've won.

826
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:06,949
It's my gift.

827
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,449
I heard that
if your other half weakens,

828
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,619
that you'll weaken as well.

829
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:35,139
They're evening primroses
from the grave.

830
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:09,610
Yeon!

831
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,469
Darn it.

832
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:07,599
Rang.

833
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,340
Rang!

834
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,880
Let me go.

835
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:27,250
You and I are one now.

836
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:30,159
If I die, you'll die with me.

837
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:31,860
That's exactly what I want.

838
01:06:56,219 --> 01:06:57,349
Rang.

839
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,949
No. I can't.

840
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:04,190
Soon,

841
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,159
I'll turn into him.

842
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,869
Let me stay as myself.

843
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:17,340
Rang.

844
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:19,010
No...

845
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:45,800
Rang.

846
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,670
Save me.

847
01:08:30,949 --> 01:08:33,479
I will reincarnate.

848
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,880
And when I do,

849
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,819
I will find her once again.

850
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,159
Don't be ridiculous.

851
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,329
If you fall into the Styx,

852
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:47,859
you will never be able
to reincarnate.

853
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,380
No...

854
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:27,800
No.

855
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:38,649
I love you.

856
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:41,819
No! Please!

857
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:45,220
No!

858
01:10:24,789 --> 01:10:26,229
He smiled.

859
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,600
As if he felt glad...

860
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:32,600
that he had saved me.

861
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:37,039
Is this the happy ending
he talked about?

862
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,439
At the last moment,

863
01:10:45,649 --> 01:10:47,409
I think I heard him say...

864
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:48,920
Lee Yeon!

865
01:10:48,979 --> 01:10:50,649
the word "love".

866
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:30,619
(Tale of the Nine Tailed)

867
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,630
I can do anything you want.

868
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:35,600
Just this once...

869
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,300
That will never happen.

870
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,670
"Pull yourself together."
Mr. Lee told me to say this.

871
01:11:41,739 --> 01:11:44,840
You'll get used to it.
Although you'll have to walk...

872
01:11:45,939 --> 01:11:48,239
the road we used to walk
on your own,

873
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:50,779
please forget me now.

874
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,979
I love you, Ji A.

875
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:56,819
I heard a rumor
and came to see that old man.
