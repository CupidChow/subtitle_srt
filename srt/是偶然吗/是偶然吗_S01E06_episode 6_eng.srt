22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,610

23
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,360
We just met again recently, you know.

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,860

♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

26
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,850
I think I need some time to adjust.

27
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,960
Okay.

28
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,420
   

29
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,180
- Let's eat. 
 - Yes.

30
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,350
Eat a lot of food.

31
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,850
Exactly.

32
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,380
Look away so I can eat a lot.

33
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,250
Got it.

34
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,430
Are you sure you get it?

35
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,420
Don't look. I won't be able to digest.

36
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,690
That would be bad. I'll stop looking.

37
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,690
Instead,

38
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,030
feel free to stare at me.

39
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,140

46
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,560
 Is he on his way back or what? 

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,970
Should I try calling Lee Ddoong?

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,550
Why is he making things worse?

49

♫  To be honest, to be honest, I like you a lot  ♫

59
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,480
Thank you for driving.

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,320
What should we have for dinner?

61
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,010
What?

62
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,500
I'm not hungry.

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,870
But I'm hungry.

64
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,910
R-Really?

65
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,390
Then I'll send you restaurant recommendations.

66
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,560
Wh-What?

67
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,650
Why?

68
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:26,540
Do you think I want to have dinner because I'm hungry?

69
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,890
 What are you two doing? 

70
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,140
 What were you doing? 

71
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,590
Finish what you were doing.

72
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,950
 Finish what you were doing. 

73
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,120
It seems your dream came true.

74
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,910
Why didn't you answer my call?

75
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,780
You could have waited to talk to me in Seoul.

76
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,170
Will you really quit your job?

77
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,830
Yes.

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,100
Your mom called me.

79
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,800
 Hu Yeong submitted a resignation letter. 
   

80
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,810
 What? What did you say? 

81
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,810
 You can't suddenly do this. 

82
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,480
 I never heard him say that. 

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,150
You didn't know, right?

84
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,050
   

85
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,580
Okay. I'll take care of it then.

86
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,180
   

87
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,750
She said she'd take care of it. I'm scared.

88
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,840
I'll take a shower.

89
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,670
Quitting is too drastic.

90
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,170
There must be a good solution. I'll find one.

91
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,110
Go to the U.S. for a while. I'll bring you back no matter what.

92
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,690
Uncle, you were right.

93
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,340
Lee Hong Ju was my issue.

94
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,540
Because I like her so much,

95
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't want to go to the U.S. anymore.

96
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,910
Who are you? What did you do to my nephew, Kang Hu Yeong?

97
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,740
Rock Asset's ace, the math genius,

98
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,920
the number-obsessed fool, the scumbag—

99
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,120
That rude, cold stare means you're Hu Yeong.

100
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,770
I can tell why Hong Ju is close to you.

101
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,100
You probably couldn't show it, but you must have felt suffocated.

102
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,880
Your dad couldn't stand it, either.

103
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,490
Uncle.

104
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,180
So what I'm saying is…

105
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,880
Since your mom broke up with your dad,

106
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,050
she did her best to make up for that failure.

107
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,300
You and Rock Asset were the results of that.

108
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,210
Doing this to her means you'll destroy both at once.

109
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,400
Your mom would never allow that to happen.

110
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,820
Don't tell Hong Ju that I quit my job.

111
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,420
I'll tell her when it's sorted out.

112
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,570
I want to tell her.

113
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,510
It's leather.

114
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,930
Hu Yeong, it's leather. It's expensive…

115
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,770
This is leather… leather…

116
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,710
I'll go. I'll go.

117
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,590
Hey, I'll be staying here for a while.

118
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,040
- You can't. 
 - I can't?

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,110
What do you mean I can't? This is my house, my home.

120
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,740
I'll be watching you here.

121
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,990
And this is leather.

122
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,290
 You suck. 

123
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,910
Have you seen the file?

124
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,780
 I'm annoyed because you look happy. 

125
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,870
Do I?

126
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,760
You're laughing?

127
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,530
How could you abandon your client and just... just laugh?

128
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,340
Just letting you know the contract has expired.

129
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,470
 What about opening our family office? 

130
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,220
Don't worry about it.

131
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,620
I already sent you the plans so talk with Scarlett from now on.

132
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,180
We've all met before, right?

133
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,100
You're going to go on your own in Korea.

134
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,720
Let me invest then.

135
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,930
Talk with Scarlett about that as well.

136
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,710
 What happened to you anyway? 

137
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,000
Coincidence.

138
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,060
 "Coincidence"? 

139
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,990
Yes.

140
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,350
 Hu Yeong, why am I… 

141
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,300
so excited to see what your mom would do?

142
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,910
 And I'll bet 100% that you'll lose. 

143
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,170
But I'll throw the legit welcome-back party for you.

144
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,150
 Catch you later, Man. 

145
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,410
   

146
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,090
Everyone is more curious about what my mom would do.

147
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,940
Is she sleeping?

148
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,360
   

149
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,000
 Not yet. 

150
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,670
   

151
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,930
 - Kang Hu Yeong?  
 - I'm coming up now.

152
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,940
Why? Is something going on?

153
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,330
 I want to see you. 

154
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,920
♫  There are so many things  ♫

155
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,900
Hey, never mind.

156
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,590
I'm already in bed. I'll go to sleep.

157
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,790
♫  Standing in front of you  ♫

158
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,070
Will you really go to bed?

159
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,680
Yes.

160
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,890
I haven't slept well for a while. I'm so tired.

161
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,910
♫  I'm unable to say a word  ♫

162
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,250
You should go to bed, too. 
 ♫  I love you so much  ♫

163
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,900
Okay.

164
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,580
Good night.

165
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,620
Okay. You, too.

166
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,280
♫  Why is it so hard to say this?  ♫

167
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,900
Lee Hong Ju.

168
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,680
Yes?

169
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,810
Have I told you that I like you?

170
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,630
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

171
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,610
Yes.

172
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,780
I think you did.

173
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,950
I see.

174
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,540
Yes, you did.

175
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,840
♫  I want to be a meaningful person  ♫

176
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,790
I like you.

♫  To you  ♫

178
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:46,270
♫  I'm not sure if you know how I feel  ♫

179
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,610
Good night.

180
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,300
    
 ♫  I love you so much  ♫

181
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,880
♫  Why is it so hard to say this?  ♫

182
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,530
Gosh, I would never get used to this.

183

♫  I really want you  ♫

184
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,770

185
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:14,870
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

186
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,800
Did you stay up all night?

187
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,790
Yes, I couldn't sleep.

188
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,260
Because you were worried?

189
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,300
Because your heart was racing?

190
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,140
Tell Lee Ddoong to come down for breakfast.

191
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,470
Will you be here, too?

192
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,650
I should at least eat before I leave.

193
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,380
You're making single people feel so sad!

194
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,320
Jerk.

195
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,800
You'd better not do anything bad in my house.

196
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:08,140
- What do you mean, "anything bad"? 
 - Don't you know?

197
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,190
 Call her. 

198
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,970
She should be up, right?

199
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,010
   

200
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,050
Did you sleep well?

201
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,950
 Yes. How about you? 

202
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,300
I did, too.

203
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,940
Do you want to come down? Let's have breakfast together.

204
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,570
Oh, I'm gone out right now.

205
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,480
- Where? 
  - I'm at a department store. 

206
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,900
I'm shopping with Hye Ji.

207
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,060
 Your leg hasn't healed yet. Why would you do that? 

208
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,630
I'll call you later, okay?

209
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,200
- What is it? 
 - She's at a department store with Kim Hye Ji.

210
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,630
Oh, really?

211
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,220
 Yesterday's friend is today's enemy, right? 

212
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,560
Aren't you going to eat?

213
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,180
I won't.

214
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,950
- Was it Kang Hu Yeong? 
 - Yes. He wanted to eat together.

215
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,630
He waited ten years.

216
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,720
He can wait another day. Let's go.

217
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,690
Aren't we going in?

218
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,900
This isn't our destination today. Let's go.

219
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,610
Are you sure this is it?

220
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,440
Yes. I didn't consider Mr. Son's taste enough.

221
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,790
I'll show him the best outfit tomorrow.

222
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,680
Let's go in.

223
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,490
   

224
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,950
   

225
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,980
I was about to text you just now.

226
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,170
 Have you finished shopping? 

227
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,550
I'm at a hair salon now.

228
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,000
Hye Ji is getting her hair done.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
Lee Ddoong will hang out with me today.

230
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
 How about dinner then? 

231
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,350
 Lee Ddoong, come look at this. 

232
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,380
 Don't worry about me. Get things done today. 

233
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,410
Let's see each other tomorrow.

234
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,370
Hurry up.

235
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,190
Look at this.

236
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,530
You've hung out with her for ten years.

237
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,730
Did she have to see her today too?

238
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,990
 Cheers! 

239
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,030
   

240
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,910
- Lee Ddoong. 
 - Yes?

241
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,460
Why is your face always so cute and lovely?

242
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,070
Today, you look like her.

243
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,930
Hermione, who just started school. Hermione.

244
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,440
Ms. Kim, you're going too far.

245
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,010
- What do you mean? 
 - You're just like…

246
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,600
Sunmi, the mysterious goddess.

247
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,360
Sang Pil, play Sunmi's song.

248
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,980
Music cue!

249
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,030
Two dogs are in the restaurant.

250
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,070
Okay.

251
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,160
Okay, okay.

252
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,320
Please continue eating the meat.

253
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,920
There are other customers.

254
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,450
Our hair turned out nicely.

255
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,770
- Aren't you inviting Hu Yeong? 
 - You'd better not invite him today.

256
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,520
Today is all about us two girls, okay?

257
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,510
That's right.

258
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,770
I'm sure.

259
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,020
By the way, how about Bang Jun Ho—

260
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,070
Seriously…

261
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,530
Bang Jun Ho.

262
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,400
Why did you bring up that scum's name on a nice day like this?

263
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,060
No, no, no. You heard him wrong.

264
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,320
- I did, right? 
 - Of course, you did.

265
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,040
- I heard him wrong. 
 - Cheers!

266
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,120
Mr. Kwon, get us the radish wrap.

267
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,890
You're talkative, but your service is slow today.

268
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,840
Hey, don't tell Kang Hu Yeong that I got my hair to look pretty.

269
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,390
Why would I tell him that?

270
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,670
Do you think I have time for that?

271
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,480
   

272
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,460
Lee Hong Ju doesn't text often.

273
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,890
I'm like that myself.

274
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,560
Hey, I wasn't ready.

275
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,590
Okay, okay.

276
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,280
- What if my hair burns? 
 - I know, right?

277
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,190
- Hey, I'm not ready. 
 - Okay, one, two, three.

278
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,930
 The war isn't over yet. 

279
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,050
   

280
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,010
   

281
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,320
   

282
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,750
Why did he send this photo?

283
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,360
Gosh, why did you drink so much, Uncle?

284
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,180
I…

285
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,780
I don't know what I did wrong.

286
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,200
I still don't understand.

287
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,980
Be careful. Be careful.

288
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,670
Kang Hu Yeong, take him off my hands.

289
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,990
My nephew, Hu Yeong.

290
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:28,000
Of course, you were waiting for me. You missed me.

291
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,300
What a great guy, Hu Yeong. Let me give you a hug.

292
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,500
Uncle.

293
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,300
I ran into him on the main street. He was sitting on a bench.

294
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,190
I'm okay.

295
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,910
I was talking on the phone.

296
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,730
- Right, I need to call. 
 - No, no. Do it tomorrow.

297
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,760
You'll regret it when you wake up.

298
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,390
It's not that. I need to hear an answer today.

299
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,430
That's why. 
    

300
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,310
 Hey! I told you not to call! 

301
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,050
Be honest with me.

302
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,250
I'm your first love, right?

303
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,160
You were crazy about me, right?

304
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,630
 I said I wasn't. 

305
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,190
What do you mean by you weren't?

306
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,910
Hey, we were so in love back then.

307
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,330
I know you like me.

308
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,100
 Let me talk to the one with you right now. 

309
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,510
See?

310
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,750
You're worried about me now, too. Right?

311
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,040
You used to like me. You did.

312
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,600
 Let me talk to them. 

313
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
Otherwise, I'll come and kill you right now.

314
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,350
- Hey. 
 - Over here.

315
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,230
Hello, I'm Uncle Wook's niece.

316
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,170
"Niece"?

317
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,450
 Take him home right now. 

318
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,920
 He's been outside for over two hours in this weather. 

319
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,070
Okay. I'll make sure he gets home safely.

320
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,420
I'll tell him to call you tomorrow—

321
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,890
Her voice sounds familiar.

322
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,150
Give it to me.

323
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,250
Hey, tell me.

324
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,500
Just tell me why you dumped me then.

325
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Hello?

326
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,510
Ddoong, I'm so curious about something.

327
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,250
I'm curious why I suddenly got dumped twenty years ago.

328
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,800
I want to know why…

329
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,100
I was dumped 20 years ago.

330
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,250
Uncle, hop on my back.

331
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,090
Come on.

332
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,590
Gosh. Be careful. Be careful.

333
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,390
If you'll drink so much that you can't even walk,

334
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,940
just quit drinking, Uncle.

335
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,840
Yes, the lady on the phone was worried, too.

336
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,210
Yes, yes.

337
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,420
Fine!

338
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,870
I live just fine, too.

339
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,240
Hold on.

340
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,440
Lee Ddoong, I've always told you, right?

341
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,620
The first love is like frozen food.

342
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,450
It melts the moment you take it out of the freezer.

343
00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:00,380
So the day Bang Jun Ho left, it was all over.

344
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,840
The end.

345
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,580
The end of first love! Do you understand?

346
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,030
There are many men in the world.

347
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,100
Hey. How about Hu Yeong?

348
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,730
He's smart,

349
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,160
successful, and as for his looks…

350
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,800
See, he's so handsome because he resembles me.

351
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,860
- Let go. 
 - But he's not that impressive, either.

352
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,840
He won't go back to the States. He's afraid of his mother—

353
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,300
Hey! How can you throw him to the ground?

354
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,990
Hey…

355
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,580
Hey, you can't leave Uncle there like that.

356
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,470
How about me? This is our first time seeing each other today.

357
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,100
My hair.

358
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,880
"Hair"?

359
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,790
My hair.

360
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,700
What the heck?

361
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,160
What are you doing?

362
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,210
Wasn't it for me anyway?

363
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,480
I did it because I had time to spare.

364
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,850
The curls will go once I wash my hair.

365
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,680
Then I should take a good look at you.

366
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,580
It suits you.

367
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,830
Hey, will you abandon me, too?

368
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,970
Don't forget about me.

369
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,430
I miss you!

370
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,510
♫  I will give you all my stars  ♫

371
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,490
No. 
 ♫  Our memories  ♫

372
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,150
This one.

373
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,870
What should I wear?

374
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,360
♫  When I see you wishing every day  ♫

375
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,180
♫  You'd let me in your life  ♫

376
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,870
♫  Fall in love with you  ♫

377
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:07,190
♫  I know if I stay, I'll be with you again  ♫

378
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,580
♫  Say that you'll come and take my hand  ♫

379
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,260
♫  Bring me loving, loving dreams of you  ♫

380
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,240
♫  Oh, Baby, feeling... feeling close to you  ♫

381
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,420
♫  It's our story  ♫

382
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,540
♫  I want to fall in love with you  ♫

383
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,990
What is wrong with you?

384
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,930
Are you going hiking?

385
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,600
Aren't you going hiking today, Dad?

386
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,210
Me?

387
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,770
I'm not.

388
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,840
Why not?

389
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,960
You used to go with Teacher Son every Sunday.

390
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,450
 Teacher Son is apparently sick. What can I do? 

391
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,470
He's stressed out. You kept forcing him to go on a blind date with Unnie.

392
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,030
Stop bothering him.

393
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,970
He'd become the son-in-law of the future principal. He should suffer that much.

394
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,370
Who's the principal, and who's the son-in-law?

395
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:27,000
You're acting impulsively again.

396
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,680
Hey, Teacher Son has to become my son-in-law.

397
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,930
Hey, you and your sister don't listen to me anymore. You're all grown up.

398
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,750
Your mom was busy going on trips with her friends.

399
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,850
Teacher Son was my only friend.

400
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,780
He was basically my son at that time.

401
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,430
He is proper, manly, and generally good,

402
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:58,400
 but he's awkward around women. 

403
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,700
We should invite him to dinner when Hye Seon is off work.

404
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,940
He likes beef.

405
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,850
I'm here, too.

406
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,770
You?

407
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,860
What about you?

408
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,790
I mean,

409
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:24,450
I'm closer to Teacher Son. You know that.

410
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,970
 Aigoo, my stomach! My stomach… 

411
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,200
Gosh… That's so… so funny.

412
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,840
Excuse me, Teacher Kim.

413
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,320
Forget it.

414
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,280
Wow! You're jealous because I'm setting your sister up.

415
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,290
Gosh, seriously…

416
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,090
Do you think I'm a child? Why would I get jealous?

417
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,700
You don't know anything!

418
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,070
Get out of the way. I can't see the TV.

419
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,500
Your head is so big.

420
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,670
 You're annoying. 

421
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,130
 Good. 

422
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,990
Hi.

423
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,550
By the way, where are we going today?

424
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,940
Welcome. 
    

425
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,240
One iced Americano, two hot chocolates, and…

426
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,900
She's a problem.

427
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,000
- three tiramisus, please. 
 - Okay.

428
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,820
We don't need the tiramisus.

429
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,470
Why? I want something sweet.

430
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,610
Kim Hye Ji isn't allowed to come today.

431
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,350
We have no choice since Teacher Son is sick.

432
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,090
She over-prepared for today.

433
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,770
Thank you.

434
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,160
Are you two handcuffed together?

435
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,710
You can't let go of your hands.

436
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,910
Thanks to you-know-who.

437
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,030
My stomach hurts.

438
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,760
It hurts even more because I'm jealous.

439
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,100
Is Teacher Son feeling okay?

440
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,690
I don't know. I texted him, but he hasn't replied.

441
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,540
   

442
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,050
   

443
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,280
 Have you taken medicine or seen a doctor? I'm worried. 

444
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:25,990
I'm sorry for making you worry.

445
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:42,610
It's not so bad. You don't have to worry.

446
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,990
 Are Teacher Son and I such a poor match? 

447
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,820
No.

448
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,610
Are we a good match?

449
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,620
Did someone say you were a poor match?

450
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,900
My dad did…

451
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,970
and Teacher Son seems to think so, too.

452
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:03,630
I was sure he was interested in me.

453
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,030
Does he feel pressured because I'm the vice principal's daughter?

454
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,900
Or is he afraid of having an office romance?

455
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,210
Ask him directly.

456
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,020
Right now?

457
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,200
   

458
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,770
- Do you want to visit him? 
 - "Visit him"?

459
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,580
He's not hospitalized. Why should we?

460
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,470
You said he lives alone.

461
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,560
He can't be eating properly.

462
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,310
My heart fluttered a lot when Hu Yeong brought me food while I was injured.

463
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,970
Your heart fluttered?

464
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,950
"A lot"?

465
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,540
Do you know where he lives?

466
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,470
I do.

467
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,840
But…

468
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,520
I can't go looking like this.

469
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,200
I don't like my outfit. I don't want to go.

470
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,100
Kim Hye Ji.

471
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,150
No porridge shops are around here.

472
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,660
We should have bought it on the way.

473
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,430
Where's the nearest one from here?

474
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,970
No.

475
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,080
There's a salad store nearby. I'll take that instead.

476
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,610
Will salad be enough?

477
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,050
Yes. I'll go now.

478
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,400
- I have a good feeling. 
 - Get going.

479
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,590
I'll be right back.

480
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,560
Hye Ji is so pretty.

481
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,110
Wasn't she always shy?

482
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,490
 Kim Hye Ji finally found herself after getting out of her uniform. 

483
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,810
Will you keep talking about her?

484
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,790
By the way, is Uncle okay? Did he get over the hangover?

485
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,950
We should go somewhere far away

486
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,050
so no one interferes with us.

487
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,700
Let's get going.

488
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,410
Oh, let me change first.

489
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,580
- Why? 
 - I want to look pretty.

490
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,090
 Let's go. 

491
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,250
 You have no girlfriend to visit you. 

492
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,240
 Why are you trying to make me leave? 

493
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,720
I don't want you to get sick.

494
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,330
Don't worry about me. Worry about the fact that you're alone.

495
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:01,660
You're like this because you don't have a girl in your life.

496
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,730
What does that have to do with this?

497
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,310
I can manage myself.

498
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:13,340
You shouldn't be too good at managing yourself.

499
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,700
Wait a moment. I'll get you a taxi.

500
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,570
You're going to Hyung's house, right?

501
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,460
Yes.

502
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,440
Teacher Son.

503
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,570
Teacher Kim.

504
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,330
Is she your mother?

505
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,850
- Yes. 
 - Hello.

506
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,630
Hello.

507
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,330
I heard you're also a teacher at Gyeong Taek's school.

508
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,730
Yes. I heard Teacher Son was sick

509
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,540
so I came to check on him on behalf of the faculty.

510
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,130
Aigoo, that school is full of affectionate people.

511
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:08,260
I even liked the name of the school.

512
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,790
Ohbok. Ohbok.

513
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,180
- It's full of bok (good fortune). 
 - Right.

514
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,100
How old are you?

515
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,800
M-Mom!

516
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,020
I'm right here.

517
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,800
I'm not dead. Just get me a taxi.

518
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,080
I'm turning 29 this year.

519
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,200
Aigoo, that's perfect.

520
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,990
Are you married, by chance?

521
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,170
Pardon? No, I'm not.

522
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:44,000
How nice. Aigoo, I love it.

523
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,480
I visit him only once in a while. I rarely come.

524
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,080
I came because he was sick.

525
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,810
Thank you.

526
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:03,580
Not at all. By the way, you'll get a cold if you dress like this.

527
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,200
It will be hard when you give birth.

528
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,900
Our family has many children because we have good genes.

529
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,400
I had (birthed) seven children, you know.

530
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,800
Taxi! Taxi!

531
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,040
 Did you pick up the package for me? 

532
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,190
Hey... Gosh!

533
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,020
Aigoo, what's all this? Oh!

534
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,170
Is this a room or a market street?

535
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,260
Gosh, a ghost might come out of this room.

536
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,850
- Teacher Hye Ji, let's see each other often. 
 - Okay.

537
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:56,200
It'd be even better if you visited me sometime.

538
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,000
- Okay. 
 - Call me when you arrive.

539
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,860
Aigoo, okay, I said.

540
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,090
Don't just leave; chat with him before you go.

541
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:10,060
I brought him side dishes and fruit. Go to his place and—

542
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,160
Mom, that's enough! Please!

543
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,700
Okay, I said!

544
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,300
She has nothing to do with me.

545
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,800
Really?

546
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,410
It was rude of me then.

547
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,530
Teacher Hye Ji,

548
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,860
I'm sorry.

549
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,730
It's fine.

550
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,840
- Get home safely. 
 - Aigoo...

551
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,590
Okay.

552
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,980
Bye.

553
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,980
I'm sorry.

554
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,520
My mother is old and from a different era.

555
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,250
I'm sorry if she offended you with what she said.

556
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,890
This isn't something you should be apologizing for.

557
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,260
No.

558
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,380
I'm very sorry.

559
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,970
Well, then...

560
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,400
It's okay.

561
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,170
It was rude of me to visit you like this.

562
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,900
I'm sorry. I have nothing to do with you.

563
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,780
Well, it's not that...

564
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,480
Go inside and rest.

565
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,900
- I'll get you a taxi— 
 - No, it's okay.

566
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,000
I can just walk from here.

567
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
   

568
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,600
I should have bought porridge,

569
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,390
but I wanted him to see these.

570
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:15,490
I invited you because I got a good liquor.

571
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,210
It's not nice to drink alone at my age.

572
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,840
I didn't invite you when you were busy, right?

573
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,140
No, I was looking for an excuse to drink, too.

574
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:38,600
You'll give a special lecture for the twelfth-graders, right?

575
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,230
Call me when the schedule is posted.

576
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,870
Aigoo, we should try to work with a great writer's schedule.

577
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,990
Not at all.

578
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,500
Jun Ho,

579
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,510
I didn't tell you last time because your aunt was here.

580
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,180
We were all worried when you suddenly left the country,

581
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,320
but I believed you'd figure things out.

582
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,630
It's fine because you came back looking great.

583
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,800
But...

584
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:27,300
don't tempt Hong Ju.

585
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,480
I...

586
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,930
had no choice but to leave like that.

587
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,700
You should have  told her. You should have!

588
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,120
You should have asked her to wait or asked to break up.

589
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,670
She would have accepted the reasoning if you told her before you hurt her,

590
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,380
but once you hurt someone,

591
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,370
it's all an excuse.

592
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:58,300
- Uncle. 
 - Do you know what I've been telling my students?

593
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:04,400
I told them never to date a jerk like you who makes women cry.

594
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,440
Our Hong Ju

595
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,520
can't be with you.

596
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,490
I don't think you'll get used to me if you just glance at me.

597
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,330
Can I ask you something?

598
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,450
Yes, what is it?

599
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,930
What do you like about me so much?

600
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,520
Pardon?

601
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,900
What was so funny about my question just now?

602
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:10,190
Sorry. It was an unexpected question.

603
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,160
Why is it unexpected?

604
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,150
It was a very obvious question.

605
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,310
♫  I thought I'd find happiness in there  ♫

606
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:20,440
I'll think about it.

607
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,770
♫  So you can fulfill your dreams  ♫

608
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:26,520
♫  True happiness always lies in your own heart  ♫

609
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,420
You keep smiling.

610
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,890
Have you always been so smiley?

611
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,280
It's because I'm unsure.

612
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,320
I wasn't sure then,

613
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,970
but I still have no idea.

614
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,790
You have no idea?

615
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,000
What is that...

616
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
♫  So I can go straight into your heart  ♫

617
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,930
Why are we going so far away?

618
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,740
What neighborhood is this?

619
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,650
You'll find out when we get there.

620
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:58,460
♫  Show me your smile  ♫

621
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:08,300
♫  So my heart for you stays the same forever  ♫

622
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,410
♫  Forever, oh, I love you  ♫

623
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,940
    
 ♫  You will never know  ♫

624
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,680
You're so smart; why don't you know something so simple?

625
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,560
What's your brain for?

626
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,580
Kang Hu Yeong,

627
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:43,890
how long will you walk behind me?

628
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,750
Whenever you call me "Kang Hu Yeong,"

629
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,200
my heart races so fast that it aches.

630
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,930
It beats so intensely that

631
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,820
I worry it will pop out of my mouth.

632
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,180
 Kang Hu Yeong, this is from my friend, Kim Hye Ji. 

633
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,210
 Kang Hu Yeong! 

634
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,750
 Hey, Kang Hu Yeong! 

635
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,900
 Kang Hu Yeong. 

636
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,880
 Kang Hu Yeong, run, run! 

637
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,180
 Kang Hu Yeong, give me your dream. 

638
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,230
 Hey, Kang Hu Yeong! Wait right there. I'll be right over. 

639
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,650
 Wait. 

640
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,060
 I don't know when it began. 

641
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,500
 I noticed  

642
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,780
I was waiting for you to call my name.

643
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,750
That's when I realized...

644
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,800
that I like you.

645
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,930
 Good to see you, Kang Hu Yeong. 

646
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,680
♫  I wonder if you're like me, too  ♫

647
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,870
♫  Could you stop your heart  ♫

648
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:48,520
 I realized 

649
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,020
I still like you. 
 ♫  From racing and shaking?  ♫

650
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,770
♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

651
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:03,900
I really don't know why I like you or what I like about you.

652
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,540
♫  So I ask you  ♫

653
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,080
♫  Will you respond  ♫

654
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,640
You never gave me time to adjust.

655
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,800
You didn't, either.

656
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:23,170
♫  Someday when you find out how I feel  ♫

657
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:30,440
♫  You need to tell me, too  ♫

658
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,540
♫  That you like me  ♫

659
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,320
   

660
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,950
 - The customer is not available.  
 - Geez.

661
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,720
Answer the phone, please!

662
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,560
Wasn't it your uncle?

663
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,550
It doesn't matter.

664
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,600
   

665
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,590
Emergency! Emergency!

666
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,920
 Emergency! 

667
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,150
I'm sorry, there's suddenly an emergency at work.

668
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,040
I understand; go now.

669
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,600
I'll go after you go in.

670
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,360
Kang Hu Yeong,

671
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,420
ask me what I'm doing tomorrow evening.

672
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,690
What are you doing tomorrow evening?

673
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,540
I'm meeting you.

674
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,430
How about the day after?

675
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,120
I'm meeting you. How about you?

676
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,390
Me, too.

677
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,160
Go now.

678
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:05,010
♫  I feel so strange these days  ♫

679
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,680
♫  It's really not like me  ♫

680
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,810
   

681
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:13,150
♫  All day I think of you  ♫

682
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,450
♫  I can't stop worrying about you  ♫

683
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:21,980
♫  My heart is pounding  ♫

684
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,190
♫  It's you  ♫

685
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,630
♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

686
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:32,660
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

687
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,840
Why did I put this in here?

688
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,680
♫  It has to be you  ♫

689
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,980
   

690
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,150
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

691
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,680
   

692
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:53,050
♫  I never believed in destiny  ♫

693
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:58,490
♫  But since I got to know you  ♫

694
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:07,000
♫  I am like a star in a drama. I cry and laugh often  ♫

695
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,040
♫  Fall in love  ♫

696
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,350
♫  It's you  ♫

697
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,970
That's right.

698
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,820
I felt that way then, too.

699
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,670
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

700
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:23,750
♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

701
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,610
♫  It has to be you  ♫

702
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:33,630
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

703
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,310
I didn't think you'd come to Korea.

704
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:06,630
I wanted to get some fresh air like you.

705
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,740
I'm sorry I suddenly made this decision.

706
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,130
"Decision"?

707
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,970
Nothing has been decided yet.

708
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,620
Mom.

709
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,810
It feels different coming to Korea after all these years.

710
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,680
I thought I had forgotten everything,

711
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,410
but even the air feels familiar.

712
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,560
Memory is so fascinating.

713
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,360
We should have visited here once in a while.

714
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,420
Please process the resignation letter.

715
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,330
I'll hand over my duties without problems.

716
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:51,550
Hu Yeong, it always bothered me that you never misbehaved while growing up.

717
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,280
You made the best decision for me,

718
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,030
and I believed that was the best, too.

719
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,260
But?

720
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,690
From now on, I'll give it a try,

721
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,560
whether it's the best decision or not.

722
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:15,770
I'm tired from a long flight.

723
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,090
Let's finish talking tomorrow.

724
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,490
Hello.

725
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,780
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

726
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:43,000
 Teacher Kim, why are you so elegant today? 

727
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,070
I went to a hair salon this morning.

728
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,970
I didn't like the new hairstyle I had yesterday.

729
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,300
You're so diligent.

730
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,430
Men don't even notice women's hairstyles.

731
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,140
They think it's either long or short.

732
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,960
Don't waste money for no reason.

733
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,530
But I notice it.

734
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,710
It was a hippie perm yesterday and straight with curled ends today.

735
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:04,340
Guess, what style will it be tomorrow?

736
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,300
 Seriously. 

737
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,990
   

738
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:17,950
 Good morning. 

739
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,200
Good morning.

740
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,940
Hello.

741
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,870
Let's see...

742
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,030
Good morning.

743
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,770
   

744
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,340
   

745
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,930
   

746
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,050
   

747
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:04,080
   

748
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,330
- Healthy... 
 -  Bodies! 

749
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,860
- Healthy... 
 -  Minds! 

750
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,160
 That's right! 

751
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,930
One!

752
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,700
Left foot! Pick it up!

753
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,460
- Teacher Son. 
 - Get right behind me!

754
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,810
Teacher Son, why are we running so fast so early in the morning?

755
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:22,260
Left foot!

756
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,780
What?

757
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,770
Did he not come home, by chance?

758
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:33,490
   

759
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:35,170
 You were thinking of me. 

760
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,480
What's going on?

761
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,650
You aren't watching me, are you?

762
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,380
Where are you?

763
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,560
You didn't forget your plan tonight, right?

764
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,220
No. See you later, after work.

765
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:55,060
I wanted to go to work together.

766
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,160
Let's go.

767
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,310
The neighborhood hasn't changed, right?

768
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,260
Is that right?

769
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,050
It's still the same.

770
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,250
I recognized it immediately.

771
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:05,670
This is why I hate Seoul.

772
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,760
It's too small.

773
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:20,360
He definitely changed the subject.

774
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,530
It means something is going on.

775
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,970
Does he not want to mention it?

776
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,950
No, first of all,

777
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,210
I need to take care of this first.

778
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,240
 It's okay. 

779
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:48,920
 It was rude of me to visit you like this. 

780
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,330
 I'm sorry. I have nothing to do with you. 

781
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:59,660
Teacher Kim, thank you, and sorry about yesterday.

782
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,280
I'm sorry.

783
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,650
Are you free this evening?

784
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,490
Okay, nice!

785
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,600
Teacher  Kim!

786
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:25,130
Yes?

787
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:27,540
Please help us.

788
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,400
We can't figure out this grammar question.

789
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,030
Let's see. This sentence is in the past tense. "Last month."

790
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,000
So it is past perfect.

791
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,900
But using "before" clarified the order of time.

792
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,930
You don't use "had PP" in this case.

793
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:50,890
Use the simple past tense then create a past perfect sentence.

794
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:52,630
- Do you understand? 
 -  Yes. 

795
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,110
Should we create five past perfect sentences?

796
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,150
- Yes. 
 - Five? Teacher...

797
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:59,360
Yes, five of them.

798
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,610
Thank you.

799
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,590
Are you okay?

800
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:13,840
Pardon me, pardon me.

801
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,770
Teacher Kim!

802
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,800
Teacher Kim, yesterday, were you sorry?

803
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,620
What?

804
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:45,340
I definitely apologized yesterday.

805
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,070
Was my apology not enough?

806
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,200
Well, no,

807
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
it's not that.

808
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,330
I-I mean...

809
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,600
I'll no longer bother you anymore.

810
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,670
Come in.

811
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,410
Have a seat there.

812
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:55,370
What kind of coffee would you like?

813
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:57,460
I'm fine.

814
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,520
I'll make you an Americano.

815
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,060
Is your leg okay?

816
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,420
Yes.

817
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:27,630
I'm glad you came, Lee Hong Ju.

818
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,410
 Your letters promised your unchanging love. 

819
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:40,960
 My book, you used to praise it. 

820
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,210
 That time we were passionately in love. 

821
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,500
 The sad reason I had no choice but to leave you. 

822
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,520
This is...

823
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,960
I can make things work without it now on.

824
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,940
Okay. Everyone, attention!

825
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,350
At ease!

826
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,890
R-Relax.

827
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:56,810
Everyone, there's no need to get nervous.

828
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:02,070
Th-The CEO of HQ is coming, but there's nothing to worry about.

829
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,520
You can just trust me.

830
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,150
Understand?

831
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:09,400
   

832
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,330
Here she comes.

833
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:16,830
 Attention. 

834
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:19,240
Welcome.

835
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,390
Hey.

836
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,490
Is she here due to the Roem case?

837
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:34,950
No, we took care of that with their legal team this morning.

838
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,060
Good work. Why is she here then?

839
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,030
You didn't tell her about our hangout, right?

840
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:41,490
Don't let her come anywhere near there.

841
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,410
She'd be furious if she found out I renovated it.

842
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,830
Okay, I said I understand.

843
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,000
Give it to me. I'll bring it inside.

844
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,200
Good luck, okay?

845
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,840
- Set, set, set. 
 -  Rock Asset. Go, go. 

846
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,100
What do you think as an animation expert?

847
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,930
Does the script need to be adjusted a lot?

848
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:12,200
Please have a look at this.

849
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,440
- What's this? 
 - It's the files I gathered after reading the script.

850
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,350
Already?

851
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:21,790
We have a lot of time. Why are you in such a hurry?

852
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:25,210
I did sketches of the things I wanted to see in the animated version.

853
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,470
So I included those too.

854
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:31,300
I suppose you know more about this book than I do.

855
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:35,050
Consider including them if there's anything you like.

856
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:37,100
Okay.

857
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,500
I'll leave this project.

858
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:48,100
Gosh, do something...

859
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,740
The view isn't bad.

860
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,050
What do you mean it isn't bad, Noona?

861
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,410
It's nothing compared to San Francisco.

862
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,990
Don't you agree, Hu Yeong? Right?

863
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:00,350
Is the house vacant, by the way?

864
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,960
No. Why would it be vacant?

865
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,850
Someone lives there.

866
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,410
Someone really nice.

867
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:10,010
Look for a business hotel that's closest to the office then.

868
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:12,100
I'll be working here starting tomorrow.

869
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,460
Why?

870
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,110
- Why? 
 - Yes.

871
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:21,000
Shall we say I'm inspecting the Korean branch?

872
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:31,740
If you're doing this because of me,

873
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:35,740
stuff like this won't change my mind.

874
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,390
I won't change my mind, either.

875
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,590
I won't return alone.

876
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,650
I'll leave now.

877
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,710
Wait.

878
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:01,900
Won't you give me time to look through it?

879
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,300
Contact me if you have any questions.

880
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,950
Mr. Bang, are you okay?

881
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:19,160
I'm okay.

882
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:22,380
I'm okay.

883
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,900
Don't come close.

884
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,690
I'll read the files...

885
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:41,430
I'll read them later. Y-You can leave now.

886
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,730
Oppa, what's wrong? Are you sick?

887
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,930
If I were sick...

888
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:57,030
If I left because I was ill...

889
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,020
would you take me back?

890
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:27,690
   

891
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:00,450
 Hey, Kang Hu Yeong! Wait right there. I'll be right over. 

892
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,270
 Wait. 

893
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:11,670
 What? I told him to wait. 

894
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:22,980
 Timing and subtitles by the  
🔮Meant to Be Together🍀 Team @viki.com 

895
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:31,450
 Is this yours, by chance? 

896
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,270
   

897
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,900
 These are the films I like, 

898
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,450
 but it's not mine. 

899
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:50,520
 Whose is it? Did someone leave it here? 

900
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,900
 It's mine. 

901
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:04,260
 My son unexpectedly likes the cute type. 

902
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,950
 Pardon? 

903
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:21,000
 If the question I got wrong reappears on the exam, 

904
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,700
 would I be able to... 

905
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,890
♫  I hope you, whom I like  ♫

906
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:41,160
 Would I be able to... 

907
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,240
 Write the right answer this time? 

908
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,130
♫  Will like me, too  ♫

909
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:59,800
♫  I hope you come a bit closer to my heart now  ♫

910
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:11,260
♫  Did we reunite by coincidence?  ♫

911
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:14,510
 I'll do it right this time. 

912
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:17,780
 - Do what? 
 - Call it going astray or a rebellion. 

913
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,690
 - Over there! 
 - Run, run! 

914
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:22,540
 - What? Did you quit your job? 
 - Lee Hong Ju, my arm, my arm. 

915
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:25,170
 They say people die if they change suddenly. 

916
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,580
 It's probably that girl, Lee Hong Ju. 

917
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,230
 Since these are your feelings, you throw these away. 

918
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:34,980
 I'd like you to let go of Hu Yeong. 

919
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:37,130
 Shouldn't you trust me first? 

920
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,750
 What if you end up going? 

921
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:42,310
 Am I supposed to not know anything and find out after you leave? 

922
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:44,860
♫  In my heart  ♫

923
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:47,910
♫  Now you...  ♫
