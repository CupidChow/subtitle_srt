I didn't get hit by a car.

I fell trying to dodge it.

11

Why did they contact you?

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,000
You must be busy. I'm sorry. I'll take care of the rest.

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,420
- Lee Hong Ju. 
 - I'm really okay so you can leave now.

Why do you insist that I leave? Where would I go?

Hey, why are you getting upset?

It's not a big deal so I don't want to bother you.

Yesterday, he yelled at me.

39
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,780

Lee Hong Ju, what an impure imagination.

45
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,360
You're Hye Ji's friend. You shouldn't think this!

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,880
Gosh, seriously.

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,420
Please hold your head still. 
    

48
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,830
Okay, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,400
Vice Principal, Sir.

50
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,020
Yes, Teacher Kim.

51
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,260
Please lead the end-of-the-day assembly for my class.

52
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,520
Why? What's going on?

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,620
Hong Ju was in a car accident and is in hospital.

54
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,040
What?

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,280
Did she get injured a lot?

56
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,060
Where is the hospital? I'm going.

57
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,990
You said you have an evening meeting, Dad.

58
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,030
She just woke up and is being examined now.

59
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,810
How did she get into an accident?

60
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,100
Car accident complications can be so scary.

61
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,940
- Teacher Sohn. 
 - Yes.

62
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,740
- You brought your car, didn't you? 
 - I did.

63
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,350
Yes, then you should go to the hospital with Teacher Kim.

64
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,430
One of our alumni had an accident. She was taken to the hospital.

65
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,060
- Oh, no. 
 - No, Teacher Sohn. I can go alone.

66
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,590
Aftermath management is important in car accidents.

67
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,820
Just you two girls, they'll look down on you for no reason.

68
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,360
Vice Principal, we're not two girls. We're adults.

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
Please hold the end-of-the-day assembly for my class.

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,840
Don't worry, Teacher Sohn.

71
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,780
Y-You…

72
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,560
They've never managed an accident before.

73
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,740
Let me take you there.

74
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,840
Yes.

75
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,590
Sir, I'm the person who called you earlier.

76
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,410
The security office?

77
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,150
Yes, yes. Thank you. Yes.

78
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,150
He even left his suitcase.

79
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,020
Why did he suddenly come to a hospital?

80
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,820
Teacher Kim!

81
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,250
♫  You, I like you  ♫

82

84
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,560
Gosh, I almost died.

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,650
You saved me again, Teacher Sohn.

86
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,950
Where did he go?

87
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,860
Change into sneakers.

88
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,170
♫  Should I tell him I like him?  ♫

89
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,600
♫  Tell me that you like me  ♫

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,180
They'll fit better if you tie them up a little tighter.

91
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,940
♫  The truth is  ♫

92
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,630
I washed them so they're clean. 
 ♫  I'm fine with everything  ♫

93
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,720
They're big, but thank you.

94
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,030
♫  You, I like you  ♫

95
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,810
I'll park and let you know. 
 ♫  I like you, too  ♫

96
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,340
Yes, please do.

97
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,860
Ahjussi.

98
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,840
Teacher Kim.

99
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,520
- Wait in the waiting room. I'll call you later. 
 - Okay.

100
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,950
Anyway, thank you, Kang Hu Yeong.

101
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,740
You must feel guilty for yelling at me yesterday.

102
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,430
I'll accept the apology.

103
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,420
You might as well take care of me.

104
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,100
Why do you justify it for me?

105
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,180
You keep…

106
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,810
Look forward.

107
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,830
Tell the doctor that your neck hurts.

108
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,220
Is she okay? Where's she right now?

109
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,350
Since there was no serious injury, she's coming down. She'd come to the lobby.

110
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,930
Why didn't she just get hospitalized?

111
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,320
I know,

112
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,560
but she hates hospitals.

113
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,000
Seriously.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,460
Ahjussi,

115
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,890
you already knew, right?

116
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,320
I know she hates to look for guardians at hospitals,

117
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,480
but she has guardians. She has me and you, too.

118
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,190
Not that.

119
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,090
What then?

120
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,610
That Hu Yeong likes Hong Ju.

121
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,890
To be honest, I didn't know it was this serious.

122
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,720
He's probably never been so reckless in his life!

123
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,030
He's so reckless.

124
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,510
Ahjussi,

125
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,100
do you want to team up with me?

126
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,700
Is Hye Ji here? 
    

127
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,100
- I told her we were on our way down. 
 - I see.

128
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Did you have fun with Hye Ji last night?

129
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,420
She's really popular, right?

130
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,010
You should be honored.

131
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,520
Lee Hong Ju,

132
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,450
Kim Hye Ji and I…

133
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,560
   

134
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,470
♫  To you  ♫

135
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,170
 I'll have to keep ignoring this, too, won't I? 

136
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:06,240
♫  There are so many things I want to tell you  ♫

137
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,300
♫  Standing in front of you again after a long time  ♫

138
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,150
Crazy… 
 ♫  I'm unable to say a word  ♫

139
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,850
What? 
 ♫  I love you so much  ♫

140
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,930
No, it's nothing.

141
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:29,110
♫  Why is it so hard to say this?  ♫

142
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,340
♫  I really want you  ♫

143
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,900
♫  I always want to be  ♫

144
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:42,420
Kang Hu Yeong, we need to talk. 
 ♫  By your side  ♫

145
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,550
I'm asking you a favor.

146
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,930
Don't be so offended by it.

147
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,040
Are you asking me to leave again?

148
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,390
Can you stop flirting?

149
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,610
Stop doing what?

150
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,460
You may be used to this since you lived in the USA,

151
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,610
but it can easily lead to misunderstandings.

152
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,860
Of course, I'm not saying I misunderstood you.

153
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,820
It's just that I'm kind of conservative. It makes me uncomfortable.

154
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,520
Hey.

155
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,610
So please be careful, okay?

156
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,910
Hye Ji!

157
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,840
Lee Ddoong!

158
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,340
 "Flirting"? 

159
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,900
 "Flirting"? 

160
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,100
Lee Ddoong!

161
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,880
Why do you look like this?

162
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,220
It wasn't just a light accident.

163
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,050
You're wearing a cast too.

164
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,770
Kim Hye Ji, what took you so long?

165
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,160
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,400
A car hit me.

167
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,970
A car this big hit me at a crazy speed.

168
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,620
I dodged it, but my leg bled a lot.

169
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,880
Look at my forehead too.

170
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,660
It hurt a lot. Look.

171
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,210
What jerk tore my best friend's forehead?

172
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,370
Who drives like that?

173
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,260
I was so scared.

174
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,750
Gosh,that must have hurt. I'm sorry.

175
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,700
Kang Hu Yeong!

176
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,960
It's Uncle.

177
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,460
Hey, Uncle.

178
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,420
Did you have to abandon your stuff?

179
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,910
Use hydrogen peroxide to wash it…

180
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,440
I was busy being flirtatious.

181
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,820
It hurts.

182
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,680
Where else did you get hurt?

183
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,410
By the way, why did you call Kang Hu Yeong?

184
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,570
What should I do? I couldn't come right away due to the class.

185
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,890
How about Kwon Sang Pil?

186
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,020
I don't know. At that moment, I just thought of him.

187
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,400
Geez. Anyway, I'm done playing Cupid.

188
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
Go ahead and start dating him now.

189
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,260
The thing is…

190
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,100
Gyeong Taek!

191
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,740
Gyeong Taek!

192
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,600
What's this now?

193
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,700
I didn't want to tell you like this,

194
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,800
but I'm…

195
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,420
dating Gyeong Taek.

196
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,720
What?

197
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,260
What?

198
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,470
What about Kang Hu Yeong?

199
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,320
What do you mean? So what if he was my first love?

200
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,000
Gyeong Taek says he likes me a lot.

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,370
Right, Gyeong Taek?

202
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,560
Yes, I do.

203
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,460
I've liked Teacher Kim for a long time.

204
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,830
I went on a blind date to hide it. I'm sorry, Hong Ju.

205
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,970
I'm so sorry.

206
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,370
Well, you don't have to apologize to me.

207
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,690
I told Hu Yeong yesterday so he knows.

208
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,920
I tried to tell you yesterday, but you left.

209
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,120
- So congratulate me. 
 - What do you mean?

210
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,580
I will on the way home. Let's go.

211
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,790
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable taking their car?

212
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,730
Hu Yeong, you said you were going home, right?

213
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,580
- Yes, why? 
 - Then stay with Lee Ddoong.

214
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,700
She can't climb up to the rooftop in this state.

215
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,800
You also have many rooms in your hideout.

216
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,380
- Kim Hye Ji! 
 - Good idea.

217
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,030
I felt bad leaving you behind. This is good.

218
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,150
Rest at our hideout.

219
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,700
Stop. I can take care of myself.

220
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,440
Uncle, let's go home right now. I'm tired even standing right now.

221
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,020
Yes, let's go. Let's go. Get in.

222
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,780
CEO Baek, didn't you say you had to go back to the office?

223
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,030
We're going back to school. Let us drive you.

224
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,010
It'd be inconvenient to stop by the hangout.

225
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,080
What do you mean, inconvenient? It's right there—

226
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,260
I have a work emergency. I need to get going.

227
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,640
Hu Yeong, take good care of Lee Ddoong.

228
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,410
Lee Ddoong, take good care of yourself.

229
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,800
I'll treat you to a barbecue later.

230
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,200
We're going. Let's go.

231
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,220
- Let's go. 
 - Uncle!

232
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,930
Lee Ddoong, this is a critical time. Good luck.

233
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,620
Wait…

234
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,840
Bye!

235
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,420
 - Hey. 
 - Drive her back safely. 

236
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,990
 Take good care of yourself, okay? 

237
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,940
What's wrong with everyone?

238
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,100
Let's go home.

239
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,150
I'm uncomfortable around him.

240
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,290
Let's go.

241
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,710
It seems an important call. Why not answer it?

242
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,670
Gosh, the loud vibrating noise woke me up.

243
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,400
Yes, CEO Bae. Did the meeting go well?

244
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,230
Do you like her that much?

245
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,020
I'm happy for you, too.

246
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,330
Pardon?

247
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,620
Yes, I like Teacher Kim a lot.

248
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,900
I really like her a lot.

249
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,800
Teacher Son, you can stop now.

250
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,040
We're not dating at all.

251
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,100
I'm sorry. I must have imposed on you, didn't I?

252
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,500
Not at all.

253
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,850
I tried my best,

254
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,980
but I don't think they'd believe I was your boyfriend.

255
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,610
I believed it.

256
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,200
What's the point of you believing it?

257
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
Hey…

258
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,640
What the heck?

259
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,360
You wanted to help Hu Yeong and Lee Ddoong get together,

260
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,950
but why did you lie about dating this teacher?

261
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,340
Teacher Kim wanted Hong Ju and me to…

262
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,360
She didn't want your nephew to get the wrong idea.

263
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,500
I went on a blind date with Hong Ju.

264
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,970
Hong Ju and who did?

265
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,240
I did.

266
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,260
You…

267
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,790
Is he that person then?

268
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,060
Yes.

269
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,300
By the way, you fooled me completely.

270
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,500
I thought you actually liked Teacher Kim, seriously.

271
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,050
You're a good actor.

272
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,660
- You are. 
 - Okay, Uncle. We heard you.

273
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,600
I sent the design edit to the director.

274
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,930
No, of course, I'll be there until the end.

275
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,100
We'll start planning the new project now so it's okay.

276
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,900
Since I wasn't there today, I'll be there next week.

277
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,980
I can still review it so send me the edited version when it's done. Okay.

278
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,940
   

279
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,160
Talk to her if you need to.

280
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,300
I'm done now.

281
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,500
It's not urgent.

282
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,200
Everyone must have been worried that I didn't show up to the meeting.

283
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,400
Don't you skip out anymore?

284
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,700
How can I skip work?

285
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,650
You often did when we were in school.

286
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,490
You skipped school and stayed up all night with me.

287
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,000
When did we do that?

288
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,950
Now you're making stuff up.

289
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,390
Don't you remember?

290
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,760
The day we went to Cheorwon together?

291
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,770
 Why would I sleep with you? 

292
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,440
 When did I say that? 

293
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,890
 Of course, we'd sleep separately. 

294
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,390
   

295
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,610
Let's get a taxi on the main street.

296
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,820
We can go to the bus terminal that way.

297
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,670
At least you know how to think.

298
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,660
How good are you at thinking that you're here now?

299
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,220
 That little… 

300
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,000
Today I wanted to show you what true love is,

301
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
but the timing didn't work out.

302
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,200
Let's meet again when Oppa Jun Ho gets discharged.

303
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,120
Then I'll show you our love.

304
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,580
Kang Hu Yeong?

305
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,360
Hey.

306
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,240
Where are you?

307
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,970
This isn't funny. Come out!

308
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,330
 Lee Hong Ju. 

309
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,920
Kang Hu Yeong.

310
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,880
Hey, why are you down there?

311
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,900
   

312
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,600
The ground was too wet.

313
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,640
I don't think I can just climb up.

314
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,200
Is there a rope or stick around?

315
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,710
   

316
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,320
Look at yourself.

317
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,990
Gosh, are you stupid?

318
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,760
Are you going to keep laughing?

319
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,790
I'll find something we can use.

320
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,430
I'll never get involved with you again.

321
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:56,950
   

322
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,320
Lee Hong Ju?

323
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,390
Lee Hong Ju.

324
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,820
L-Lee Hong Ju? L-Lee Hong Ju! Lee Hong Ju!

325
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,220
What? What? What? What?

326
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,640
Find something quickly.

327
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,220
I'm looking right now.

328
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,760
- Lee Hong Ju. 
 - Gosh, what?

329
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,500
You can't leave me here, okay?

330
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,840
I would never do that, okay?

331
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,910
   

332
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,780
   

333
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,250
Lee Hong Ju.

334
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,800
Are you a fool?

335
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,970
You… you tried to lift me up with this?

336
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,590
They say, "When you are drowning, you cling to the grass."

337
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,170
That's a saying about using the worst option!

338
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,500
Is that so?

339
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,740
"Is that so?"

340
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,250
I'm asking you why you are here.

341
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,130
You also left your bag and phone up there.

342
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,320
How could you jump in unless you're an idiot?

343
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,880
Yes, I'm an idiot.

344
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,060
I couldn't come up with a solution because I'm stupid.

345
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,440
I called you, but you didn't answer.

346
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,730
I thought you were drowning.

347
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,930
 - Pull. 
 - A little more. 

348
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,370
 Try pulling harder. 

349
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,870
 Hey, Kang Hu Yeong! 

350
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,850
 Are you okay? 

351
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,610
 Are you okay? Hey! 

352
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,140
 What do I do? 

353
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,010
 Kang Hu Yeong! 

354
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,110
 Kang Hu Yeong! 

355
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,430
You should have called 911 first.

356
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,070
I know.

357
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,770
I know I'm thoughtless and stupid.

358
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,390
I didn't say you're thoughtless.

359
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,460
Hey, is your head okay?

360
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,870
Yes, it's okay.

361
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,320
How about you? Are you hurt?

362
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,130
I'm fine.

363
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,340
We don't have to worry.

364
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,470
The ground is solid. It wasn't a swamp.

365
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,370
What would you have done if it were?

366
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,580
Why would you worry about it when it isn't?

367
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,950
Aren't you scared being in here?

368
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,920
Why would I be scared when you're here with me?

369
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,870
Looking for a rope alone was scarier, okay?

370
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,010
A frog was croaking right next to my ear.

371
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,130
Croak, croak, croak.

372
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,980
What's so scary about a frog?

373
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,490
♫  I always believed in myself until I met you  ♫

374
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,460
♫  I wanted to live splendidly  ♫

375
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,690
What a chicken. 
 ♫  I thought I'd find happiness in there  ♫

376
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,540
♫  I'll teach you to fly high in the sky so you can fulfill your dreams  ♫

377
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,320
It looks like you remember.

378
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,020
We barely escaped after the sun came up.

379
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,780
The soldiers found us.

380
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,230
You were shaking all night in fear.

381
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,640
When did I?

382
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,380
I remember everything, okay?

383
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,170
You were going to…

384
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,600
Where was it? You were going somewhere.

385
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,680
- Seoul National University. 
 - Yes, Seoul National University.

386
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Why were you going there?

387
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,330
- I had an interview. 
 - Yes, an interview.

388
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,580
"Interview"? What interview?

389
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,000
An interview about when,

390
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,610
why, and how I became good at math.

391
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,290
Anyway, I can't believe that happened.

392
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,930
I completely forgot about it.

393
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,630
How could you forget that?

394
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,300
I'm good at forgetting bad memories.

395
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,020
Is it a bad memory for you?

396
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,740
Everything linked to Bang Jun Ho is bad.

397
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:53,550
How is that related to Bang Jun Ho?

398
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,040
It was your memory with me.

399
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,960
What are you doing?

400
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,020
I'll do it.

401
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,650
Is this being flirtatious?

402
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,990
I know you're trying to help, but I'm okay.

403
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,200
I should be able to do it myself.

404
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,070
It's not like you're going to keep helping me.

405
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,360
You can let me help when I'm around.

406
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,950
I suppose.

407
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,740
Anyway, thank you.

408
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,450
I'll text you a fried chicken gift card.

409
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,990
Will you climb up the stairs like that?

410
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,440
Gosh, of course.

411
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,810
Do you want a piggyback ride?

412
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,030
It's okay.

413
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,560
Would it be better if I carried you?

414
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,610
Shut up while I'm being nice—

415
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,160
Nice catch!

416
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,090
Thank you for letting me live.

417
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:27,270
I'll eat and play more for the rest of my life.

418
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,340
Shouldn't you thank me?

419
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,660
I'll send you three fried chicken gift cards.

420
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,550
Who said fried chicken would do?

421
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,800
Give me the prescription. I'll get your medicine.

422
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,060
It's okay. I can get it tomorrow.

423
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,100
Give it to me.

424
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,640
What do you want for dinner?

425
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,670
No, I'm okay. I'll lie down for a bit and go.

426
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,270
Try saying you're okay one more time.

427
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,570
I need to get groceries. Get some rest.

428
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,700
What's wrong with him?

429
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,870
Gosh, I don't know. I'm hungry.

430
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,490
I feel sick because I'm hungry.

431
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,590
Thank you.

432
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,880
It's nice to see it.

433
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,640
He's taking good care of you until the end.

434
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,950
Let's raise our glasses.

435
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,080
 Thank you so much. 

436
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,740
 Wow, this is a refreshing combination. 

437
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,150
Kim Hye Ji, Lee Hong Ju's landlord without Lee Hong Ju,

438
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,680
and who's this?

439
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,660
He's Lee Ddoong's blind date

440
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,110
and Teacher Kim's boyfriend for the day.

441
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,560
You're into extreme stuff, aren't you?

442
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,350
 - That's my coat. 
 - He's not "Hyungnim." He's a teacher. 

443
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,860
"A teacher"?

444
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,620
I'm Son Gyeong Taek, a PE teacher at Ohbok High School.

445
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,840
Yes, hello.

446
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,860
Can I pour you some soju?

447
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,690
Y-Yes.

448
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,350
Let him introduce himself, too.

449
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,390
I know the landlord. What for?

450
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,600
He's Kang Hu Yeong's uncle.

451
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,200
What?

452
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,360
No way. He looks too different from him.

453
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,280
Mr. Kwon,

454
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,510
you're hurting my feelings. What do you mean, different?

455
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,380
Look carefully.

456
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,800
- I see the resemblance. 
 - Right?

457
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,390
Like Hu Yeong's mom.

458
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,350
You're right because I'm her brother, but…

459
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:56,790
- How crazy. No, this is still Ohbok-dong. 
 - My eyes, nose, and mouth, look carefully.

460
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,350
Then is Kang Hu Yeong staying at…

461
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,420
A floor below Lee Ddoong's.

462
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,320
What's this? Are they making some kind of romantic film?

463
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,160
They suddenly got separated in high school,

464
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,800
but they reunited like destiny.

465
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,110
Sit.

466
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,030
You knew, didn't you?

467
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,670
You should have told me that he likes Lee Ddoong then.

468
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:27,070
He hasn't even told anyone. Why would I tell you?

469
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,490
I was being loyal and sensible.

470
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,090
I just found out because I'm quick.

471
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,100
Even a dog could see it now.

472
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,630
Hey, come on.

473
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,830
Forget your first love.

474
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,410
You had no chance with him anyway.

475
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,070
Hey.

476
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,980
Hold on.

477
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,150
Was Teacher Kim's first love Hu Yeong?

478
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,910
- Yes. 
 - Really?

479
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,830
Yes.

480
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,040
Why aren't you loyal and sensible to me?

481
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,970
Sir, is the meal to your liking?

482
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,090
Y-Yes, it's delicious.

483
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,430
What a relief.

484
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,050
It was back in high school.

485
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,380
Kang Hu Yeong was my first love

486
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,490
and his first love was my best friend.

487
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,040
What's wrong with that?

488
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,850
It was never a secret and

489
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:23,100
I ended it cleanly too.

490
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,940
I pretended to be dating Teacher Son.

491
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,210
The rest is up to them now.

492
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,460
Right?

493
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,270
Yes.

494
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:34,110
It's okay. It's okay.

495
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,610
Seriously.

496
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,180
Why did you do that, Teacher Son?

497
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,710
Pardon?

498
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,830
Hong Ju is also a graduate of Ohbok High School.

499
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,510
Ohbok High School has a very long warranty period, right?

500
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:13,330
Anyway, I wonder if Hu Yeong is taking good care of Lee Ddoong.

501
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,730
 You came. 

502
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,500
 What are you having for dinner? 

503
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,100
 You. 

504
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,430
 You're crazy, Lee Hong Ju. 

505
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,930
Go away! Go away, you demon!

506
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,810
Being (sexually) frustrated is a serious problem.

507
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,200
I'd better go home.

508
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,500
Let's go home.

509
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,590
Would it be better to crawl?

510
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,870
Okay.

511
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,550
 You never listen. 

512
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,950
Are you really Kang Hu Yeong?

513
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,170
- What are you saying? 
 - Whether you're a spirit or Kang Hu Yeong,

514
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,890
please stop worrying and leave.

515
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,180
What?

516
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,690
Hey! What are you doing? Put me down.

517
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,420
You will fall if you move.

518
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:56,400
♫  I will give you all my stars  ♫

519
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,400
♫  Our memories whenever we're apart  ♫

520
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,400
Wait a moment.

521
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,210
♫  You'd let me in your life  ♫

522
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,040
♫  Run, run, run to you  ♫

523
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,340
♫  Girl, this love has always been our own  ♫

524
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:21,370
♫  You used to have my tender, loving heart  ♫

525
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:26,350
♫  You renewed our time and made us shine  ♫

526
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,150
♫  I need you by my side  ♫

527
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,250
I saw a porridge shop so I bought some. It's good for you.

528
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,800
Rest since you must have been really shocked today.

529
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,270
Take your medicine too.

530
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,480
See you tomorrow morning.

531
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,370
Kang Hu Yeong.

532
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,880
Thank you.

533
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,940
Sure.

534
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,940
You're a good child, but

535
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:00,140
I think I have the wrong memories of you.

536
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,600
I mean, we were never really close in school.

537
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,300
I wouldn't have remembered you if it wasn't for Hye Ji.

538
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,900
I'm like that to you, too, right?

539
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,100
Honestly, we're just each other's classmate Number Three, right?

540
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,510
Call me when you wake up. I'm going.

541
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,100
Did his feelings get hurt?

542
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,210
No, it's his fault.

543
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,310
Why would he flirt?

544
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,700
 Hey! What are you doing? Put me down. 

545
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,400
See? See?

546
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,750
Kang Hu Yeong is the one who crossed the boundary first.

547
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,010
Go away.

548
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,230
Go away! Go away, you evil spirit!

549
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,110
 I mean, we were never really close in school. 

550
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,000
 I wouldn't have remembered you if it wasn't for Hye Ji. 

551
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,830
 Honestly, we're just each other's classmate Number Three, right? 

552
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,170
How many times am I getting dumped before confessing my love?

553
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,610
   

554
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,640
 Hey, aren't you supposed to be on the plane right now? 

555
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,130
 Why are you still in Korea? 

556
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,690
When are you coming back?

557
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,920
I'm coming.

558
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,470
 Come immediately. 

559
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,990
 I'm not asking you a favor. 

560
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,400
 I'm telling you as a client. 

561
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,800
   

562
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,550
No.

563
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,940
I won't go.

564
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,070
   

565
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,500
 Did you need something? 

566
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,870
 Th-The thing is... you know... 

567
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:37,260
 I was wondering if that was my seat. 

568
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,650
 I see. I thought you'd say you fell in love with me at first sight 

569
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,670
 or ask me if I'm free after school. 

570
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,080
 I thought that's what you'd say. I'm a little disappointed. 

571
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,760
 Hey, that's enough! 

572
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,430
 We need to co-exist. 

573
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,300
   

574
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,480
- Please put the chair here. 
 - Okay.

575
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,810
This will be the backdrop for the interview.

576
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,860
The writer will sit here, and you'll sit here.

577
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,070
That seems good.

578
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,200
I'm glad I'm not late.

579
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,270
I said you didn't have to come.

580
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,000
You said you stayed up all night at work.

581
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,140
I said I'd be your stylist today.

582
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,960
Anyway, you look great.

583
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,770
I'll be watching in the back so

584
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,420
you can talk comfortably.

585
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,340
You came to watch because you thought I might not do well, right?

586
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,280
No, I didn't.

587
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,270
This is Writer Bang Jun Ho's first interview after winning the award.

588
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,830
Of course, I had to see it.

589
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:54,420
And you need another person on your side in situations like this.

590
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,660
Yes.

591
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,510
Writer Bang is ready!

592
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,470
Hong Ju...

593
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,520
- Writer Bang, shall we sit down? 
 - Sure.

594
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,300
Good luck. Fighting!

595
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,380
Thank you.

596
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,960
What did you do first after hearing you won the award?

597
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,850
What did I do first?

598
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:30,130
I called someone who always reads my stories first.

599
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,830
How do you know this person?

600
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:47,310
She's my first fan, who liked my work from the beginning.

601
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:52,840
The newly born stories that are still rough

602
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:59,200
get refined based on what face she makes.

603
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,440
She helped me greatly this time too.

604
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,750
I called her and told her I had won the Young Writer Award,

605
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,420
then she burst into tears.

606
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,400
I was the one who wanted to cry,

607
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,930
but I couldn't because I had to comfort her.

608
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,960
Thank you so much for today.

609
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,180
My pleasure.

610
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,980
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

611
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,380
Please write a good report.

612
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,480
We will.

613
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,430
You said you'd watch me.

614
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,050
Lee Hong...

615
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,440
Ju.

616
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:13,950
♫  I know whenever I see you  ♫

617
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,580
Writer Bang. 
 ♫  My mood is different than usual  ♫

618
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,680
Well...

619
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,950
I know this might be rude to ask,

620
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,900
♫  I close my eyes  ♫

621
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,520
but are you seeing someone?

622
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:33,360
♫  I try to forget, but I still get reminded of you  ♫

623
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,690
♫  I miss the time when I didn't know anything  ♫

624
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,930
Yes.

625
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,940
Starting just now, I think.

626
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,260
♫  Looking in your eyes  ♫

627
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,500
♫  I keep circling around and complaining  ♫

628
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,900
♫  But my heart is beating again toward you  ♫

629
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:05,080
♫  I'm afraid of the awkward atmosphere  ♫

630
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,560
♫  I can't even start speaking  ♫

631
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,440
♫  That's why I hesitate  ♫

632
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,070
   

633
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:21,420
♫  I circle around you like this  ♫

634
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,160
How about Hong Ju? Did you see her?

635
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,800
I just discussed the contract, and that is what you ask?

636
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,800
She didn't answer my calls all day.

637
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,500
I guess she really doesn't want to work with me.

638
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,400
See, if you told her everything then,

639
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,400
she wouldn't have cried, and you would have felt better, too.

640
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,170
Told her what?

641
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,130
That I can't write a single line since I had a panic disorder?

642
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,000
That I returned the contract money and became penniless?

643
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,100
She thought I was the greatest writer in the world. I couldn't tell her that.

644
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,500
Doesn't the one you love stay

645
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,310
by your side when you hit rock bottom?

646
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:14,350
I didn't want to drag her down to stay by my side.

647
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,930
Sure, you didn't.

648
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:25,590
Hong Ju will join the project as a producer.

649
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,810
See? I said she would.

650
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,790
She joined the animation company because of me,

651
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,790
as she wanted to turn my book into an animated film.

652
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,910
   

653
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,090
I'll turn everything back to how it was.

654
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,390
   

655
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,930
Am I just classmate Number Three to you?

656
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,650
   

657
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,950
   

658
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:27,530
How about we play truth or dare?

659
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:29,390
Why would we play that now?

660
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:32,600
It's because I'm so sleepy.

661
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,510
Let's share shocking truths that can wake each other up.

662
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,720
You get hit in the head if it's not shocking.

663
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,890
How would you determine that?

664
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:48,500
It's not shocking if it doesn't perk you up.

665
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,190
Go ahead. You go first.

666
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,400
Me first?

667
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,640
Oppa Jun Ho is really freaking handsome.

668
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,870
Hey! Why did you hit me?

669
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,410
I'm sleepy.

670
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,910
Oh, really?

671
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,920
It's your turn now then.

672
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,790
Let's hear what amazing story you have.

673
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:13,610
Thinking about it...

674
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:18,910
It'd be weird to have something like that at our age.

675
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:22,150
How dare you try to get out of it? Tell me.

676
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,920
I got one math question wrong on the midterm exam.

677
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:41,700
You really are a genius, aren't you?

678
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,820
But I got one question wrong, though.

679
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,930
I've ranked last in the entire school.

680
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,670
I chose number 2 for all the questions in the English exam.

681
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,240
But I'm not joking; none of the answers was number 2.

682
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,420
I complained about it to the English teacher. How could that be?

683
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,430
There were five options and 40 questions.

684
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,660
Shouldn't at least eight answers be number 2 for it to be fair?

685
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,840
Are you surprised? Was it shocking?

686
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,330
Yes, even your nonsensical theory is shocking.

687
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,340
Right? Yes!

688
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,090
It's your turn now.

689
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,420
Just hit me.

690
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,060
I don't have anything as shocking as that.

691
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,040
Tell me.

692
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,190
I can't.

693
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,320
I've...

694
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,610
never told anyone this before.

695
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,980
My dream was to become an animation director.

696
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,140
Really?

697
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,910
Are you awake now?

698
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,150
You just made that up, right?

699
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,690
It is not your personality at all.

700
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,550
I'm serious.

701
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,110
Really?

702
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,170
I love animations, too.

703
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,550
You've seen them, too, right?

704
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,310
In our childhood, animated shows were on TV morning, afternoon, and evening.

705
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,840
I watched them all.

706
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,650
I learned of the world through animation.

707
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:25,010
I think you should learn in a different way.

708
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,450
Why did it use to be your dream?

709
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,610
Isn't it anymore?

710
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:41,290
Because dreams don't always come true.

711
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,210
Right.

712
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,300
It's just like how Santa doesn't exist.

713
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,130
He doesn't exist, but they say he does.

714
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,260
It's not possible, yet they say it is.

715
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,550
Did the animated shows teach you that too?

716
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,290
Kang Hu Yeong, give me your dream.

717
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,200
- What? 
 - I'll become an animation director.

718
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,270
My homeroom teacher keeps telling me to write about my dreams on my career report, but

719
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,960
I never had one.

720
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,400
But I have one now.

721
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,110
It's really hard to become one.

722
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,040
Everything is hard in this world.

723
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,210
You just have to do it.

724
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:27,580
Why? Don't you want to give it to me?

725
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,150
It's not that I don't want to.

726
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,270
Okay, I'll let you keep your shares.

727
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:36,870
I'll give you...

728
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,950
5% of my monthly paycheck.

729
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,000
- Really? 
 - Yes.

730
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,020
   

731
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,870
   

732
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,700
 Thanks to you. 

733
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,650
 Did you sleep well? 

734
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:16,960
A man and a woman were in the same room. How could you sleep well?

735
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,560
   

736
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,440
 Why would a man be in my house? 

737
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,110
 Gosh, watch your mouth. 

738
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:24,590
   

739
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:25,880
   

740
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,330
 I'm taking this week off. 

741
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,660
 I don't feel well at all. 

742
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,840
   

743
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,470
   

744
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:40,900
Gosh. Why would she invite him?

745
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,520
♫  Your crystal-clear smile, Baby  ♫

746
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,430
Come downstairs. Let's have breakfast.

747
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,520
Why would I?

748
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,390
Do you want me to come up then?

749
00:52:52,390 --> 00:53:01,980
♫  So I can go straight into your heart  ♫

750
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,760
♫  Your crystal-clear smile, Baby  ♫

751
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,660
- I'll— 
 - Stay seated.

752
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,530
You won't be any help walking with your leg like that.

753
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,740
Okay. I'm your guest, after all.

754
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:21,560
♫  So my heart for you stays the same forever  ♫

755
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:27,610
♫  Forever, oh, I love you  ♫

756
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:31,660
♫  You will never know  ♫

757
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,290
Is the food to your liking?

758
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,970
I like that it's not too salty.

759
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:57,710
 Hong Ju doesn't like her food too salty. 

760
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,610
 Make a meat dish on the side. 

761
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,530
You'll have dessert afterward, right?

762
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,010
I don't need a dessert; it's okay.

763
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:13,560
I need to take the tiramisu out now if you want it.

764
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,570
 I'll give you a tip. 

765
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,360
 Lee Ddoong is crazy about tiramisu. 

766
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,830
Take it out if you have it.

767
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,310
Thanks for the meal.

768
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,760
You made time to care for your injured classmate.

769
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,940
You're a good person.

770
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,550
Really? That's great to hear.

771
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,900
I'll get going now then.

772
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,850
Hold on.

773
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:57,810
I think we have more to discuss.

774
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,430
I have nothing to say.

775
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,390
Five percent.

776
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,020
"Five percent"?

777
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,490
It's 5% of your monthly paycheck.

778
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:13,430
That's my share. Don't you remember?

779
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:17,160
Why would you have a share of my paycheck? What nonsense.

780
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,430
 Okay, I'll let you keep your shares. 

781
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:21,590
 I'll give you... 

782
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:25,190
 5% of my monthly paycheck. 

783
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,920
What are you talking about?

784
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,150
Wh-What do you mean, 5%?

785
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:32,940
That was your promise

786
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,490
to your classmate Number Three.

787
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,580
You said you remembered all that happened that day.

788
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,510
Hey, that's...

789
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:45,060
How much is ten years worth?

790
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,610
You've been working hard, Lee Hong Ju.

791
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,140
Here. Enjoy.

792
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,110
I'll do the math.

793
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:57,060
You know that I'm good at math, right?

794
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,020
 Hong Ju won't be easy. 

795
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,410
 This isn't because you're my first love. 

796
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:09,950
 You don't need to know what her past relationship was like, 

797
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:15,020
 but that jerk left the country without telling her. 

798
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:18,030
 So she was dumped in the worst way. 

799
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:22,480
 Dating was the last thing she wanted. I convinced her to go on a blind date, 

800
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,790
 and she ended up meeting you. 

801
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:29,760
 - Really? 
 - I don't know what happened between you two, 

802
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:35,880
 but I want Hong Ju to be happy. 

803
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,710
 And you passed my test yesterday. 

804
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,130
 I feel so supported. 

805
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,090
 Did you confess to her yet? 

806
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:47,950
 She said I was just her classmate Number Three. 

807
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,520
 "Classmate Number Three"? 

808
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,170
 She doesn't even have classmates Number One or Two. 

809
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,110
 So what will you do? 

810
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,870
 I should get the number removed first. 

811
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,660
I said that when I was feeling weak

812
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,280
since I fell in the pit due to you.

813
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,380
That has...

814
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,030
no legal power.

815
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,560
I don't think we were feeling that weak.

816
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,840
We were.

817
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,280
We fell into the pit stuck all night. How were we not weak?

818
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,080
I wasn't.

819
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,410
I was, okay?

820
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:24,530
 People say random things before they die. 

821
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:26,210
And let's make this clear.

822
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,080
I said, "If I become a director."

823
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,640
I'm not a director. I'm just an employee at a production company.

824
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,820
So that promise doesn't count. It doesn't.

825
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,650
Are you laughing?

826
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:43,310
I didn't think you'd argue so seriously about it.

827
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:45,970
Lee Hong Ju, you really...

828
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,510
What?

829
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,320
Gosh, Kang Hu Yeong.

830
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,690
I answered seriously because it was you.

831
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,510
I thought you were trying to manage my income.

832
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:02,080
You're also inhuman. Kang Hu Yeong is like a smart preschooler.

833
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,000
Because you'd be more than capable of that.

834
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,700
Does your salary for the last ten years total 1 billion won (720,000 USD)?

835
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,700
I don't deal with anything below 1 billion won.

836
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,800
- Five percent of 10 billion is only ₩500 million ($368,000). 
 - Oh, I see.

837
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,650
You're so impressive.

838
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,650
How is work? Is it fun?

839
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,160
Whatever.

840
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,470
How could work be fun?

841
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,390
It's only fun watching animations.

842
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,270
Do you know how labor-intensive it is?

843
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:39,140
I started by collecting receipts.

844
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,820
And how dare you joke about taking 5%

845
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,490
of the tiny salary I worked so hard for?

846
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:46,250
I was just happy to see you again.

847
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,350
I didn't know you were actually making animations.

848
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:53,060
I told you. I'm just in a planning team.

849
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,460
I might not be a director,

850
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,780
but I'll debut as a producer this time.

851
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,480
Wow, how impressive.

852
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:07,130
You always surpass my expectations.

853
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,770
Well, I suppose I tend to do that.

854
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,830
Do you want to watch our work if you have time?

855
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:18,360
My name is in the ending credits too.

856
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,820
Let's watch one now.

857
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,930
Let me finish this first.

858
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,880
Enjoy it.

859
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,660
Hello.

860
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:48,120
Excuse me,

861
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,020
where is Producer Lee Hong Ju?

862
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,110
"Producer Lee"?

863
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,890
I'm tired.

864
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,820
I'll go get my laptop.

865
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,180
Do you want me to carry you again?

866
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,520
No, okay?

867
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,390
It's easier not to use the crutches.

868
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:11,840
I'll jump using one foot.

869
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,500
Stay away.

870
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Lee Hong Ju.

871
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:43,290
What brings you here, Mr. Bang?

872
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:48,620
I heard the meeting got postponed due to an accident.

873
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,700
But it doesn't seem that way.

874
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:56,480
I'm sorry the schedule was changed due to me, but—

875
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,310
Is this how much you care about your work?

876
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,100
If you neglect things like this,

877
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:08,100
I'll have to reconsider working with you.

878
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,340
You—

879
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,600
Fire me then.

880
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:31,610
Lee Hong Ju, what's wrong with you?

881
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:35,220
I'll be so upset if you don't know why I do this.

882
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,630
You said you wouldn't change your mind.

883
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:44,390
You said you'd never change.

884
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,780
You're the one who said it.

885
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,830
Did I say that?

886
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:52,400
I'm sorry,

887
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,700
but I've changed.

888
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,300
You understand why now, right?

889
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,690
Then could you leave now?

890
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,070
I didn't finish talking to you yet.

891
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:07,170
If you touch me one more time,

892
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:09,840
I'll beat you up.

893
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:41,490
Why are you sitting here like this?

894
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,360
Because my foot hurts.

895
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,950
You said you'd jump up with one foot.

896
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:49,190
Why did you act strong in your condition?

897
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,780
Does it hurt a lot?

898
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,930
It freaking hurts,

899
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,800
and I'm embarrassed.

900
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,790
I'm embarrassed that you keep finding out about my failed relationship.

901
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,980
You're making me feel bad.

902
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:20,880
I'm happy

903
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,350
that your relationship failed.

904
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:37,620
This reminds me of when we fell into the pit.

905
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:43,500
Stop reminding me of the past I want to forget.

906
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:50,970
Lee Hong Ju.

907
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:55,760
Recover soon,

908
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,180
your foot and your heart too.

909
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:40,210
♫  There are so many things I want to tell you  ♫

910
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:45,000
    
 ♫  Standing in front of you again  ♫

911
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:52,210
♫  For a long time I'm unable to say a word  ♫

912
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:56,480
♫  I love you so much  ♫

913
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,730
♫  Why is it so hard to say this?  ♫

914
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:02,660
 Memories are unreliable. 

915
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:07,890
 Because only one person remembers some memories. 

916
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:17,050
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

917
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:36,970


918
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,590
 Kang Hu Yeong. 

919
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,550
 What's going on with me? 

920
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:15,060
 My heart started racing just now. 

921
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,980
♫  I feel so strange these days  ♫

922
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:37,210
♫  It's really not like me. All day I think of you  ♫

923
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:41,210
 I must be the only one who was shocked. 

924
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:43,840
♫  I can't stop worrying about you  ♫

925
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,290
 Memories are unreliable. 

926
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:49,920
♫  My heart is pounding  ♫

927
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,940
♫  It's you  ♫

928
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:55,670
♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

929
01:07:55,670 --> 01:08:00,600
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

930
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,650
♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

931
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,630
♫  It has to be you  ♫

932
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:13,480
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

933
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:21,430
♫  I never believed in destiny  ♫

934
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,700
 Rethink it carefully starting now. 

935
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,850
 Are we really just friends? 

936
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:31,300
 - I said things are awkward between us. 
 - Hey, Hu Yeong! 

937
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,200
 I'm having more fun now. 

938
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,130
 You keep showing interest in me. 

939
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:41,070
 Just forget about Kang Hu Yeong and have fun. 

940
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,790
 You tried to kiss me just now, right? 

941
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:47,780
 I'm here to pick up Hu Yeong. 

942
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:49,470
 Are you going somewhere? 

943
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:51,610
 You really want me to leave? 

944
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:54,650
♫  It has to be you  ♫

945
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:58,380
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫
