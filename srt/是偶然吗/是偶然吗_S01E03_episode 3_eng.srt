00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,520
We can go get it.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,630
Yes, it's my favorite hair tie.

16
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,120

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,590
   

31
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,990
Are we done hiding now?

32
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,940
You work with Uncle Wook, don't you?

33
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,600
Our company is next to Rock Asset. It's that building.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,400
- That's why that man— 
 - I think you should keep the hair tie.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,040
Use it to tie your bangs.

36
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,400
He's the one who almost turned you into a carp head, right?

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,980
I was really grateful to you just now.

38
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,880
Could you play ignorant so I can stay grateful?

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,410
I should return to the office.

40
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,780
Anyway, thank you, and it was good to see you.

41
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,540
Bye.

42
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,200
I have to keep ignoring this too, right?

43
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,420
Thanks for letting me use it.

44
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,400
Go back safely.

45
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,980
She keeps sending me away.

46
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,970
You were in the restroom for a long time.

47
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,430
You were here, CEO Bae.

48
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,190
I was just about to visit you.

49
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,190
Does your heart still ache?

50
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,900
It's already been three years.

51
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,700
I'm not sure what you mean.

52
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,820
Everyone knows it was your ex who left just now.

53
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,720
When did you find out?

54
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,850
Your face was saying everything. How could I not know?

55
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,670
- I'm sorry. 
 - No need to apologize about your relationship.

56
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,600
To be honest, I'm not interested.

57
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,950
Read it and prepare for the adaptation meeting.

58
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,410
CEO Bae, I can't do this.

59
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,210
You asked me to let you debut as a senior producer for the company's tenth anniversary.

60
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,790
I did.

61
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,120
But you saw me just now.

62
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,220
Yes, I did.

63
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,800
You said, "I won't discuss with you," to his face.

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,220
- CEO Bae. 
 - Do you think opportunities always suit your liking?

65
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,310
You all saw it just then, right?

66
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,130
There's no such thing as beautiful love.

67
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,710
But what are we?

68
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,620
We're creators who create sincere fantasies.

69
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,830
Let's work instead of falling in love. Work!

70
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,850
   

71
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,690
 I have to keep ignoring this too, right? 

72
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,670
 Thanks for letting me use it. 

73
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,760
Kang Hu Yeong.

74
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,320
Oh, you came.

75
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,850
How about Lee Ddoong? Did she go back?

76
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,330
Uncle, who was that guy earlier?

77
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,510
Why ask about that son of a gun?

78
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,070
His name is Bang Jun Ho.

79
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,320
Who? Whom did you say he was?

80
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,070
Writer Bang Jun Ho. He published a book.

81
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,340
Hey!

82
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,510
   

83
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,860
   

84
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,590
   

85
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,900
 That man was... 

86
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,400
Bang Jun Ho?

87
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,280
I gave Peter's Pen my script.

88
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,230
 Do you insist on making the animated film? 

89
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,740
 It won't make any money. 

90
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,640
 You haven't even finished your new novel. 
   

91
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,650
You have to do the autograph event too.

92
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,240
I can do everything.

93
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,120
I'm in the best condition right now.

94
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,190
 How about Hong Ju? Did you see her? 

95
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,780
Did you get a slap in the face?

96
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,080
 Is that funny? 

97
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,190
 You really are a rascal. 

98
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,440
 Hong Ju visited me dozens of times after you suddenly left. 

99
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,690
 I couldn't tell her where you went; you asked me not to. 

100
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,460
 Seeing her sob made me so angry. 

101
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,350
 I would have beaten you up if I were her parent. 

102
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,400
Many people hate me here, too.

103
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,120
 I hate you, too. You jerk. 

104
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,180
Should I sign my next contract with someone else then?

105
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,110
You scum.

106
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,810
I'll discuss the adaptation with Hong Ju.

107
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,480
 Will she agree to? 

108
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,620
Of course, she will.

109
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,140
 There's no way Hong Ju could say no. 

110
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,250
   

111
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,190
   

112
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,560
   

113
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,080
 Was it all Bang Jun Ho? 

114
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,690
Yes! Is it so surprising that it was him?

115
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,470
You'll be more shocked to hear how much the sofa and carpet cost.

116
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,410
Geez, seriously!

117
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,420
Uncle, you know what?

118
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,420
When I was in high school, I wrote a lengthy book recommendation in the library.

119
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,900
I asked them to buy Bang Jun Ho's book.

120
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,090
Were you his fan, too—

121
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,980
Were you his fan, too?

122
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,400
That's not all.

123
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,240
 I should be going with you. 

124
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,520
 It's too bad I have a class. 

125
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,950
 You're doing the interview 

126
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,610
 as a medalist and the representative of Ohbok High. 

127
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,970
 There's no need to be too humble. 

128
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,310
 If someone exceptional as you acts like that, 

129
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,150
 it comes across as more annoying. 

130
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,170
 Guys there are talented, too. 

131
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,400
 But you're different. 

132
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,260
 You're the only one from a regular high school. 

133
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,330
 Yes. I'll be right back. 

134
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,020
 Okay. 

135
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,630
 Don't talk about me too much. 

136
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,140
 Okay. 

137
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,750
   

138
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,410
 Aigoo, which award are you receiving today? 

139
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,840
 I'm doing an interview today. 
   

140
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,490
You're Ohbok High's pride, Hu Yeong.

141
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,450
Thank you.

142
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,280
Sure. Safe travels.

143
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,320
What?

144
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,990
What's with you?

145
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,570
It's my bag.

146
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,300
Cl-Classes started. Where are you going?

147
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,160
What do you care?

148
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,950
I'm going home because I'm sick, okay?

149
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,660
How about you? Where will you go instead of class?

150
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,130
- Seoul National University. 
 - "Seoul National University"?

151
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,790
I'm being interviewed as an International Math Olympiad medalist.

152
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,820
Is that so?

153
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,560
Seriously.

154
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,720
You're dead if you tell anyone you saw me!

155

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:35,880
♫  Show me your smile, Baby, that's as white as snow  ♫

165
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:45,880
♫  So my heart for you stays the same forever  ♫

166
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,460
♫  Even if it's not such a splendid world  ♫

167
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:04,410
♫  There's a world I've been dreaming just for you  ♫

168
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,630
♫  I'll teach you to fly high in the sky so you can fulfill your dreams  ♫

169
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,660
♫  True happiness always lies in your own heart  ♫

170
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,070
    
 ♫  Sometimes, the warm sunlight  ♫

171
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,640
    
 ♫  Shines on your shoulders  ♫

172
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,820
♫  Can you think of me as another you?  ♫

173
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,450
   

174
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,270
♫  I always believed in myself until I met you  ♫

175

176
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,080
♫  Real happiness is always within your heart  ♫

177
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,410
♫  Baby, trust me  ♫

178
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:44,600
♫  Your crystal-clear smile, Baby, show me your smile  ♫

179
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,840
   

180
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,880
♫  So my heart for you stays the same forever  ♫

181
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,030
When does the earliest bus to Seoul leave?

182
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,310
In 20 minutes.

183
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,920
I'll take one ticket.

184
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,550
♫  Forever, oh, I love you  ♫

185
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,540
♫  You will never know  ♫

186
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,480
Wow, is Seoul National University around here (86 km away)?

187
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
- Of course not. 
 - Exactly.

188
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,300
Why are you here?

189
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,380
I took the wrong bus.

190
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,020
That's a lame excuse.

191
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,030
Do you live in Cheorwon then?

192
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,040
What was the school's phone number?

193
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,710
Hey, come on!

194
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,580
You're playing hooky, too.

195
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,360
You can't threaten me like that.

196
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,700
I'm not playing hooky (skip school).

197
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,300
   

198
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,440
Are you giving up? Playing hooky is too much for you.

199
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,320
I'm leaving later in the evening, okay?

200
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,810
Is that so?

201
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,030
Then have fun.

202
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,520
   

203
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,080
♫  I look at the old photo in front of the fire  ♫

204
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,550
♫  I stare at it for a long, long time  ♫

205
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:13,410
♫  I try to finally express my heart  ♫

206
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,380
♫  Slowly, slowly  ♫

207
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,310
You're following me right now.

208
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,600
Hey, I don't want to talk to you, either, okay?

209
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,370
Why are you following me?

210
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,500
I don't know, either.

211
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,790
Why did I follow you?

212
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,450
 The next stop is Jingyeong Army Base entrance. 

213
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:50,290
 The next stop is Cheorwon Forest. 

214
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,250
♫  In the midst of the smoke  ♫

215
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,090
Let's get off.

216
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,300
Why?

217
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,440
You said you were following me.

218
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,680
♫  Seeing the photo where I'm smiling awkwardly  ♫

219
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,770
♫  I was very happy then  ♫

220
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,130
♫  I ignored my feelings like a fool  ♫

221
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,690
♫  I'm sorry I've been complaining  ♫

222
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:26,520
♫  I shed my old worries and throw them in the fire  ♫

223
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,410
♫  Slowly, slowly, I'll come to you  ♫

224
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,200
Where are we going?

225
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,300
You won't know. Just follow me.

226
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,920
You aren't going to some weird religious center, right?

227
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,320
Maybe I am. Isn't your heart racing?

228
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,020
You're excited and thrilled to see what interesting event will unfold.

229
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,080
I'm anxious and worried.

230
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,590
That's a part of the excitement.

231
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,190
Where are we going?

232
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,450
Over there.

233
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,770
   

234
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,200
Hold on.

235
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,920
- Did you come here to visit someone? 
 - No.

236
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,850
I'm here to confess my love.

237
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,690
What do I do? I'm so nervous.

238
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,980
Let's go! Let's do it!

239
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,100
For love.

240
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,470
 You visited Bang Jun Ho at his army base? 

241
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,950
You even played hooky?

242
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,380
So was that all Bang Jun Ho?

243
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,230
But why?

244
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,180
With even Lee Ddoong?

245
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,140
Why would you visit Bang Jun Ho with Lee Ddoong?

246
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,020
You... Hey, you... you!

247
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,060
It wasn't Ms. Kim?

248
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,870
Seriously...

249
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,290
So my tenant and best friend, Lee Ddoong...

250
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,310
Was Lee Hong Ju your first love then?

251
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,020
Uncle, my head is hurting so much.

252
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,560
Could you just think silently?

253
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,870
Oh my gosh!

254
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:12,920
Are you staying a week longer to spend time with Hong Ju?

255
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,500
What if you fall for her even more?

256
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,800
Not returning to the U.S. because of Hong Ju wasn't part of the plan!

257
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
I know you very well.

258
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,510
You've never failed because you resemble your perfectionist mom.

259
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,800
And I know everything has gone your way since you're smart.

260
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,660
Everything has gone your way all this time, right?

261
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,600
Is it a problem that I'm smart?

262
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,590
Yes, Lee Hong Ju is your problem now.

263
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,510
I understand why you're like this because it's Lee Ddoong, but...

264
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,060
Wow! But I don't know if she will act as you predict.

265
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,700
- You're not even her type. 
 - Uncle!

266
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,960
I warned you, okay?

267
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,290
I warned you! All right?

268
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,390
 How was the blind date? 

269
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,940
 The thing is— 

270
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,880
Try meeting my niece if it didn't work out.

271
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,320
She just got a job, and she wants to get married.

272
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,890
She's 25 years old.

273
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,630
I think you two would make such a nice couple.

274
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,230
Gosh, Ma'am...

275
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,080
Your niece wouldn't like me.

276
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,140
Gosh, I wouldn't just introduce her to anyone.

277
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,220
There's no one like you these days.

278
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,940
You're kindhearted, dependable, and clean-cut.

279
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,760
He has a full head of hair too.

280
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,400
By the way, Teacher Son has high standards.

281
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,010
Look. He won't even bat an eye at me.

282
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,790
N-No, no, I...

283
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,840
My niece is younger than you, Ms. Kim.

284
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,410
And she's a natural beauty like me.

285
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,370
Gosh, Teacher Oh.

286
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,510
That's so old school to mention being a natural beauty.

287
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,610
Could you tell your niece

288
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,020
to see a dermatologist once she gets her first paycheck?

289
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,970
Teacher Son, could we talk for a second?

290
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,700
Well, I didn't want to say this because it hurts my pride,

291
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,950
but why won't you ask Hong Ju out again?

292
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,260
The thing is that I...

293
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,920
I'm not saying this because she's my friend.

294
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,570
Her charm is like a black hole.

295
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,820
Once you fall for her, there's no going back. That's why.

296
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,650
I can guarantee it, okay?

297
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,020
Even I've been smitten with her for over a decade.

298
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:50,780
Ms. Kim, she said she has no interest in dating.

299
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:56,650
What? She thought you weren't interested in her.

300
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,370
Come on. It was just a misunderstanding.

301
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,300
Call Hong Ju right now, Teacher Son.

302
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,930
Teacher Kim, to be honest, I...

303
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,920
Let's go.

304
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,870
Teacher Son,

305
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,940
you can't go on another blind date, okay?

306
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,840
Her niece is weird.

307
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,150
Okay.

308
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,470
   
   

309
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,280
She parked here again.

310
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,100
How many times do I have to tell her?

311
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,600
Seriously.

312
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,920
   

313
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,250
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep... 

314
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,600
Okay, you won't answer?

315
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,920
Should I just crash into it?

316
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,630
I told her not to park here—

317
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,070
   

318
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,710
Yes, what's the matter?

319
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,870
Did you look at the data Mr. Kang assembled?

320
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,510
Yes.

321
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,220
 It was completely faultless. 

322
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,770
 What more does he have to check that he postponed his departure? 

323
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,680
I didn't like him from the beginning.

324
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,670
 He knows too well that he's superior. 

325
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,630
To be honest, he is superior.

326
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,030
Hey, so what if he's all that?

327
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,400
 His head is probably filled with nothing but numbers. 

328
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,680
This is how it went, right?

329
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,510
   

330
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,370
   

331
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,610
He should have told me.

332
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,820
Hey.

333
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,910
What's with you?

334
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,180
- What about me? 
 - You got promoted.

335
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,960
Didn't you know?

336
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,850
Should I congratulate you or not?

337
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,920
I heard the new office is owned by a prominent Korean family.

338
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,220
It hasn't been confirmed yet.

339
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,160
What do you mean? Your mom told me to send you back to HQ immediately.

340
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,680
I'll figure it out.

341
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,620
Where are you going?

342
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,580
You should have dinner, at least.

343
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,570
 Hu Yeong! 

344
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,330
 Success or love? 

345
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,750
 It's that cliche of a problem again. 

346
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,170
 Lee Hong Ju, I'm glad you're here. 

347
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:22,970
 He's the one who almost turned you into a carp head, right? 

348
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,010
 I have to keep ignoring this too, right? 

349
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,890
Ignoring would be better.

350
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,180
Hey, Kang Hu Yeong. Funny to run into you here.

351
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,840
Are you heading home, too?

352
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,520
We run into each other because we share the same route.

353
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,340
The property values went up a lot around here.

354
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,570
I should have bought a place a long time ago.

355
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,750
Is your project in Korea going well?

356
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,690
It's going okay.

357
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,460
When are you returning to the U.S.?

358
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,140
I don't know.

359
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,400
I suppose you never inform before leaving.

360
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,860
Kang Hu Yeong,

361
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,620
do you want fried chicken?

362
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,340
 I surprised you, didn't I? 

363
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,530
You did. How could this happen?

364
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,000
Are you really Uncle Wook's nephew?

365
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,550
We really must be meant to be, Hu Yeong.

366
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,240
I know.

367
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,060
Unnie, we'll have a half order of spicy plus half order fried chicken and a coke.

368
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,320
Why half and half? You always order a whole chicken per person.

369
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,660
I don't have an appetite. Right.

370
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,380
You were craving fried chicken a lot, right?

371
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,600
Should I order another one?

372
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,150
Unnie, we'll have a whole one spicy and one plain.

373
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,400
Okay.

374
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,520
Why don't you have an appetite? Did your boss yell at you again?

375
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,530
Why would she? I'm really good at my job.

376
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,490
 Then why would you lose an appetite you've had all your life? 

377
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,450
What's wrong with her?

378
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,560
I wouldn't know.

379
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,900
So where did you run into each other?

380
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,080
In front of work.

381
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,470
I noticed someone was following me secretly.

382
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,310
"Secretly"? You're giving her the wrong idea.

383
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,580
You were walking ahead of me.

384
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,950
All I did was walk behind you.

385
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,580
You tried to ignore me.

386
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,670
I thought you were grateful I saved you earlier today.

387
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,960
"Saved her"?

388
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,120
"Earlier today"? Why?

389
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,130
I had no idea your leg was there.

390
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,710
I suppose my legs are too long. Sorry.

391
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,910
Lee Hong Ju, you...

392
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,510
Why are you still the same as you were ten years ago?

393
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,600
What did I do?

394
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,090
You still...

395
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,820
 are as clueless... 

396
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,960
 and dumb as ever. 

397
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,360
You're calling me dumb to my face?

398
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,420
Wow. I took you on amusement rides yesterday,

399
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,640
took photos of you, and entertained you all day.

400
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,800
Even today, since you said you wanted fried chicken,

401
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,930
I invited you when I planned to hang out alone with Hye Ji.

402
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,820
I've been so nice to you, but you call me...

403
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,610
clueless and dumb?

404
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,730
You're the one who's still freaking annoying, okay?

405
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,870
Excuse me. I'll have a draft beer.

406
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,170
 Three? One? 

407
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,800
No, cancel the draft beer.

408
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,860
Ms. Kim, it's Monday today.

409
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,320
We promised not to drink on Mondays.

410
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,540
I'll go to the restroom.

411
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,950
Start eating without me.

412
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,740
Enjoy it.

413
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,350
Hu Yeong,

414
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,480
I might be overreacting,

415
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,980
but I need to clarify stuff like this.

416
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,740
Do you like Hong Ju?

417
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,560
Does she know, too?

418
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,190
   

419
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,760
Why are you calling?

420
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,370
No, no. Don't do things like this.

421
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,870
 Hey, Lee Ddoong! 

422
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,660
Hey!

423
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,910
She suddenly has an emergency at work.

424
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,800
Kang Hu Yeong, consider yourself lucky.

425
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,760
I'm tolerating you since Hye Ji likes you.

426
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,070
Why would she fall for someone like him?

427
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:36,040
♫  I wonder why I'm being influenced by you  ♫

428
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:42,550
♫  It surprises me how I mimic the way you talk  ♫

429
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,550
♫  It's so strange  ♫

430
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,830
I'm sorry.

431
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,180
You don't have to apologize to me.

432
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,660
That's how you feel.

433
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,760
♫  Could you stop your heart from racing and shaking?  ♫

434
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,550
So did you look for Hong Ju purposely when you returned?

435
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,900
I happened to run into her.

436
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,600
You're Uncle Wook's nephew by chance.

437
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,260
You live downstairs from Lee Ddoong by chance.

438
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,360
You hung out yesterday by chance.

439
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,960
Did you see her today by chance too?

440
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,490
Was all of it just a coincidence?

441
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,320
♫  Will you respond to my feelings?  ♫

442
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,170
One part wasn't a coincidence.

443
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,360
♫  Someday when you find out how I feel  ♫

444
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,130
By chance, since we were in high school...

445
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:42,870
♫  You need to tell me, too  ♫

446
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,390
♫  That you like me  ♫

447
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,530
Welcome.

448
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,070
Hey, you came.

449
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,080
How would you get any customers like that?

450
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,370
You should greet a customer happily and energetically.

451
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,310
Customer, as if. You don't help the business at all.

452
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:12,200
I've been telling everyone I meet that your restaurant is amazing.

453
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,460
You should pay me a commission. I'd own this building already.

454
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,130
How does that math work?

455
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,980
How much commission would earn you a building even I can't afford?

456
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,280
Did you eat dinner?

457
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,170
Make me something tasty.

458
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,990
I gave up on fried chicken to come here.

459
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,870
Got it. I'll make you something tasty.

460
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,610
Hey, hold on.

461
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,520
I'll only feed you.

462
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,360
Go to your friend if you need a therapist.

463
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,160
My friend...

464
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,410
is having fried chicken with her first love right now.

465
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,610
What? With Hu Yeong? Just those two?

466
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,620
Yes.

467
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,670
No matter how much I think, Hye Ji deserves so much better!

468
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,220
Seriously, this makes no sense.

469
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,190
Why shouldn't it make sense? But...

470
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,750
Excuse me, we'll have another draft beer.

471
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,640
I thought you couldn't drink.

472
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,630
Don't be sweet to me unless you're going to date me.

473
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,150
Okay.

474
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,920
 Okay, I will stop now. 

475
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,660
You've decided to stay in Korea, right?

476
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,240
Are you going back?

477
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,350
Oh, I see, okay, okay.

478
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:00,970
I thought you were serious because you got so emotional just now.

479
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,400
You're like me, too. Do you want to test her?

480
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,890
It's not that.

481
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,600
Do you know who is her number 0 on speed dial?

482
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,700
It's neither you nor Bang Jun Ho, who's been with her for years.

483
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,080
It's me. I'm her guardian.

484
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,920
You can't compete with me, anyway.

485
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,800
I'll pay.

486
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,300
We didn't even touch the chicken. Take it with you. You can't have this in the U.S.

487
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,410
   

488
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,780
I'll pay.

489
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,460
I even made a side dish to feed you.

490
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,000
When will you grow up?

491
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,610
I'm done growing. My height hasn't changed since Grade 9.

492
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,900
Are you stupid?

493
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,870
Are you all serious right now? Why do you keep provoking me?

494
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,900
I just pity Hu Yeong.

495
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,300
Why would you pity him? He's a total jerk and a rogue!

496
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,500
I, the Korean office worker, am more pitiable.

497
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,730
 Why am I the only one eating this tasty food? 

498
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:21,560
 How can you go to work if you start craving alcohol starting Monday? 

499
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:26,190
You need to give your liver a break—

500
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,020
 Help yourself. Go ahead. 

501
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:54,140
The CEO said I need to work on the tenth anniversary project.

502
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,550
You have to if the CEO tells you to. How dare you say no?

503
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,090
She said she'd make me the main producer.

504
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,300
That's great. I thought you've always wanted to be one?

505
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,600
Yes, it's my first opportunity since I started working ten years ago.

506
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,020
Is it already ten years? You got your chance after working so hard.

507
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,650
It's Bang Jun Ho's book.

508
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,510
You'd better say no. You can speak up. You've worked there ten years.

509
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,230
I'm finally becoming a senior producer after ten years, though.

510
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,720
Would that get you a discount at convenience stores?

511
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,060
Who else would do it if not me?

512
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,910
Find a better thing to worry about.

513
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,190
There are tons of people who would do it.

514
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,090
But still, I'm a founding member.

515
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,100
I need to work on the foundation anniversary project.

516
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,400
Hong Ju, are you crazy? You want to work with Bang Jun Ho?

517
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,500
You still haven't come to your senses yet.

518
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,890
- I'm calling Hye Ji now. 
 - You're dead.

519
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,350
You little... You knew you'd die when you said that, didn't you?

520
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,900
- What? 
 - Give me ramen noodles.

521
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,100
Goodness! I'm so sick of this!

522
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,300
   

523
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,850
 Yes, Lee Hong Ju is your problem now. 

524
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,370
 But I don't know if she will act as you predict. 

525
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,430
 You can't compete with me, anyway. 

526
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:36,190
 You're the one who's still freaking annoying, okay? 

527
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,960
   

528
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:59,740
♫  There are so many things I want to tell you  ♫

529
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:07,980
♫  Standing in front of you again for a long time  ♫

530
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,300
♫  I'm unable to say a word  ♫

531
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,500
Is he not back?

532
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,290
♫  Why is it so hard to say this?  ♫

533
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,600
   

534
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,510
♫  I really want you  ♫

535
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,890
No, I should take a hint.

536
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,730
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

537
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:39,970
♫  When we spend time together  ♫

538
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,650
Kang Hu Yeong, this isn't right.

539
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,940
It wasn't easy for me to give you up to Hye Ji.

540
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,610
I also had much to tell her today.

541
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,170
♫  I really want you  ♫

542
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:10,400
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

543
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,770
   

544
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:59,200
   

545
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,360
   

546
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,530
   

547
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,850
I enjoyed your proposal.

548
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,850
The overall quality isn't perfect, 
    

549
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,430
but you chose a good book.

550
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:27,060
I liked how you interpreted it as the audience.

551
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,930
Thank you.

552
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,580
Hand me your resume.

553
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,670
Weren't you told to bring it to the interview?

554
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,600
   

555
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,000
Is this all? 
     

556
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,140
Yes.

557
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,750
This shouldn't be all.

558
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,250
What did you think of Peter's Pen

559
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,760
when you applied with such qualifications?

560
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,520
The application requirement said, "Anyone who loves animation."

561
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,050
- It said the education level doesn't matter. 
 - That meant

562
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,310
candidates with a basic education level.

563
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,920
"Anyone who loves animation" refers to

564
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,000
someone with professional skills as an animator.

565
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,500
Don't you know?

566
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,030
Is that so? I didn't know.

567
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,710
I wrote it wrong. It was me.

568
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,980
Okay then.

569
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,480
You can leave now.

570
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,750
CEO Bae,

571
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,920
you can make me do anything.

572
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,400
I'll learn everything. I'll try everything.

573
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,960
I stayed up all night for the first time working on a proposal.

574
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,480
I have a dream, too.

575
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,760
I want youth like me to have fun and heartwarming dreams watching our films.

576
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,570
Just imagining that got me excited.

577
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:07,700
And I'm sure of it now after meeting you.

578
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,140
This is the place.

579
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,140
I want to work here.

580
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,680
   

581
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,140
Did you have fun while working on this?

582
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,530
Yes!

583
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,700
How much?

584
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:25,100
I didn't notice I stayed up all night. I didn't even notice the sunrise.

585
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,720
   

586
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,210
Hello.

587
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,580
CEO Bae.

588
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,690
CEO Bae, I'll do it.

589
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,720
Because of Mr. Bang? 
    

590
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,520
No. Well...

591
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,010
To be honest, I'm not sure.

592
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,930
I'm certain I'd regret this moment later.

593
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,500
But I'd regret today if I didn't.

594
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
I'll just do it.

595
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,900
I want to become a main producer through this project.

596
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,890
If you can't separate work and life, I'll remove you at that time.

597
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,680
Deal!

598
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,720
Are you sure you can leave like this?

599
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,840
Is this really your answer?

600
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,130
I'm done with work.

601
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:09,410
We could have taken my car to the airport.

602
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,190
Tell your employees that they did a good job.

603
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,050
Did you say goodbye to Lee Ddoong?

604
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,020
She knows I'm leaving.

605
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,890
And...

606
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,720
she said goodbye when she saw me.

607
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,060
And you're okay with that?

608
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,800
I think that's enough, given the relationship we have.

609
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,730
Call me when you arrive then.

610
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,150
See you in the States, Uncle. 
    

611
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,200
Ready.

612
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,220
Throw it! Throw it!

613
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,000
Here I go!

614
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,100
Yes, yes!

615
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,860
Hey, hey, hey!

616
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,650
Pass it!

617
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,400
   

618
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,030
   

619
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,010
   

620
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,070
   

621
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,070
   

622
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:45,100
 Hye Ji, is something going on? 

623
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,900
   

624
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,040
Kim Hye Ji...

625
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,350
why are you so pathetic?

626
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,740
Rematch. Start.

627
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,220
Teacher Son, can we stop playing the bodyguard game?

628
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,820
That's right. We get hit instead of the girls.

629
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,510
It's unfair.

630
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:20,740
Really? Okay. I'll listen to you.

631
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:27,310
It's unfair that only you got to experience protecting someone.

632
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,250
You threw it yourself earlier. That was cool.

633
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,870
I never did.

634
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,530
We get it, you're Superman. Who is he trying to protect?

635
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,750
Over here! Over here! Over here!

636
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,010
Goodness, here we go.

637
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,420
Catch it! Catch it!

638
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,460
Let's go! Let's go!

639
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,110
Stop right there!

640
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,750
Teacher Son.

641
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,380
Over here.

642
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,950
Teacher Son, can I ask you something?

643
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:22,700
Yes, go ahead.

644
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,240
Well, if...

645
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:33,380
your first love likes your best friend, how would you feel?

646
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,130
It's a coincidence,

647
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,570
but they're getting tangled up by fate.

648
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:46,370
I would

649
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:50,590
congratulate them

650
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:54,170
if my friend finds a new love, at least.

651
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,740
My first love is turning 60 next year.

652
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,360
But it's not because she's 60.

653
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,880
My buddy is a good person, too.

654
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,780
I've wanted him to find someone good,

655
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,210
but my first love is a good person, too.

656
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,610
Since they're both good...

657
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:16,300
yes...

658
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,920
Thinking about it, I think it's a good thing.

659
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,560
What?

660
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,470
Come on now.

661
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,350
Seriously, so funny.

662
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,840
Did you refuse to meet Teacher Oh's niece, by the way?

663
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,590
- Yes. 
 - Why did you?

664
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:51,260
I'll ask her to arrange the date again.

665
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,890
N-No, Ms. Kim! Ms. Kim!

666
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:58,030
Forget I asked you to have a date with Hong Ju, okay?

667
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,520
Right, Sang Pil.

668
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,460
   

669
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,130
I'm breaking my promise again.

670
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,400
 I'm here for a visit. 

671
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,440
 Who are you visiting in which squadron? 

672
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,350
 "Squadron"? Just one second. 

673
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,180
 Here. 

674
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,960
 Squadron No. 1 is no longer here. 

675
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:08,620
 I've been sending letters here until last week. 

676
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,720
 This reply came from here too. 

677
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,130
 I can't check the details for you. 

678
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:17,470
   

679
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,040
   

680
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:53,080
   

681
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,220
 I must be crazy. 

682
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,630
 Why did I follow her here? 

683
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,940
 Let's go. 

684
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,150
 Only one bus comes here. 

685
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,120
 We have to walk to the terminal if we miss it. 

686
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,430
 Do you want to eat ramen before we go? 

687
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,890
   

688
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:17,930
   

689
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,180
 You aren't students from around here. 
   

690
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,320
 We came to visit someone at the army base here. 

691
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,020
But we didn't get to see him.

692
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,840
If you think you'll never see them again, you can endure it,

693
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,940
but you miss them if you know they're nearby.

694
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,350
I tend to make food spicy.

695
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,230
Get water if the ramen is too spicy.

696
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,770
Enjoy, okay?

697
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:56,060
 Thank you for the food. 

698
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:12,960
It's spicy.

699
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,980
Her ramen is really spicy.

700
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,530
The ramen is too spicy, Ma'am.

701
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,550
It's spicy.

702
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,390
Hey, why are you suddenly crying?

703
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:38,390
It's spicy. The ramen is too spicy.

704
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:40,790
 Should I add some water? 

705
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:44,020
No. That'd ruin it.

706
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,180
 Eat slowly. 

707
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,600
We have time to catch the bus.

708
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,360
Go without me. I'll stay here overnight.

709
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,360
You can't stay overnight here.

710
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,250
I'll confess my love to Oppa and leave.

711
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,850
You don't even know if he's here. How would you do that?

712
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:21,620
I will. I'll find him and tell him.

713
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:26,030
It's overflowing from here.

714
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:30,030
It keeps overflowing that I can't even breathe.

715
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,930
I think I'd die if I don't tell him.

716
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,300
Still, you can't.

717
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,840
Don't confess.

718
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,410
Why not?

719
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,100
Because...

720
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,420
I will report you,

721
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,070
for dating a soldier when you're a student.

722
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,440
You'd report me? Are you crazy?

723
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,340
He gave you the wrong address because he doesn't want you to visit.

724
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,860
You'd get rejected anyway. Isn't it better not to see him?

725
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:15,240
You aren't rejected yet.

726
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,290
She hit me with a spoon first.

727
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,690
Why do you keep crying?

728
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,380
 Do you want kimbap? 

729
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,870
 Ice cream? 

730
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,710
Chocolate?

731
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:12,230
Then should we go back to the army base after this?

732
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,510
Okay. Let's go and ask.

733
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:27,540
Eat. The noodles will get soggy.

734
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,900
   

735
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,800
She's been sending letters here,

736
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,600
and she got a reply here too.

737
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,910
Bang Jun Ho of Squadron No. 1 at this army base. Right?

738
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,200
This is the right army base,

739
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,800
but Squadron No. 1 is no longer here. I told you.

740
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,000
"No longer" means they used to be here and left.

741
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,610
- Tell me where they went. 
 - That's...

742
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,140
classified military information. I can't tell you.

743
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,520
You can deliver a letter and present, right?

744
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,770
Student, this isn't a janitor's office.

745
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:31,760
Tell me where they went so we can deliver them ourselves.

746
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:45,040
Squadron No. 1 was sent to the general outpost last week.

747
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,770
They went up to the mountain over there.

748
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:50,320
You can't visit them for six months.

749
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,150
Happy now?

750
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,920
Six...

751
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:14,370
   

752
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,840
Lee Hong Ju, let's walk a bit faster.

753
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,010
The bus will be arriving soon.

754
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,340
I'm coming.

755
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,270
Coming.

756
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,340
If he went somewhere she couldn't visit,

757
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,890
he should have written her.

758
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,380
What's wrong with that scum?

759
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,050
   

760
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,360
Hey, that's the last bus.

761
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,200
Run, Kang Hu Yeong!

762
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,600
- The bus... 
 - Are you okay?

763
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,200
The bus!

764
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,600
You should have stopped the bus!

765
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,900
But you fell—

766
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,200
That's not important right now.

767
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,500
What if we miss the bus to Seoul now?

768
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,390
We can stay here overnight then.

769
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,610
Why would I sleep with you?

770
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,180
When did I say that?

771
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,590
Of course, we'd sleep separately.

772
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,300
 Gosh, I'm sorry. 

773
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,300
That car suddenly cut me off.

774
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,690
It's okay.

775
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,350
We can arrive at the airport by three, right?

776
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:07,410
Of course. We're leaving Seoul now.

777
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,290
   

778
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,560
   

779
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:33,610
- Yes, Hye Ji, I— 
  - Where are you right now, Hu Yeong? 

780
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,500
I'm on my way to the airport.

781
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,830
Hong Ju was in a car accident.

782
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:42,760
- What? 
  - She's being sent to Ohbok Hospital's ER now. 

783
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,460
I'm her guardian. What do I do?

784
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:48,690
 I'll be there soon, but she's probably alone now. 

785
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:49,870
 Could you get there before me? 

786
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:51,780
Please turn around, Sir.

787
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,240
Let's go to Ohbok Hospital.

788
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,260
You'd miss the flight if we turned around—

789
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,720
It doesn't matter. Hurry.

790
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,510
Okay.

791
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,280
 You went off-route. 

792
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,250
 Finding a new route. 

793
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,300
♫  I feel so strange these days  ♫

794
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:18,970
♫  For some reason, all day I think of you  ♫

795
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:21,310
Sir, your suitcase!

796
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:25,620
♫  I can't stop worrying about you  ♫

797
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:30,380
♫  My heart is pounding  ♫

798
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,160
♫  Out of countless people, you're so precious  ♫

799
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,480
I heard a patient in a car accident was just sent here.

800
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,550
Just one moment. 
 ♫  You're the only one  ♫

801
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:42,740
She's in the bed over there on the left. 
 ♫  Who can reach me  ♫

802
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:47,880
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

803
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,450
♫  Or are you playing ignorant?  ♫

804
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:53,530
♫  It's you  ♫

805
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:57,190
♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

806
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:02,110
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

807
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:05,240
♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

808
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,080
♫  It has to be you  ♫

809
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:13,070
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

810
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:18,510
Lee Hong Ju. 
 ♫  It's okay because it's you  ♫

811
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:22,000
Are you this patient's guardian?

812
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,580
I'm...

813
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,610
♫  It's you  ♫

814
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:29,490
♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

815
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:30,990
Yes, I am.

816
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:34,140
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

817
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,260
♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

818
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,160
♫  It has to be you  ♫

819
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:46,910
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

820
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,590
 Let's send Hong Ju back... 

821
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:52,130
 to her family or an orphanage. 
   

822
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:55,430
Oppa, we agreed not to talk about that anymore. 
    

823
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:59,260
That was before you got pregnant.

824
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,600
Don't tell Hong Ju.

825
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,770
I'll figure out where to send her.

826
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,500
   

827
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,920
You should get treated at a hospital and rest at home.

828
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,840
Here's an early leave permission.

829
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,290
   

830
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:03,630
Save this for me. I'll use it next time.

831
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:06,380
Lee Hong Ju, you have a high fever.

832
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,110
You should go to a hospital.

833
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:09,600
Why would I go to a hospital again?

834
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,900
This is a hospital too.

835
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,300
There are medicines and a doctor here too.

836
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,200
I'm not a doctor.

837
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,630
- Are you a quack? 
 -  Lee Hong Ju!

838
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,430
Please keep it down. My head is ringing.

839
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:26,450
That's why I'm telling you to sleep comfortably at home.

840
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:29,700
This bed is more comfortable than the one at home.

841
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:33,000
- You change the blanket every day, right? 
 - Do you think this is a hotel?

842
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,380
I can't even kick out a sick girl.

843
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,350
Stay here.

844
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,740
Hey, don't you want an early leave?

845
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:49,530
Never mind. Stay here longer.

846
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:08,810
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but can I have some water?

847
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,100
 Lee Hong Ju, are you awake? 

848
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,680
Kang Hu Yeong?

849
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,200
Where...

850
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,500
You can't move.

851
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,600
You were sent to a hospital after a car accident.

852
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,520
I was?

853
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,910
I survived.

854
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,090
But why are you here?

855
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:19,200
Wait here. They said to tell them when you wake for a CT Scan.

856
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,940
I'm okay.

857
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,440
I didn't get hit by a car.

858
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,800
I fell trying to dodge it.

859
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,300
Why did they contact you?

860
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:31,530
You must be busy. I'm sorry. I'll take care of the rest.

861
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:34,240
- Lee Hong Ju. 
 - I'm really okay so you can leave now.

862
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,240
Why do you insist that I leave? Where would I go?

863
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,450
Hey, why are you getting angry?

864
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:44,910
It's not a big deal so I don't want to bother you.

865
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,600
"Not a big deal"?

866

 Timing and subtitles by the  
🔮Meant to Be Together🍀 Team @viki.com 

867
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:08,660
Is this still nothing?

868
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:20,240
♫  I wonder why I'm being influenced by you  ♫

869
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,730
   

870
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:26,780
♫  It surprises me how I mimic the way you talk  ♫

871
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:29,240
 The real thing starts 

872
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,700
 when you lose your way. 

873
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,550
Are you stupid?

874
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:41,890
♫  I wonder if you're like me, too  ♫

875
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:51,170
♫  Could you stop your heart from racing and shaking?  ♫

876
01:08:53,330 --> 01:09:00,890
♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

877
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:05,840
♫  So I ask you  ♫

878
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:10,280
♫  Will you respond to my feelings?  ♫

879
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,450
 Can you stop flirting? 

880
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:16,200
 We're just each other's classmate Number Three, right? 

881
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,490
 Nice catch! 

882
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:20,700
 I was never fooling, 

883
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,790
 not ten years ago and not now. 

884
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,980
 What's wrong with him? 

885
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:30,270
 You're the one who said it. You said you'd never change. 

886
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:33,850
 I'm embarrassed that you keep finding out about my failed relationship. 

887
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:38,760
 I'm happy that your relationship failed.  
 ♫  I know I'm falling in love  ♫

888
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,390
♫  I know it  ♫

889
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:44,640
♫  You look so beautiful in the sunlight  ♫
