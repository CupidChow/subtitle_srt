♫  It's you  ♫

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,490
    
 ♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,740
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,090
    
 ♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,470
    
 ♫  It has to be you  ♫

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:30,420
    
 ♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,070
   

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,100
   

9
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,750
Are you okay?

10
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,730
Why did you run so much?

11
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,200
I was coming to you.

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,250
Kang Hu Yeong. 
 ♫   I wonder why  ♫

13
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,840
♫  I'm being influenced by you  ♫

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,210
♫  It surprises me  ♫

15
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,690
Why did you come out like this in this cold? 
 ♫  How I mimic the way you talk  ♫

16
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,250
Because I wanted to see you right away. 
 ♫  It's so strange  ♫

17
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,350
Why aren't you angry at me?

18
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,310
Because I'm not angry.

19
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,540
♫  I wonder if you're like me, too  ♫

20
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,670
♫  Could you stop your heart from racing and shaking?  ♫

21
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,630
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,140
Why would you be sorry?

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm sorry even more.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,730
I'm really, really sorry.

25
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,040
It was enough to get you upset and angry. 
 ♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,090
It's not because I couldn't trust you. 
 ♫  So I ask you  ♫

27
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,910
My anxiety became your responsibility.

28
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,900
♫  Will you respond to my feelings?  ♫

29
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,910
Hong Ju, look at me.

30
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,690
♫  Someday when you find out how I feel  ♫

31
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,350
I feel okay.

32
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,020
I'm fine; I saw your face.

33
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,860
Kang Hu Yeong, 
 ♫  To tell me, too  ♫

34
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,840
You have my heart.

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,960
♫  That you like me  ♫

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,080
I really like you.

37
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,140
I know. But I'm certain I like you more.

38
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,410
No, I adore you much, much more.

39
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,920
This is delightful and warm.

40
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:55,010


41
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,630
I'm at my place now.

42
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,740
You should go home. You'll catch a cold.

43
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,050
I'll stay a little longer.

44
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,770
You'll catch a cold. Go now.

45
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,430
If you insist, bye.

46
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,030
Well…

47
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,580
would you like some ramen before you go?

48
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,800
Indeed.

49
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,300
Since you're cold, I offered you ramen (not seduction).

50
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,070
That's all you're getting, okay?

51
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,460
Warm yourself up.

52
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,960
Get in here if you're cold… Maybe not.

53
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,940
Put this on you.

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,260
What kind of ramen do you like?

55
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,200
I like…

56
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,740
- this type. 
 - Okay, I'll make you this—

57
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,170
Geez!

58
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,500
"Geez!" is kind of hurtful.

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,460
Why did you get so close? I said to eat only ramen.

60
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,260
What else were you expecting, exactly?

61
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,030
What do you imply?

62
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't tempt me if you won't.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,340
You keep giving me hope.

64
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,300
- Can I use this pot? 
 - Yes.

65
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,900
Here is water.

66
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,210
Let's eat downstairs.

67
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,290
I'm lightweight. Let's start eating.

68
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,180
What?

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,770
It's nothing.

70
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,980
Kang Hu Yeong.

71
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,540
You're good at making ramen, too.

72
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,610
There really is nothing you can't do.

73
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,800
Lee Hong Ju, will you keep—

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,380
You're good at many things:

75
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,560
your job and your looks.

76
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,000
Aren't you better off where you were before?

77
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,450
Hong Ju.

78
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,720
I don't want you to give up precious things because of me.

79
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,070
Lee Hong Ju, I'm not good at games.

80
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,880
I'm also a terrible singer,

81
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,730
and I broke six bowls at Sang Pil's restaurant.

82
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,990
When I'm with you, I always find out my weaknesses.

83
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,010
But I appreciate it.

84
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,710
It makes me realize what I prefer and I'm good at.

85
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,410
I also want to accomplish some things.

86
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,560
Accomplish what things?

87
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,560
Eat ramen with you after work.

88
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,550
Defeat you completely at the arcade.

89
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,680
Take you to new places and watch you enjoy the fun.

90
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,120
View your created cartoon in a movie theater. Take a photo of your name.

91
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,550
Be in a photo…

92
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,970
standing together with you.

93
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,910
These are my dreams.

94
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,360
Can I make them happen?

95
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,730
If it's up to me, you can.

96
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,470
- Really? 
 - Yes.

97
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,950
Dreams usually come true.

98
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,790
Kang Hu Yeong, are you okay?

99
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,420
- Lee Hong Ju. 
 - What? Does your head hurt?

100
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,600
Was this an accident just now?

101
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,330
I think you did it on purpose.

102
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,730
No! It was an accident.

103
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,030
Still, you have to take responsibility for this.

104
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,810
Let's finish the ramen first.

105
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,680
Eat ramen, then after you brush your teeth,

106
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,740
I won't release you.

107
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,670
I won't, either.

108
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,640
Let's eat quickly.

109
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,910
 Is your mom not happy you're in Korea? 

110
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,530
 My dad is in Korea. 

111
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,810
They got divorced when I was in Grade 11.

112
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,230
My dad met someone else…

113
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,540
and asked for her forgiveness, but…

114
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,010
   
   

115
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,810
 I don't think Mom could forgive him. 

116
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,790
We will never come back.

117
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,180
  ­ 
   

118
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,650
 That's how hurt she must have been. 

119
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,880
 In fact, she never wanted to return to Korea. 

120
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,200
Yes, I need to take care of something in a hurry.

121
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,380
Prepare a video call with the law firm.

122
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,470
Hey, you should have left in the morning.

123
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,940
I couldn't. You held my hand so tight.

124
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,630
Are you blaming me for this?

125
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,920
Are you going to tell me to take—

126
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,750
Mom.

127
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,930
Good morning.

128
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,390
  ­ 

129
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,160
Let's go together. I'll drive you.

130
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,640
It's fine. Catch up on your sleep at home.

131
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,470
Why do you keep following me?

132
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,370
I'm not following you.

133
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,280
Well then.

134
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,890
Is this okay?

135
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,870
What are you trying to do with me?

136
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,890
I'm so sorry about earlier, Mother.

137
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,010
How am I your mother?

138
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,470
Kang Hu Yeong's mother then?

139
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,410
Ahjumeoni?

140
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,130
Ahjumma.

141
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,630
Aunt?

142
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,680
Oh, Madam.

143
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,630
Just call me CEO Baek.

144
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,280
Doesn't that feel too impersonal? Between us?

145
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,950
What is our relationship?

146
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,460
We both love Hu Yeong.

147
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,330
Are you warning me right now?

148
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,070
No, no, no. It's just a fact.

149
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,780
I like Hu Yeong very much.

150
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,280
I also plan to like you in the future.

151
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,190
Hopefully, we will get along well.

152
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,450
Have a nice day.

153
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,920
  ­ 

154
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,840
  ­ 

155
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,790
Her company is…

156
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,220
   

157
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,830
Even I'm starting to think this is fate.

158
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,280
Mr. Kang.

159
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,820
  ­ 

160
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,160
You really were in Korea.

161
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,260
I thought you weren't interested in Korea.

162
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,020
I suppose I didn't know how I felt.

163
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,740
The rumor that Chairman Oh proposed something amazing also spread in Korea.

164
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,690
Someone as smart as you won't say no to that.

165
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,600
I'd like you to propose something better than that.

166
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,290
Does CEO Baek know you're doing this?

167
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,830
CEO Baek…

168
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,400
knows how good I am at this job.

169
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,890
I like your reasonable confidence.

170
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,090
You'd better not meet with anyone other than me.

171
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,360
 I knew this would happen! 

172
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,230
He said he is looking for investors!

173
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,370
It means he would become independent.

174
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,130
Why is he rebelling so methodically?

175
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,000
He really is my son.

176
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,190
You shouldn't be impressed right now.

177
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,920
They will fulfill all of his requirements.

178
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,230
Why wouldn't they?

179
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,850
He didn't budge when they scouted him, but now he wants to join them.

180
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,910
We're about to lose Hu Yeong.

181
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,380
- Be quiet. 
 - What do you mean "be quiet"?

182
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,680
This is such a mess right now!

183
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,490
Whatever! You can't take Hu Yeong with you, either.

184
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,760
I'll keep him with me.

185
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,140
Geez, seriously.

186
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,510
I thought he was drunk.

187
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:34,020
By the way, my friend went to Ko Samui (Thai island) for a honeymoon.

188
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,270
Apparently, it's really nice there.

189
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,030
That's right, in Thailand.

190
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:42,210
 Teacher Son, have you thought of a honeymoon spot? 

191
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,510
I've never thought about it.

192
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,510
He doesn't have a girlfriend. Why would you ask that?

193
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,000
- I don't even have a girlfriend. 
 - He will go eventually.

194
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,900
He should think about it.

195
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,960
What's the point of thinking about it?

196
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,870
You'll end up going wherever your wife wants to go.

197
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,290
How shocking.

198
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,700
I couldn't do that myself. It's unfair.

199
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,070
Teacher Son,

200
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,700
may we talk for a moment?

201
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,400
Yes.

202
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,800
Do we have to keep doing this?

203
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,060
Pardon?

204
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,870
Dating isn't a sin. Why should we keep it a secret?

205
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,080
Teacher Kim, many people can see us at school—

206
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,220
So what?

207
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,280
If the rumor spreads at school, people will start talking about you.

208
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,290
But look at us.

209
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,630
You talk to me even less than before.

210
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,590
Every time you see me, you avoid me.

211
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,970
That's because…

212
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll make it too obvious.

213
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,980
I know. Just make it obvious.

214
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,970
I don't mind if the rumor spreads.

215
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,190
I mean it.

216
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,920
♫  Should I tell him I like him?  ♫

217
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,160
- Really? 
 - Yes.

218
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,610
Why is it so warm? Did you keep it warm?

219
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,490
- Let go! 
 - I'm sorry, I said.

220
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,990
You're always like this.

221
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,640
I thought it was tomorrow.

222
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,500
I can't switch the night duty schedule.

223
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,250
Don't ever ask me that again.

224
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,260
Then just don't.

225
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,600
Friends shouldn't fight. They should get along, right?

226
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,480
Keep reading the comic book.

227
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,930
You go on.

228
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,810
I'd rather watch your facial expressions.

229
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,500
I can't focus. Look somewhere else.

230
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:44,300
   

231
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,640
   

232
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,920
Key requirement?

233
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,720
My love for animation?

234
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,540
That's right. That's the most important thing.

235
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,200
For the…

236
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,580
animation.

237
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,360
   

238
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,510
Why are there so many requirements?

239
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,600
Over here!

240
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,230
♫  I feel so strange these days  ♫

241
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,630
♫  It's really not like me  ♫

242
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,430
Why did he fall in the pit if he's so athletic?

243
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:52,760
♫  I can't stop worrying about you  ♫

244
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,590
♫  My heart is pounding  ♫

245
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:04,940
♫  Out of countless people, you're so precious  ♫

246
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,310
Nice, nice!

247
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,820
Yes! Nice!

248
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,060
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

249
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,600
♫  Or are you playing ignorant?  ♫

250
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,610
♫  It's you  ♫

251
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,360
♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

252
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,650
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

253
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,050
Kang Hu Yeong. 
 ♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

254
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,580
I've been looking for you.

255
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,210
You shouldn't be in the library right now.

256
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,720
♫  No matter what  ♫

257
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,500
Have you read this? 
 ♫  I don't want to lose you  ♫

258
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,560
   

259
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,140
No.

260
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,790
I'll read it and let you borrow it.

261
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,160
There's a girl in my class who's really into this stuff.

262
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,360
She gave it to me when I said I'd be an animation director.

263
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,050
I'm okay.

264
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,900
What?

265
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,780
You acted like it was a dream you never told anyone.

266
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,090
You said, "I wanted to become an animation director."

267
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,980
Are you denying it now?

268
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,220
 Which college is Kang Hu Yeong applying to? 

269
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,110
 What's the point of knowing? You can't follow him there. 

270
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,090
You chased him for three years, but it didn't work out.

271
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,740
Just give it up.

272
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,640
Yes.

273
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:23,020
 Did you hear the girl from the liberal arts class got rejected? 

274
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,500
 They made a fuss in the library. 

275
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,820
 It's because Hu Yeong has no interest in girls yet. 

276
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,370
 We're growing up now. 

277
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,470
 There will be more handsome guys than him. 

278
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,300
You're the only one I told.

279
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,280
Keep reading the comic book.

280
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,380
You're more handsome than these guys. What can I do?

281
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,290
I can't argue with that.

282
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,630
I just remembered something huge,

283
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,970
but I won't tell you.

284
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,930
Tell me. What's so huge?

285
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,140
I won't tell you.

286
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,100
- What is it? 
 - I won't tell you.

287
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,530
You won't? You won't?

288
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,710
- You won't? 
 - It tickles! Stop!

289
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,500
I love you, Lee Hong Ju.

290
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,760
Me, too.

291
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,640
Why do you laugh?

292
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,580
It's snowing.

293
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,710
Wow!

294
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,480
It's pretty.

295
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,600
Kang Hu Yeong?

296
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,490
Kang Hu Yeong?

297
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,610
Wont you ask me to come in?

298
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,980
Please come in.

299
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,390
There's nothing to drink at home. Is that okay?

300
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,890
I also don't have much time.

301
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,970
So…

302
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,940
I prepared this in a little hurry.

303
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,400
This is…

304
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,880
I'm sure it's better than what you expected.

305
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,620
This doesn't mean I'll accept this,

306
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,440
but I'll just open it.

307
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,820
You came.

308
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,680
I thought I wouldn't see you before I left.

309
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,920
This suitcase is—

310
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,030
They insist on my return since two people are gone.

311
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,130
Should we eat together like we used to?

312
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,190
Mom, I'm sorry I disappointed you.

313
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,090
Hu Yeong,

314
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:27,640
do you know why I decided to move to the U.S. ten years ago?

315
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:35,860
You don't think it was just about your dad, do you?

316
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,160
It was obviously for our future opportunities.

317
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,610
You have never disappointed me once.

318
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:55,280
Do you really think I've been dictating your life all this time?

319
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,760
That I didn't help while you faced tasks before you?

320
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,950
There was nothing I could do.

321
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,060
You figured everything out yourself.

322
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,340
You always wrote down the answer.

323
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,190
Mom.

324
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,300
Answer it. It's probably my lawyer.

325
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,840
Starting now,

326
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm going to sue you.

327
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,100
Since I haven't processed the resignation letter,

328
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,170
you should know you're still on a business trip.

329
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:44,050
I heard that you used company info to attract investors.

330
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,410
That's nonsense—

331
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,340
Let's determine if it makes sense or not.

332
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,510
You have to stop getting investors due to the lawsuit.

333
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,480
Time is money.

334
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,850
Should we meet in ten days?

335
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,970
Mom, why are you taking it this far—

336
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,830
I told you.

337
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,850
My decision won't change.

338
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,520
What kind of mom would let her son ruin his life?

339
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,590
This won't change my decision, either.

340
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,060
I know.

341
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,620
You take after me.

342
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,580
I'm looking forward to seeing what you'll do.

343
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,960
Clearly, I'm worried.

344
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:54,190
♫  I know whenever I see you  ♫

345
00:27:54,190 --> 00:28:00,500
♫  My mood is different than usual  ♫

346
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:07,580
♫  I close my eyes  ♫

347
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,380
♫  I try to forget, but I still get reminded of you  ♫

348
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,020
♫  I miss the time when I didn't know anything  ♫

349
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:25,280
♫  Looking in your eyes  ♫

350
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,570
♫  I keep circling around and complaining  ♫

351
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:39,330
♫  But my heart is beating again toward you  ♫

352
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:47,360
♫  I circle around you like this  ♫

353
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,350
 You were right, Ms. Lee. 

354
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,750
Hu Yeong did the calculation with his smart brain.

355
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,440
He must have made the right decision.

356
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,470
This means I also like you, since he chose you.

357
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,890
So that means—

358
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,530
Come to the U.S. with Hu Yeong.

359
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,370
I don't have the time to get you the plane ticket;

360
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,900
but for now, be ready to move to USA with this.

361
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,100
You won't reach the limit. Don't worry about it.

362
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,920
Wh-What makes you trust me?

363
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,320
You don't know what I would do with this.

364
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,190
I mean, what I would buy with this.

365
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,890
Do you think I trust you?

366
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,700
I trust Hu Yeong's judgment.

367
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,180
I'm going back to the U.S. today.

368
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,430
I'll start a long battle with Hu Yeong.

369
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:55,700
If you stay by his side, he will feel supported.

370
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,920
I don't think I understand what you're saying at all.

371
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,170
Once he leaves for the U.S., he can't return for a while.

372
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm very capable.

373
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,480
So…

374
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,350
let's live in the U.S. together.

375
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:25,050
He chose to stay with you in Korea and gave up on all the great things.

376
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,190
Can you…

377
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,830
give up this stuff for him?

378
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,920
Or are you not that serious about this relationship?

379
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,890
Lee Hong Ju?

380
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,860
Mr. Kim.

381
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,320
Why are you walking around like that in this cold?

382
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,480
Mr. Kim, you can't walk around with wet hair in this cold.

383
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,080
I'd rather die than hear you worry about me.

384
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,110
Come with me. I'll get you something warm.

385
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,850
Mr. Kim.

386
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,490
Can I treat you today?

387
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,580
No, I said it's okay.

388
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,440
I really wanted to use this today.

389
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,880
I'll make a single payment.

390
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,190
Insert the card there.

391
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,500
The payment went through. 
    

392
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,100
How dare you try to follow him there?

393
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,750
Do you think USA is a neighborhood nearby?

394
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,170
You're right, but…

395
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,300
he likes me a lot.

396
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,510
He says his heart might jump out when I call his name.

397
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,640
I like him, and I want to be with him, too.

398
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,340
It might be nice to get out of here using this chance.

399
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,320
It makes me think I might have a chance.

400
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,590
It's not a terrible proposal, is it?

401
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,520
Then you can just go.

402
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,110
When you get there, you'll figure it out.

403
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,740
People live there just fine, too.

404
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,560
If you don't like it, you can return.

405
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,230
You're right. If I don't like it, I can just come back.

406
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,420
Mr. Kim, I'm really leaving.

407
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,150
Will you really do what I tell you to do?

408
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,810
Geez, you were so disobedient even as a student.

409
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,700
Why would you listen to me now?

410
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:19,600
Come up with an answer yourself, no matter what it is.

411
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,980
Think carefully about what you really want.

412
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,800
I don't worry about you.

413
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:37,010
I've seen you come this far, finding good answers.

414
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:43,980
You've always been my pride as a teacher.

415
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,670
You've been my favorite student in my whole career.

416
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,480
Be proud.

417
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,460
Mr. Kim.

418
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:00,080
So who is the man you're seeing now?

419
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,910
I wonder if you would remember him.

420
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,420
Kang Hu Yeong, whom I went to school with.

421
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,870
Wh-Who?

422
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,960
K-Kang Hu Yeong?

423
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,270
M-My dear student, the math genius, Kang Hu Yeong?

424
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:22,680
I think he's a math genius, but I didn't know he was your dear student.

425
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,340
Hey! Why would he date you?

426
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,780
Did you t-tell Hu Yeong about me?

427
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,440
He must have looked for me.

428
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,170
This wouldn't have happened if he talked to me first!

429
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,500
Mr. Kim, how could you?

430
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,350
No, how could you?

431
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,500
Call me when you arrive.

432
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,080
Okay.

433
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,800
I explained everything to Ms. Lee.

434
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,930
I thought you couldn't tell her what you really wanted.

435
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,890
Let's all see each other again in the U.S.

436
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,900
Hong Ju!

437
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,400
Lee Hong Ju!  
 ♫  I hope that you  ♫

438
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,640
♫  Will look at me, too  ♫

439
00:35:49,100 --> 00:36:01,600
♫  You appear in my dreams. I hope I see you in my dream  ♫

440
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:15,400
♫  I hope you, whom I like, like me, too  ♫

441
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:29,400
♫  I hope you come a bit closer to my heart now  ♫

442
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,570
   

443
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:40,420
♫  Did we get reunited by coincidence?  ♫

444
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:50,830
♫  The days we spent like that  ♫

445
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:57,630
♫  Was it a coincidence?  ♫

446
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:09,900
♫  I hope that you, whom I'm looking at, will look at me, too  ♫

447
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:23,400
♫  I hope you come a bit closer to my heart now  ♫

448
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,330
   

449
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,230
What?

450
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,790
He doesn't have class, but why won't he reply?

451
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:22,310
You should have started preparing if you heard the inspectors were coming.

452
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:25,090
What will they think of our school?

453
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:29,130
They'll know we've been rushing after being notified.

454
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,480
Seriously.

455
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,810
Wow, am I really in a relationship?

456
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,080
Why do I feel lonelier?

457
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,910
You're so clumsy.

458
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,100
 How could you miss that? 

459
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,060
 Are you okay? 

460
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,320
I told her so many times not to wear shoes like those.

461
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,460
Seriously. Gosh.

462
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,580
Why right here?

463
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,350
Who's going to marry her, anyway?

464
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,280
Everyone will find out about our secret relationship at this rate.

465
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,360
Hye Ji,

466
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,810
you'd better be ready from now on.

467
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,430
Pardon?

468
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,790
I decided not to hide my feelings in front of anyone.

469
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,780
That's what I've wanted to hear.

470
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,100
Father.

471
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,200
I will take Hye Ji with me.

472
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,750
She's my daughter. How dare you?

473
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,180
Hurry and take her with you, Son-in-law.

474
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,120
Yes!

475
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,770
What? Really? Did everyone know?

476
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:39,230
We have his approval. We have his approval, Teacher Kim!

477
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,030
Vice Principal.

478
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,620
Here is the food you ordered.

479
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,250
- Excuse me, here you go. 
 - Thank you.

480
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,540
Enjoy.

481
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,620
- Welcome! 
 - Why is it so crowded?

482
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,070
Sit anywhere and peruse the menu—

483
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,040
 I want to sit there. 

484
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,320
 Right there. 

485
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,460
 Do you understand? 

486
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,740
 Okay. 

487
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,930
   

488
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,840
This table is reserved. I'm sorry.

489
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,860
- Is it reserved? 
 - Yes.

490
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,960
It appears you are full.

491
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,120
Oh, Bae Hye Suk.

492
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,900
Were you eating?

493
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,330
Great. I'm hungry, but they don't have a table.

494
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,470
I can join you, right?

495
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,920
Hey, hey, hey.

496
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,080
Finish your food first, then leave.

497
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,200
Hey.

498
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,700
Please eat with me.

499
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,600
Don't leave me behind today, please.

500
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,080
You can only eat.

501
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,790
Of course, I will only eat.

502
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,800
Another bowl of rice, please.

503
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,890
We haven't eaten together in a while. How about a drink?

504
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,870
- Here's the rice you ordered. 
 - Yes.

505
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:41,320
You two are my regular customers.

506
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:47,930
I'd like to give you Kwon Sang Pil's signature spicy chicken feet.

507
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,570
Would you like to try them?

508
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,290
We'll take them and a bottle of soju, as well.

509
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,360
Okay, understood.

510
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,200
Their spicy chicken feet are good.

511
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,810
You used to like spicy food.

512
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,550
Here's the soju.

513
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,690
Do... you remember that?

514
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,220
It's been more than 20 years.

515
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:19,120
It was my first love; I got sick after each date. How could I forget?

516
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:27,600
Here. Aigoo, it has been a while.

517
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,300
Here you go. Should we do a Love Shot?

518
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,270
Gosh, how nice.

519
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,300
Right, Hye Suk? Do you remember the old days?

520
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,210
- Just eat. 
 - Okay.

521
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,060
Everyone is dating but me.

522
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,900
Did you know this is our first time walking to school together?

523
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,380
You're right.

524
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,800
It would have been nice if we met a little sooner.

525
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,860
It would have been perfect if we met in Grade 10.

526
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,440
Grade 11 would have been fine, too.

527
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,830
The spring of Grade 12 would have been nice.

528
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,890
Let's go to the U.S. together.

529
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,000
I know it won't be an easy decision,

530
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,230
but I can't be without you.

531
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,040
I'm not fine to be away from you again.

532
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,740
Let's go together.

533
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,760
Hong Ju, look at me.

534
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,100
Hu Yeong,

535
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,500
I like you.

536
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,020
I like you so much that it makes me worry.

537
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,180
I keep falling for you more.

538
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,100
I don't want to be away from you, either.

539
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,960
But...

540
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,930
I know.

541
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,420
Everything that's precious to you is here.

542
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,780
All the things you like and want to do.

543
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:49,120
That wasn't enough to seduce Lee Hong Ju.

544
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,660
I'm sorry.

545
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,950
I finally feel relieved.

546
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,430
It won't matter who.

547
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,000
You won't even budge.

548
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,060
No one can seduce you.

549
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,450
   

550
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,570
I found it on the way.

551
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:51,430
   

552
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,090
This book contains so many of our memories.

553
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:03,030
How could you throw it away?

554
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:06,100
♫  It surprises me how I mimic the way you talk  ♫

555
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,670
Hong Ju, please continue to protect my dream.

556
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,550
♫  It's so strange  ♫

557
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,490
♫  I wonder   ♫

558
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,410
Why do you keep crying? 
 ♫  If you're like me, too  ♫

559
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,140
I'll be back. 
 ♫  Could you stop your heart  ♫

560
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,760
I'll come to the world you live in.

561
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,360
Then...

562
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:39,570
I won't let you go.

563
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,570
Hu Yeong... 
 ♫  No one taught me  ♫

564
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,310
♫  So I ask you  ♫

565
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:53,200
♫  Will you respond to my feelings?  ♫

566
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:04,940
♫  Someday when you find out how I feel  ♫

567
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,320
What should we do now?

568
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,670
   

569
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:13,450
Kang Hu Yeong, you'd better be good. 
 ♫   I love you  ♫

570
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,730
She is coming.

571
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,920
Whom did you bring today?

572
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,580
I really am a crazy person.

573
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,220
About you, Hong Ju.

574
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,040
Hey, what kind of line is that?

575
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,910
She's not believing it.

576
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:48,380
- You made him say that, right? 
 - No, I didn't.

577
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,510
Long time, no see.

578
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,140
Enjoy your food.

579
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,940
Thank you.

580
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,720
- Eat. 
 - Yes, let's eat.

581
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:02,110
♫  I always believed in myself until I met you  ♫

582
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:05,940
Should I put it here? 
 ♫  I wanted to live splendidly  ♫

583
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,510
Put this up for me, please.

584
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,780
Okay. 
 ♫  I'll teach you to fly high in the sky so you can fulfill your dreams  ♫

585
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,680
 I'll turn it on. 

586
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,440
Wow, all done. Nice!

587
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,260
So pretty. Shall we take a photo?

588
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,340
- I'll take it now. 
 - Okay.

589
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:25,330
One, two, three. 
 ♫  Your crystal-clear smile, Baby  ♫

590
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,940
- What? 
 - One, two, three.

591
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:39,260
♫  So I can go straight into your heart  ♫

592
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:42,780
How fun.

593
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,970
She looks like you.

594
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:49,080
Does she? 
 ♫  Show me your smile  ♫

595
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:59,180
♫  So my heart for you stays the same forever  ♫

596
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,740
♫  Even if it's not such a splendid world  ♫

597
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:18,300
♫  There's a world I've been dreaming just for you  ♫

598
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,000
♫  I'll teach you to fly high in the sky  ♫

599
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,050
   

600
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:29,000
♫  True happiness always lies in your own heart  ♫

601
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,720
♫  We will forever, oh, I love you  ♫

602
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,600
♫  You will never know  ♫

603
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,940
So how long will it take?

604
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,400
I don't know.

605
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,790
Minimum six months and maximum...

606
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:51,650
His mom won't actually sue him.

607
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,950
She was just warning.

608
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:59,800
She's capable of worse. No, I strongly believe she can do what she wants.

609
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,640
Will you wait for Kang Hu Yeong although you don't know when he returns?

610
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,730
When you don't even know if he can return?

611
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,130
Lee Ddoong!

612
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,250
Are you okay?

613
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,560
Try begging him not to go then.

614
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,370
Why are you so unusually cool about it?

615
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:28,560
But his trying to stay in Korea would be challenging too.

616
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,540
You should go then.

617
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,040
You said he asked you to go with him.

618
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,300
Who'd spend time with you if I did?

619
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,790
Who'd peel onions for Sang Pil?

620
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,240
My company would be in trouble without me.

621
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,010
Kang Hu Yeong is so annoying.

622
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,800
He shouldn't have returned from the start.

623
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,510
He has done so much damage.

624
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:56,440
Forget Kang Hu Yeong! Forget about him.

625
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,020
Forget about a jerk like him.

626
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:04,950
Every day has been like a vacation since Hu Yeong came.

627
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:10,870
I looked forward to what I'd do and what would happen every day.

628
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:15,360
My heart was ticklish all day, but it felt nice.

629
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,370
Hye Ji, I had so much fun.

630
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:23,950
What kind of vacation is this short?

631
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,610
Maybe it was a spring break.

632
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,900
Spring breaks are short but most exciting.

633
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,920
I'll accompany you from now on.

634
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,890
I'll tickle you to death daily.

635
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:37,470
Hey, spend time with Teacher Son instead.

636
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,300
I'll spend time with you.

637
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,600
Just take a break from work.

638
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,220
My vacation starts soon.

639
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,720
What do you think?

640
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,700
Red wines give me a hangover.

641
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,610
That's more reason to drink white wine.

642
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:56,560
Right.

643
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,020
It's great.

644
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,650
   

645
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,610
   

646
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:12,350
Are you ready to leave then?

647
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,920
There isn't much to do.

648
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,840
The business trip was supposed to be ten days long.

649
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,260
You should stay for Christmas. What's the rush?

650
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,650
How impatient.

651
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,480
Why isn't Hong Ju here?

652
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,350
She said she'd be late. The preview screening is next week.

653
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,400
Does she own that company or something?

654
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,190
That's not important right now.

655
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:31,600
Of course, it is.

656
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,270
Her work is all she has now.

657
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,360
She's going to be alone since her boyfriend is leaving.

658
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,690
Hey, Kim Hye Ji.

659
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,390
What?

660
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:45,400
What? You're hiding behind Gyeong Taek?

661
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,280
Yes.

662
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,880
Okay, I give up.

663
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,070
When is Uncle Wook coming?

664
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,490
He said to have fun without him.

665
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,560
Is he really missing our gathering?

666
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,090
He must be in a relationship.

667
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:20,650
Hey, hey. Be careful.

668
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:26,250
No woman likes walking on snow.

669
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,310
What's wrong? Isn't it pretty?

670
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:32,830
We never saw snow together as we dated in  summer.

671
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,110
We dated in winter, okay?

672
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,030
We went snowboarding together too.

673
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,760
Oh, that?

674
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,000
That wasn't you.

675
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,620
You went snowboarding with another woman, didn't you?

676
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,870
What? Am I supposed to chase you?

677
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,360
Be careful you don't fall.

678
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,900
Bones don't heal fast at our age. Wait for me!

679
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,640
By the way, who's your first love, Sang Pil?

680
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,790
Mine is Kang Hu Yeong, and his is Lee Hong Ju,

681
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,090
and hers is Bang Jun Ho—

682
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:15,080
But we don't know whom yours is.

683
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,020
It's someone you don't know.

684
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:21,450
Oh, come on. You never had a woman I didn't know about.

685
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:25,010
It's her: that woman who cheated on you while you were in the army.

686
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,270
Was her name Su Ji?

687
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,350
It's Ji Su, okay?

688
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,150
And she wasn't my first love.

689
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:34,480
My first love...

690
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,570
hasn't come yet.

691
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,970
The woman I'll fall in love with will be my first love,

692
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:49,120
because that'd be my first time loving her.

693
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:56,210
Taek, you're my first love, too.

694
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,580
You are mine, too.

695
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:03,220
No, your first love was your elementary school teacher.

696
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,540
Is she pretty?

697
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:09,050
She's turning 60 soon.

698
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,810
What's wrong with that?

699
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:14,080
You don't think I'll be pretty at 60?

700
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,840
Of course, you'll be beautiful then, too.

701
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,550
You'll be cool when you turn 100, too.

702
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,690
I'll create a hangout before I turn 90.

703
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:30,000
I'll put a kitchen there and for the rest, Hyungnim will...

704
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,960
You figure it out. What does that have to do with him?

705
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,370
   

706
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,510
   

707
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,500
We won't come even if you invited us.

708
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,380
Where's he going?

709
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,220
   

710
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,890
 Hey, where are you? Come here quickly. 
   

711
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,680
 We can't go anywhere right now. 

712
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,040
- Unnie, go back a bit. 
 - Go back?

713
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,100
I think this part isn't working well.

714
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,760
From here to here.

715
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,310
- Are there other sources? 
  - You'd better hurry over! 

716
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:25,470
- I like this. 
  - Everyone is waiting. 

717
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,270
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

718
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:32,050
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

719
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,510
Hong Ju is very late.

720
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:50,440
She said she'd be working all night.

721
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:56,410
I heard you two met in high school because of Hye Ji's letter.

722
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:02,040
We met once by coincidence one morning,

723
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,600
on the bus.

724
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,540
I see.

725
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:10,920
You know I contributed to your reuniting

726
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,400
when you returned to Korea, right?

727
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,610
I picked the cafe for the blind date.

728
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,070
You would have met here anyway,

729
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:31,870
but I think I made it a bit more dramatic.

730
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,430
You're correct.

731
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:38,530
Thanks to you, it was more dramatic.

732
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:42,540
I support your love more than anyone.

735
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,620
It seems the plane will leave just fine tomorrow.

This is unacceptable. Let me come with you.

You can't close the restaurant again today.

Go to work now. You should leave, too.

757

We're all writers from the time we are born.

762
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:38,980
All of you have lied when you were children, right?

763
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,560
 Yes. 

764
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,720
You imagine what you'd say,

765
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,020
and you turn that into a good sentence.

That's what writers do.

767
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:54,500
 You all must have kept diaries and wrote letters, too.

 Yes. 

769
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,900
Read the diaries and letters you wrote then.

770
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:05,010
 He left without a goodbye? 

771
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,950
He said he will see you when he comes back.

Lastly,  does anyone have questions?

Could you tell us what your next book is about?

782

788

Why did they break up?

789
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,200
Because she left him.

790
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,130
It's not your personal story, right?

791
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:20,050
What is it?

792
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:23,750
What do you think?

793
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,200
Do you think I was in a heartbreaking relationship like that?

794

Yes, I think you would have been in one.

795

- Who was it? 
 - It was your ex-girlfriend, right?

Lee Hong Ju.

812
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:14,990
What? It's Kang Hu Yeong.

813
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,810
What are you doing here?

814
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:25,810
Oh, are you really surprised?

815
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:28,610
- You— 
 - I had so many vacation days saved up.

816
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:31,560
You'll be my tour guide this time, okay?

817
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,130
Kang Hu Yeong, this isn't a coincidence, okay?

818
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:42,810
I found you to save you.

819
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:47,530
I'll live thanks to you.

820
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,740
Look at me. I want to see your face.

821
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:02,170
I didn't even tell those guys in order to surprise you.

822
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,470
I've been eager to tell you, but I held back—

823
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:30,320
 In our lives, how many coincidences do we experience? 

824
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,640
 Ma'am, 

825
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,660
 I'm sorry, but please get me some water. 

826
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:11,720
 Here's water. 

827
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:24,400
 Coincidences sometimes go unnoticed. 

828
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,200
 Nice, everyone. I'll take the photo now. 

829
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,750
 Teachers, stand closer. 

830
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,720
 - I'll take it now. 
 - A little closer. 

831
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,810
 One, two... 

832
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:36,510
 Let's go to the cafeteria. Hurry! 

833
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:41,890
♫  All day I think of you  ♫

834
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:45,780
♫  I can't stop worrying about you  ♫

835
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:51,400
 In our lives, how many coincidences do we experience? 

836
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:56,510
 Some coincidences dare to change our lives. 

837
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:59,280
♫  You're the only one  ♫

838
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:05,110
 What's clear is that each coincidence... 

839
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:09,490
 Involves our predetermined decisions. 

840
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:12,030
 Was it a coincidence? 

841
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:14,120
♫  It's you  ♫

842
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:19,090
♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

843
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:22,670
 Gosh, that was too scary. 

844
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,760
♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

845
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,420
♫  It has to be you  ♫

846
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:28,710
 Let me go now. 

847
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:31,360
 Oh!  
 ♫  No matter what  ♫

848
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,100
 Thank you so much. 

849
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,860
 You saved me. 

850
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:43,140
♫  I never believed in destiny  ♫

851
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,880
♫  But since I got to know you  ♫

852
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,320
 Your foot... Is it okay? 

853
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:53,730
 Is he okay?  
 ♫  I am like a star in a drama  ♫

854
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:57,100
♫  I cry and laugh often  ♫

855
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:00,130
♫  Fall in love  ♫

856
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:02,030
♫  It's you  ♫

857
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:05,820
♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

858
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:10,720
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

859
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,790
♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

860
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:16,760
♫  It has to be you  ♫

861
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:21,410
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

862
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:24,530
♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

863
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:27,340
♫  It has to be you  ♫

864
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:32,480
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

865
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,810
 If so, was it a coincidence that we met 

866
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:38,890
 and fell in love? 

867
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,170
   

868
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:45,240
 The flight to San Francisco... 

869
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,640
 I never thought I'd take my first trip abroad with you. 

870
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,310
To the U.S. even. I'm so excited.

871
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,740
Let's get something tasty at Duty-free.

872
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:58,750
- Should we buy a gift for your mom? I'll pay. 
 - Okay.

873
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:04,180
Hong Ju, I'm asking you just to make sure.

874
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,460
You have a visa, right?

875
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,900
Whom do you think I am?

876
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:13,240
Hold on. What visa, by the way?

877
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,550
What's a visa?

878
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:19,890
You really didn't get a visa?

879
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:21,200
What is it?

880
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,320
You can't enter if you don't get a visa.

881
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,510
Do I need it?

882
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:26,700
- Can I not enter? 
 - You can't.

883
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,880
Take a later flight.

884
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,990
🫂  Wishing you a beautiful journey together through life! The Beginning. 💖

885
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:42,160


886
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:48,280
♫  I wonder why I'm being influenced by you  ♫

887
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:54,710
♫  It surprises me how I mimic the way you talk  ♫

888
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:57,720
♫  It's so strange  ♫

889
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:08,700
♫  I wonder if you're like me, too  ♫

890
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:17,990
♫  Could you stop your heart from racing and shaking?  ♫

891
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:27,810
♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

892
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:32,650
♫  So I ask you  ♫

893
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:35,760
♫  Will you respond to my feelings?  ♫
