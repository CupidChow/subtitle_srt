00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,200
♫  It's you  ♫

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,500
    
 ♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,620
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,030
    
 ♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,360
    
 ♫  It has to be you  ♫

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,680
    
 ♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,260
   

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,200
   

9
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:50,010


10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,210
Gosh, my head hurts.

11
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,060
I'd be crazy to drink again.

12
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,340
 How have you been? 

13
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,200
 - Congratulations! 
 - Thank you for the meal. 

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,360
 There's no reason to give up. 

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,280
 This day has come because we have endured. 

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,400
 You know that, right, Producer Lee? 

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,300
 Of course, I have a lot of patience. 

18
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,070
 - For the success of "Special School"! 
 - Cheers! 

19
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,050
 Bottoms up! 

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,200
 Yes, I've been well! 

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,540
 What will you do about it? 

22
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,290
 It's Kang Hu Yeong. 

23
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:57,690
 Kang Hu Yeong is like a smart preschooler. 

24
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,590
 Ramen is the best for hangovers. 

25
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,100
 Ramen is best with dumplings. 

26
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,800
 Keep the dumplings in the freezer. 

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,990
 Keep them frozen. You know, right? 

28
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,370
What's with this story flow?

29
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,390
 I'm sorry, 

30
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,060
 but mine has already started to thaw. 

31
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,340
Oh no.

32
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,030
 Really? 

33
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,330
 So did mine. 

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,410
 It's okay. They won't kill you. 

35
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,600
 See you tomorrow morning. 

36
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,870
"Tomorrow morning"?

37
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,390
Gosh, you scared me.

38
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,920
- You came. 
 - Why didn't you answer your phone?

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,800
Did it run out of battery?

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,300
- Come in. 
 - No.

41
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,400
Get ready quickly and come out. Let's go get gamjatang (pork bones stew).

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,580
Hurry, hurry.

43
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,820
Gosh, I'm happy I'm still alive.

44
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,160
I can have some hangover soup you made.

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,320
By the way, how did you know I drank last night?

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,060
- Just eat. 
 - Okay.

47
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,280
Wow, this is so unbelievably good.

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,120
What's with the dumplings suddenly?

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,610
You craved them, didn't you?

50
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,080
They don't have these in the USA, do they?

51
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,610
What happened with your first love yesterday?

52
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,070
- Uncle, the soup is getting cold. 
 - Yes.

53
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,160
I should have it while it's hot.

54
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,340
You don't mind my inviting a friend, right?

55
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,630
- "A friend"? 
 - Yes, she will be here soon.

56
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,490
- She lives upstairs. 
 - No!

57
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,610
Why are you yelling?

58
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,920
My heart is weak.

59
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,020
I made only two servings.

60
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,270
Enjoy it by yourself.

61
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,680
I'm sure Lee Ddoong drank last night, too.

62
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,880
Gosh, you finished it.

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,970
You shouldn't bother people when they're eating so I held back.

64
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,440
What is it?

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,600
Where and whom did you drink so much with last night that you got so sick?

66
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,720
I was hungry and nauseous.

67
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,900
It wasn't just us last night.

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,940
It was to welcome back Kang Hu Yeong, right?

69
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,260
It was just us four. You said you'd come soon,

70
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,150
but you got drunk.

71
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,560
We invited him. Think how he must have felt.

72
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,830
- I'm sorry. 
 - Don't apologize to me. Apologize to him.

73
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,650
Do you know how much I drank because you didn't come?

74
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,070
Did you force yourself to drink to lift your spirits?

75
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,670
Hye Ji, I deserve to die.

76
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,750
My Hye Ji, how come you're so pretty?

77
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,610
Whatever.

78
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,030
So why were you late last night?

79
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,910
Jun Ho.

80
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,260
I'm a crazy woman. I was out of my mind!

81
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,750
I can't believe it.

82
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,360
You pay.

83
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,470
Do you want pastries, too?

84
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,650
You went to run an errand, but Bang Jun Ho was there?

85
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,960
I could have avoided him, but the director caught me.

86
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,770
So then?

87
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
He asked me how I've been. With a smile, too.

88
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,320
How could he?

89
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,830
What a completely useless swine.

90
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,360
I told you he'd be like that.

91
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,250
He's a rude, crazy jerk who only cares about himself.

92
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,690
- I'll call him. 
 - N-No.

93
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,750
So I said, "Yes, I've been well."

94
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,930
 I've been really well. 

95
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,730
 You seem great, too. 

96
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,190
 I didn't even know you came to Korea. 

97
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,190
 Funny to see you here. 

98
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,120
 Gosh, Producer Park. 

99
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,000
 How was the movie? Wasn't it fun? 

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,080
 I loved the ending so much. What do you think? 

101
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,180
 I was so smooth. 

102
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,510
And as I started drinking with everyone…

103
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,950
I'm sure it was smooth and natural.

104
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,350
Your eyes are still fine.

105
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,530
Of course, they are. Did you think I cried?

106
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,070
How about you? Did you contact Kang Hu Yeong?

107
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,450
Not yet.

108
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,840
Kang Hu Yeong is still as handsome,

109
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,160
but he has a different vibe.

110
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,900
He's totally an adult male now.

111
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,420
Is he?

112
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,290
Well, he had to grow up.

113
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,840
He was really awful back then.

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,660
Kang Hu Yeong? He wasn't.

115
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,100
What do you mean?

116
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,460
Don't you remember what he said then?

117
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,840
 What do you mean "handsome"? 

118
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,840
 His face is small, but his eyes are long, 
   

119
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,520
and his nose is unnecessarily high.

120
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,990
That's what makes him handsome.

121
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,170
Gosh, what an idiot.

122
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,500
Hey, I've delivered ten letters to him already.

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,440
   

124
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,560
- Gosh, you scared me. 
 - Geez.

125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,800
♫  I always believed in myself until I met you  ♫

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,830
Kang Hu Yeong, this is from my friend, Kim Hye Ji.

127
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,400
♫  I thought I'd find happiness in there  ♫

128
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,390
♫  I'll teach you to fly high in the sky so you can fulfill your dreams  ♫

129
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:21,400
Kang Hu Yeong! Hey, Kang Hu Yeong!

130
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,750
Here. This is from my friend, Hye Ji.

131
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,130
♫  Your crystal-clear smile, Baby  ♫

132
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,580
 Hey, get out of the way! 

133
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,180
Move! 
 ♫  Show me your smile  ♫

134
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:41,840
♫  So I can go straight into your heart  ♫

135
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,900
Kang Hu Yeong, this is from my friend, Kim Hye Ji.

136
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,160
 I'm sure he has never liked anyone. 

137
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,300
If that wasn't the case, how could he ignore all those letters?

138
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,450
Hye Ji, instead of someone like him,

139
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,580
how about you like someone who's normal?

140
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,920
Lee Ddoong, then can you give up on Bang Jun Ho?

141
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,360
Why would I give up?

142
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,180
Let's send him a public letter so he can't ignore you this time.

143
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,430
"A public letter"?

144
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,020
Yes.

145
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,480
Kang Hu Yeong is here! He's here!

146
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,970
 What's this? 
   

147
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,420
Answer her!

148
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,440
Hey, hold on! I-I didn't get a photo of it.

149
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,820
How could you erase someone's heart like that?

150
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,770
I still remember that I was so angry.

151
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,040
Hey, when you and I visited a fortuneteller,

152
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,370
she said I'd be living abroad. Remember?

153
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,600
Well…

154
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,050
the one who said you and your ex were meant to be?

155
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,180
But my ex was wrong about the time he was born.

156
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,710
Think carefully.

157
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,770
Why did I become good at English?

158
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,000
I know. Because you liked Brad Pitt.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,660
That's right.

160
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,310
Since then, I thought I'd live in the USA after getting married.

161
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,520
- If so… 
 - If so…

162
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,790
 I can feel it! 

163
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,760
Are you two close?

164
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,590
With whom?

165
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,870
The woman upstairs.

166
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,370
Lee Ddoong? We're really close.

167
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,600
We've been best friends for ten years.

168
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,660
Then ask her to be my guide.

169
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,370
"Lee Ddoong"? A guide for what?

170
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,760
I haven't been back in a while. I can't just leave.

171
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,650
You're leaving next Tuesday.

172
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,360
You have only three days left.

173
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,260
Meet your first love as soon as possible.

174
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,600
What is it? Didn't things go well yesterday?

175
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,930
Just ask her to entertain your nephew from the U.S. for a day.

176
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,180
Skip the details.

177
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,710
Why does it feel like you're being pushy?

178
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,920
Is it just the way I feel?

179
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,460
You don't know who Lee Ddoong is.

180
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,690
I saw her going upstairs yesterday.

181
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,460
So?

182
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,700
Anyway, never mind.

183
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,900
You said you were close with her.

184
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,200
I just wanted to ask casually.

185
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,190
What's the big deal?

186
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,670
 That's why you should be in a relationship. 

187
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,430
That's not even close to carbs.

188
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,600
Yes, it is an essential nutrient.

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,230
Since you're missing relationship nutrients,

190
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,430
your whole body is sending a signal.

191
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,070
"You're dissatisfied. This is an emergency." It's like that.

192
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,940
- Uncle. 
  - Lee Ddoong. 

193
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,100
What are you doing tomorrow?

194
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,960
"Tomorrow"?

195
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,400
Nothing, it seems. Why?

196
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,200
Aren't you meeting your blind date from last week?

197
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,960
You have to tell Hye Ji for me.

198
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,450
I shouldn't be dating right now, right?

199
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,600
Right, you shouldn't be.

200
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,700
You yourself are dating. Why would you tell her that?

201
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,010
Teacher Kim, you're turning 29 this year, right?

202
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,210
Did you go to Ohbok High School?

203
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,480
Yes, why do you ask?

204
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,100
Teacher Kim, did you have a reunion yester—

205
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,800
- What? 
 - Just get to the point.

206
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,790
Okay, give it back.

207
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,580
You're a funny one, aren't you?

208
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,310
Lee Ddoong, can you entertain my relative tomorrow?

209
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,270
Your relative?

210
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,080
The one in the photo?

211
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,070
Yes, that child came to Korea a few days ago.

212
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,710
The youngster hasn't seen anything so go wherever you want.

213
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,090
I'd love to.

214
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,190
Tell the youngster to count on this Unnie.

215
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,380
 - "Unnie"? (female refers to female)  
 - Okay.

216
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,390
Then come to our hideout around 10 a.m.

217
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,410
Thank you in advance.

218
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,060
Are you happy?

219
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,100
Uncle,

220
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,200
has she seen a photo of me?

221
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Yes.

222
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,180
Which one?

223
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,300
How could she have such distinctive features at this age?

224
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,700
She will grow up to be a beauty.

225
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,790
- Isn't that right? 
 - Yes.

226
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,590
So cute.

227
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,550
 Why do you have this photo? 

228
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,170
I want to have a daughter like this.

229
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,230
Lee Ddoong and Teacher Kim were classmates.

230
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,070
They also drank together yesterday.

231
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,310
I just told you I saw her.

232
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,290
You just said you didn't know her. You acted like it.

233
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,990
- Me? 
 - Yes, you did. You, Man.

234
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,850
Are you using me to hang out with your first love?

235
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,100
Hey, hey. I won't ask you anymore, even if you begged me to.

236
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,210
I'm going on a date, too. Hey, where are my clothes?

237
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,110
- Which clothes? 
 - The ones you wore for the blind date.

238
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,380
I'll wear it since you wore it.

239
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,570
It must be in here. Look for it.

240
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,690
Where is it? I didn't see it.

241
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,510
Go ahead and look for it.

242
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,430
First love must be a powerful thing.

243
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,140
It even got Kang Hu Yeong to pull a trick. Seriously.

244
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,420
Then why does he  want to see only Lee Ddoong?

245
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,430
Who is it?

246
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,880
  . 

247
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,120
It's Wook.

248
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,960
He's telling you to bring me tomorrow.

249
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,070
Really?

250
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,350
What should we eat tomorrow? What should we do?

251
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,640
Leave me out of it.

252
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,180
Why?

253
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,460
Where Kim Hye Ji goes, Lee Hong Ju goes.

254
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,330
Where Lee Hong Ju goes, Kim Hye Ji goes, right?

255
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,140
Hang out with us.

256
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,450
Youngsters should play among themselves.

257
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm expecting an important plan tomorrow.

258
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,850
What should I do with the little girl?

260
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,070
What shall I do?

261
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,720
♫  On a date (day) where shadows play  ♫

262
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,570
♫  A familiar echo led my way  ♫

263
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,610
♫  In the distance, soft and sad  ♫

264
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,480
♫  A dream I never could forget  ♫

265
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,090
♫  Whispers of the past in the breeze  ♫

266
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,320
♫  Now starts a new tune and again  ♫

267
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,800
Niece.

268
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,050
 Niece? 

269
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,330
 I'm the Unnie from upstairs. 

270
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,180
Coming.

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,620
Wasn't it a girl?

272
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,420
What are you doing?

273
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,400
The wrong person came out.

274
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,450
Hey.

275
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,570
Hey, why were you in Uncle Wook's house?

276
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,410
Because I'm his nephew.

277
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,740
You can't be. Why did a grown man come out?

278
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,650
But I am.

279
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,050
It can't be you.

280
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,940
It should be her.

281
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,030
Why do you have that photo?

282
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,300
Because I wanted a daughter like her.

283
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,980
Is this really you?

284
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,700
It was my kindergarten talent show.

285
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,570
Why did he ask me to entertain an adult?

286
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,820
Did you know it was me?

287
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,900
I dropped you off at home on Friday.

288
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,530
 See you tomorrow morning. 

289
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,560
You were right about that.

290
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,460
- Quit drinking. 
 - Mind your own business.

291
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,840
You should have said no if you knew it was me!

292
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,290
My friend said she'd entertain me. Why would I refuse?

293
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,440
- Entertain yourself. 
 - Hey.

294
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,570
Let's hang out.

295
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,670
Are you breaking your promise like Friday again?

296
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,310
Let's go anywhere.

297
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,270
Hye Ji, Hye Ji, Kim Hye Ji.

298
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,350
   

299
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,430
 The person you are calling is on another line. 

300
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,520
Kim Hye Ji, of all days…

301
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,730
Lee Hong Ju, you drive.

302
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,070
Can't I make a reservation?

303
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,940
Not even a foot massage, not a full-body one?

304
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,170
Got it.

305
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,130
Why is Kang Hu Yeong busy?

306
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,200
I freed my precious Sunday to hang out with you.

307
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,790
Lee Ddoong couldn't have left already, right?

308
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,760
 Kim Hye Ji! 

309
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,360
Get dressed and come out.

310
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,050
Yes, nature is calling me!

311
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,350
Do you want to go anywhere specific?

312
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,030
You told me to count on the Unnie upstairs.

313
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,050
I was expecting a small, cute girl.

314
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,280
I know. I'd be okay with anything.

315
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,920
I'll choose a spot then.

316
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,560
Okay.

317
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,070
♫  My love  ♫

318
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,930
♫  I always believed in myself until I met you  ♫

319
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,850
I heard there's a festival going on now.

320
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,080
♫  I wanted to live splendidly. I thought I'd find happiness in there  ♫

321
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,310
Let's go.

322
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,690
♫  I'll teach you to fly high in the sky  ♫

323
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,510
♫  So you can fulfill your dreams  ♫

324
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,620
Isn't it fun? 
 ♫  Real happiness is always within your heart  ♫

325
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:24,710
♫  Your crystal-clear smile, Baby, show me your smile  ♫

326
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:34,310
♫  So I can go straight into your heart  ♫

327
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:43,920
♫  Your crystal-clear smile, Baby, show me your smile  ♫

328
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:54,100
♫  So my heart for you stays the same forever  ♫

329
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,510
Why won't she pick up the call?

330
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,640
Please walk slowly. 
    

331
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,120
   

332
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,230
   

333
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,200
   

334
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,750
   

335
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,720
   

336
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,440
 I should have realized. 

337
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,600
Is Uncle crazy?

338
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,540
What's wrong with Uncle?

339
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,210
He's telling us to have fun.

340
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,550
He really is a fool for his nephew.

341
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,610
Are you feeling okay?

342
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,850
Yes.

343
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,510
The rides are kind of boring.

344
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,060
Is there something more intense?

345
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,650
Just go home. You look pale right now.

346
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,220
I'm like this even without any special skincare.

347
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,720
Whatever.

348
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,670
Being in a crowded place exhausts me.

349
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,790
- Are you exhausted? 
 - Yes.

350
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,320
I haven't come out to play in a long time.

351
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,440
On weekdays, I use all my energy working.

352
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,610
I lack energy to go out on weekends.

353
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,940
It turns out I do have energy to play.

354
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,350
I feel I'm on vacation, thanks to you. It's nice.

355
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,620
Let's go.

356
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,360
- Where? 
 - You're not done playing.

357
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,090
What do you want to ride?

358
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,620
Young Man, do you really want to move to the next stage?

359
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,380
- This is… 
 - The essential K-food.

360
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,670
I heard foreigners are crazy about this stuff.

361
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,300
- I'm Korean. 
 - Then you'd love it even more,

362
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,660
as long as you aren't a coward.

363
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,600
"A coward"?

364
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,310
Try it, and don't swallow if it's too spicy.

365
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,140
You'll get heartburn.

366
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,020
 My first love— 

367
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,550
 Spicy! Spicy! 

368
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,250
Do you want to bet who finishes it first?

369
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,510
Look how confident he is.

370
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,860
The loser has to grant the winner's wish.

371
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,600
Start.

372
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,310
It's crazy spicy. Don't you agree?

373
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,260
You can't handle spice.

374
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,400
Me? I'm good at handling spice.

375
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,960
You couldn't eat the spicy chicken feet at Sang Pil's.

376
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,970
I become less pain tolerant when drunk.

377
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,800
I guess alcohol awakens my senses.

378
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,610
- Then this doesn't count. 
 - No way.

379
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,610
You have to grant my wish.

380
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,330
I don't want to.

381
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,760
This is…

382
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,190
You can't skip this when you're in Korea.

383
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,080
My gosh, I've never worn a hanbok before.

384
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,970
Why am I wearing the eunuch's uniform?

385
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,230
Come on. A loser shouldn't complain.

386
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,430
Follow your King.

387
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,840
Who's entertaining whom?

388
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,870
 Wow, the mountains look great. 

389
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,560
Let's come every week, Teacher Son.

390
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,070
I'd love to, Sir.

391
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,440
- Teacher Son. 
 - Yes.

392
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,430
Did you make a reservation at the chicken restaurant?

393
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,800
Yes, I did.

394
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,370
Yes, they have amazing makgeolli (rice wine).

395
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,150
I can't wait to drink the makgeolli after this.

396
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,360
There's nothing to see but the sky and rocks.

397
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,320
Why did we come up here?

398
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,310
There are so many pretty things down below.

399
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,420
Are you okay, Teacher Kim?

400
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,280
I'm okay.

401
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,130
Bukhansan is rocky. You need to be careful.

402
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,620
It really is very rocky.

403
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,390
Wait…

404
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,820
You are wearing running shoes.

405
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,540
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

406
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,360
Don't mention it. I should have been more careful.

407
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,190
I promise I didn't try to do anything.

408
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,780
I didn't grab your hair purposely, either.

409
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,950
But now I know you have a lot of hair.

410
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,750
Pardon?

411
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,080
 Teacher Son! 

412
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,230
Yes, Sir!

413
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,940
 Why are you so slow today? 

414
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,280
Let's go down quickly and drink makgeolli.

415
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,660
Get going. I'll rest a bit here.

416
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,900
I'm okay. You don't have to worry.

417
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,690
- Get going for your career. 
  - Teacher Son! 

418
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,110
You look strong, but you're so weak.

419
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,310
 Come quickly, I said! 

420
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,030
Then I'll be ahead of you.

421
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,260
 - Hurry up, I said!  
 - Coming! Coming!

422
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,140
Gosh, what's going on?

423
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,070
I should be planning a vacation to USA with Kang Hu Yeong instead.

424
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,970
   

425
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,330
   

426
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,640
How interesting can Wook's young relative be?

427
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,570
You can't shock me unless it's Kang Hu Yeong.

428
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,490
 I'm in Korea. 

429
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,630
 I'll be at your place this evening. 

430
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,700
This scoundrel.

431
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,750
Teacher Kim!

432
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,640
Go slowly. You need to go down slowly.

433
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,800
You'll hurt your knees.

434
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,760
No, use an upward angle so my legs look long.

435
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,970
Your legs aren't even visible.

436
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:12,710
I ask you to make the invisible legs look longer, you fool.

437
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,080
♫  Everyday  ♫

438
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,960
♫  You'd let me in your life  ♫

These aren't good. 
 ♫  Run, run  ♫

440
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,030
Photograph the whole body, not just the face.

Make me appear a better version.

442

♫  You used to have my tender, loving heart  ♫

Gosh, the wind.

♫  In love with you  ♫

453
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,830
Are you taking photos?

454
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,630
Yes.

455
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,570
I'll take one.

456
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,700
Did you take it?

457
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,480
   

458
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,390
Call (sounds like "Your Majesty").

459
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,540
Yes, I'm your Majesty.

460
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,110
Joseon's future depends on me.

461
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,080
You got a call, I said.

462
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,410
It's Hye Ji, right? You answer it.

463
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,070
Let's surprise her. Hurry.

464
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,590
- I don't think you should answer it. 
 - Why not?

465
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,060
You're a carp head if you answer it.

466
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,480
   

467
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,640
Kim Hye Ji.

468
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,340
When did she change this?

469
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,520
- What was that? 
 - I thought you might turn into a carp head.

470
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,100
Okay, keep my phone with you.

471
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,120
Don't give it to me. Never.

472
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,640
Let's take photos by the pond there.

473
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,170
I heard it's a great photo spot.

474
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,420
Let's stop taking photos.

475
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,630
Hurry.

476
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,080
Hurry!

477
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,910
Seriously.

478
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,640
I told you to take them from below. You're so stubborn.

479
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,330
Go over there. Go there.

480
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,970
♫  On a night with shining stars, I can't sleep thinking of you  ♫

481
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,870
You need to take one from way down here like this.

482
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,430
This is how you do it.

483
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,810
Look how nice it looks.

♫  I stare at it for a long, long time  ♫

489
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:51,050
♫  I push ahead to try to express my heart to you  ♫

490
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,830
I admit that I'm not so fit.

491
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:57,590
I'm so tired from taking a few photos.

492
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,540
"A few"?

493
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,620
The weather isn't right.

494
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,920
We'll have to skip the highlight of the day.

495
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,000
Is there still a highlight left?

496
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,750
What?

497
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,650
Give me the key; I will drive.

498
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,910
Wow, I look so good in this photo.

499
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,010
It's like I stepped out of a period drama.

500
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,790
You had a good photographer.

501
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,370
You greatly improved, thanks to me.

502
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,300
Look at this. See the photo I took of you.

503
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,700
You look amazing.

504
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,030
That's because I'm a great model.

505
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,400
Do you say that with your own mouth?

506
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,120
I never learned how to lie, you know.

507
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:04,550
Yes, I had fun without unnecessary thoughts, thanks to you.

508
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,680
Return to Korea again soon.

509
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,770
You talk like we won't see each other anymore.

510
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,670
After today, it will likely take years for us to meet again.

511
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,690
That's usual with old classmates.

512
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,410
I will send your photos to you.

513
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,230
 Oh, you can't turn here. 

514
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,270
 I can. 

515
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,750
The day is not over yet.

516
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,500
 - I will get going now, Uncle and Aunt. 
 - Yes. 

517
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,000
Let us see your handsome face more often.

518
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,350
- Don't forget the umbrella. 
 - Okay.

519
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,480
It's pouring like the monsoon season when it's fall.

520
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,430
- I will let you rest. 
 - Okay.

521
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,000
Hong Ju won't answer her phone.

522
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,710
She drank a lot on Friday.

523
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,400
How could you appear in front of Lee Ddoong again?

524
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,900
Was Hong Ju very surprised?

525
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,210
Why would she be surprised?

526
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,010
She has been doing just fine without you.

527
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,410
She's not answering because she's on a date with a guy.

528
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,650
Don't ever appear in front of Hong Ju again.

529
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,610
You're being overprotective.

530
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,840
Yes, I'll protect her as best as I can.

531
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,320
I won't let you get near Lee Ddoong.

532
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,980
Why? Because Hong Ju still likes me?

533
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,780
Are you crazy?

534
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,680
You two broke up three years ago.

535
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,160
You dumped her and ran away!

536
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,170
Aunt was worried,

537
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,680
but I like how straightforward you became after fixing your face.

538
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,930
Hey.

539
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,060
I'm happy as long as Hong Ju is okay.

540
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,280
I have always been jealous of your friendship.

541
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,240
What the heck?

542
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:31,330
He's a piece of trash that's good for nothing. What do I do with him?

543
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,620
Should I kill him?

544
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,000
Who reads books written by a jerk like him?

545
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,100
What a psychotic narcissistic scoundrel.

546
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,500
Lee Ddoong can't get involved with that lowlife.

547
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,180
Seriously! What do I do?

548
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,960
 Eating fried chicken by the Han River 

549
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,810
was the highlight, but...

550
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,150
It won't work today.

551
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,460
I know.

552
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,590
Let's go to the restaurant if you're hungry.

553
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,360
It's okay.

554
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,630
I still got to see what I wanted to see.

555
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,100
Did you want to see the Han River?

556
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,000
So, Kang Hu Yeong,

557
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,350
 you should never meet your first love. 

558
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,900
- Lee Hong Ju, what you told me on Friday— 
 - Oh!

559
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm so sorry. I crossed the boundary that day.

560
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,040
I shouldn't have said that.

561
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,480
What do you know?

562
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,590
How could I have said that without knowing?

563
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,170
When did you know?

564
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:48,050
It was... when we first met.

565
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,870
I didn't then, okay?

566
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,400
I'm sure it started then.

567
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,030
You did that to me when you knew?

568
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,980
I said I'm really sorry.

569
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,020
But think carefully.

570
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,320
About 50% of it was compliments.

571
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,740
"A smart preschooler."

572
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,130
That means you're a genius.

573
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,820
I know you might be offended since it could mean that you're immature.

574
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,150
That's why I'm apologetic for that comment.

575
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,300
Wait. Hold on.

576
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,800
So...

577
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,560
when you said you knew everything...

578
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,070
 He's expressionless and disloyal. He's also inhuman. 

579
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:36,240
 Kang Hu Yeong is like a smart preschooler. 

580
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,630
Did I say something worse than that?

581
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,500
I'm relieved that 50% of it was compliments.

582
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,500
Expensive cars certainly are different.

583
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,650
I've never been in Uncle's new car.

584
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,530
There are many buttons since it's expensive.

585
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,950
Why are you opening the window?

586
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,380
How do you close this?

587
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,260
- Hey. 
 - Why won't this close?

588
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,660
It's because you're messing with it.

589
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,000
Try closing this!

590
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,900
Stay still.

591
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,740
Could you move that way?

592
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,370
Okay.

593
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,810
Well, fix my seat too.

594
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,460
Okay.

595
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:23,890

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,470

Oh.

Wait here. I will get an umbrella.

No need.

617
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,080
I just need to go up the stairs.

618
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,180

00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,840
Why does eating fried chicken sound so romantic?

650
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,200
♫  I will confess  ♫

651
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,410
Is it because he's handsome?

652
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:56,500
♫  I love you so much  ♫

653
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:03,760
♫  Why is it so hard to say this?  ♫

654
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,580
♫  I really  ♫

655
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,380
I thought he was going to kiss me.

656
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,110
♫  I always want to be  ♫

657
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,920
Oh, what do I do?

658
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,670
I must be sexually frustrated.

659
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,300
   

660
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,750
- I'm returning this. 
 - Why not?

661
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,450
Student, the school purchases only books that support the students' education.

662
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,200
That's why I'm saying you need this book.

663
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,920
Write a proper reason for the recommendation then.

664
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,620
This won't meet requirements, okay?

665
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,000
Why not?

666
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,110
"It's fun."

667
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:38,790
"It's so fun that you won't notice if people around you are dying."

668
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:40,000
It's true, though.

669
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,600
Make it sound like Grade 12 level.

670
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:46,690
It is Grade 12 level because I'm in Grade 12.

671
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:49,820
How could I improve on that?

672
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,360
You... you...

673
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,630
Why won't you write back to her?

674
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,280
Text her if you don't like writing letters.

675
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,960
Talk to her in person if you won't text.

676
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,210
She confessed her love. You need to respond, at least.

677
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,790
Why are you telling me this?

678
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,870
Are you Kim Hye Ji?

679
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,330
No response is also a response.

680
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:16,700
I don't need to explain the meaning, right?

681
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,830
Hey, Kang Hu Yeong!

682
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,050
We're in the library.

683
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,600
It's because she likes you.

684
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,040
She's shy because she likes you.

685
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,910
And since she likes you,

686
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:36,530
she knows what it means, but she can't face it.

687
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,940
Have you ever even liked someone?

688
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,770
Do I have to answer such a childish question?

689
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,280
You think you're really smart, don't you?

690
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,910
But no, you know nothing about love.

691
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:58,180
I would never fall for someone like you.

692
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:03,390
It seems you're her representative. Go tell her

693
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,780
to study Korean if she has time to write letters.

694
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:24,600
What I said just now has nothing to do with Hye Ji.

695
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,490
I have been overreacting because it is about my friend.

696
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:32,350
Don't misunderstand Hye Ji.

697
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,410
Whatever your answer, respond properly.

698
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,060
I heard Lee Hong Ju criticized you for being

699
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,630
rude to her in the library. Is that true?

700
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,510
Face forward.

701
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:24,230
Did you truly tell her to study Korean, not write letters?

702
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,670
Come on, you didn't say it, right?

703
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,310
You're not that much of a jerk.

704
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:32,090
You said it, didn't you?

705
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,400
How strange.

706
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,010
Why did you wait so long this time?

707
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:40,240
You don't normally accept letters from girls.

708
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,510
You're also good at saying no.

709
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,580
I thought you liked receiving letters this time.

710
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,100
Hu Yeong, she's here again.

711
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,130
One, two, three, four, five...

712
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,910
Wow, you're good.

713
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:42,840
♫  I feel so strange these days  ♫

714
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,730
Kang Hu Yeong! Hey!

715
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:46,800
♫  All day  ♫

716
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,050
Hey, Kang Hu Yeong! 
 ♫  I think of you  ♫

717
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:56,480
Here. It's from my friend, Hye Ji.

718
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,170
♫  My heart is pounding  ♫

719
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:07,140
♫  Out of countless people, you're so precious  ♫

720
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:12,690
♫  You're the only one who can reach me  ♫

721
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:17,010
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

722
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:21,300
♫  Or are you playing ignorant?  ♫

723
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,520
♫  It's you  ♫

724
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,120
♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

725
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,390
Kang Hu Yeong, this letter is from my friend, Kim Hye Ji.

726
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,130
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

727
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,120
♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

728
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,040
♫  It has to be you  ♫

729
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:45,290
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

730
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,910
   

731
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,800
She's sleeping so soundly.

732
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:32,260
   

733
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,930
Is this what she has been working on?

734
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:03,960
   
   

735
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,680
 "has been love." 

736
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:11,320
 "But the education in Korea doesn't discuss this important topic of love enough." 

737
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,370
 I don't think the book is worthy of mentioning humanity. 

738
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:21,010
Gosh, I fell asleep again.

739
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:24,120
I was going to finish writing it today.

740
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,130
Where did it go?

741
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,830
Did it fly away?

742
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,030
Gosh, I was sure I wrote something great.

743
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,300
What did I write?

744
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,570
   

745
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,110
   

746
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:58,540
   

747
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,430
   

748
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:19,890
♫  I wonder if you're like me, too  ♫

749
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,370
When did I...

750
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:30,960
♫  Could you stop your heart from racing and shaking?  ♫

751
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,770
 Hold on. 

752
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:40,430
♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

753
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,210
♫  So I ask you  ♫

754
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:50,110
♫  Will you respond to my feelings?  ♫

755
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,000
When should we eat fried chicken?

756
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:00,240
♫  Someday, when you find out how I feel  ♫

757
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,150
When should we? 
 ♫  Will you  ♫

758
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:07,920
♫  You need to tell me, too  ♫

759
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,940
♫  That you like me  ♫

760
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,570
   
   

761
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:30,500
Who is this jerk? 
  

762
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,800
Don't they read Hangul?

763
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,030
   

764
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,970
   

765
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:40,810
   

766
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,140
Hello.

767
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,000
Good morning.

768
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,310
Producer Lee, come in for a second.

769
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:20,970
Why does she want to see me first thing in the morning?

770
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,000
Is something wrong?

771
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:32,400
What is it? Why aren't you guys making eye contact with me?

772
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,990
Am I in charge of the bomb again?

773
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,990
I had a good feeling this morning, though.

774
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,000
Come join us.

775
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,690
I have news you've been awaiting.

776
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:51,240
We decided on a piece to celebrate the tenth anniversary.

777
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,820
Really?

778
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:58,310
Writer, this is our producer, Lee Hong Ju.

779
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:01,410
Hello, Sir. I'm Lee Hong Ju—

780
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:11,520
I know Producer Lee well.

781
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,600
It's good to see you again.

782
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:21,090
   

783
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:31,220
Oppa Jun Ho, please talk to me.

784
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:35,600
Oppa, what did I do wrong?

785
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,100
I will fix everything.

786
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,030
Since you wrote this as a movie scenario,

787
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,900
you will have to adapt it to the target audience.

788
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,800
- Are you okay with that? 
 - Of course.

789
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,950
You said you're in the process of writing.

790
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,910
We can be in charge of adaptation.

791
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,600
No, I will do it.

792
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,400
I know...

793
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,840
Producer Lee will help me.

794
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,900
Why would I?

795
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,680
I'm in charge of production

796
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,510
so I won't discuss with you at all, Mr. Bang.

797
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,370
Good morning, everyone.

798
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:43,530
- Today, we're... 
  - Set, set, set. Rock Asset! 

799
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:48,600
 Set, set, set, Rock Asset. 

800
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,800
Set, set...

801
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,510
What are you doing?

802
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,020
I'm thinking.

803
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:09,590
What are you thinking about with such a scary face?

804
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:12,410
- Uncle. 
 - Yes, what?

805
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,800
I can't leave tomorrow.

806
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,600
Why not?

807
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,550
Because of work, of course.

808
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,370
What work? Roem?

809
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,970
That has already been settled.

810
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:27,680
You transferred it to HQ in a week like an ace should. Why can't you leave?

811
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,840
No.

812
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,920
I'm not done yet.

813
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,370
With what?

814
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,860
I haven't looked through it yet.

815
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,960
Of course, I'd be happy if you stayed longer. But...

816
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,000
I thought you had an important plan in the U.S.

817
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,100
A week.

818
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,120
I can handle it then.

819
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,400
I will discuss the contract with Minoo Pictures then.

820
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,200
Okay, I will think of how to adapt it then.

821
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,500
Farewell.

822
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:12,580
Lee Hong Ju, come in for a second.

823
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,870
CEO Bae, I will stop by the restroom.

824
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:43,670
I'm back, Hong Ju.

825
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,900
I went to do research for my novel.

826
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,800
That doesn't matter anymore.

827
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,800
Were you upset?

828
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
"Upset"?

829
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,100
That's why...

830
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,500
I'm back now.

831
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:11,900
I wanted to see you privately to ask you not to let anyone in the office

832
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:16,760
know about our past. That's all.

833
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:21,850
I don't care at all if you decide to work or not work with Peter's Pen.

834
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:24,430
You said I have to work with you

835
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:27,590
if I turn my book into an animation.

836
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,480
I said that...

837
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,000
before we broke up, Mr. Bang.

838
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,400
Hong Ju,

839
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,190
we never broke up.

840
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:48,140
I never stopped thinking about you for three years and

841
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,500
I know you didn't, either.

842
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:01,070
Was everything written here a lie?

843
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,850
I believe you'd never be like that,

844
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,220
but I'm asking you just in case.

845
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:14,980
You can't be delaying your departure due to your first love, right?

846
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:22,100
Teacher Kim isn't a femme fatale or anything.

847
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:26,000
Gosh, why are you suddenly stopping, Man?

848
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:30,640
What? It's Lee Ddoong.

849
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,000
What the heck?

850
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,220
Why is that jerk there?

851
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,400
- Who is he? 
 - You wouldn't know.

852
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,000
He's Lee Ddoong's ex and

853
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,490
her first love, a total son of a gun.

854
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,870
Lee Ddoong!

855
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:55,400
Uncle.

856
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,800
- Kang Hu Yeong? 
 - When did he return to Korea?

857
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,550
Why were you with that snake?

858
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,400
Hong Ju.

859
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,100
"Hong Ju"?

860
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,950
Uncle.

861
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,100
Take care then, Mr. Bang.

862
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,500
If you really have no feelings for me,

863
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,400
there's no reason not to work on the project together.

864
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:26,430
Your acting like this... means you still like me.

865
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,610
You little...

866
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:36,410


867
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:39,640
Lee Hong Ju, I'm glad you're here.

868
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:44,770
The hair tie you left last night is in my car.

869
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,700
We can go get it.

870
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,370
Yes, it's my favorite hair tie.

871
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:53,800
Let's go.

872
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:59,000
♫  I can't stop worrying about you  ♫

873
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,020
♫  My heart is pounding  ♫

874
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:05,000
   

875
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
   

876
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,100
   

877
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,200
 I'll confess my love to Oppa and leave. 

878
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,700
 Don't confess. 

879
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,200
 Why not? 

880
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,100
 Because... 

881
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,100
 I will report you, 

882
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,270
 for dating a soldier when you're a student. 

883
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:27,620
 You'd report me? Are you crazy? 

884
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,160
 Back then, we were... 

885
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,670
 Pathetic, but we were lovely. 

886
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:36,920
 We were clumsy but passionate. 

887
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,470
 Probably. 
   

888
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:47,400
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

889
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:54,930
♫  I never believed in destiny  ♫

890
01:05:54,930 --> 01:06:00,490
♫  But since I got to know you  ♫

891
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:04,300
♫  I am like a star in a drama  ♫

892
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,300
 I need to work on the tenth anniversary project. 

893
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,310
 It's Bang Jun Ho's book. 

894
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:11,420
 Was it all Bang Jun Ho? 

895
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:15,970
 There's no way Hong Ju could say no. 

896
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,420
 Gosh, are you stupid? 

897
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,530
 Is it a bad memory for you? 

898
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:25,750
 Everything linked to Bang Jun Ho is bad. 

899
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,270
 Do you want fried chicken? 

900
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:30,960
 You're as clueless and dumb as ever. 

901
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,550
 Are you sure you can leave like this? 

902
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,620
 Hong Ju was in a car accident. 

903
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,200
 It's not a big deal. Why are you getting angry? 

904
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,100
 Is this still nothing? 

905
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:45,240
♫  And difficult sometimes  ♫

906
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,300
♫  Everything is okay  ♫
