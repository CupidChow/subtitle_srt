Hello? 
    

13
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,160
 I'm near your school. Do you want to wait? 

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,620
No, I'm okay.

 Really? 

16
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,260
Come home quickly. I have something important to say.

17
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,840
What is it about?

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,190
We're moving to the U.S. this month.

19
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,010
What about school?

20
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,810
You won't go to school anymore. You don't have to worry about it.

21
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,890
Mom.

22
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,060
Hu Yeong,

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,630
do I ever go back on my decisions?

24
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,780
Come home.

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,540
Hey, Kang Hu Yeong! Wait right there.

26
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,300
I'll be right over. Wait.

Kang Hu Yeong, wait!

 I'm happy 

30
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,340
 that your relationship failed. 

31
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,310
This reminds me of when we fell into the pit.

32
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,060
Stop reminding me of the past I want to forget.

Lee Hong Ju.

34

Recover soon,

You could have dodged it.

I couldn't because I was surprised.

I need to give him the sneakers.

75
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,350
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

76
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,370
Teacher Son.

 - I need to get going. I'm sorry!

Wait...

80
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,960
I saw him going this way.

81
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,850
Didn't he?

82
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,460
   

83
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,120
You scared me!

84
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,610
You should have called out if you were here. What are you doing?

85
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,890
I did call you.

86
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,410
Did you really?

87
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,260
Was I too focused again?

88
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,040
Hey, give me some goggles, too.

89
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,270
Don't bother me; go away.

90
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,430
Do you know how delicate a prepping operation is?

91
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,970
No, I need to keep myself busy.

92
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,300
Hey!

93
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,090
What?

94
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,970
Stop peeling.

95
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,700
This isn't an onion anymore. It's garlic.

96
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,310
What?

97
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,590
When did it get so small?

98
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,720
- Kwon Sang Pil. 
 - What?

99
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Why aren't you dating these days?

100
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,030
Do you think I don't want to?

101
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,120
You and Kim Hye Ji ignored me when I asked for a blind date.

102
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,810
It's because you're too good for anyone.

103
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,590
I don't care anymore.

104
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,510
I won't date until things become stable at the restaurant.

105
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,430
Right.

106
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,520
What do you mean by "right"?

107
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,600
What is it? Are you dating these days?

108
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,140
Bring more onions.

109
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,870
I'll peel all of your onions today.

110
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,460
Okay. Here are the onions!

111
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,560
 The customer is not answering the phone. 
   

112
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,440
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

113
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,980
He won't come to work or answer his phone.

114
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,410
What's he doing?

115
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,100
She parked here again. Here we go again!

116
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,710
Geez, you've got to be joking.

117
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,190
   

118
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,060
Hello? Hello—

119
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,560
CEO Bae Hye Suk...

120
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,100
CEO Bae Hye Suk, I think I told you over 1,000 times

121
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,320
not to park in front of my building... Ma'am.

122
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,690
I don't think it was over 1,000 times... Sir.

123
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,180
I don't think that's my point... Ma'am.

124
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,200
You're a CEO who works with numbers, but you're exaggerating too much.

125
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,930
I can't really trust you. Don't you think?

126
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,790
- What does that have to do with— 
 - And to be accurate,

127
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,210
my car is parked in front of this building, not your building.

128
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,400
The owner of this building allowed me to park,

129
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
unlike someone so petty.

130
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,230
"P-Petty"?

131
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,500
"P-Petty"? Me?

132
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,190
You've got to be fooling me.

133
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,010
Why does our CEO insist on parking there?

134
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,110
- There are spots over here too. 
 - Further this way...

135
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,490
Actually, CEO had been trying to buy that building for a while.

136
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,760
- But three years ago, that man bought it before she could. 
 - Am I petty?

137
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,210
Once she holds on to something, she never lets go.

138
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,340
I can see why she's holding grudges.

139
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,400
Right?

140
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,900
Is it because...

141
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:26,890
Is it because I'm your first love, and you haven't moved on?

142
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,450
I think you mean yourself.

143
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,910
You were a loser but cute when you were young.

144
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,490
But now...

145
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,230
How pathetic.

146
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,780
Please stop acting familiar with me. It's annoying!

147
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,740
"P-Pathetic"? "Annoying"?

148
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,720
You aren't my first love, Bae Hye Suk!

149
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,060
And stop parking in front of my building!

150
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,480
See? You...

151
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,450
You're a little closer to this side!

152
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,300
 I liked you then, and I like you now. 

153
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,720
 It took me too long to say that. 

154
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,600
 Are you happy? 

155
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,420
 Yes, I am. I feel satisfied. 

156
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,680
You shouldn't be acting that way now.

157
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,800
- Why? 
 - I tried to extend your business trip

158
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,650
using the Roem project, but HQ won't allow it.

159
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,480
Have you talked to your mom?

160
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,920
She won't answer my calls.

161
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,590
How about you go to the States then return?

162
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,780
Finish the project you were working on,

163
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,050
plan for the early phase, and talk to your mom.

164
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,930
Don't you think you'd get assigned back here then?

165
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,490
How long would that take?

166
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,940
A month?

167
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,190
A month and a half or two months?

168
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,500
That's why I don't want to.

169
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,600
Don't you want to? Then what will you do?

170
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,000
Will you quit your job or something?

171
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,470
There's no guarantee that things will work out with Lee Ddoong.

172
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,070
What's so great about a first love that you'd bet all on it?

173
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,800
Did something happen to you?

174
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,210
I'm worried about you right now!

175
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,160
Whatever! Do whatever you want!

176
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,650
I won't worry about you anymore.

177
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,690
Be in love for 1,000 years.

178
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,000
 Do you think you're the only one with a first love? 

179
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,150
 I have one, too! 

180
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,460
What's wrong with him?

181
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,700
- Teacher Min Seok. 
 - Yes?

182
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,360
Did Teacher Son go to the class assembly?

183
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,940
- No, he went to the vice principal's office. 
 - Why?

184
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,040
He kept wanting to see Teacher Son today for some reason.

185
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,220
- Really? 
 - Yes.

186
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,490
Teacher Son!

187
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,220
Why was it so difficult to see you all day?

188
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,130
I've been looking for you everywhere.

189
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,170
I'm sorry. Well,

190
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,400
the vice principal wanted to see me.

191
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,000
Here's the thing.

192
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
This weekend, he wants me to—

193
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,900
- Did Dad ask you to go hiking with him again? 
 - No, it's not that.

194
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,300
For this weekend, he asked me to...

195
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,100
plan a date...

196
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,000
- A d-date... 
 - D-Date, what date?

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,380
He asked me to plan a hiking date with the teachers.

198
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,800
Isn't he sick of climbing the same mountain all the time?

199
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:34,000
He tries to do things with you every weekend since you never refuse.

200
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,290
Things are easier for me and my sister, thanks to you,

201
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,610
but he's taking it too far.

202
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,390
You should start saying no to him.

203
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,000
I'll try my best.

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,910
Good. What are you doing tomorrow?

205
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,520
- Me? 
 - Yes.

206
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,800
- Why do you ask? 
 - We have only four periods tomorrow.

207
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,840
- Let's go get something tasty. It's my treat. 
 - It's okay.

208
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,930
It's because I'd like to thank you. Don't feel pressured.

209
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,020
I-It's nothing. I didn't do much.

210
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,730
You did a lot.

211
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,030
If it wasn't for you,

212
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,830
I would have been a clueless friend who interfered with my friend's relationship.

213
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,820
Do you already have plans, by chance?

214
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,610
No, I don't.

215
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,650
Then tomorrow, your afternoon is mine.

216
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,690
I'm glad.

217
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,300
   

218
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,340
Who's the "Carp Head"?

219
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,040
I don't know.

220
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,150
   

221
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,500
   

222
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,440
Why is everyone doing this to me?

223
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,560
What are you saying? Finish eating first.

224
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:36,270
Hey, I ate pork. Why does it taste like onion?

225
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,710
Hong Ju, I think there's a crack in your head.

226
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,920
Are you okay?

227
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,260
Let go.

228
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,920
Okay.

229
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,360
Hu Yeong will be here in a while.

230
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,240
Oh, why?

231
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,340
To eat!

232
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,830
Geez! Who said you could invite him?

233
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,780
Why can't I invite my friend to my restaurant? What?

234
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,780
I can't eat comfortably because of Kang Hu Yeong.

235
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,420
Hey, hey.

236
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,750
Hey, hey, hey.

237
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,080
Hong Ju, I'll put this on your tab!

238
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,640
-  Okay!  
 - It's 37,000 won ($27)!

239
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,950
 Here's the soju you ordered. 

240
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,810
 Hey. 

241
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,700
She ran away as if debt collectors were after her.

242
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,130
Is it a fight or a fling?

243
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,700
Okay.

244
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,900
Is it my turn to step in?

245
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,640
What?

246
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:59,010
 Bus numbers 6716 and 603 are arriving soon. 

247
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,590
   
   

248
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,300
 Hey, Kang Hu Yeong! Wait right there. I'll be right over. 

249
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,100
 Wait. 

250
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,950
Oh, it was then.

251
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,800
Wow, why do I remember that?

252
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,140
Gosh, Kwon Sang Pil, that jerk.

253
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,410
He made an injured person peel all those onions.

254
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,250
   

255
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,760
   

256
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,430
Black... What?

257
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,360
"No color..."

258
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,250
"can change the color black."

259
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:45,300
"That's why my love for you is black, Oppa."

260
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,380
"It will never change..."

261
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,400
How could the color black change?

262
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,820
What?

263
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,110
Did you just change, too?

264
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,680
You said the color black lasts forever.

265
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,090
Why won't you answer my call?

266
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,560
Come back.

267
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,840
   

268
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,350
They say a breakup is part of a relationship too.

269
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,520
I suppose my relationship is finally ending.

270
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,280
 Kang Hu Yeong, wait! 

271
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:39,600
♫  I hope that you, whom I'm looking at, will look at me, too  ♫

272
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,380
♫  You appear in my dreams  ♫

273
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,970
 What? I told him to wait. 

274
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:53,380
♫  I hope you see me in your dreams  ♫

275
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:05,520
♫  I hope you, whom I like, will like me, too  ♫

276
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,370
   

277
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:21,000
♫  I hope you come a bit closer to my heart now  ♫

278
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,120
♫  Did we get reunited by coincidence?  ♫

279
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,790
   

280
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:31,770
♫  Did we get reunited by coincidence?  ♫

281
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,040
♫  The days we spent like that  ♫

282
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,830
   

283
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,510
   

284
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,200
 Everyone knows how it ends. 
   

285
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,170
 Yet why do they go through the pain? 

286
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,600
♫  Was it a coincidence?  ♫

287
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:58,600
♫  I hope that you, whom I'm looking at, will look at me, too  ♫

288
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,850
You can live just fine without it.

289
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,850
You can.

290
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:11,300
♫  I hope you come a bit closer to my heart now  ♫

291
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,350
   

292
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,510
   

293
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,090
   

294
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,470
   

295
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,910
   

296
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,410
   

297
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,890
   

298
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,680
   

299
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,300
Put down your anger.

300
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,690
This, too, shall pass.

301
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,470
Everything has to pass eventually.

302
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,820
 Hong Ju! 

303
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,990
 Lee Hong Ju! 

304
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,690
I won't go.

305
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,690
I'm taking a day off for the first time in two years.

306
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,790
Have you seen me close the restaurant?

307
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,590
Can't you see my condition?

308
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,070
I injured my leg and...

309
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,430
I injured my leg!

310
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,110
You ran around just fine yesterday,

311
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,270
 and I didn't tell you to drive or run. 

312
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,300
Just sit down and enjoy yourself.

313
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,220
You two enjoy yourselves.

314
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,550
What? It's not only we two.

315
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,880
Your landlord is in the car, and...

316
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,310
Hye Ji is getting out of school early today, too.

317
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,610
Isn't the timing amazing? Doesn't it sound so fun?

318
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,070
When will we enjoy ourselves if not today, Hong Ju?

319
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,180
Hong Ju!

320
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,610
Okay. Honestly,

321
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,470
you're just at home, work, and my restaurant all the time.

322
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,280
Besides going to restaurants with Hye Ji, you're having no real fun.

323
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,270
Can't you give yourself a day off after ten years of hard work?

324
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,810
Gosh, I'll have to pass. I'm not in the mood for fun, and...

325
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,090
I said things are awkward between us.

326
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,900
- Really? 
 - Yes.

327
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,120
Okay. Rest then.

328
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,950
Hey, Hu Yeong! Hong Ju feels awkward—

329
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,950
Darn it.

330
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,540
♫  I will give you all my stars  ♫

331
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,800
♫  Our memories whenever we're apart  ♫

332
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
♫  When I see you wishing every day  ♫

333
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,540
My head hurts.

334
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,300
♫  You'd let me in your life  ♫

335
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,050
♫  Run, run, run to you  ♫

336
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,920
What a nice car.

337
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,170
It's fun to drive it on the highway.

338
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,630
Hu Yeong, I'll lean my seat backward.

339
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,040
Okay.

340
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,600
- Uncle, are you sick? 
 - Don't talk to me.

341
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,910
I'm sad right now so don't talk to me.

342
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,240
Let me lean a little further back,

343
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,300
a little more.

344
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,760
Love?

345
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,180
Darn it all.

346
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,440
♫  Say that you'll come and take my hand  ♫

347
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,720
♫  Bring me loving, loving dreams of you  ♫

348
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,550
What's with you two today?

349
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,680
It's like you're both having a fling.

350
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,580
You'd better shut your mouth.

351
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,550
Otherwise, I'll slap your neck.

352
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:03,020
Yes, Ma'am.

353
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,320
♪ Aigoo, how nice! ♪

354
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:14,830
♫  It's our story. I want to fall in love with you  ♫

355
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,110
 I'll get some drinks and snacks. 

356
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,820
I'll come with you then.

357
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,000
Wait here.

358
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,100
Kwon! Wait for me!

359
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,250
Hey!

360
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,730
I'll pretend nothing happened yesterday.

361
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,760
Regarding what exactly?

362
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,160
The fact that I kissed you?

363
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,320
Or the fact that I said I liked you?

364
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,090
All of it, all of it!

365
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,760
- I don't want you to. 
 - Why?

366
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,980
We're friends.

367
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,300
I had so much fun when we roamed Seoul together.

368
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,900
But look at us now.

369
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,530
It's so awkward and uncomfortable. How can we have fun?

370
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,110
I'm having more fun now.

371
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,510
You keep showing interest in me.

372
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,220
I like being with you when you're aware of my presence.

373
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,480
I'll go to the restroom.

374
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,170
- Let me help you. 
 - Gosh.

375
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,210
Just hold this.

376
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,500
- But still— 
 - No!

377
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,200
- Stay away. 
 - Geez...

378
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,800
What's wrong with him?

379
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,660
What's he so happy about?

380
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,190
Yes, let's have fun.

381
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,270
Just forget about Kang Hu Yeong and have fun.

382
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,660
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

383
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,860
I'll drive.

384
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,590
You must have closed up late last night.

385
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,360
Nice! I was feeling tired anyway.

386
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,830
Are you trying to kill us all?

387
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,610
I've driven for ten years.

388
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,020
I can drive with just my big toe.

389
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,890
Sit in the back.

390
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,590
Deal.

391
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,000
Uncle, sit in the front.

392
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,090
It's too bright!

393
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,180
   

394
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,100
   

395
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,960
 Let's discuss the project formally. 

396
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,150
 I'll wait to hear from you. 

397
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,230
Hand me a walnut pastry.

398
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,050
Do you want to die?

399
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,150
I'm driving.

400
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,060
♫  I always believed in myself until I met you  ♫

401
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,970
There's one left.

402
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,510
I'll eat it if you don't take it.

403
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,970
♫  I thought I'd find happiness in there  ♫

404
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:17,880
♫  I'll teach you to fly high in the sky so you can fulfill your dreams  ♫

405
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,660
You need to eat walnut pastries at the rest stops.

406
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,410
Do they have walnut pastries at rest stops in the U.S.?

407
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,900
I don't think so.

408
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,470
How about sausage and rice cake skewers?

409
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,230
Do you think they'd have those?

410
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,800
Let's get more on the way back then.

411
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,800
You should eat a lot before you go back to the U.S.

412
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,560
♫  So I can go straight into your heart  ♫

413
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,030
Wow, it's the ocean!

414
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,400
Kang Hu Yeong, it's the ocean!

415
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,660
Kwon Sang Pil, Uncle, wake up. We're here.

416
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,390
Wow, it's the ocean.

417
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,380
 The ocean? Where? 

418
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,850
Let's go. Uncle.

419
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:59,590
 I mean, Ahjussi. Let's go fishing. 

420
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:03,030
How nice.

421
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,880
I love it.

422
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,400
I'll catch something amazing this evening.

423
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,970
Let's have sashimi (raw fish) for dinner.

424
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,820
This is nice.

425
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,390
Wow, this is crazy. We have an ocean view.

426
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,630
 What's this? 

427
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,530
We can have a barbecue here later.

428
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,920
What's that?

429
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,840
Sang Pil brought ingredients for cooking.

430
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,240
"Fishing is a discipline in the equality of men"

431
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,920
"for all men are equal before fish."

432
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,090
Former U.S. President,

433
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,480
Herbert Hoover.

434
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,630
"You fish with your heart."

435
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,950
"The Fishermen and the City," (reality show) Lee Kyung Kyu.

436
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,240
Wow, he wanted to have a vacation so badly.

437
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,050
What would he have done if you didn't come to Korea?

438
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,320
What?

439
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,700
You should join them and fish, too. I'll clean up here.

440
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,440
Let's clean then go there together.

441
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,100
You do it alone.

442
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,370
Gosh.

443
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,330
   

444
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,960
Did you guys arrive?

445
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,880
Kim Hye Ji, hurry up.

446
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,580
I need you so badly.

447
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,420
Hang out with Kang Hu Yeong.

448
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,770
I don't want to. I hate him so much.

449
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,640
You hate him?

450
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,490
The strong denial sounds like strong affection.

451
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,760
No.

452
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,530
How about you? You're coming with Teacher Son, right?

453
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,710
Yes.

454
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,120
I didn't tell him it was an overnight trip.

455
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,370
Vice Principal...

456
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,830
I appreciate that you like me,

457
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,770
but that's not for me.

458
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,890
That's not true.

459
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,880
You're the only one who makes sense, I said.

460
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,560
I have an eye for these things.

461
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,160
No, Sir. I really can't do it.

462
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,740
Okay.

463
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,330
I can't force you when you don't want it.

464
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,420
Okay.

465
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,300
Just try meeting her, at least.

466
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,400
I'll give you her phone number.

467
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,840
Sir. Vice Principal!

468
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,870
Teacher Son.

469
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,100
Hi.

470
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,340
What are you doing?

471
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,850
What? You haven't caught any.

472
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,190
You came here.

473
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,120
Hong Ju, there's a fishing pole on the side.

474
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,850
Let's go fish on the seawall.

475
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,200
Take Kang Hu Yeong with you.

476
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,460
You've never fished before, right?

477
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,800
I went with friends a few times.

478
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,440
I'll show you what true fishing means.

479
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,360
Let's go.

480
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,350
Let's go.

481
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,820
What are you doing? Hold it.

482
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,600
Take it with you.

483
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,740
- We'll be back, Hong Ju. 
 - Okay.

484
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,270
Let's go.

485
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,900
See you.

486
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,970
Watch Ahjussi.

487
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,060
Wait for me.

488
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,220
Hurry up!

489
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:19,220
"Peter's Pen will be in full charge of the production."

490
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,270
That includes human resources too.

491
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,480
There's no way you wouldn't know that, CEO Ju.

492
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,120
It's just a suggestion.

493
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,740
Having Writer Bang Jun Ho and Producer Lee Hong Ju work together won't be good.

494
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,730
Let's replace the producer for the sake of the project.

495
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,440
Do you know what is the charm of animated films?

496
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,310
There's no limit to imagination and expression.

497
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:00,550
How the world looks and what someone's eyes look like,

498
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,950
the creator gets to decide everything.

499
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,550
The most important part of it is

500
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:13,510
that the entire production crew needs to understand that world clearly.

501
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,770
The ones who understand the world of "My Avant-garde Love"

502
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,320
are Writer Bang and Producer Lee, don't you think?

503
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,530
Those two are the best candidates for the project.

504
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,600
And Producer Lee is a professional.

505
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,390
She's not an amateur who gets personal feelings involved.

506
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,230
I suppose our writer isn't a professional.

507
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,370
But we can't replace the writer.

508
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:48,050
Then let's do this.

509
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,670
What do you mean all of a sudden?

510
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:58,070
 Start working at Writer Bang's studio starting next week. 

511
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,040
Why would I?

512
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,760
 We agreed to finish the adaptation in a month. 

513
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,510
Work with him closely and bring the best result.

514
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,760
Because we're professionals.

515
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,540
But CEO Bae, I'm still far from being a professional.

516
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,010
CEO Bae!

517
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,500
What did they say at the HQ?

518
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,900
Did they say something again?

519
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,200
What's going on?

520
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,760
Did you put glue on yours?

521
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,110
How come you catch one every time you dip in?

522
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,620
My client was a fishing fanatic.

523
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,350
I learned over his shoulder.

524
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,410
You're annoyingly good at everything.

525
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,380
Don't worry. I don't know how to prep it.

526
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,550
Come on.

527
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,990
All right...

528
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:22,500
Aigoo. What's the point of catching a hundred flounders?

529
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,600
You can't capture your first love's heart. Aigoo...

530
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,200
Don't you need to see your fishing-fanatic client?

531
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,330
No.

532
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:37,930
What did your mom say? She allows you to do whatever you want?

533
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,480
What did your mom say when you said you'd open a restaurant?

534
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,700
She begged me to at least give it a try.

535
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,110
She never had any hopes for me.

536
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,640
You don't get it since you're good at everything, right?

537
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,830
My mom has no hopes for me, either.

538
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:02,550
She decides what she wants from me first.

539
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:05,670
I wonder if she planned this too.

540
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,510
Hey! Isn't that Hong Ju? That hat?

541
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,950
 It will be high tide soon. 

542
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:20,700
Hong Ju! Come out!

543
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,000
It's going to be high tide! Come out of there!

544
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,340
Hong Ju... Hey, hey, hey!

545
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,750
Hey, hey! Geez...

546
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,070
Can I catch one?

547
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,110
You should be careful.

548
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,940
I almost fell.

549
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,700
It will be high tide soon.

550
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,140
- You would catch a cold if you get wet. 
 - Hey, look at this.

551
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,540
Come on. Look.

552
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,180
Look, do you see it?

553
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,010
- What am I supposed to see? 
 - Right here.

554
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,010
Isn't that sea cucumber?

555
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,880
So?

556
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,520
Catch it.

557
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,360
I don't want to.

558
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,240
I caught enough fish so we don't have to eat this stuff.

559
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,990
Fish is different from sea cucumber.

560
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,790
Are you scared?

561
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,500
It's gross (slimy).

562
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,390
Gross things can scare you.

563
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,770
Since you can't do it...

564
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,150
I can catch it, okay?

565
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,300
- What do I do? It's moving, Hong Ju. 
 - What do we do?

566
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,810
Here. Put it in here, in here.

567
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:14,680
Done, right? Let's go.

568
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,160
Are there some more?

569
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,380
The tide is coming in.

570
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,050
I heard you can also catch octopus here.

571
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,790
Octopus...

572
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,660
 Wow, the weather is so nice. 

573
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,900
- Isn't it? 
 - Yes.

574
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,310
This is our first time out together, right?

575
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,240
W-We went to Bukhansan last time...

576
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,710
That doesn't count.

577
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,380
I wore random clothes that day.

578
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,820
You still looked pretty.

579
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,500
Did I?

580
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,900
That day counts then.

581
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,580
Excuse me. 
    

582
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,580
Hey, Unnie.

583
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,640
I said I can't go home today.

584
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,550
Dad? I didn't tell him.

585
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,290
Tell him if he asks

586
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,030
that I went on a trip with Hong Ju.

587
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,860
What? Photo of whom?

588
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,770
Why do you need his photo?

589
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,460
Yes.

590
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,520
Really?

591
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,790
Of course, I don't have his photo.

592
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:31,590
I'll call you later, Unnie.

593
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,780
Okay.

594
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,700
By chance, are you and my sister...

595
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,000
having a blind date, I see.

596
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:01,360
She asked me to send her your photo.

597
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,100
Send me one if you have one that's nice.

598
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,450
No, I'll take one for you at the ocean.

599
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,350
Actually, Ms. Kim...

600
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,120
The thing is that I...

601
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,910
♫  I spread old photos in front of the fire  ♫

602
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:27,510
♫  I stare at it for a long, long time  ♫

603
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,530
Hey, over there! Look over there.

604
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:37,120
♫  Slowly, slowly, I'll come to you  ♫

605
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,490
Is there one?

606
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:43,020
Wow! It's huge.

607
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,450
Put it in here.

608
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,580
- Here. 
 - Yes!

609
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,320
Is one in there too?

610
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,290
You're good at catching them.

611
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,830
I keep getting more whenever I dip my hand in.

612
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:08,890
♫  I can't sleep thinking of you  ♫

613
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:13,050
- Another one! 
 - Hooray!

614
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:18,300
♫  I try to recall my buried old feelings  ♫

615
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,200
♫  Seeing the photo where I'm smiling awkwardly  ♫

616
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,590
By the way, we should get going.

617
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,180
Everyone else left.

618
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,960
You said you wanted to eat octopus. 
 ♫  I was very happy then  ♫

619
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,280
♫  I ignored my feelings like a fool  ♫

620
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,200
What?

621
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,620
Come here.

622
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,520
 It's an octopus. 

623
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,590
"Octopus"?

624
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:44,400
♫  I spread old photos in front of the fire  ♫

625
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,990
♫  I stare at it for a long, long time  ♫

626
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,470
You're right.

627
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,320
- Can I try catching it? 
 - Yes.

628
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,880
♫  I push ahead to try to express my heart to you  ♫

629
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,380
Wow, it must be so strong. It won't let go.

630
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,550
Hold it tightly. I'll grab it out.

631
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,390
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

632
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,790
We missed the octopus. Let's go.

633
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,300
You tried to kiss me just now, right?

634
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,390
What are you saying?

635
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,840
- Lee Hong Ju. 
 - I didn't!

636
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,740
Where's your hat?

637
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,040
My hat?

638
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,970
It was here...

639
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,600
It was right here.

640
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,410
Lee... Lee Hong Ju!

641
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:32,900
Go and catch all of them again!

642
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,320
 I'm sorry. 

643
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,850
 Lee Hong Ju! Stop right there! 

644
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,420
 I said I'm sorry! 

645
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:59,220
I asked you to pound the garlic, not purée it.

646
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,400
Teacher Kim.

647
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,810
Lee Ddoong, you came.

648
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,820
Yes. What are you doing, by the way?

649
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,130
I'm preparing dinner.

650
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,600
Stop, stop, stop!

651
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,720
Hey, stop her.

652
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,030
Let it go now.

653
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,320
- I need to do four more. 
 - It's okay. He will do it.

654
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,720
Hey, put this down, and let's go.

655
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,150
We'll get some fresh air.

656
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,840
What's wrong with Teacher Kim?

657
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,170
I don't know.

658
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:39,710
I've never seen her so angry since her ex cheated.

659
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:51,670
You tried to have a good time with your friends.

660
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:54,480
I'm sorry I ruined the mood.

661
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,200
She's the one who's acting out.

662
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,610
Don't worry about her.

663
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:00,050
Hu Yeong, pound the garlic for me.

664
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,000
- C-Can I help with anything? 
 - No, no, no!

665
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,220
Just relax. Just relax.

666
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:07,130
Play Go-Stop with the drunk man over there if you want.

667
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:08,730
Okay.

668
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,210
You know how to pound garlic, right?

669
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,830
Yes.

670
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,700
Did you and Teacher Son have a fight?

671
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,600
We're not that close.

672
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,100
We aren't dating.

673
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,490
Did you break up already?

674
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,950
No.

675
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,800
We were never together.

676
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:47,600
I lied to you so you don't push Kang Hu Yeong away.

677
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,140
Hey, don't make a face like that.

678
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:56,220
That's the extent of my feelings for Kang Hu Yeong.

679
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:00,500
I like you way more than I like him.

680
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,510
Me, too.

681
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:07,750
So? What happened today?

682
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,300
- I got turned down. 
 - What?

683
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,300
Who got turned down by whom?

684
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,170
 Dad was suggesting you go 

685
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,940
 on a blind date, not a hike, right? 

686
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,660
 I'm sorry. 

687
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,590
 - Did you say you'd like to meet Unnie? 
 - Pardon? 

688
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:37,280
 No, never! 

689
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:43,360
 I should have made it clearer to the Vice Principal that I didn't want to. 

690
00:54:53,200 --> 00:55:00,100
 I'll explain myself to your sister and Vice Principal again. 

691
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:06,110
 I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable. 

692
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,460
 Teacher Son... 

693
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:31,940
 Do you want to try dating me? 

694
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:37,320
♫  You, I like you  ♫

695
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,850
 You're so shocked. 

696
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:42,150
♫  Is this love?  ♫

697
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:44,300
 I-I'm sorry. 

698
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,840
 Your joke went too far.  
 ♫  Should I tell him I like him?  ♫

699
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,530
 I wasn't joking. 

700
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:56,270
♫  Let me take a step closer to you  ♫

701
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:00,140
 I know you're interested in me, too. 

702
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,830
♫  Everything is good  ♫

703
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:07,360
 I've never felt that way, not even once. 

704
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,600
 Not even once. 

705
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,570
 Really? 

706
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,380
 Stop, stop. 

707
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,470
I'm struggling to understand.

708
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,720
Why do you like Teacher Son suddenly?

709
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,930
Well, the thing is...

710
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:41,590
You said you would never stop obsessing over looks. What happened?

711
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:47,900
Teacher Son is a big guy, you know.

712
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,100
Yes, I know he's a generous man, but—

713
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,380
No. He's literally a big guy.

714
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,400
He's very firm.

715
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,500
I feel very secure when I see him.

716
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,540
Was that enough to win you over?

717
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,070
Yes.

718
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,920
I like him.

719
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,040
I think I like him.

720
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:13,220
I'd find out why I want to date him if I keep seeing him, right?

721
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,880
Do you want to start a relationship that easily?

722
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,790
Why should it be so complicated?

723
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:24,310
A relationship is between two people, after all.

724
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,390
Anyway, why did I get rejected?

725
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,860
I was so sure he was interested.

726
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,900
What?

727
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,200
Gosh, you always know when it's time to eat.

728
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,330
Yes. Gosh, how nice.

729
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,250
Thank you for inviting me.

730
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,920
Don't mention it. Take a glass.

731
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,200
- Are you a good drinker? 
 - No, I'm not.

732
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,040
 Aren't you scared? 

733
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,240
 The memories of your love and relationships, 

734
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,190
 you might lose it all, including him. 

735
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,430
 I'm scared. But... 

736
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:01,900
But still, it isn't impossible, is it?

737
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:06,330
 Despite all that. 

738
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:11,890
♫  You're the only one who can reach me  ♫

739
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:16,970
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

740
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:20,480
♫  Or are you playing ignorant?  ♫

741
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,640
♫  It's you  ♫

742
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,000
That's my spot.

743
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,420
- Sit somewhere else. 
 - You're so selfish.

744
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:31,380
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

745
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,340
♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

746
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,310
♫  It has to be you  ♫

747
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:40,660
♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

748
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,120
You must be hungry from fishing all day.

749
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,690
Let's start eating, since everyone is here.

750
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,040
Hold on.

751
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:53,680
We need to take a group photo. 
 ♫  But since I got to know you  ♫

752
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,830
All right.

753
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,210
You won't be in the frame like that.

754
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:00,320
Okay. 
 ♫  I am like a star in a drama  ♫

755
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,510
Okay, a little more...

756
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,060
 Despite all that... 

757
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,770
I'll take it now. One, two, three.

758
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:10,910
One, two, three.

759
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:15,510
- One more time. 
  - I'd like our relationship to change. 

760
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,510
- It turned out well. 
 - I can eat now, right?

761
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,390
- Eat. 
 - Why am I with you guys on a nice day like this?

762
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,940
Come on. We're entertaining you because you broke up with your girlfriend.

763
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,270
Don't bother. He will start dating soon.

764
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,290
He's addicted to dating.

765
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:32,350
We could have had octopus soup if we caught it earlier, right?

766
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:35,700
That's not all we didn't get to eat.

767
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,390
- Thank you for the food. 
 - Cheers!

768
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,960
- Cheers! 
 - Okay,

769
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,540
to each of our love lives!

770
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,710
For love!

771
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,250
 You can't eat anything with him. 

772
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:54,560
 You're right. By the way, is there a fun group game? 

773
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,570
 I wonder. 

774
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,870
 Never mind! 

775
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:02,880
 We agreed not to play the crane game. 

776
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,900
 How about we all play hide and seek? 

777
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,760
 I'll be back. Watch things at home. 

778
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,910
 Can I come with you? 

779
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,860
 You can't. 

780
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:30,950
 Mom. Mom, take me with you. 

781
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,770
 Mom... 

782
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:37,170
 Mom! 

783
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,700
 Mom, Mom... 

784
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,980
 Aunt! 

785
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,860
 Aunt! 

786
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:55,440
 When can I see my cousin? 

787
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,570
 Later, much later. 

788
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:06,430
 Aunt, wait for me. 

789
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,570
 Aunt! 

790
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:35,060
 Oppa. Oppa Jun Ho, please talk to me. 

791
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,140
 Oppa. 

792
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,760
 You son of a gun! 

793
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,170
 You'd better not show up in my dream again. 

794
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:05,040
 You're banned from showing up as of today. 

795
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,130
 Okay, cut! 

796
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,240
 Why are you in my dream again? 

797
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,280
 I'm happy 

798
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,790
 that your relationship failed. 

799
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,520
 Shut up. 

800
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,580
 Are you going somewhere? 

801
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,150
 I should go back. 

802
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:37,600
 I know you won't stop me. 

803
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,440
 You really want me to leave? 

804
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,250
Why do you ask if you will leave anyway?

805
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,410
Hye Ji, wake up. We're making breakfast.

806
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:25,380
Hye Ji! Kim Hye Ji!

807
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,410
Is she gone?

808
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,660
Hey, Kwon Sang Pil. Are you guys up?

809
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:52,470
You don't drink, but you stayed up late with us.

810
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:56,030
You didn't have any fun, did you?

811
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:58,080
I had fun, thanks to you all.

812
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,160
I like your friends.

813
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,290
I had a good time.

814
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:04,480
That's a relief.

815
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,450
I had fun, too.

816
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:11,570
Let's hang out often from now on.

817
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:19,820
My head keeps ringing.

818
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,300
Is your head ringing?

819
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,310
You became a lightweight (drinker).

820
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:25,370
You're not your old self anymore.

821
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:29,340
I don't think I deserve to hear that from you.

822
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,100
Do you want some? No?

823
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,780
My head hurts too much.

824
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:39,350
It's ringing. Ahjussi.

825
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:40,930
Yes.

826
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,050
- Is it mine? 
 - Yes.

827
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:46,560
Hello, this is Baek Wook.

828
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,720
What? What did you say?

829
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,680
You can't suddenly get up.

830
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,310
I've never heard that.

831
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,110
Noona.

832
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:00,910
Baek Do Seon.

833
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,440
What? Is something wrong?

834
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,700
- S-Step on it. 
 - Pardon?

835
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,300
- Let's go back quickly. 
 - Okay, got it.

836
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,510
Where did everyone go?

837
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,800
They won't answer my call, either.

838
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:33,620
You're here?

839
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:38,570
Where did you go? Why didn't you answer my call?

840
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:40,750
Sorry, I left my phone.

841
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,340
Where's everyone?

842
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,720
They went to Seoul.

843
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,460
Let's go in. I got us coffee and scones.

844
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,340
They went to Seoul?

845
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,720
They need to work.

846
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,380
How about us?

847
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,520
We have time.

848
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,560
You said you have the day off.

849
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,640
You'll hit your head.

850
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:05,400
Let's have breakfast after checking out.

851
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,060
There's a famous grilled fish restaurant nearby.

852
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,920
 You really want me to leave? 

853
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:28,300
Don't go.

854
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:39,030
I don't want you to go to the U.S.

855
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:50,790
I'm not going.

856
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,760
You can't change your mind, okay?

857
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:38,320
♫  I wonder why I'm being influenced by you  ♫

858
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,640
♫  It surprises me  ♫

859
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,410
   

860
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,700
   

861
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,820
♫  It's so strange  ♫

862
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,690
♫  I wonder if you're like me, too  ♫

863
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,800
   

864
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:05,450
♫  Could you stop your heart from racing and shaking?  ♫

865
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:09,870
 Oppa. Oppa Jun Ho, please talk to me. 

866
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:13,020
 Oppa. 

867
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:16,370
 I'll write a great novel and come back. 

868
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:19,850
 Please... 

869
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:22,680
 wait for me a little, Hong Ju. 

870
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:28,610
♫  Will you respond to my feelings?  ♫

871
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:38,290
♫  Someday, when you find out how I feel  ♫

872
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:45,330
♫  You need to tell me, too  ♫

873
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,520
♫  That you like me  ♫

874
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:54,820
 Does love change... 

875
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:59,370
 or do people change? 

876
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:05,580
♫  You look so beautiful in the sunlight  ♫

877
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,730
♫  I think of you every day  ♫

878
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,890
   

879
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:18,610
♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

880
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:23,400
♫  So I ask you  ♫

881
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:29,250
♫  Will you respond to my feelings?  ♫

882
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:33,500
♫  Someday when you find out how I feel  ♫

883
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,030
 I don't know when it began. 

884
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:38,750
 I noticed I was waiting for you to call my name. 

885
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,030
 What are you two doing? Finish what you were doing. 

886
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:42,940
 What do I do? 

887
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,390
 It's still the same. I recognized it immediately. 

888
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:50,330
 It was my decision. It has nothing to do with Hong Ju. 

889
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:54,660
 Hong Ju, I have been very ill. 

890
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,890
 It's none of your business. 

891
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:59,680
 I saw how much you cried because of that jerk. 

892
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:03,800
 How am I supposed to not be bothered by him? 

893
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:08,790
♫  No one  ♫
