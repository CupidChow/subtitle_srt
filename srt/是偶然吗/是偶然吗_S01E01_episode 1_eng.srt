♫  It's you  ♫

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,440
    
 ♫  The destiny I've been waiting for  ♫

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,510
♫  Why has it arrived only now?  ♫

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,230
    
 ♫  I see only you. I hear only you  ♫

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,470
    
 ♫  It has to be you  ♫

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:30,210
    
 ♫  No matter what, I don't want to lose you  ♫

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,020
   

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,100
   

9
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:53,010


10
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,530
 Wouldn't you rather stay at a hotel? 

11
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,660
This place would be a bit uncomfortable.

12
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,910
It's close to the office.

13
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,830
That's true.

14
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,870
But it's not a great environment to work in.

15
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,410
Okay, okay.

16
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,690
You're the ace from HQ (headquarters). I can let you have anything.

17
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,600
Fine, fine.

18
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,270
 Welcome to my secret hangout! 

19
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,770
Hu Yeong, can you handle the Roem case in ten days?

20
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,920
- Why? 
 - But ten days is too short.

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,960
It's your first time in Korea in ten years. Stay a bit longer.

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,510
- What for? 
 - What do you mean?

23
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,210
Meet your friends and see how much Seoul changed.

24
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,530
I have no friends,

25
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,680
and I'm not interested either.

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,420
I fixed it up a bit since it was old.

27
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,360
Isn't it amazing?

28
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,850
This is my parents' house.

29
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,930
It's just under your mom's name.

30
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,630
You won't live in Korea anyway, right?

31
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,260
You must be hungry.

32
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,180
Do you want me to take you to an amazing place?

33
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,980
I have plans.

34
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,980
"Plans"? You just said you had no friends.

35
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,530
It's not a friend, but is it a woman?

36
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,720
It is a woman, isn't it?

37
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,000
I am wearing bright colors.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,820
Of course, I have makeup on.

39
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,910
I put on lotion, base makeup, and lip balm.

40
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,130
I did my eyebrows too.

41
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,020
 Real makeup starts from there. 

42
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,090
 Wear colors: red, pink, or peach. 

43
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,720
 Colors. Colors! 

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,050
Yes, yes. I'll color myself now.

45
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,710
You're here for a blind date, right?

46
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,540
Hello.

47
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,250
I'm Hye Ji's friend, Lee Hong Ju.

48
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,720
"Lee Hong Ju"?

49
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,670
Is it really you?

50
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,540
Pardon?

51
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,600
Mr. Kang Hu Yeong?

52
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,210
I mistook you for someone.

53
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,840
Have a pleasant time then.

54
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,870
Hello.

55
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,390
Yes, hello.

56
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,730
Are you Ms. Lee Hong Ju?

57
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,530
Hello, I'm Joseph's cousin, Mi So. Oh Mi So.

58
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,610
I'm Kang Hu Yeong.

59
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,970
I know.

60
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,410
- Did you eat? 
 - Oppa, don't you recognize me?

61
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,620
We went to the same university, Yale.

62
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,480
We said hello at Oppa Joseph's wedding,

63
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,760
and we ate at the same table.

64
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,780
I had a red dress on with brown curls.

65
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,780
Well, it's all in the past.

66
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,350
We can get to know each other now.

67
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,950
I'll have the caramel macchiato.

68
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,650
What would you like?

69
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,110
Do you know her?

70
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,010
She's a friend from high school.

71
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,420
Did you use to date then?

72
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,440
Is she your ex?

73
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,040
You recognized her immediately.

74
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,110
She hasn't changed at all.

75
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,790
I suppose you've changed a lot then.

76
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,640
She didn't recognize you.

77
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,040
Go ahead and order.

78
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,550
Pardon?

79
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,660
Did she really not recognize me?

80
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,130
What should we eat?

81
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,070
I made a reservation at a pasta restaurant nearby.

82
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,190
Teacher Kim recommended it, saying you'd like it.

83
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Actually, I know a pork belly restaurant that has great quality pork.

84
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,300
Not many people know that spot,

85
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,780
but I'll make an exception and share it with you.

86
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,090
Well, you see...

87
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,220
She said you'd suggest going to a pork belly restaurant.

88
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,690
Teacher Kim told me to make sure not to listen to you.

89
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,010
Hye Ji's a regular there, too.

90
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,980
She also said she's not a regular there.

91
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,680
Today's a perfect day to eat pasta.

92
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,860
- Yes, I'm on my way there now. 
 - Okay.

93
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,540
Oppa, should we just skip dinner?

94
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,100
There's a nice bar near my place.

95
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,780
Would you like to have a drink with me?

96
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,350
- I brought my car. 
  - I'll drive you home. 

97
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,780
It's okay. I need to stop by somewhere near.

98
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,430
But still...

99
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,810
- How about you? 
 - I didn't bring my car.

100
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,230
Well then...

101
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,260
Get home safely then.

102
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,940
What?

103
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,100
I don't know my way around Seoul.

104
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,490
I had fun today.

105
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,830
It was nice to meet you.

106
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,010
Yes.

107
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,100

108

 ♫  Fall in love with you  ♫

117
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,010
It's early in the morning.

118
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,420
 That's because of you. 

119
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,890
I woke up because of you.

120
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,280
Why did you dump her?

121
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,670
Don't put it that way. It's all taken care of.

122
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,110
Hu Yeong, I wasn't asking you a favor as a client.

123
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,680
 I set that up as a friend. 

124
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,140
Then I should have said no.

125
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,170
Mi So is pretty, has a nice body,

126
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,560
 and comes from a good family too. 

127
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,910
And she even works in the States now so... so why not?

128
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:41,110
I'll add a provision about the privacy assurance of the asset manager in our next contract.

129
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,910
- Are you coming back for the company party? 
 - Yes.

130
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,820
 How did you get permission for the family office from my dad? 

131
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,210
You know, he never leaves (trusts) his money to someone else.

132
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,990
Anyway, you're good.

133
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,720
It's not decided yet.

134
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,140
 It is. 

135
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,110
And since you're totally involved now,

136
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,250
just make sure you see before coming all the people you've missed

137
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,030
 so you don't leave things behind in Korea, all right? 

138
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,750
 I'm Hye Ji's friend, Lee Hong Ju. 

139
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,170
I came here to work.

140
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,000
 You're no fun at all. 

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,700
Life is not supposed to be fun.

142
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,630
Go back to sleep.

143
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:03,340
 The buses that are arriving are 761, 6716, 2736... 

144
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,350
Lee Hong Ju?

145

♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

153

00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,090
Sir, I'll have two servings of soondae (blood sausage) to go.

164
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,780
- Half soondae and half organs. 
 - Half and half? Okay.

165
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,820
Welcome!

166
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,140
What would the handsome customer like?

167
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,370
I'll have what she's having.

168
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,830
She's having one tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), tempura,

169
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,080
and how many fishcakes? One, two, three, it's three.

170
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,430
Would you like the same?

171
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,720
I'll have one serving of tteokbokki.

172
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,330
Okay.

173
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,010
Here.

174
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,820
Give me some fishcake broth too.

175
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,940
A napkin too.

176
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,410
- Lee Hong Ju. 
 - What?

177
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,430
Don't you know me?

178
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,260
I do. You're Kang Hu Yeong.

179
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,900
Then why won't you acknowledge me?

180
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,210
Do I have to?

181
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,750
We haven't seen each other in ten years.

182
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,630
Oh, has it been that long already?

183
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,090
By the way, were you in Korea?

184
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,300
I thought you moved to the U.S.

185
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,990
I did.

186
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,320
I stopped by briefly for work.

187
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,720
You stopped by briefly and went on a blind date?

188
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,800
Did you recognize me at the cafe too?

189
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,490
Of course. You haven't changed at all since high school.

190
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,860
You haven't changed, either.

191
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,080
Hey, that's an insult, isn't it?

192
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,760
I'm not sure.

193
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,280
Do you stay in touch with your friends?

194
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,550
No.

195
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,030
You're the first one I saw.

196
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,900
Really?

197
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,380
Aren't you curious about our classmates?

198
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm curious now.

199
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,350
Then... give me your phone number.

200
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,500
I don't have a number in Korea. I have my U.S. number.

201
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,820
Give me that, at least.

202
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,340
I kept in touch with only a few,

203
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,140
but Hye Ji kept in touch with many.

204
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,910
They'd be so happy to see you.

205
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,010
How about you?

206
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,140
Aren't you happy to see me?

207
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,470
I'm so sorry. L-Look at your jacket.

208
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,780
I'm so sorry.

209
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:24,080
Well, I chuckled because you said something so silly.

210
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,770
Sir.

211
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,520
Give him the change.

212
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,490
I'm so sorry.

213
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,300
Use the change to get it dry-cleaned.

214
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,380
My bus is here. Bye.

215
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,820
Sir?

216
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,610
- Yes. 
 - Here's the change.

217
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,380
 Here's the change. 
   

218
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,150
 What idiot parked at the bus stop? 

219
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,110
 It's getting towed. Seriously. 

220
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,030
   

221
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,150
She won't even text after leaving like that?

222
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,560
I'm not happy to see you at all, either.

223
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,830
Who remembers what happened ten years ago?

224
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,390
 This stop is Ohbok High School. 

225
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,610
   

226
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,310
Student,

227
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,730
wake up your friend and get off with her.

228
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,670
There's a female student in the back.

229
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,620
- I don't know her. 
 - That's okay.

230
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,700
Just wake her up.

231
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,590
Hey, who are you?

232
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,540
He wants you to get off.

233
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,960
Thank you, Sir.

234
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,880
Aren't you getting off?

235
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,240
   

236
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:14,530
Five, four, three, two, one.

237
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,930
That's it! You're tardy.

238
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,800
Are you late again?

239
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,130
You were also late yesterday, right?

240
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,720
You're late. Kneel down.

241
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,640
Raise your arms.

242
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,370
Raise them high!

243
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,760
What's a student's duty?

244
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,800
What the heck?

245
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,580
Come to school on time.

246
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,140
Let's stay together until the end, Comrade.

247
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,640
Let go of me.

248
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,840
So you become good adults.

249
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,120
You're late all the time.

250
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,980
Lee Hong Ju, stop.

251
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,340
- You. 
 - Yes?

252
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,380
You're late again.

253
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,280
I'm late because I was helping him walk.

254
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,830
I just met her.

255
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,270
What are you saying?

256
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,940
We're good friends.

257
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,840
You woke me up this morning too.

258
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,830
Sir, my arm is about to break.

259
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,620
Lee Hong Ju, let go of that arm.

260
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,440
Sir, we really are friends.

261
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,250
Do you know my name?

262
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,970
Your name?

263
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,010
Gosh, you're so disloyal.

264
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,740
You don't even know my name.

265
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,190
Should I be loyal to you?

266
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,200
Hey, you can go.

267
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,930
What? Why? He's late, too.

268
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,260
Can't you see his leg?

269
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,210
Go now.

270
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,220
Thank you.

271
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,390
Give me the bag.

272
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,000
Sir.

273
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,460
Sir!

274
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,670
Look at this. Look at this. 
    

275
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,650
What's this?

276
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,380
Where are your textbooks?

277
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,050
These are my textbooks.

278
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,150
Everything I need to learn is here.

279
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,550
You don't even know.

280
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,420
It hurts! Why would you hit my head? You'll make me stupid.

281
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,640
How can you get any more stupid?

282
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,290
Go inside and study.

283
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,470
That...

284
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,810
   

285
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,860
When it always satisfies...

286
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,940
Sum of f(x) from zero to one,

287
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,640
with respect to x. Find its...

288
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,330
value.

289
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,590
 Let's stay together until the end, Comrade. 
   

290
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,790
Underline the f(x)dx part.

291
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,120
Let's try solving this. 
    

292
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,640
We do this all the time.

293
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,410
How childish.

294
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,390
The one who solves this question will save the world!

295
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,840
   

296
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,870
What's on your desks? Why are you all looking down? 
    

297
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,350
Aigoo. 
    

298
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,340
Kang Hu Yeong!

299
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,390
Come and solve this. 
    

300
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,470
Stop.

301
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,940
Twenty-two.

302
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,550
Applause!

303
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,500
That's correct.

304
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,580
You saw how the top of the class solved the question, right?

305
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,920
Look at him.

306
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,450
He's handsome, but he's also smart.

307
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,970
He's smart, but he's also handsome.

308
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,810
Do you not feel motivated at all?

309
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,070
 Once you go out into the world, 

310
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:31,380
 you'll be so grateful for things with clear answers, like math. 

311
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,150
 Life? 

312
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,910
Yes, life gives you many options.

313
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,920
 However... 

314
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,050
the right answer might not be among the options.

315
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,960
 Dreams? 

316
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,390
 There's no answer to that at all. 

317
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,140
How about love?

318
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,540
Love?

319
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,180
 You might not even get a chance to solve that problem. 

320
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,230
Sir, you're cursing us.

321
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,380
Oh, it's Kang Hu Yeong!

322
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,460
♫  It's so strange  ♫

323
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,880
♫  I wonder if you're like me, too  ♫

324
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:31,090
♫  Could you stop your heart from racing and shaking?  ♫

325
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:40,820
♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

326
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,700
♫  So I ask you  ♫

327
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:51,610
♫  Will you respond to my feelings?  ♫

328
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:01,380
♫  Someday when you find out how I feel  ♫

329
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:08,470
♫  You need to tell me, too  ♫

330
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,730
   

331
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,200
Hey, your neighbors might call the police.

332
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,310
 Was it really Kang Hu Yeong? 

333
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,700
 Ohbok High's golden boy, Kang Hu Yeong? 

334
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,570
Yes, that Kang Hu Yeong.

335
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,370
 Daebak. 

336
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,330
When did you see him? Where did you see him?

337
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:28,880
 I saw him at a cafe earlier and on the street too. 

338
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,820
What was he like?

339
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,800
Is he the same?

340
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,140
Pretty much.

341
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,050
Are you that happy?

342
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,500
Of course, I am. It's Kang Hu Yeong.

343
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,250
I was so curious about him.

344
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,850
What does he do?

345
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,960
Is he doing well? Does he live in Korea?

346
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,940
Is he... married?

347
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,580
I don't know. We didn't talk much. You ask him.

348
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,200
How could I ask him? He's my first love.

349
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,340
I know.

350
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,060
 He was your first love. 
   

351
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:20,630
   

352
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,810
Stop getting caught by my dad.

353
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,840
He said he's skeptical about being a teacher due to you.

354
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,790
I'm also questioning being a student these days.

355
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,610
What?

356
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,530
I'm having an early life crisis.

357
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,430
You don't hang out with me because you're studying.

358
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,340
It's not fun coming to school.

359
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,970
I just get sleepy.

360
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,340
What's the point of being a student?

361
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,270
Is studying not an option?

362
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,830
Lee Ddoong, I need to tell you something.

363
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,380
Yes, go ahead.

364
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,480
You know...

365
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,320
I can't focus on studying these days.

366
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,590
I have no appetite either.

367
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,500
A female high schooler with no appetite?

368
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,230
This must mean...

369
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,360
We go to the same academy.

370
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,730
Hye Ji, you're finally starting a real-life romance.

371
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,550
Who is it? Who?

372
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,510
It's Kang Hu Yeong.

373
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,250
"Kang Hu Yeong"?

374
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,420
Who is Kang Hu Yeong? I've never heard of him.

375
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,750
- He's the top student in our school. 
 - Gosh!

376
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,290
"Top student"?

377
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,230
You changed to our school's top student after Brad Pitt?

378
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,160
Isn't your taste too random?

379
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,820
What? What? Who is it?

380
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,950
Hey, you're making it too obvious.

381
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,020
Look stealthily.

382
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,280
He's the one with the leg cast.

383
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,740
That meanie this morning had a cast, too.

384
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,020
If I see him again, I'll break the other leg.

385
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,040
Hey, is that Kang Hu Yeong?

386
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,510
Kim Hye Ji, that jerk is—

387
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,020
Isn't he so handsome?

388
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,090
It's him! The one who got my help and ran away.

389
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,420
He even laughed at me when I got scolded.

390
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,710
I can confess my love, right?

391
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,440
Of course, you can.

392
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,510
Let's do it.

393
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,810
I can feel it. I can feel it.

394
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,750
What do you feel?

395
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,400
You both will definitely start dating.

396
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,820
Oh, it's Kang Hu Yeong!

397
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,590
Kim Hye Ji, hurry. It's Kang Hu Yeong.

398
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:27,240
   

399
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,750
♫  I wanted to live splendidly  ♫

400
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,210
♫  I thought I'd find happiness in there  ♫

401
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,190
♫  I'll teach you to fly high in the sky so you can fulfill your dreams  ♫

402
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,940
I can't do it, Ddoong.

403
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,220
Why? Are you nervous?

404
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,860
I can't go.

405
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,920
I can't do it.

406
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,780
Lee Ddoong, could you deliver this for me instead?

407
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,090
What are you talking about? You should give it to him directly.

408
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,430
I can't do it. I can't.

409
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,300
♫  So I can go straight into your heart  ♫

410
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,280
Just deliver it for me.

411
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,620
Just this once.

412
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,130
No. You need to be the one to confess your love.

413
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,760
I'll give you Bang Jun Ho's military unit address.

414
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,450
♫  Your crystal-clear smile, Baby  ♫

415
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,690
Deal? 
 ♫  Show me your smile  ♫

416
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,360
Unnie will go!

417
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,990
For both of our loves.

418
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,540
- You can do it! 
 - I can do it!

419
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,940
Fighting! Go for it!

420
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,610
You'll write back, right?

421
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,000
♫  Even if it's not such a splendid world  ♫

422
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,160
It's from my friend, Kim Hye Ji.

423
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,250
Hye Ji says she likes you.

424
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,680
♫  I'll teach you to fly high in the sky  ♫

425
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,070
♫  So you can fulfill your dreams  ♫

426
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,570
♫  True happiness always lies in your own heart  ♫

427
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:53,490
You're keeping my book safe, right?

428
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,580
When did you put that in my bag?

429
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,200
- Who's that? Well? 
 - Hey, hey.

430
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,870
Who's that female student on the boys' floor?

431
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,550
Return my book when you write back.

432
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,970
- It's an important book. Make sure to return it. 
 - What are you all looking at?

433
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,960
Go back inside. Hurry!

434
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,100
Yes!

435
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,460
   

436
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,570
How childish.

437
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,970
First love is liking a random guy when you're a clueless, snotty child. Everyone has one.

438
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,750
I'll hold you to that comment.

439
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,940
Don't forget. You owe me fried chicken and beer ten times.

440
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,730
- Don't you think Mr. Son was nice? 
 - Yes.

441
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,400
He's nice.

442
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,410
I haven't met someone like that in a while.

443
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,220
He's like...

444
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,370
- maybe a rock? 
 - Right?

445
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:51,660
You get a feeling he'd protect you and stay by your side, right?

446
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,120
The first date determines a relationship between a man and a woman.

447
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,300
First impressions are everything.

448
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,080
I meant he'd never roll over to my side.

449
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:07,500
Hey, don't judge a person after seeing him just once.

450
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,820
 You need to see him at least three times. 

451
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,370
Hey, you said you wouldn't bother me if I went on a blind date.

452
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,230
What's the reason for a blind date, Ddoong?

453
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,720
 You need to date someone. 

454
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,260
 You're having a big appetite because you're repressed from not dating. 

455
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,470
Buddy, as for me...

456
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:28,420
I think the dating culture and love is forced on modern people.

457
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,880
It's a waste of time, money, and energy.

458
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,500
There are so many other things we need to do in this world.

459
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,580
The icebergs are melting right now.

460
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,740
The Earth, that we need to leave to the next generation, is in decline.

461
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,780
You once said love is the only way for humans to survive.

462
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,650
Where did that friend go?

463
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,700
What happened to my friend who needs her first love's phone number?

464
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,210
Save the Earth. Save energy.

465
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,370
 I root for your first love, Teacher Kim. Fighting! 

466
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,260
Tteokbokki, tempura, and fishcake, I ordered those three.

467
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,190
It's 10,500 won ($8). Is that right?

468
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,490
I paid for dry cleaning so he won't complain, right?

469
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,660
Oh, whatever.

470
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,320
I don't feel like taking a shower.

471
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,810
Gosh, what a hassle.

472
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,140
   

473
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,820
   

474
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:03,690
   

475
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,920
 Yes, I'll see you later. 

476
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,370
 Yes. 

477
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,570
 Okay. 

478
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:13,020
Yes, he's here. I'll talk to you later. Bye.

479
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,310
Good morning.

480
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,540
Sit, sit, sit. Since when did you do this?

481
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,320
Sit, sit.

482
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,380
What's with your faces?

483
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,300
You all look shocked. Why?

484
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:31,870
Is it because Mr. Kang and I look so much alike?

485
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,290
Handsome people tend to look similar.

486
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,850
All right. As for Mr. Kang Hu Yeong,

487
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:44,980
he could have easily become a math professor at Ivy League (prestige) schools a hundred times.

488
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,230
CEO Baek.

489
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,120
He's business savvy.

490
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,710
He also set the direction for Rock Asset,

491
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,780
a successful private asset management family office,

492
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,360
ahead of others, for Koreans in the USA.

493
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,150
Applause.

494
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,290
The Roem case is giving everyone a headache.

495
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,680
Let's work on it with our ace right here.

496
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,240
Mr. Kang, say something.

497
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,420
- Mr. Kang. 
 - Five hundred.

498
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,300
"Five hundred"?

499
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,630
Minus 2,983,740,000 won ($2,155,000).

500
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,420
That's the total number on page four.

501
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,300
There's an equation error in two categories.

502
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,930
The profits from the building sales in Singapore were in euros.

503
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:44,400
The back door investment in Hong Kong was—

504
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,300
Wow, isn't that amazing?

505
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,650
He's the ace for a reason.

506
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,910
This is how focused he is. Everyone—

507
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:56,510
Give me all files on Roem.

508
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,630
The HQ will manage that case from now on.

509
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,670
Wait, Hu Yeong.

510
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,670
Why would the HQ...

511
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,210
I-It's okay. Hold on. Wait a moment.

512
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,550
Set, set, set. Rock Asset.

513
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,090
 Hey, hey. 

514
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,850
 Hey, what do you mean the HQ will manage it? 

515
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,240
It was decided before I came here.

516
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,470
Without even discussing it with me?

517
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,530
But still, I'm the CEO of the Korean branch.

518
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,340
So what if Baek Do Seon is the founder?

519
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,900
This still isn't right—

520
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,650
Kang Hu Yeong, this was your idea. That's it.

521
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:53,150
I should have known when you said you were suddenly coming to Korea. You little—

522
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,580
This is the best for the Korean branch and you, Uncle.

523
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,100
Why are you starting to act like Baek Do Seon?

524
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,510
I'm nowhere near Mom yet.

525
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,170
Hey, you'd better stay longer.

526
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,150
You can take care of this with me while you're here.

527
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,210
If the HQ takes our major client,

528
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,130
what about my employees' morale?

529
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,830
Didn't you hear me saying, "Set, set, set"?

530
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,600
That's your concern, CEO.

531
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,540
Whose call are you waiting for in this situation?

532
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,570
Is it the woman you met yesterday?

533
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,940
- No. 
 - What do you mean, no?

534
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,800
I'm really disappointed in you.

535
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,280
I really am. So be honest with me.

536
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,510
- Uncle. 
 - Hold on.

537
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,960
- Yes. 
  - CEO, 

538
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,000
 you need to leave for the meeting with CEO Shin Hye Mi at 2 p.m. 

539
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,070
Okay.

540
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,670
Let's talk again later.

541
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,580
You took my car, right? Give me the key.

542
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,970
It got towed.

543
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,860
I'll pick it up after work.

544
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,750
The car suddenly got towed?

545
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:09,780
I got it less than a month ago. Why did it get towed?

546
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,490
I stopped on the street briefly and...

547
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:16,730
So why did you stop on the street?

548
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,170
I ran into a...

549
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,010
high school classmate by coincidence.

550
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,150
Oh, okay.

551
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,300
So... what you're saying is

552
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:37,760
you were driving, and you stopped because you ran into a classmate.

553
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,460
It was nice to see her.

554
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,440
She is still pretty.

555
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,070
"Pretty"? She hasn't changed.

556
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,320
So she isn't just a classmate.

557
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,970
Your ex. First love?

558
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,630
Hey, really? You ran into your first love?

559
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,860
So while you were driving...

560
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,880
you happened to look at a passerby...

561
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,890
and that was your—

562
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,540
 - I'll get the car now. 
 - Hey! 

563
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,170
Did he really make a face like that?

564
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,480
- Hello? 
  - Hi, Kang Hu Yeong. 

565
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,890
 This is Hye Ji. 

566
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,730
I gave you a letter when we were in Grade 12.

567
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,370
We went to the same academy, too.

568
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:29,130
 Try to remember. 

569
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,760
- Kim Hye Ji? 
  - Yes. 

570
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,750
I knew you'd remember me.

571
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,570
 It's been a while. 

572
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,630
Yes, it's been a while.

573
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,470
Are you married? You aren't, right?

574
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,790
Hey, are you starting with that?

575
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,570
It's important.

576
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,840
 No, I'm not. 

577
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:52,250
Really? When did you come to Korea then?

578
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,590
- Yesterday. 
 -  Yesterday? 

579
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:59,570
Did you run into Hong Ju by chance as soon as you came?

580
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,940
I got your number from her.

581
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,590
- Really? 
  - Yes. 

582
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,750
Welcome to Korea.

583
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,140
I mean it.

584
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,900
Welcome? Yes, a welcome party.

585
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,670
Let's have a welcome party. We should meet.

586
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,250
You just came up with that?

587
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,820
Sure, let's meet.

588
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,510
Hey, he wants to meet. He wants to meet!

589
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,940
Hey, he can hear everything.

590
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,030
Is Lee Hong Ju also there?

591
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,940
How's this week?

592
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,090
Sang Pil, Hong Ju, and I are hanging out.

593
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,250
You know Kwon Sang Pil, right?

594
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,270
"Sang Pil"? I do.

595
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,000
He's very curious about you, too.

596
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,600
I'll text you when and where we're meeting.

597
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,820
Any dates we should avoid?

598
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,670
- Any day is fine. 
 - I see.

599
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,350
I'll let you know, Kang Hu Yeong.

600
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,160
   

601
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,890
Lee Hong Ju.

602
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,790
Hooray.

603
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,260
I didn't get to hear her voice.

604
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,180
I'll say something when I see her.

605
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,870
♫  I will give you all my stars  ♫

606
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,970
♫  Our memories will never be apart  ♫

607
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,660
   

608
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,030
 How pretty was your first love that 

609
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:33,550
you didn't even notice the brand-new car getting towed?

610
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,310
Is she Suzy turned into Han Ga In? (from movie "Architecture 101")

611
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,070
Hey, be honest with me.

612
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,430
Why haven't you called her once all these years,

613
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:41,980
when you're obviously so happy?

614
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,840
I'm just meeting my classmates.

615
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,540
I know. Your first love is one of them.

616
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:52,370
I need to get something from her.

617
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,080
What do you need to get? What is it?

618
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,830
Love?

619
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:05,660
♫  I know if I stay, I'll be with you again  ♫

620
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,180
♫  Say that you'll come and take my hand  ♫

621
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,220
Here's the lettuce.

622
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,340
- Thank you. 
 - Of course.

623
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,350
   

624
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,080
Welcome—

625
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,660
Hi, my friend.

626
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,080
You came.

627
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,300
Where's Hu Yeong?

628
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,150
That's why you suddenly became punctual.

629
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,890
My heel got scraped since I wore new heels.

630
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,080
Why would a teacher wear shoes like that?

631
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,370
Why? Can't teachers wear high heels?

632
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,830
- Put this in there. 
 - Okay.

633
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,390
- Hey Kwon Sang Pil. 
 - Yes?

634
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,530
You know this meeting is for Hu Yeong and me to connect, right?

635
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,290
- What? 
 - Be careful with your words.

636
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,700
Why do I have to be careful?

637
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,490
By the way, for him to recognize you,

638
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,410
shouldn't you go back to yourself from back then?

639
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,460
That's exactly what I meant.

640
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,040
Does plastic surgery change your personality too?

641
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,990
- Hey! 
 - Whoa, okay, okay.

642
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,340
I got it. I won't.

643
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,900
Long time, no see, Kwon Sang Pil.

644
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,380
Hey, have you been well?

645
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,370
How could you ignore me for ten years?

646
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,220
Are you okay? Gosh, your shoulders got broader.

647
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,630
Sang Pil, won't you let me say hello?

648
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,700
Good to see you, Kang Hu Yeong.

649
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,680
Who?

650
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,330
I knew you wouldn't recognize her.

651
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,520
This is Kim Hye Ji from high school.

652
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,090
She totally changed her face—

653
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,450
I lost some baby fat.

654
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,520
By the way, you got even more handsome.

655
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,900
You look great, too.

656
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,650
Is Lee Hong Ju not here yet?

657
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,580
   

658
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,640
   

659
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,890
   

660
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,580
   

661
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:59,650
   

662
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,380
 Take the present in my office. 

663
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,000
Here's the food.

664
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,160
You probably haven't had this in the U.S.

665
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,520
It's Kwon Sang Pil's signature spicy chicken feet.

666
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,320
When did you start cooking?

667
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,720
Since I was in the military.

668
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,380
I discovered my hidden talent.

669
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,930
I had this restaurant for two years already.

670
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:39,020
I opened it using the marriage fund my mom gave me.

671
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,040
I devoted my whole life to this.

672
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,440
Did I tell you about me?

673
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,150
I became a teacher.

674
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:50,820
I'm an Ohbok High School English teacher.

675
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,470
Yes, you did, many times already.

676
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,430
- Aren't you sick of it? 
 - Sir.

677
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,060
Yes, coming.

678
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,760
You're a "Jaemu Seolgyesa."

679
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,250
It's called "financial planner" in English.

680
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:13,880
I'm so happy we turned out so well and got to meet again.

681
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,080
We need to raise our glasses on a day like this.

682
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,060
Cheers.

683
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,740
Cheers.

684
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,920
"Cheers," I said.

685
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,250
Drink this from now on.

686
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,580
What are you doing?

687
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,700
I get the feeling.

688
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,400
By the way, this is so crazy.

689
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,430
How did Lee Ddoong recognize you?

690
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:46,740
I don't think I'd recognize you if I saw you on the street.

691
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,300
You got even more handsome.

692
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:57,370
I suppose Hong Ju remembered you because of me.

693
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,550
Then what's taking her so long?

694
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,170
I'll try calling her.

695
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:05,130
Okay?

696
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,160
What's with her?

697
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,660
She should have watched how much she drank instead of watching that.

698
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,790
Director, congratulations on the premiere.

699
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:41,920
You came, Producer Lee.

700
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,670
Producer.

701
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,110
The CEO couldn't make it.

702
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,790
She asked me to give this to you in person.

703
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:51,950
She didn't need to do this. Thank you.

704
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,720
You didn't eat yet, right? Join us. Eat something.

705
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,020
No, I'm okay.

706
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,610
Come on, eat something before you go.

707
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,780
- Stay for a bit. 
 - Come sit. Come here.

708
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:04,420
- I'm all right. 
 - Come, come.

709
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,420
For our writer, Mr. Bang Jun Ho!

710
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,380
 Cheers! 

711
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,220
Thank you.

712
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,780
- Excuse me. 
 - Sure.

713
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:21,080
Mr. Bang, how many copies do you expect to sell this time?

714
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,030
Excuse me.

715
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,800
What?

716
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,500
What's wrong? Where are you going?

717
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,990
Is this a secret too?

718
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,280
I came to see you, Director. I'll go now.

719
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,160
Why do you keep trying to leave?

720
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,090
Talk to Mr. Bang briefly.

721
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:38,220
Aren't you two close? Say hello.

722
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,710
No, no, not at all.

723
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,570
- I'll get going now. 
 - Where do you think you're going?

724
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,550
Come here. Yes.

725
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,300
How have you been?

726
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,600
She said she'd come. I guess not.

727
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,130
How disappointing.

728
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:12,490
It's her job. She can't help it.

729
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,310
Kwon Sang Pil!

730
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,640
It's Kang Hu Yeong.

731
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,440
I run into you again.

732
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,030
How fascinating. We keep running into each other.

733
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,310
You show up in the east and the west.

734
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,350
Fascinating, so interesting.

735
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,770
Why are you so drunk?

736
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,400
Hye Ji? My friend, Kim Hye Ji.

737
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,890
Lee Ddoong is here.

738
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,580
- You came. 
 - You turned out so well.

739
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,590
Lee Ddoong. Lee Ddoong.

740
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,350
My friend, Lee Ddoong.

741
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,880
You turned out well, too.

742
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,300
She's not Lee Ddoong because she's fat.

743
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,640
It's because she's unpredictable.

744
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,080
My friend, Lee Ddoong. You turned out well.

745
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,690
What are you doing?

746
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,730
How embarrassing. Hu Yeong is here.

747
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,000
"Embarrassing"?

748
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,600
Are you embarrassed of me?

749
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,050
Why? What's wrong with me?

750
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,650
I'm Lee Hong Ju.

751
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,090
I hope you understand.

752
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:30,840
Hong Ju went through a lot. She lost her mind.

753
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,490
See? She keeps laughing.

754
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,120
- Kwon Sang Pil. 
 - Yes?

755
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,610
Beer. I need to drink beer tonight.

756
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:39,820
What's wrong with her?

757
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:44,530
You boosted someone else's sales. Why make a scene here?

758
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,140
I can get drunk tonight.

759
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,040
Do you know whom I met today?

760
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,540
My first love—

761
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,710
Just eat this.

762
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,800
Spicy! Spicy!

763
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,630
What do you think? Sang Pil's signature spicy chicken feet.

764
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,470
It's pleasantly spicy. What do you think?

765
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,420
- Spicy. 
 - It's tasty.

766
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,240
Of course, it is.

767
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,530
- Spicy! 
 - Hye Jin has good taste.

768
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,470
Peppery!

769
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,690
- Are you sleepy? 
 - Yes.

770
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,830
So sleepy, so drowsy.

771
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,650
Have you guys kept in touch since you graduated?

772
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:37,370
Yes, we have. It's just my luck.

773
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:40,440
I befriended these weak drinkers somehow.

774
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,650
Where are you staying?

775
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,360
Spicy.

776
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,610
Ohbok-dong.

777
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:51,360
That's great! Hey, you should take that loser with you.

778
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,050
- It's fiery hot! 
 - She still lives in Ohbok-dong.

779
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,680
She can go home just fine. Just watch her.

780
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,270
- How about you? 
 - I sh-should take care of this lovable idiot.

781
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,030
Wrap things up and go home.

782
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,140
Hey, Hu Yeong.

783
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,650
Don't leave without saying goodbye like last time.

784
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,600
Stay together until the end, Comrade.

785
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,360
Seriously, what's with you?

786
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,700
I'm Lee Hong Ju.

787
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:26,320
Don't you remember? I went to Ohbok High.

788
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,250
Yes, Lee Hong Ju.

789
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,050
I wanted to see you today because...

790
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:37,680
there's something we need to settle.

791
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,220
- Last week, you... 
 - Oh!

792
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,000
What now?

793
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,060
   

794
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:53,750
Hey, I'm late again because of you.

795
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:57,060
"Again"? I don't have any such memory.

796
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,710
Wow, look how shameless you are.

797
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:03,710
The day we first met on the bus.

798
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:08,580
 I helped you get off the bus, 

799
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,550
 and I helped you walk to the school entrance. 

800
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,400
 I also got scolded on your behalf since you were injured. 

801
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,730
Are you sure of that?

802
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,350
I think I am.

803
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,660
You aren't Kang Hu Yeong, are you?

804
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,480
What?

805
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,990
He doesn't laugh like this.

806
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:43,000
He's expressionless and disloyal.

807
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,900
He's also inhuman.

808
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,880
Kang Hu Yeong is like a smart preschooler.

809
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,320
You're a bit different from him.

810
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,530
Do you think I'm like that?

811
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,640
Didn't you know that?

812
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,530
How could you not? Even I know.

813
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:04,490
You actually know, don't you?

814
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:07,170
You already know everything, right?

815
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:19,910
I'm glad you're back.

816
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:22,560
Good to see you, Kang Hu Yeong.

817
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,140
Hooray, I won!

818
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:48,590
I'm the staring contest champion of Ohbok High!

819
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,230
Where did you drink so much?

820
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,830
I wonder.

821
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:58,290
Where did I drink?

822
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:00,850
Do you have alcohol-induced dementia?

823
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,520
Do you remember?

824
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,450
I put a book in your bag so Mr. Bok Nam couldn't confiscate it.

825
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,090
"My Avant-garde Love"?

826
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,860
Gosh, bingo.

827
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,570
You must really be Kang Hu Yeong.

828
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:23,290
There's a line that goes like this in that book.

829
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:29,950
"Your first love is special because it happens only once in life."

830
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:32,070
So what is first love?

831
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,720
It is frozen food.

832
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,450
You have to keep it frozen.

833
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:40,330
You can't keep it fresh like it was in the beginning.

834
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,790
But if you take it out and thaw it?

835
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:48,910
No, you can never. You can never thaw it.

836
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,720
What happens if you do?

837
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:00,500
Then... it ends up expiring.

838
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,870
You can never again remember it as it was.

839
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:08,760
So, Kang Hu Yeong,

840
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,910
you should never meet your first love.

841
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,050
Ramen is the best for hangovers.

842
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:39,600
Ramen is best with dumplings.

843
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,420
Keep the dumplings in the freezer.

844
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,760
Keep them frozen. You know, right?

845
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,550
- So they don't thaw? 
 - That's right.

846
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:48,600
Keep them frozen so they don't thaw.

847
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,370
Goodbye, Kang Hu Yeong. It was good to see you.

848
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:58,090
Yes, Lee Hong Ju. You, too—

849
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,550
Why are you following me?

850
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,540
Do you live here?

851
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:49,250
What do you think? You think I'm breaking into someone else's house?

852
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,890
Why do you keep smiling?

853
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,920
Because you're funny.

854
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,600
   

855
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,740
I'm sorry, 
    

856
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,180
but mine has already started to thaw.

857
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:25,530


858
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:28,290
   

859
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:31,790
♫  I'm being influenced by you  ♫

860
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:38,200
♫  It surprises me how I mimic the way you talk  ♫

861
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,360
♫  It's so strange  ♫

862
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,800
♫  I wonder if you're like me, too  ♫

863
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,380
 It was a question I'd never seen before. 

864
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:56,380
 Before I got to study in advance and review the questions from the past, 

865
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:01,390
 the bell rang to announce class started. 

866
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:11,230
♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

867
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,170
♫  So I ask you  ♫

868
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:21,810
♫  Will you respond to my feelings?  ♫

869
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:32,830
♫  Someday when you find out how I feel  ♫

870
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:35,280
 Lee Ddoong, can you entertain my relative tomorrow? 

871
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,610
 I'm the Unnie from upstairs. 

872
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:39,460
 Why did a grown man come out? 

873
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,560
 Is this really you? 

874
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,610
 Are you using me to hang out with your first love? 

875
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:46,790
 Follow your King. 

876
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,810
 Who's entertaining whom? 

877
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,530
 Hong Ju won't answer her phone. 

878
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:55,420
 It's because she's on a date with a guy. 

879
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,280
 I thought he was going to kiss me. 

880
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,380
 Your acting like this means you still like me. 

881
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,280
 I don't think I could go tomorrow. 

882
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,180
 I liked you, and I still do. 

883
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:12,220
♫  Because no one taught me  ♫
