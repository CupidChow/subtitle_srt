00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,660
I'll read them later. 
    

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,000
Y-You can leave now.

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,340
Oppa, what's wrong? Are you sick?

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,350
If I were sick...

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,560
If I left because I was ill...

13
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,410
would you take me back?

14
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:07,610


15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,850
Get up for now.

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,320
Can you stand up?

17
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,200
Hong Ju,

18
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,160
I was very sick.

19
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,420
I couldn't breathe,

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,710
my hands were shaky,

21
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,990
and I couldn't write at all.

22
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,690
I didn't know.

23
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,570
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,540
I didn't want you to see me like this.

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,300
How do you think I felt...

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,970
leaving you when you were crying?

27
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,170
I considered us together ten years.

28
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,190
You loved me the whole time,

29
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,380
and you were always special to me.

30
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,580
I felt the same even when we were apart.

31
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,620
I know you did, too.

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,500
I'll call CEO Min Woo and ask him to come. Rest a bit.

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,140
Lee Hong Ju.

34
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,860
Are you insisting on leaving?

35
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,010
How could you do this to me?

36
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,560
I was sick!

37
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,150
Please forgive me.

38
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,890
To be honest...

39
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,380
I was really curious why you left.

40
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,640
For the entire three years,

41
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,820
I wondered what I did wrong and what I didn't do.

42
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,760
Even you left me.

43
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,700
I thought it was actually my fault that everyone left me.

44
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,610
I kept thinking that over and over again.

45
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,610
But finding out the reason like this...

46
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,500
makes me angry.

47
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,150
It means you would have left no matter what I did.

48
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,170
It means you would have left without telling me, regardless.

49
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,810
"Forgive"?

50
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,210
Yes, I think I can forgive you now.

51
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,540
Thanks to you, I'm no longer curious for the first time in my life.

52
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,240
The fact that the person who left had a reason to do so

53
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,410
means it wasn't my fault.

54
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,840
I realized that, thanks to you.

55
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,400
Hong Ju, what I meant is—

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,870
I think I should make this clear.

57
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,970
There is someone I like.

58
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,930
I think I'll like him much more than I do now.

59
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,530
I won't change my mind, either.

60
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,850
I won't go back alone.

61
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,240
If that's how you feel, I'll do it right this time.

62
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,000
- Do what? 
 - Everything I didn't get to do.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,480
Call it going astray or a rebellion.

64
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,580
 Hu Yeong. 

65
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,210
 Hey! 

66
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,420
 Noona, he's been acting weird lately, right? 

67
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,700
He surprises me these days, too.

68
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,200
Did he suddenly change, or was he suppressing that part of him?

69
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,750
   

70
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,830
I'll leave the project.

71
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,580
Why?

72
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm sorry, CEO Bae.

73
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,320
I can't separate my personal life from work.

74
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,330
Did Mr. Bang do something to you?

75
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,920
No.

76
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,530
Then did you?

77
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,470
Yes, I did.

78
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,320
Fine, go ahead and leave it.

79
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,130
I don't want to force you to work on a project, either.

80
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,370
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,120
   

82
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,550
Take this because I don't need it anymore.

83
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,820
   

84
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,140
   

85
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,770
 I stayed up all night for the first time working on the proposal. 

86
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,660
 I have a dream, too. 

87
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:27,910
 I want youth like me to have fun and heartwarming dreams watching our films. 

88
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,290
 Did you have fun while working on this? 

89
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,710
 Yes. 

90
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,910
 How much? 

91
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,740
 I didn't notice I stayed up all night. 

92
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,270
 I didn't even notice the sunrise. 

93
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,940
What's with the P.E. teacher?

94
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,660
Do we have to go to school now that the entrance exam is over?

95
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,130
- That's what I'm saying. 
 - Forget it. You know how the P.E. teacher is.

96
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,500
Hey, did you watch the drama last night?

97
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,440
The supporting actor is just my type.

98
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,020
You guys must be happy.

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,540
You hang out with each other all day long,

100
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,160
you eat every meal on time,

101
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
you sleep when tired,

102
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,840
and eat after you wake up.

103
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,840
I miss being a student.

104
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,350
Aren't you describing a puppy daycare?

105
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey, don't respond. She's weird—

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,380
Don't talk to a weird person.

107
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,630
Am I weird?

108
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,300
What's so weird?

109
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,860
Is it weird that I yelled at a sick person,

110
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,360
or is it weird that I rejected an opportunity?

111
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,340
What's so weird?

112
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,840
Come here.

113
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,810
What's wrong with you?

114
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,400
- Wait for me! 
 - Hey, talk to me.

115
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,800
I won.

165
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,740
That can't be right.

166
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,220
So what if you're bad at games?

167
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm having so much fun.

168
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,780
I am, too.

169
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,060
I was also in the mood to go to an arcade today.

170
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,860
- We're in sync. 
 - Why?

171
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,490
Were you stressed at work, too?

172
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,970
Sort of.

173
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,340
How surprising.

174
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,990
I thought you never got stressed.

175
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,530
That's why I quit my job.

176
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,540
What? Did you quit your job?

177
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,840
Lee Hong Ju, my arm, my arm.

178
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,100
Is it because of me, by the way?

179
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,150
Because I told you not to go to the U.S.?

180
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,060
It's not like that.

181
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,520
Then what is it? Why did you suddenly quit your job?

182
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,510
Lee Hong Ju,

183
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,120
you don't have to worry.

184
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,950
I'm Kang Hu Yeong.

185
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,950
You won.

186
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,920
Just trust me.

187
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,810
Okay, I'll trust only you from now on.

188
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,410
 This is all because of Kang Hu Yeong. 

189
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,700
 I briefly lost my mind after getting rejected by him. 

190
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,580
 You said he's a big man. 

191
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,330
You said he's strong and dependable.

192
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,220
What's the point?

193
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,020
It's a handsome face that matters.

194
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,990
I guess that I agree.

195
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,050
That's why...

196
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,110
 I'm sorry. 

197
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,420
 You should have stopped me. 

198
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,350
 Your friend made the wrong decision. 

199
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,780
 You seemed to be having fun. 

200
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,870
What? Fun, as if.

201
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,970
 I could have been in danger, okay? 

202
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,140
 My ideals and values that I've protected all my life almost crumbled. 

203
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,860
Darn. I won't date anymore!

204
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,390
I'll focus only on work for now, only work.

205
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,480
What are you talking about? You need to date. It's nice.

206
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,930
 What do you mean by "nice"? 

207
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,100
 You waste emotions, and you have to constantly worry. 

208
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,280
- What if you get into a fight? 
 - Just don't fight then.

209
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,590
And work is more emotionally demanding.

210
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,550
You have to worry about the students a lot.

211
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,010
Work is rewarding, at least. Dating isn't.

212
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,790
- You get love from it. 
 - Wow.

213
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,330
You've changed, Lee Hong Ju.

214
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,210
Not at all. I just returned to my old self.

215
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,100
I don't know. I hate that.

216
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,600
Let's hang up. 
    

217
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,500
Love, as if.

218
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,370
Hiking boots aren't only for hiking.

219
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,390
They protect your ankles. They're nice.

220
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,550
Are they kind of heavy?

221
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,850
Nice, nice. Perfect.

222
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,870
I love it.

223
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,070
Gosh, why do they bother me so much?

224
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,990
   

225
00:16:49,930 --> 00:17:00,610
♫  There are so many things I want to tell you  ♫

226
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:08,170
♫  Standing in front of you again for a long time  ♫

227
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,020
♫  I'm unable to say a word  ♫

228
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,220
♫  I love you so much  ♫

229
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:23,500
♫  Why is it so hard to say this?  ♫

230
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,710
♫  I really want you  ♫

231
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:36,660
♫  I always want to be by your side  ♫

232
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,710
Hong Ju!

233
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,470
Did you go for a run?

234
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,930
Yes. This is kind of a bummer.

235
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,280
I wanted to walk a little longer.

236
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,510
That way.

237
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,200
We're going in the same direction.

238
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,050
I'll come with you.

239
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,580
Sounds good.

240
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,180
Mom?

241
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,130
"Mom"?

242
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,640
Hello, I'm Lee Hong Ju.

243
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,920
I'm Baek Do Seon.

244
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,730
You're with a friend this early in the morning.

245
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,640
- Mom, Hong Ju is— 
 - Hu Yeong hasn't been in Korea in a while.

246
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Thank you for keeping him company like this.

247
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,210
Yes.

248
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,430
She's my girlfriend.

249
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,640
Ms. Lee Hong Ju,

250
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,200
I need to talk to Hu Yeong briefly. Could you leave us alone?

251
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,530
Mom.

252
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,160
Hu Yeong.

253
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,180
See you next time.

254
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,750
 Uncle, it's an emergency. 

255
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,090
You met her again, didn't you?

256
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,370
Do you know Hong Ju?

257
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,590
Is there anything I don't know about you?

258
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,300
Is this why you suddenly want to rebel?

259
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,420
It has nothing to do with her.

260
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,120
It's my business, and I made the decision myself.

261
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,400
Okay. I'm sure you're right.

262
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,560
Oh, wh-what are you doing here?

263
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,370
Wh-Why did you come here, Noona?

264
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,710
The house has changed a lot.

265
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,180
I thought I requested maintenance only.

266
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,010
You didn't like this place because it reminded you of Brother-in-law.

267
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,050
You don't have a brother-in-law.

268
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,240
You aren't going to live in Korea, anyway.

269
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,700
Don't get me a hotel room.

270
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,100
I'll stay here while I'm in Korea.

271
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,840
Why?

272
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,030
Why?

273
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,800
No!

274
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,920
Baek Do Seon, leave!

275
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,790
Go to the U.S.!

276
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,210
Go!

277
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,900
The investors reacted positively to turn "Cloud Airport"

278
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,050
into a feature-length animated film.

279
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:23,510
They'd like to have a meeting with you sometime next week.

280
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,400
   

281
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,200
   

282
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,000
How far along are you with "Flowers that Blossom at Night"?

283
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,170
"Flowers" progress.

284
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,620
Oh, yes.

285
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,920
The director said the female lead's outfit was boring in the beginning.

286
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,470
The design team is fixing it, and—

287
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,710
A widow's outfit should be boring, not flashy.

288
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,160
You shouldn't entertain such requests.

289
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,130
They suggested white embroidery on the collar or ribbon.

290
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,100
The director said it was your idea.

291
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,740
Next.

292
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,300
Are we done?

293
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:12,200
"My Avant-garde Love" will have a new producer.

294
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,600
I know you're all working on a project each,

295
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,170
but this project will be meaningful to you and the company.

296
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,810
Check your schedules and come to my office if you want it.

297
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:31,230
Don't even knock on my door if you aren't committed.

298
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,800
Hey, you can't be here. Go home.

299
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,950
I don't want to. I won't.

300
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,010
Isn't your mom at your place?

301
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,320
Yes, she is.

302
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,150
And?

303
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,150
Were you surprised to see my mom this morning?

304
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,670
I was more surprised because of what you just did.

305
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,400
Will she be staying with you for a while?

306
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,600
Yes.

307
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,160
Should I stay somewhere else for a while?

308
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,680
I can stay with Hye Ji.

309
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,040
I'm here. Why would you go elsewhere?

310
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,500
It's because I feel uncomfortable.

311
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,210
I think your mom dislikes me.

312
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,400
She is always like that.

313
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,100
- You aren't lying, right? 
 - I'm not.

314
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,980
I wondered whom you resembled. Turns out it was your mom.

315
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,960
You mean I'm expressionless and inhuman—

316
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,140
When did I say that?

317
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,130
I ask you...

318
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,650
not to worry so much.

319
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,320
It's not like I never had any responsibility.

320
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,750
It's my fault for being too attractive.

321
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,100
♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

322
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,830
What's with this silence?

323
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,410
♫  So I ask you  ♫

324
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,170
You're right.

325
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:47,080
It's because you're too attractive.

326
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,210
If you admit it now, I can't take responsibility for it.

327
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,800
You have to.

328
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,500
- You're so shameless now that you're jobless. 
 - Right.

329
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,510
I'm jobless, aren't I?

330
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,230
You're smiling. Are you happy to be jobless?

331
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,970
I'm happy since I will have a lot of time for you.

332
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,530
You're a bit mischievous today.

333
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,350
You should leave now.

334
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,140
I don't want to.

335
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,140
♫  I know I'm falling in love  ♫

336
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,540
I'll stay a little longer.

337
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,410
I'll stay much longer.

338
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:25,290
Whatever.

339
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,550
♫  I love you  ♫

340
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,860
Here's your order.

341
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,650
Hey, Hu Yeong.

342
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,500
I'm busy because of the lunch rush.

343
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,680
- I'll clean this up. Sit here. 
 - Okay.

344
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,440
- Why are there so many people here? 
 - I don't know.

345
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,090
- Welcome. Table for three? 
 - Yes.

346
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,530
Hey, move.

347
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,890
Sit here. Check the menu and let me know what you want.

348
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,910
- Excuse me! 
 - Yes!

349
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,320
We haven't gotten our food yet.

350
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,180
Coming right out. Wait just a moment.

351
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,790
Should we ask what's good?

352
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,740
Excuse me.

353
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,380
Excuse me.

354
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,710
Pardon?

355
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,640
Is the kimchi stew tasty?

356
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,950
- Yes. 
 - What else is tasty?

357
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,910
It's all tasty.

358
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,810
We'll have two kimchi stews and one spicy pork stir fry.

359
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,580
Okay.

360
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,480
- Sang Pil. 
 - Yes?

361
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,190
Two kimchi stews and one spicy pork stir fry.

362
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,660
- Sang Pil. 
 - Yes, thank you.

363
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,680
Thank you.

364
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,500
I'm not used to disappointment.

365
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,410
Can't you just stay still?

366
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,670
- We will pay. 
 - Yes, coming.

367
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,110
I'm okay. Don't worry.

368
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,390
What are you talking about? You aren't.

369
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,900
I'm not okay. You broke so many bowls already.

370
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,760
Don't worry. I'm good at math.

371
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,030
 I'll ring you up. 

372
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,740
We enjoyed the meal.

373
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,620
It was so tasty and so handsome.

374
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,170
- Thank you. 
 - You're handsome.

375
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,010
 - Please come again!  
 - Thank you.

376
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,060
 Thank you. 

377
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,470
   

378
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,110
   

379
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,430
Please wash the dishes for me. 
    

380
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,570
H-Hu Yeong?

381
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,340
Yes, just stand there.

382
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,260
I'd be grateful for that.

383
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,750
Sang Pil, do you need more help?

384
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,120
No, just look at your phone.

385
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,030
Three clients didn't renew the contract this year.

386
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:44,460
One client said they would work with their bank.

387
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,100
So? 
    

388
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,670
Did you say, "Got it. Take care"?

389
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,860
No. Of course, we tried to persuade them.

390
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,240
   

391
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,700
   

392
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,680
Would you step out for a moment?

393
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,530
What are you doing right now?

394
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,110
What do you think I'm doing?

395
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,640
Grilling and harassing.

396
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,700
You're taking it out on them because you can't control Hu Yeong!

397
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,400
- You're right. 
 - I'm right?

398
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,570
You got sued for not doing a good job and let an HQ employee quit.

399
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,890
How could I not get angry?

400
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,150
I agree with the first one, but not the latter.

401
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,010
It's...

402
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,520
probably that girl, Lee Hong Ju.

403
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,600
How did you know?

404
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,750
 Do you remember Goblin Tteokbokki in front of our school? 

405
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,790
   

406
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,220
   

407
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,790
 Hu Yeong? Kang Hu Yeong? 

408
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,600
The handsome math genius,

409
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,310
I know him well.

410
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,970
He hasn't changed at all since. He's really handsome.

411
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,280
And... this is a secret.

412
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,830
I'm dating him.

413
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,640
 I told her you're my boyfriend. 

414
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,650
Hong Ju, lying like that makes you look pathetic.

415
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,790
It's true. Why won't you believe me?

416
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,220
He'd be crazy to date you.

417
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,060
- He isn't dating you. 
  - She won't believe me. 

418
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,920
 She said you'd be crazy to date me. 

419
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,740
You're so mean!

420
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,570
- Here you go. 
 - Wow.

421
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,570
 You need to come here with me to prove that you're crazy. 

422
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,580
   

423
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,480
 Let's have barbecue for dinner tonight. 

424
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,020
I'm losing my mind from having too many customers.

425
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:54,020
Are you happy that you're dating after quitting your job?

426
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,670
Yes.

427
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,550
What? I'm suddenly getting scared.

428
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,670
They say people die if they change suddenly.

429
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,830
I'll help you during the lunch hours for a while.

430
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,240
What?

431
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,930
- I'm free during the day. 
 - Please don't.

432
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,100
Just be free.

433
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,870
I can't wait until six.

434
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,210
   

435
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:19,530
Kang Hu Yeong won't come to work,

436
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,390
and he won't answer his phone.

437
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,100
Where is he, and what is he doing?

438
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,940
Gosh, my bowels are twisting.

439
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,250
Is it my stomach?

440
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,590
It's all twisting.

441
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,460
Bae Hye Suk!

442
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,580
Are you getting off work?

443
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,930
Have you had dinner yet?

444
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,640
Since when do we ask each other that, Sir?

445
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,320
Why not? We can ask that since we're neighbors, Ma'am.

446
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,330
- Baek Wook. 
 - Yes.

447
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,530
I won't park here anymore.

448
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,300
So stop calling me while you're drunk.

449
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,080
We're both over forty. What are we doing?

450
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,300
So childish.

451
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,420
You...

452
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,450
What are you doing right now?

453
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,230
Can you not control yourself because you're over forty?

454
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,390
Your skirt got stuck.

455
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,320
Why are you so clumsy?

456
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,690
What's wrong with you?

457
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,830
Why would you touch my skirt?

458
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,630
You're annoying! Go!

459
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,680
Hey! Bae Hye Suk!

460
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,310
Hey!

461
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,790
Hey!

462
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,470
Your skirt got stuck in the door!

463
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,740
I didn't want you to get injured!

464
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,690
Why get so angry about that?

465
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,080
My outfit is for work. I'll get changed and be there.

466
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,200
 - I'll pick you up.  
 - I can meet you there, no need to come.

467
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,800
Start grilling the meat so it's perfect by the time I get there.

468
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,130
- Is he crazy? 
  - What? 

469
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:57,150
Start... start grilling. I'll be right there.

470
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,350
What are you doing right now, Mr. Bang?

471
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,980
I'm throwing paper planes.

472
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,200
So why are you doing that here...

473
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,760
using these?

474
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,270
What should I do then?

475
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,900
I don't want to keep them with me anymore.

476
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,970
It's dangerous to burn them,

477
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:30,140
and it's too sad to throw them in the trash.

478
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,990
Throw them away in a trash bag.

479
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,470
You're so cold, Lee Hong Ju.

480
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,250
 I won't hold on to you anymore. Let's break up. 

481
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,670
 We broke up three years ago. 

482
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,470
 Yes, we broke up three years ago. 

483
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,710
 Are you sure you're seeing someone nice? 

484
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,390
 Yes. 

485
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,660
 Okay. 

486
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,830
 That's enough then. 

487
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,090
By the way, Hong Ju,

488
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,610
I don't think...

489
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,080
I can believe in love anymore.

490
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,660
I thought breaking up was so painful that I could die.

491
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,670
But I didn't die.

492
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,850
I didn't die, and I fell in love again.

493
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,350
You will also be okay, just like me.

494
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,120
This isn't fun, either.

495
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,080
Since these are your feelings,

496
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,930
you throw these away.

497
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,360
Good job, Bang Jun Ho.

498
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,450
You did the right thing.

499
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,300
The airplanes...

500
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,620
He threw so many.

501
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,200
I did write to him a lot.

502
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,390
Hello.

503
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,500
It seems children threw them nearby.

504
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,580
I thought you were just cute.

505
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,770
But looks like you have complicated relationships with men.

506
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,500
Seriously.

507
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,400
Why are you two just sitting here?

508
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,610
I'm not in the mood to grill the meat today.

509
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,150
What's wrong with her now?

510
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,340
Are you waiting for Lee Hong Ju?

511
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,100
 What a romantic. Seriously. 

512
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,910
Hye Ji, did Hong Ju tell you anything?

513
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,060
Tell me what?

514
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,940
   

515
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,140
   

516
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,350
Her office is crazy.

517
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,800
Lee Ddoong can't work with Bang Jun Ho unless they're crazy.

518
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,300
And don't say useless things to Hu Yeong.

519
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,170
Lee Ddoong won't do it. I know she won't.

520
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,920
What do you know?

521
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,510
She looked like she was dying to do it.

522
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:11,620
Hu Yeong has been sitting around here after quitting his job.

523
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,890
How could Lee Hong Ju consider doing that?

524
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,170
Did she look like she wanted to, or is she—

525
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,550
How could you just—

526
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,040
Kwon Sang Pil, you'd better fix this.

527
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,290
What did I do?

528
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,380
I'll pick up Hong Ju.

529
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:44,510
   

530
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,500
Hu Yeong...

531
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,420
better not know what happened today, right?

532
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,890
I'm not sure what you saw just now, but—

533
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,540
You don't have to tell me.

534
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:19,630
Not dragging Hu Yeong into a messy relationship like that is enough for me.

535
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:28,220
Ms. Lee, I see that this is a funny coincidence,

536
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,150
but don't waste time for no reason.

537
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,080
Hu Yeong will become the CEO of the Rock Asset HQ.

538
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,800
If he wants to, he can grow even more.

539
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,600
You understand what I mean, right?

540
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,750
"Understand what"?

541
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,510
I'm here to take Hu Yeong with me.

542
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,600
He doesn't belong here.

543
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:06,480
Shouldn't he decide that for himself?

544
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,190
My decision is his decision.

545
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,410
- But he– 
 - Maybe it's because he hasn't been in Korea in a while.

546
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,570
He softened up quite a bit.

547
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,700
He isn't usually like this.

548
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,500
I'd like you to let go of Hu Yeong.

549
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:33,100
I'm not holding onto him.

550
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,600
If so...

551
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,690
do you mean Hu Yeong is holding on to you,

552
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,170
Lee Hong Ju?

553
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,720
Yes. He seduced me first.

554
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,380
I was in a car accident recently.

555
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,870
I told him not to, but he took care of me.

556
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:55,350
He said he was glad that my relationship failed, and he kissed me first.

557
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,420
He also took me to a beach. I kept saying no,

558
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,500
but he kept saying he liked me. So...

559
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,370
So...

560
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,700
you gave in?

561
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,600
The cool, successful Kang Hu Yeong seduced me.

562
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,530
How could I not give in?

563
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,340
You're right.

564
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,870
You probably had no choice but to give in.

565
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,490
But do you think...

566
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,400
you're the only one?

567
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,100
I'm worried that he changes girlfriends often.

568
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,080
He keeps breaking other precious daughters' hearts.

569
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,950
But you know how men easily change their minds.

570
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:50,660
I hate to say this, but my son can't be too different.

571
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,700
I'd like you to quit...

572
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,010
before you get hurt badly.

573
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:07,930
I'll get going if you're done.

574
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,300
 Have you thought about... 

575
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,940
how much loss Hu Yeong would suffer due to you?

576
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:23,370
He's smart, and he must have done the calculation first.

577
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:28,100
It must mean I'm worth more.

578
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:46,100
♫  I hope you, whom I'm looking at, look at me, too  ♫

579
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:59,800
♫  You appear in my dreams  ♫

580
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:10,430
♫  I hope you, whom I like, like me, too  ♫

581
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,430
   

582
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:27,400
♫  I hope you come a bit closer to my heart now  ♫

583
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,960
What are you doing here?

584
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,520
What are you doing out in the cold?

585
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,920
I had some thinking to do.

586
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,750
Did something happen?

587
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:07,800
Sandra, Ann, Sarah, Amanda, and Selena.

588
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,240
Are these any of your exes?

589
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,300
What?

590
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,100
I heard you had many girlfriends in the U.S.

591
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,360
What do you mean?

592
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,570
Did you see my mom?

593
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,770
Yes. She told me...

594
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,790
that she worried a lot because you made many girls cry.

595
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:33,410
- Lee Hong Ju, that's– 
 - Why should I hear that from your mom?

596
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,080
What she says isn't important.

597
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,060
It's not?

598
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:45,490
Then her coming to take you back can't be important, either.

599
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,490
I'm sorry, I didn't tell you about her.

600
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,720
But I told you that I won't go.

601
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,040
What if you end up going?

602
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,990
Am I supposed to not know anything and find out after you leave?

603
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,800
Don't just believe what Mom said.

604
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,900
Shouldn't you trust me first?

605
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,150
How am I supposed to believe you in this situation?

606
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,550
So is that why you didn't tell me about Bang Jun Ho?

607
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,670
Why would you bring him up now?

608
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,990
It's none of your concern.

609
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,260
How could I not be concerned about that swine?

610
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,050
I saw how much you cried because of him.

611
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:40,710
I know what you did too. How could I...

612
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,600
How could I be okay?

613
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,380
I ended everything.

614
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,410
I moved on from everything.

615
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,750
You don't believe me, either.

616
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,750
- Hong Ju. 
 - Never mind.

617
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,640
You're the same. You also–

618
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,610
Don't say anymore.

619
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,060
You also are supposed to leave.

620
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,120
I forgot that for a moment.

621
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,860
Hong Ju.

622
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,220
Haven't you left for work yet?

623
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,050
Is this what you call rebellion?

624
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:37,780
I didn't sleep well. I'll lie down a little longer.

625
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,120
I'm hungry.

626
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,540
- Get out of there. 
 - Goodness, that was a close one.

627
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,580
Where should we go?

628
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,690
 What? 

629
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:45,890
 Did you come here to visit someone? 

630
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,500
 No. 

631
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,570
 I'm here to confess my love. 

632
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:55,070
 I'll confess my love to Oppa and leave. 

633
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,670
 It's overflowing from here. 

634
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,490
 It keeps overflowing that I can't even breathe. 

635
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:04,660
 I think I'd die if I don't tell him. 

636
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,000
 Let's meet again when Oppa Jun Ho gets discharged. 

637
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,540
 Then I'll show you our love. 

638
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,340
 I completely forgot about it. 

639
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,670
 How could you forget that? 

640
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,750
 Is it a bad memory for you? 

641
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:22,470
 How is that related to Bang Jun Ho? 

642
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:26,400
 It was your memory with me.  
 ♫  I keep circling around  ♫

643
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,060
 How could I not be concerned about that swine? 

644
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,020
 I saw how much you cried because of him. 

645
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,230
 I know what you did too. How could I... 

646
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,230
♫  Toward you, I'm afraid of  ♫

647
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,730
 How could I be okay?  
 ♫  The awkward atmosphere  ♫

648
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,100
♫  I can't even start speaking  ♫

649
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:52,400
♫  That's why I hesitate like this  ♫

650
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,910
Lee Ddoong.

651
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,230
Kim Hye Ji, what do I do?

652
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,390
What is wrong?

653
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,000
What have I done in front of Kang Hu Yeong?

654
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,930
I had completely forgotten about it.

655
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,070
- Why? Did you guys have a serious fight? 
 - Yes.

656
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,370
No.

657
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:12,990
What? Did you fight or not?

658
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:16,200
- I don't know. 
 - It's okay. Relationships are half love and half fights.

659
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,860
It's fine. What should we eat? Let's go.

660
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,500
- I'm not hungry– 
 - Don't even say that.

661
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,700
I used my precious opportunity to step out.

662
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,900
Let's get something tasty.

663
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:06,040
Hong Ju kept calling it a hideout.

664
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,550
It really was one.

665
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:14,720
I didn't know CEO Wook was this tasteful and rich.

666
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,760
I've been treating him without respect.

667
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,990
I forgot to call you last night. I'm sorry.

668
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,600
What?

669
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,320
By looking at how you left, I knew you wouldn't be back.

670
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,750
I thought you'd just get a drink.

671
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,230
Didn't you go too far?

672
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,960
I should have gotten you some fruits.

673
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,210
How about the restaurant?

674
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:39,650
I've been thinking a lot since we went to the beach last week.

675
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,610
Why did I decide to open a restaurant?

676
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:46,760
Was success the goal or was it happiness?

677
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,430
After working without a break,

678
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,650
am I successful or happy?

679
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,850
Selena as in Selena Gomez.

680
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,120
Sandra as in Sandra Bullock or Sandra Oh?

681
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,070
How did you come up with those names?

682
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:20,700
You're laughing too much, Teacher Kim.

683
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,310
You did well. You did well.

684
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:23,820
I already ate a leg.

685
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,950
You should eat my piece today.

686
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:30,770
Your face got skinny because you've been worried.

687
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:33,350
Kang Hu Yeong must be angry.

688
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,890
Why? What did you tell him?

689
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,900
I said he'd leave, too.

690
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,110
I said he's just like Bang Jun Ho.

691
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,730
Lee Ddoong, are you crazy?

692
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,720
His mom came to take him back with her. What was I supposed to say?

693
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,480
Kang Hu Yeong said he won't go.

694
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,140
What's the problem then?

695
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,810
He did, but...

696
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:59,680
I think Hu Yeong found out I tried to work with Bang Jun Ho again.

697
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,790
Oh, right.

698
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,420
I'm more disappointed about that.

699
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,100
Why didn't you tell me?

700
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,230
Why do you do everything alone?

701
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:12,400
I said I've always found that hurtful, didn't I?

702
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,580
I just didn't want you to worry.

703
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,910
- I wanted to take care of it myself– 
 - I know.

704
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,910
Take care of everything yourself then.

705
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:21,880
I don't have to worry since you're good at everything, right?

706
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,870
You're on your own.

707
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:31,790
You eat it, I said. I'm okay.

708
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,630
Eat it.

709
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,480
 Your attitude is wrong already. 

710
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,040
You should have kept denying it.

711
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:50,520
Say Lee Hong Ju is the only one now, in the past, and in future.

712
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,710
She is.

713
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,720
Is she?

714
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,990
That's not good either.

715
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:58,830
The more love, the better.

716
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,060
The more, the better, they say.

717
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,110
Let me show you something funny.

718
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,460
Before I show this to you,

719
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,380
don't tell Hong Ju and Hye Ji that I showed you this.

720
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,590
My life would be over then.

721
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,910
I was on vacation in my last year then.

722
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,330
Look at their faces.

723
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,960
Hye Ji was a mess because she was studying for the teachers' exam,

724
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,630
and as for Hong Ju...

725
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,580
Her work was intense, apparently.

726
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:49,640
I almost became a career soldier because of them.

727
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,700
What's this?

728
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,080
Oh, it's a photo of Hong Ju's name.

729
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,950
It was her company's first feature-length film.

730
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,260
She said her name would be in the ending credits,

731
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,530
but the letters were too small and fast to see.

732
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,560
Among children, we watched the movie three times to take this photo.

733
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,680
It was the day before winter break.

734
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,900
Hong Ju had indigestion after eating tteokbokki.

735
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,990
Hye Ji and I freaked out that day.

736
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:27,780
She cried and refused to go to the hospital.

737
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,220
Hong Ju got drunk and said this once:

738
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,580
She has had a nightmare since childhood.

739
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:56,880
The locations and people keep changing,

740
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,580
but she apparently keeps chasing them.

741
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,960
She wondered what kind of nightmare that was.

742
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,460
They all said they'd be back

743
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,380
and promised to reunite later,

744
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,830
but they left without a goodbye.

745
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:14,610
She was so scared because she didn't know they would go.

746
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21,590
 Hey, Kang Hu Yeong! Wait right there. 

747
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:25,290
 I'll be right over. Wait. 

748
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:34,220
 When are you returning to the U.S.? 

749
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,860
 I suppose you never inform before leaving. 

750
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:41,660
 Am I supposed to not know anything and find out after you leave? 

751
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,770
 You also are supposed to leave. 

752
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:47,320
 I forgot that for a moment. 

753
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:52,330
I asked what she wanted to do if she caught them.

754
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:55,010
She said she wanted to say goodbye.

755
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,490
So she doesn't have to keep waiting.

756
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,810
 My bus is here. Bye. 

757
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:06,420
 Goodbye, Kang Hu Yeong. It was good to see you. 

758
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:08,670
 Bye then. 

759
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:10,520
 Go back safely. 

760
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,560
Everyone...

761
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,300
has a wound, you know.

762
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,380
Again.

763
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,560
- Hey, hey! 
 - Block it! Block it!

764
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,100
Hey!

765
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,550
Defense!

766
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,590
Pass it!

767
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,450
Me, me.

768
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,440
Hey, hey, hey!

769
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,790
Defense!

770
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,130
Teacher Kim, move!

771
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,950
Teacher Son?

772
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,530
What a relief.

773
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:35,700
Teacher Son.

774
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,960
Teacher Son, are you okay?

775
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,060
Teacher Son, my gosh. Teacher Son!

776
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:41,400
- Help him get up. 
 - Are you okay, Teacher Son?

777
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,600
Should we call an ambulance?

778
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,240
- Teacher Son, are you okay? 
 - Are you okay?

779
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,600
It hurts.

780
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:20,750
Teacher Son...

781
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,650
I know you aren't sleeping.

782
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:33,030
Teacher Son.

783
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:36,430
Let me see if your nose is okay.

784
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,160
I'm okay. This is...

785
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,340
nothing at all.

786
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,890
What do you mean it's nothing?

787
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:50,440
Look at you. You hurt your cute face.

788
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,810
♫  You, I like you  ♫

789
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:58,250
♫  I like you, too  ♫

♫  Is this love?  ♫

791
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,020
Teacher Son,

792
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,900
will you still say you don't like me?

793
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:22,020
From the beginning,

794
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:29,160
it's always been you.

795
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,430
I... you.

796
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,990
I mean, I... you.

797
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,170
I love you! I love you! I love you!

798

♫  You, I like you  ♫

799

800
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:04,850

808
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,230
Hello, Ahjumma.

809
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,690
Take care.

810
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:16,970
- Who are you? 
 - Pardon?

811
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,600
Me?

812
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:24,810
I'm Hu Yeong's best friend, Kwon Sang Pil.

813
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:28,670
I was classmates with him for three years.

814
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:31,740
I'm his best friend.

815
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,620
Oh, I see.

816
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,190
By the way, where is Hu Yeong?

817
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:39,260
Pardon?

818
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:42,430
He was here just now.

819
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:44,210
But he's not.

820
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:47,480
I'm not sure where he is.

821
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,820
I'll get going now.

822
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,510
What are you doing here?

823
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,590
The girl who lives here...

824
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,720
I made her cry.

825
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:36,600
Let's go down. You'll catch a cold.

826
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,900
Mom,

827
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:43,280
have you ever regretted leaving Korea?

828
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,990
No.

829
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,880
Did you never miss Korea either?

830
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,960
Not even once.

831
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,830
Whenever I felt tired and stressed,

832
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:00,110
I suddenly remembered.

833
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:07,060
It's always the same memory because I don't have many.

834
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,740
Whenever I thought about it,

835
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,090
everything...

836
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,870
everything became okay.

837
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,880
I didn't know why then,

838
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:29,600
but now, I understand coming back here.

839
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
I think...

840
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:38,260
I've always missed it here.

841
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,680
I think I've longed for it.

842
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,100
I long for it...

843
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,400
Go back inside, Mom.

844
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:25,940


845
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,300
See you tomorrow.

846
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:47,400
♫  I wonder why I'm being influenced by you  ♫

847
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:53,900
♫  It surprises me how I mimic the way you talk  ♫

848
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:57,010
♫  It's so strange  ♫

849
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:07,820
♫  I wonder if you're like me, too  ♫

850
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:12,400
♫  Could you stop  ♫

851
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,010
Are you okay? 
 ♫  Your heart from racing  ♫

852
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:16,770
♫  And shaking?  ♫

853
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:19,320
Why did you run so much? I was coming to you.

854
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,210
♫  Because no one taught me  ♫

855
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:22,910
Kang Hu Yeong.

856
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:30,400
♫  It’s okay if you say no  ♫

857
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:37,450
♫  I will always tell you I love you  ♫

858
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:41,860
   

859
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:44,730
   

860
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:51,810
 So will you come for the Europe trip with me? 

861
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:54,060
 I found a company I want to join. 

862
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:58,900
 It's almost the winter break. Why would you get a job already? 

863
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,600
 I need to get a job here. 

864
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,500
 They don't count your resume. They look at only proposals and stuff. 

865
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:08,020
 I love the name too. It's "Peter's Pen." 

866
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:11,880
 My dad said he'd pay for both of our trips. 

867
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,490
 - I want to go with you. 
 - Here. 

868
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:18,680
 Just send me many photos, okay? 

869
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:23,300
 - Hello, Ma'am. 
 - Hi. 

870
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,500
 Why is it so cold? 

871
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,530
 That looks amazing. Daebak. 

872
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:31,390
 Why do you keep inviting him? 

873
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,360
 It wasn't me. Didn't you invite him? 

874
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,400
 Why does it matter when we have the same taste in food? 

875
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,550
 It would have been perfect if Hu Yeong were here. 

876
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:42,000
 Why look for someone who left Korea? 

877
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,400
 I'm disappointed, though. He should have graduated with us, at least. 

878
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,690
 Are you as disappointed as I am? I'm more disappointed. 

879
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,500
 He left without a goodbye. 

880
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,300
 He said, "See you tomorrow," and left for the U.S. 

881
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,690
 - Did he? 
 - Yes. 

882
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:56,800
 He won't answer his phone either. 

883
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:06,210
♫  I spread old photos in front of the fire  ♫

884
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:09,180
 Lee Ddoong, what's wrong? Why are you crying? 

885
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:10,320
 I'm not crying. 

886
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,960
♫  I push ahead to try to express my heart to you  ♫

887
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,980
 Am I crying? 

888
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,500
 I had many days like that when I was young. 

889
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,920
 Did you make her cry? 

890
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,460
 How can I? I just came and ate only a few bites. 

891
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:27,920
 I... I think it hurts here. 

892
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,960
 I didn't know what emotion I was feeling or why. 

893
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,700
 It hurts here? 

894
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,950
 Did you get indigestion? 

895
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:37,090
 That's why you shouldn't overeat. 

896
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,480
 Seriously. 

897
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,120
 Should I get you some medicine? Or go to the hospital? 

898
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,020
 I hate hospitals. I feel so... 

899
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,960
♫  I can't sleep thinking of you  ♫

900

 Goodness, who made Hong Ju cry? 

901
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:54,670
 Don't cry. 

902
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:58,640
 I thought I didn't know because I was young. 

903
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,030
 But I still have moments like that as an adult.

 Would you like some ramen before you go? 

912
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,940
 - I just wanted to eat ramen. 
 - What are you thinking? 

913
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,160
 What? Does your head hurt? 

914
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:43,050
 Every day has been like a vacation since Hu Yeong came. 

915
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,800
 Good morning. 

916

 What's our relationship? 

917
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,880
 We both love Hu Yeong.

 - Kang Hu Yeong? 
 - Starting now, 

919
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:58,100
 I'll file a lawsuit against you. 

920
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:02,530
 I know it's not an easy decision, but I can't be without you. 

921
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,810
 Let's go to the U.S. together.
