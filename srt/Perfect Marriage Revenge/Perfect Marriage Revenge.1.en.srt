15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,200
To my parents, I'm never been
good enough as a daughter.

Please give me some
words of encouragement."

17
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,280
That was her message.

18
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,590
Your parents might not be the
best at expressing themselves,

19
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,300
but I'm sure they love
you and will be happy.

20
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,180
It's not about being good or bad.

21
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,820

23
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,690
Yi Joo, your family will
know what's in your heart.

24
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,060
Because you're family.

Eat before you go.

40
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,950
Maybe you could tidy up
the living room while I cook?

41
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,770
Unni! Don't stress about it.

42
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,850
That's what she said.

43
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,680
It's just a cut.

44
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,850
I didn't have band-aids at home.

45
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,220

But since your friends are
coming, I wanted to do my best.

What?

50
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,340

51
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,370
Is this burnt or undercooked?

52
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,470
I'm sorry, Mother.

53
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,630
You could have ordered yangjangpi*, sweet and sour pork,
and called it a day. (Chinese seafood and vegetable mix)

54
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,710
Are you trying to embarrass me on purpose?

55
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,070
- Since your in-laws are poor, so-
- No way!

56
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,680
I was wrong.

57
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,030
Please take this and get something...

- Gosh, forget it!
- Please.

59
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,240
It'll make me feel better.

60
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,160
Well, if you insist.

61
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,070
- You're going to your parents' place?
- Yes.

62
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,450
I figured they'd be busy
during the event tomorrow.

63
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,030
I'll have dinner with them ahead of time.

64
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,240
Then you should bring
up Se Hyeok this time.

65

give him a job at his company...

I heard your sister Yoo Ra
might marry Seo Do Guk.

73

But Seo Do Guk is the
CEO of Se Hyeok's company.

74
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,220
Then his younger brother-in-law would
be his boss. How does that make sense?

75

Who hung these paintings
like this without my permission?

83

CEO Lee, they're in the order of the artists'
names, like we usually do in the exhibits...

84
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,990
It should be in the order of the
collectors' names, not the artists!

85
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,550

For a party to celebrate the
acquisition of a savings bank,

87

He said he was leaving so suddenly.

176
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,520
We couldn't even have
a proper farewell party.

177
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,100
It's okay. Thank you so
much for your thoughts.

178
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,590
Take care.

179
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,820
He quit his job?

180
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,390
Se Hyeok...

181
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,260
what are you thinking?

182
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,880
- Yes, Mother.
- Hey.

183
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,340
Have you seen your father?

184
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,120
You asked him about Se Hyeok?

185
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,720
No. I don't know what
Se Hyeok is thinking yet.

186
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,040
Why don't you know anything?

187
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,730
I know everything.

188
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,950
You do?

189
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,330
Then, did you know about this?

190
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,950
What?

191
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,360
Se Hyeok quit his job?

192
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,320
He didn't tell me anything.

193
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,260
I don't know why...

194
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,900
You still don't know it's because of you?

195
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,240
- Excuse me?
- Se Hyeok said he needs to try harder.

196
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,190
He wants to work for his father-in-law.
He wants to have kids soon.

197
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,640
That's the only way he can be fully
acknowledged as a son-in-law to your family.

198
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,730
But why wouldn't he talk to me about it?

199
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,750
He said it would just make you worry.

200
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,150
He's trying so hard all by himself.

201
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,410
Shouldn't you also help your husband out?

202
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,000
There's a lot of controversy
surrounding this acquisition.

203
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,520
What do you mean?

204
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,050
The reason the financial authorities allowed
the acquisition of Savings Bank by Hanwool

205
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,370
was under the condition that it liquidates
its subsidiaries in the lending industry.

206
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,190
But Marine Credit, an art
collateral loan company,

207
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,510
was omitted from the list of
companies to be liquidated.

208
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,110
It's a simple omission.

209
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,660
Marine was classified as an arts business.

210
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,950
It didn't get lumped in
with the lending industry.

211
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:09,010
But there are rumors that the financial
authorities knowingly looked the other way.

212
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,140
Every growing company
has rumors following it.

213
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,220
Whether you let them hold
you back or move forward

214
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,520
depends on the businessman's capabilities.

215
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,780
Here, here. Today is a celebration.

216
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,320
There will be more Savings
Bank branches nationally.

217
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,330
Today is about celebrating the growth of the
Hanwool family. [Hanwool, a family under one roof]

218
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,150
I thought your advertising got
more sophisticated than before.

219
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,270
Did you bring in a new
marketing department as well?

220
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,230
Well, as for that...

221
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,420
I'll answer that.

222
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,580
Now, now. You should
have a celebratory drink, too.

223
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,230
Father.

224
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,400
Hey. You made it.

225
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,580
This must be your daughter.

226
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,260
And this is...

227
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,010
My husband.

228
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,880
He actually came up with the slogan.

229
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,140
"Hanwool, a family under one roof."

230
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,870
I see.

231
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,740
Your son-in-law is quite talented.

232
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,600
My oldest son-in-law
worked very hard on it.

233
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,000
You should have told me. I
would have come with you to help.

234
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,030
It's fine. I wanted to.

235
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,120
- What?
- Thank you.

236
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,540
For what?

237
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,340
Just. Everything.

238
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,630
You don't need to thank me.

239
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,170
When you're like this, I feel bad.

240
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,970
Okay.

241
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,390
Then don't tell me you're sorry, either.

242
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,290
I won't say "thank you,"

243
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,350
and you won't say, "I'm sorry."

244
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,930
The person who messes up
first grants the other person's wish.

245
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,020
Okay. Sure.

246
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,420
I should help Manager Oh.

247
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,250
I'll see you later.

248
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,260
Yi Joo!

249
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,120
Huh?

250
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,920
I need to tell you something...

251
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,950
after the event.

252
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,710
I hope you can hear it
without getting angry.

253
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,840
Why would I get angry?

254
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,450
You must have your reasons.

255
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,430
I trust you, Se Hyeok.

256
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,170
See you later, then.

257
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,870
Isn't it nice?

258
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,940
Hello, I'm sorry I'm late.

259
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,400
- You made it.
- Yes.

260
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,090
- You came late.
- Right, right.

261
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,320
Thank you for the invitation.

262
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,470
Thank you for being here.

263
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,870
How's your business going?

264
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,620
Very well.

265
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,280
Grandfather, it's Yi Joo.

266
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,310
Are you healthy and well?

267
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,520
I know it's not very good,

268
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,680
but I painted our family.

269
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:07,430
I hope we can take a
picture like this someday.

270
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,600
I hope you stay healthy until then.

271
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,110
"Please stay healthy?"

272
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,810
Please stay healthy until then.

273
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,710
He's not going to be happy to hear from me.

274
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,410
What are you doing, Unni?

275
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,010
What is this?

276
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,900
What do you think of my painting?

277
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,920
Wow, I had no idea you were so ambitious.

278
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,180
You brought this here to hang it, right?

279
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,480
When rich wives see it,
they'll ask about it for sure.

280
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,140
"My goodness, is this a
painting or a photograph?"

281
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,910
"Who painted it?"

282
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,050
You know better than that.

283
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,390
This would've been popular years ago.
Who hangs paintings like this these days?

284
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,170
So old-fashioned.

285
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,660
I didn't mean for it to be on display.

286
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,570
Then why did you paint it?

287
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,610
I just...

288
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,850
We don't have a proper family photo.

289
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,760
I saw a picture of you and Yoo Ra at home.

290
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,820
It was so nice.

291
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,670
I thought it might have
been nice if we were all in it.

292
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,010
Don't you know the saying, "When
you get married, you leave the family"?

293
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,440
Go be a ghost in your husband's
family if you married him.

294
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,110
What more do you want?

295
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,530
I'm sorry, Mother.

296
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,210
Get it out of the way.

297
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,460
I don't want people to
say the exhibit sucks.

298
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,280
Gosh, Mom...

299
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,950
It's not about being good or bad.

300
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,760
Yi Joo, your family will
know what's in your heart.

301
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,530
Because you're family.

302
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,130
I'm family, too.

303
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,200
What?

304
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,580
Why can't you see my
heart, not the painting?

305
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,190
Maybe it's not good enough for you.

306
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,250
But I did my best.

307
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,830
With my whole heart.

308
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,510
Hey...

309
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,180
you...

310
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,880
My goodness! What's this?

311
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,060
Why did you bring a family photo?

312
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,110
Wait, my goodness.

313
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,900
Is this a painting or a photograph?

314
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,160
What?

315
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,840
It's a painting. My sister painted it.

316
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,770
Oh, your eldest!

317
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,580
What was your name again?

318
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,930
Han Yi Joo.

319
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,480
It's nothing.

320
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,190
She went to art school.
She's an aspiring painter.

321
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,050
Gosh. What do you mean, aspiring?

322
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,260
She's a professional.

323
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,520
One of the best in the country.

324
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,730
My gosh! Why did you hide
such a talented daughter?

325
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,720
What do you mean, hide?

326
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,240
You are a person with
such deep arts knowledge.

327
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,620
You're just being kind
because she's my daughter.

328
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,020
Come on, say hello.

329
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,360
- Thank you.
- This is such a great piece. My goodness.

330
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,670
- Please paint one for us.
- Such detail and sophistication. So nice.

331
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,250
[The Hanwool Family by Han Yi Joo]

332
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,020
Don't take what I said earlier to heart.

333
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:14,960
You know your paintings
are in storage, right?

334
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
They cost money, you know.

335
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,100
We made sure the canvas didn't
stretch. That the paint doesn't come off.

336
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,090
The temperature and humidity are controlled,
and security alarms are installed.

337
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,930
Other artists pay three million won per
pyung* a year. (Measuring unit for land)

338
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,550
Thirty million for 10 pyung.

339
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,140
You get special treatment
because you're family.

340
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,950
You should be working harder.
Not stuck on something like that.

341
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,450
It got me upset a little bit.

342
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,330
I wondered when you
would stop being an amateur.

343
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,510
I'm sorry.

344
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,240
I didn't know your true intentions.

345
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:03,700
You're working on the paintings
for the Hanwool Foundation, right?

346
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,870
Yes. They're paintings for social welfare
facilities like orphanages and rehabs.

347
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,300
I've been copying pieces by famous artists,

348
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,780
so they can look at them
like real paintings, not prints.

349
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,590
It's for a good cause, so
I've been doing my best.

350
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,990
Okay. Let me know if you
need anything for your studio.

351
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,280
Yes.

352
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,370
I...

353
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,920
I'll do well.

354
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,530
I won't let you down, Mother.

355
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,390
As identical as possible.

356
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,890
Don't forget.

357
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,190
Yes.

358
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,150
So easy.

359
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,090
I like how easy she is. Han Yi Joo.

[Gallery The Han Charity Auction]

361
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,180
It's okay. I didn't get my spit on it.

362
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,730
Yes, I know. I was watching.

363
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,180
Pardon?

364
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,070
Acrylic, right?

365
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,440
This should do it.

366
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,690
Thank you.

367
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,870
Wow. Nice work.

368
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,930
Hyperrealism...

369
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,800
- or something like that.
- You must know a lot about art, sir.

370
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,800
I read somewhere that
the goal of hyperrealism

371
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,490
is not to portray the
subject as they are in reality,

372
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:30,920
but to reveal the fact that any portrayal,
however real, is ultimately fake.

373
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,440
You mean...

374
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,830
That this painting is fake.

375
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,930
No matter how real it looks.

376
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,000
Do Guk! You should have
called when you got here.

377
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,440
I was looking at your sister's painting.

378
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,420
CEO Seo, you made it.

379
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,310
My sister is so talented, right?

380
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,370
I was so surprised.

381
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,690
Stop it, Yoo Ra.

382
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,840
If your wife created such a great painting,

383
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,870
you should be bragging
about it. Why stop me?

384
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,550
Do you even love my sister?

385
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,940
What?

386
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,420
Why are you so surprised?

387
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,900
I heard she asked you out first, too.

388
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,590
How is she supposed to know how you feel?

389
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,410
Right, Do Guk?

390
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,820
- Yoo Ra, come on.
- As for that,

391
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,190
I can tell.

392
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,950
You do? How?

393
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,070
For us...

394
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,900
we have our history.

395
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,240
Yi Joo!

396
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,530
Oppa!

397
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,900
- You waited this whole time?
- Thank you.

398
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,380
Thank you for coming.

399
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,300
Showing up here means
you accept my feelings, right?

400
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,260
Remember? I said to come if
you accept my feelings for you.

401
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,650
You said you would wait until I got here.

402
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,440
Anyway. So...

403
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,760
Okay.

404
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:11,550
Love isn't just about saying "I love you."

405
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,830
"I'm sorry." "Thank you."

406
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:19,130
I can express my feelings
through those words or actions.

407
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,460
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

408
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,590
What?

409
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,270
"I'm sorry." "Thank you."

410
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:35,830
Those are things you say when
you want to avoid something.

411
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,220
Love should make you feel certain.

412
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:48,180
You should know that someone loves
you just from the way they look at you.

413
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,650
Am I wrong, Do Guk?

414
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,460
Not so sure. Everyone does it differently.

415
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,760
I think Yi Joo's way is just fine.

416
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,940
Really? How so?

417
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,580
To Han Yi Joo, Mr. Yoo
looks so handsome like this.

418
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:20,610
It makes me think, "A man could
be so loved by a woman like this."

419
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:25,430
As a man, isn't this praise
worth being jealous of?

420
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,300
Oh, I see now that you hear you say that.

421
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:44,670
Wow. Was my brother-in-law this handsome?

422
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,300
What do you think? Don't
we look better together?

423
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,450
Yoo Ra, this is...

424
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,690
Why? You don't like it?

425
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,720
I don't do it for you at all?

426
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,370
I'm going to wash my hands.

427
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,030
I need to take this.

428
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,770
See you later.

00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,350
My grandmother collapsed, apparently.

433
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,300
- I need to go.
- What?

434
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,860
Then, should I tell Yoo Ra to come?

435
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,290
Why Han Yoo Ra?

436
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,890
Because if she's your
grandmother, Yoo Ra should also...

437
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,200
You and Yoo Ra are talking about
marriage. Then, you will be family...

438
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,130

439
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,090
Oh, right.

00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,540

Why do you say hello and
thank you on their behalf?

444
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,570
Because they're family.

445
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:55,180
Do they think of you
that way, Ms. Han Yi Joo?

446
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,500

447
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,220

You thought you could get away with it?

530
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,850
See this?

531
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,710
It's a 40-year-old painting.

532
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,270
How could the area covered by wood
and exposed area be the same color?

533
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,380
The exposed part should be more oxidized!

534
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,160
It's been painted over with coffee-colored paint
to make it look older and covered with cloth.

535
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,590
Same with the Sun Jin
piece you purchased last time.

536
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,990
That one even matched the serial number of a
piece hanging in a foreign collector's home.

537
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:17,510
So, that means at least
these two pieces are fake.

538
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,380
No!

539
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,900
Sun Jin definitely painted
the pieces I gave you.

540
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,510
You know this.

541
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,770
Who could copy the artist's style?

542
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,730
It's not impossible.

543
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,420
You have someone who can
make identical copies of anything.

544
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,000
I think there's been a
misunderstanding, Ma'am.

545
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,670
- Let's not make a scene out here...
- Then,

546
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,230
let's lay it all out in the open.

547
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,960
Go through Lee Jung Hye's art sales transactions
and the list of her gallery's collection.

548
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,840
Let's investigate all the
pieces you've ever sold

549
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,330
and see if they're real or fake.

550
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,190
Ma'am...

551
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,960
Manager Kim, what do I do?

552
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,210
What do I do in a situation like this?

553
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,030
What are you doing?

554
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,190
Arrest those people!

555
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,100
- Yi Joo!
- Yes, Mother!

556
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,380
Stop this. She doesn't know anything.

557
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,170
That makes no sense!

558
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,550
She's the one who sold artwork.

559
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,490
Yi Joo, please help me.

560
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,400
Yes, Mother. What can I do?

561
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,250
Say that you did this.

562
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,100
- What?
- Ms. Yi Joo painted this piece.

563
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,760
Ms. Yi Joo said she could copy
Sun Jin's painting style identically

564
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,980
and offered to split the profits.

565
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,660
She would copy the paintings, and I faked
the sources and showed them to CEO Lee.

566
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,560
The piece you purchased last time...

567
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,200
It was also painted by Yi Joo.

568
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,930
Manager Kim.

569
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,760
Yi Joo...

570
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,230
We can't let this get
bigger for the company.

571
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,010
You know people like to talk.

572
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,530
Han Yi Joo, is that true?

573
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,040
Mother...

574
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,300
Just say yes for now.

575
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,240
Go down to the station and stay quiet.

576
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,590
I'll send over a lawyer right away. Okay?

577
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,560
Did you do this?

578
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,160
You knew all this was happening?

579
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,120
Is that what matters to you right now?

580
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,980
- Manager Kim, why would you do such a thing?
- I have proof, too.

581
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,220
In Ms. Yi Joo's car, there
should be an invoice for the

582
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,100
paper company through which
she received the payments.

583
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:06,100
The fraudulent pieces other than
those of Sun Jin are in the gallery studio.

584
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,320
She said that working there
would draw the least attention.

585
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,250
I found the documents.

586
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:25,450
You're working on the paintings
for Hanwool Foundation, right?

587
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,670
As identical as possible.

588
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,380

592
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,690
This is my fault.

593
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,710
I didn't raise her correctly.

594
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,430
Please arrest me instead, sir.

595
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,660
Are you okay?

596
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,980
How could I be okay right now?

597
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,410
I worked so hard to open this gallery.

598
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,110
I went through so much
to convince my father.

599
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,090
What has my sister done?

600
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,050
There must be a misunderstanding.

601
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,560
Yi Joo couldn't have.

602
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,990
How do you really know someone?

603
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,270

I don't know. What am I going to do?

What can I do to make you stop crying?

606
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,010
What do you care whether I cry or not?

607
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,130
I do care.

608
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,180
When I see you cry,

609
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,430
I want to cry, too.

610
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,610
Oppa.

611
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,270
You said once.

612
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,160
If a person likes someone, you can tell.

613
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,250
Couldn't you tell?

614
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,520
Yoo Ra, I...

615
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,980
Stop.

616

I don't know what's going on but stop.

617
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,830
I don't want to hear it.

618
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,080
I...

619
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,790
married Yi Joo to be close to you.

620
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,950
At first, I thought that would be enough.

621
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:31,770
But when I saw you with
another guy, I knew it then.

622
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,690
- I can't live without you.
- Stop it!

623
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,360
So what? What do you want to do now?

624
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,390
I'll leave Yi Joo.

625
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,330
And I want to be with you.

I knew it.

Only someone as clueless
as my sister wouldn't see it.

633
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,880
I thought you would stop eventually.

634
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,610
I was going to let it
go because it was cute.

635
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,920

Se Hyeok, you wouldn't
do that to me. Right?

642
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,040
I was going to tell you today.

643
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,570
You were talking about your job.

644
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,470
I know you were going to tell me you quit.
