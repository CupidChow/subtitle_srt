Hello, Chairwoman.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,030
Hello.

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,100
She's my guest. Aren't you going to welcome her?

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,010
Han Yoo Ra.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,020
What's going on?

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,020
We're...

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,600
dating, Mother.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,070
- What?
- You're doing what?

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,680
Han Yoo Ra and I are dating.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,700
And discussing marriage.

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,420
Wait...

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,200
You and the in-law? How?

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,490
She was about to get accosted by some guy at a cafe. I happened to help her out.

24
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,470
I found out later that she was Yi Joo's younger sister.

25
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,980
Had we known sooner, we wouldn't have gone on a date.

26
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,100
But...

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,020
the heart...

28
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,510
wants what it wants, you know?

29
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,510
Hold on.

30
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,780
So, Han Yoo Ra. You're saying, "Is it a sin to love both brothers?"

31
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,900
- What?
- You think I don't know you?

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,990
I know you're boy-crazy.

33
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,230
But bringing that into my family is another story. Don't you think?

34
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,890
Do Na!

35
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,440
Don't talk like that.

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,880
Yoo Ra is the one who spouted nonsense first!

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,310
Listen to your father.

38
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,780
If you go low just because they go low,

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,120
you're just like them.

40
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,960
Honey...

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,200
So, you really like this in-law lady?

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,720
Why?

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,770
Because Yoo Ra likes me.

44
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,410
That's the reason?

45
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,370
It might be the only chance in a lifetime for me.

46
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,330
It makes me sad to hear you take it as no big deal.

47
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,430
Not everyone can be beloved by women like Seo Do Guk.

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,210
It's painful, but reality is what it is.

49
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,040
Isn't it?

50
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,450
How could you see reality?

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,690
You're still blaming a leg you hurt 20 years ago.

52
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,750
What did you say?

53
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,100
"I'm going to marry her because this woman likes me."

54
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,780
I mean...

55
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,610
You're putting all the responsibility on the other person.

56
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,810
Like you did to me.

57
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,580
Do Guk.

58
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,590
I don't want to raise my voice in front of my family.

59
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,560
Then why did you make a scene like this?

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,730
I don't believe you.

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,470
You bastard...

62
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,470
Let go.

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,390
Jung Wook,

64
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,770
why don't you take Yoo Ra to her place?

65
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,100
You two, go home.

66
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
If not,

67
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,030
neither of you will be allowed in this house ever again.

68
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,680
Grandma!

69
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,380
I won't drag this on. What are you going to do?

70
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,800
What the hell are you doing?

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,020
This is all your fault, you know.

72
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,950
You acted out when you should know your place. That's why this is happening.

73
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,760
My place? What is my place?

74
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,020
A nobody shouldn't take what's mine.

75
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,760
How dare you act like you're the real one!

76
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,190
Who says I'm the fake one?

77
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,810
Don't you dare.

78
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,250
What?

79
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,460
Let's go.

80
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,700
It's not worth engaging.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,750
I'm disappointed in you, Seo Jung Wook.

82
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,150
Why?

83
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,380
Why did you get into a fight with Do Guk back there?

84
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,970
We should've behaved in front of them and gotten their blessing.

85
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,120
So, what's the plan now?

86
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,630
Do you think you can convince the Chairwoman?

87
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,920
Why would I do that? That's your job, Han Yoo Ra.

88
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,280
What?

89
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,210
We are a team.

90
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,230
I inherit the Taeja Group, and you get the families' approval.

91
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,720
Those are our respective roles.

92
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,390
Were you planning to become the first lady of the Taeja Group without lifting a finger?

93
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,280
Without lifting a finger?

94
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,160
My mom gave you the money.

95
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,260
That wasn't you, Han Yoo Ra.

96
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,280
- What?
- How can you talk like that?

97
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,350
What did I do?

98
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,500
What you said about going low just because they go low.

99
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,830
Jung Wook isn't "them."

100
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,170
They're all our children. Why would you talk like that?

101
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,600
What about you? Why do you only take Jung Wook's side?

102
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,250
- What?
- Think of how shocked Do Guk must have been!

103
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,530
Bringing a girl who used to chase him and talking about marrying her.

104
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,020
You should be scolding him, not worrying about his feelings.

105
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,230
My goodness.

106
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,680
You've always treated Jung Wook like a child.

107
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,940
Family and business both. You can't see Jung Wook objectively.

108
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,880
But you're the same.

109
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,240
You're not objective, either.

110
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,000
To you, Do Guk is your only son.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,460
What?

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Honey! Goodness...

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,750
How are the last month's sales?

114
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,120
Compared to the month before, it's gone down by 20%.

115
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,900
What should we do?

116
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,020
Let's slash the prices of the pieces we have now.

117
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,900
Think of ways to sell as many pieces as possible fast.

118
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,740
Maybe organize a special exhibit?

119
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,300
Yes?

120
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,600
My gosh. You must be exhausted.

121
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,530
You'll need to up the sales to make a case for Father.

122
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,660
Want me to tell you an easy, surefire way?

123
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,270
You?

124
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,260
What is it?

125
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,840
Me.

126
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,290
- What?
- Ms. Han, are you there?

127
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,290
Ms. Han!

128
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,110
Can I help you?

129
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,540
We're here to meet the artist Han Yi Joo.

130
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,450
Welcome, everyone!

131
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,640
It's me, Han Yi Joo.

Nice to meet you. Reporter Park Jin Young from MDN News.

137
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,230
Hello, I'm Lee Jung Hye.

138
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,710
I'm so impressed by how you turned around a classical-focused gallery's direction.

139
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:02,350
I heard it was your idea to promote her overseas anonymously.

140
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,190
Yes. I mean...

141
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,910
It was all possible because of her vision.

142
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,730
I'm so grateful.

143
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,000
What kind of work will you do now?

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,300
I'll start domestically first.

145
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,010
I think it might be good for me to play bigger, too.

146
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,160
Bigger? How?

147
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,420
So what kind of work do you want to do?

148
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,130
Something that could become my signature piece.

149
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,770
Bigger in size, a more diverse color palette...

150
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,900
Then the price will go up, too, no?

151
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,230
Kill two birds with one stone?

152
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,930
- What?
- Whatever you earn from the auction,

153
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,380
you'll tell your father it was because of your talent.

154
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,680
50% of the selling price goes to the artist.

155
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,140
You want to make some money, too. No?

156
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,490
I don't need money.

157
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,640
What?

158
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,590
Instead...

159
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,090
there's something else I want.

160
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,430
You want our gallery's centerpiece?

161
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,570
This is by the artist Sun Jin.

162
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,290
I'm trying to make a deal.

163
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,060
You don't have to accept if you think it's a loss.

166
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,230
What? Yoo Ra wants to marry Seo Jung Wook?

167
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,600
They came over to our in-laws' place together.

168
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,090
It was a whole scene.

169
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,390
I debated whether I should tell you.

170
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,800
But I don't think Seo Jung Wook is a good person.

171
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,620
I was hoping you could talk her out of it.

172
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,770
Thank you for showing your concern.

173
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,750
Ever since you got married, you seem like an adult.

174
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,100
I'm old enough, too.

175
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,020
Don't complain about old age in front of your father.

176
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,650
Please stay healthy.

177
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,480
Hanwool is just getting started.

178
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,120
Right. Oh, by the way, the acquisition business is going well?

179
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,930
Of course.

00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,420
I think you should prepare to promote as a group.

181
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,480
You're right.

182
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,600
Father, you have a lot of gray hair.

183
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,860

Why are you so late?

187
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,310
I had a lot of work to do.

188
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,360
We're planning an event for the gallery.

189
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,770
Cancel it. Get ready to wrap it up.

190
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,830
Wrap what up?

191
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,390
We said we'd see how it goes. We're going to up the sales.

192
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,370
The gallery isn't the issue here.

193
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,930
You and Yoo Ra are about to ruin our company's brand.

194
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,140
What are you talking about?

195
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,860
I heard you're trying to marry off Yoo Ra to Seo Jung Wook of Taeja.

196
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,820
Who told you that? Han Yi Joo? Or Madam Cha?

197
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,720
Does it even matter?

198
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,500
You think Taeja Group will allow it?

199
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,210
What will people say about our family?

200
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,700
- Where are we headed?
- The nursing home.

201
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,630
I'm going to get our shares.

202
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,160
A dementia patient left on his own, and you didn't know.

203
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,590
If something happens to him, how will you take responsibility?

204
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,780
He was planning his escape. How could we have stopped him?

205
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,210
What?

206
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,270
He was taking his things out, little by little.

207
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,170
He changed into street clothes.

208
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,150
We have footage of him leaving, mixed in with other visitors.

209
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,460
Aigoo, here it is!

210
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,760
This.

211
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,470
It was on the table. I just thought I'd tell you in person-

212
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,150
Please process my discharge.

213
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:12,500
When my guardian stops by later, tell her I left on my own.

214
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,740
Then, will you give Yoo Ra the shares you're holding?

215
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,870
Sure, I should. Why don't you schedule a board meeting?

216
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,640
Let's get it all done in one fell swoop.

217
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,530
He planned this.

218
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,460
So, he could reassure me, then run away.

219
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,600
My father-in-law, Chairman Han Woon Jae. He was here recently, right?

220
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,690
I'm not sure. I don't remember. Must have been a while.

221
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,910
I don't think that's true.

222
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,990
That spineless man never makes his own decisions.

223
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,810
Think hard.

224
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,760
I mean...

225
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,840

I told her how she came to be adopted.

Hey, Lawyer Kim.

239
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:23,290
You know, I think it's time to deal with my shares.

240
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,760
No, not my kid. My granddaughter.

241
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:32,330
Well, I heard skipping a generation helps cut down on taxes, too.

242
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,270
Now? A lawyer should know the basics of inheritance!

243
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,710
We should do it when stocks are cheap.

Good, good. Thanks for taking care of it.

- So, about your company.
- Yeah.

247
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,400
I heard Taeja Group was going to invest big when Seo Do Guk got married.

248
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,620
- Any movement on that?
- Well...

249
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,010
not at all.

250
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,440
Maybe it was a lie to get him to marry quickly.

251
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,840
Do you think there's another intention there?

252
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,490
- What?
- Seo Do Guk...

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,360
It seems like the Chairwoman really loves him.

254
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,000
Maybe she wants him to come back to Taeja Group?

255
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,410
You're bringing up some strange things today.

256
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,940

258
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,140
I'm really nervous.

259
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,790
Why? About what?

260
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,110
Han Yi Joo thinks she's on top of the world.

261
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,270
She even asked Dad if she could have my gallery.

262
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,600
I think she wants to ruin me for good.

263
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,560
I'm sure she just said that out of spite.

264
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,160
Out of spite?

265
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,750
I mean, she was looked down upon at your home.

266
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,090
That's not looking down on her.

267
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,400
We just wanted everyone to know their place.

268
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,660
What?

269
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,090
Did my mom not feed her? Did she not let her go to school?

270
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:09,400
She's taking out her victim complex on me and you understand her?

271
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,270
No, I mean...

272
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,420
should I talk to Yi Joo about it?

273
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,720
Oppa, you still think about her, right?

274
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,780
- What?
- You can't be doing this to me.

275
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,290

280
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,900
Why would I be in a good mood?

281
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,350
You know it's hard to get the elders' approval right away. You should keep trying.

282
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,820
I know. I know that.

283
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,870
But when I think of seeing Han Yi Joo rub it in my face every time I go...

284
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,180
I didn't even tell you because I was so embarrassed.

285
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,500
You know what she told me?

286
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,280
"Who says I'm the fake one? Don't you dare."

287
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,960
Han Yi Joo said that?

288
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,420
Yeah. She said she was the real one.

289
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,340
Welcome.

290
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:37,140
The nursing home incident made it clear to her that you and the Chairman are working together.

291
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,160
She also suspects that you know about your birth origin.

292
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,710
I need to be careful.

293
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,460
Have you looked into Lee Jung Hye's past I asked about?

294
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,220
First, I'm tracking down Lee Geum Young, who was fired for poisoning you.

295
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,030
It's taking a while, but I'm pretty close.

296
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,450
You'd already started looking into it?

297
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,680
Something that could be Lee Jung Hye's weakness.

298
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,200
Why?

299
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,000
Let's talk about that later.

300
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,610
What about Grandpa? Does he like the new place?

301
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,010
He's complaining about the food being worse, so I think he's okay.

302
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,120
Got it. Please look after him.

303
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,910
Of course. Bye.

00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,460
Wait.

305
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,820
You got the painting, right? It was hard to secure.

306
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,170
So please take good care of it.

307
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,830
But how did you know I wanted that piece?

308
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,450
You were always looking at that painting at the gallery.

Wow. You really are a man with many sins.

317
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,660
Wait, that's putting it lightly.

318
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,040

- Maybe you can be the CEO, Sun Gwon.

"In the end"?

330

You thought I would end up doing that?

331
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,680

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,740
It was an attractive new prospect for us.

337
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,670
It's a rare opportunity to work on an entire apartment brand. And...

338

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,690
You must be hungry.

357
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,180
It's so good.

358
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,750
Do Guk, you are such a good cook.

359
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,880
Just now...

360
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,120
you ate without thinking.

361
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,500
What?

362
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,180
I'm proud of you, Han Yi Joo.

363
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,970
You did a good job.

364
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,310
For having a bite of food?

365
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,580
It was a hard thing for you.

366
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,870
What changed all of a sudden?

367
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,440
Do Guk.

368
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,820
Yeah?

369
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,450
I think Lee Jung Hye knows.

370
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,190
Knows what?

371
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,610
That I know that I'm the real daughter of that family.

372
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,110
I won't sit back.

373
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,900
I won't run away. I'll fight.

374
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,200
You might get hurt again.

375
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,940
Then I can heal here.

376
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,490
At home, the safest place in the world.

377
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,090
Eating delicious food that you cook.

378
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,210
What are you going to do, Do Guk?

379
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,030
- About what?
- Your brother.

380
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,850
He won't break off with Yoo Ra easily.

381
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,170
He believes you'll threaten his spot eventually.

382
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,840
I know that.

383
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,040
You can't just let that be.

384
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,140
What if you went back to Taeja Group, Do Guk?

385
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,450
That's ridiculous.

386
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,810
That's what I would have said before.

387
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,230
What?

388
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,620
Hello.

389
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,880
Hello.

390
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,180
Hello.

391
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,310
Do Guk, be careful. You might get hurt.

392
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,580
Hello!

393
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,420
- You're looking handsome.
- Thank you.

394
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,690
- Hi, Do Guk!
- Hello!

395
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,770
- Be careful.
- Okay!

396
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,370
Grandma!

397
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,830
Aigoo, Do Guk's here!

398
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,440
Do Guk, do you know what we're building right now?

399
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,700
Of course. It's an apartment.

400
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,540
Don't say it like that.

401
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,660
What happens in an apartment?

402
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,810
A place where people live?

403
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,600
That's right.

404
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,290
A place where you eat, sleep, and rest with your loved ones.

405
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,050
Home is where you coexist like that.

406
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:05,050
What kind of home one grows up in determines who they are.

407
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,500
Do you understand what I'm saying?

408
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,850
So you're doing something really important, Grandma.

409
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,920
What?

410
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,700
When I grow up, I want to do the work you do, Grandma.

411
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,890
Aigoo. Sure, sure.

412
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,230
You will for sure, Do Guk.

413
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,400
Do you see the tall thing over there?

414
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,920
It goes all the way up there, really high. Got that?

415
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:36,930
Taeja Group was like home to me.

416
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:44,420
But now, home is where I'm with you.

417
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,250
And to protect that,

418
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,060
I'll do anything.

419
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,940
- I'm home.
- You're late. Working late?

420
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,500
Gosh! You smell like alcohol.

421
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,700
If you get off work early, you should come home and help me.

422
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,770
I'm sorry.

423
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:30,960
Aigoo. I can't live like this.

424
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,080
The girl who chased you weaseled her way into marrying rich.

425
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:44,230
Don't be mean to Yi Joo.

426
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,160
- What?
- She's an innocent girl.

427
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,460
He did a number on her. She didn't know anything...

428
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,550
What a love of the century you got there.

429
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,890
Defending someone else's wife?

430
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,360
Aigoo! You should have treated her well when she was yours!

431
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,790
Aigoo.

432
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,960
Aigoo. I can't live like this.

433
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,080
Aigoo. Seriously.

434
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,300
- Mom, what is this?
- What?

435
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,430
You deserved to get smacked.

436
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,540
How can you take her side in front of Mom?

437
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,200
Get out of my room.

438
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,390
My gosh. Want my help?

439
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,510
If you get it together, I can avenge you.

440
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,370
I mean it! I just want 200,000 Won as payment.

441
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,580
No? Fine, what the heck. Then just 100,000 won...

442
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,470
What?

443
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,920
If you're here, come in.

444
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,320
Okay. I'll come down.

445
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,530
You want me to eat lunch alone?

446
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,470
You're an adult.

447
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,670
You can do it.

448
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,090
Can I eat with your wife, too?

449
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,760
It really sucks to be single!

450
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,860
Yes, Soo Mi, I'll be there soon.

451
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,540
If you're going to eat...

452
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,490
Enjoy your meal. I'll eat on my own.

453
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,980
It's been a while.

454
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,410
Yeah.

455
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,540
Are you here to see the CEO?

456
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,950
Yes.

457
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,360
How have you been?

458
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,400
- What are you doing?
- Just tell me one thing.

459
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,520
Did you really marry CEO Seo because you love him?

460
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,840
That's not it, right? That's why you can't answer, right?

461
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,440
No.

462
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,930
- I love him very much.
- What?

463
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,540
I just don't want to talk about it because it's not your business.

464
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,000
Why do I have to tell you how much I love my husband?

465
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,810
I agree with my wife.

466
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:49,350
We can talk about that when it's just the two of us.

467
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,060
Right, Honey?

468
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,440
Mr. Yoo, don't approach my wife from now on.

469
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,590
If this happens again, I won't let it slide.

470
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,610
Aren't you going to answer me?

471
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:18,490
Yes. I got it, sir.

472
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,930
Were we all supposed to get together today?

473
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,680
I thought it was just us.

474
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,910
It's urgent. We had no choice.

475
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,210
Urgent?

476
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,360
What is this, you guys?

477
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,930
[Marriage Contract]

478
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,240
- How did you...
- Separate finances?

479
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,500
No interfering in each others' private lives?

480
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,170
It looks like a contract.

481
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,000
It is a contract, Mother.

482
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,550
That's why there are dates and signatures.

483
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,460
This was all planned from the start.

484
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,590
The two of them schemed and toyed with us while pretending to love each other.

485
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,790
Is that true?

486
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,520
Why would you do such a thing? Huh?

487
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,550
Forgive us, but we think we know the reason why.

488
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,420
You could say it's a business deal.

489
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,070
Do Guk gains his grandmother's trust and gets her investment.

490
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,780
My sister escapes the home she despises.

491
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:09,000
The home that adopted her, an orphan, and raised her until now.

492
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,440
You guys tell us yourselves! Why did you do this?

493
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,070
I'm sorry.

494
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,810
Nobody asked for an apology.

495
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,920
Give us an explanation.

496
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,720
Mother!

497
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,020
Mother!

498
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,510
Grandma. Grandma!

499
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:44,440
How is my mother doing?

500
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,810
How is Grandma doing? Is she all right?

501
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,540
She's asleep.

502
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,540
Go home, all of you.

503
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,120
Father!

504
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,150
Please listen to us.

505
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,860
We may have started that way, but not anymore.

506
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,990
We love and care for each other a lot.

507
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:26,100
Yi Joo is not the kind of person to tell empty lies. You know that.

508
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,580
I have nothing else to say to you. Go.

509
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,270
Father!

510
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,810
Too bad your plans are all thwarted.

511
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,110
You went as far as to dig through someone else's home. And say what?

512
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,230
Does blaming me make you feel better?

513
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,650
What?

514
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,540
You're the one who took advantage of our parents' trust.

515
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,460
Isn't that the root of the problem?

516
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,870
Seo Jung Wook, you two aren't innocent, either.

517
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,550
- What?
- You wanted to crush us by any means.

518
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:19,670
You invaded our home just so you could find something on us.

519
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,120
You're so shameless, Unni.

520
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,990
Yelling at us when you're the one who committed fraud-

521
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,350
Shut up! Who said you can run your mouths here?

522
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,380
You're awake.

523
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,530
How could I not wake up with that loud voice of yours?

524
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,700
You must be very disappointed in the kids.

525
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,560
Well, I wonder exactly what I'm disappointed in.

526
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,870
The fact that they did something strange, like make a contract?

527
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:16,580
Or that the other two somehow dug it up and brought it here?

528
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:23,370
When Do Guk wanted to leave this house,

529
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:27,750
I was sad, but secretly I also thought...

530
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,950
maybe the two of them can stop fighting now.

531
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:39,420
If we separate them, they'll get along someday.

532
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,940
But...

533
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,650
I finally realized it today.

534
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,420
How foolish that thought was.

535
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,430
We promised to fight together.

536
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,930
So you have to eat well.

537
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,680
[Cooking Class Teacher]

538
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,450
Yi Joo, you're coming to class today, right?

539
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,550
Is my mother-in-law coming?

540
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,700
She didn't say she wasn't coming.

541
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,970
Did something happen?

542
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,760
No. I'll see you later, Teacher.

543
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,720
Here!

544
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,770
Yoo Ra, you look like you're in a good mood.

545
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,980
I guess so.

546
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,480
Should we go shopping, then?

547
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,220
They must have a lot of new stuff right now.

548
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,800
Show me first.

549
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,990
You said you had something on Han Yi Joo. What is it?

550
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:39,380
Whoa, girl. You're really curious, aren't you?

551
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,900
- What is this?
- Just look.

552
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,120
It's all ready to go.

553
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,380
You just need to say yes. What do you think?

554
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:06,910
A fake marriage with some dirty intentions.

555
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,970
A perfect double whammy.

556
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,490
Hyungnim!

557
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,050
What is it? You didn't even knock.

558
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:19,580
Hyungnim, I mean, CEO. Something has gone very wrong.

559
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Daughter-in-law of Taeja Group. Exposing Han Yi Joo's messy private life!

560
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,330
To put it simply, Han Yi Joo cannot live without a man.

561
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,500
She dumped a man she was set to marry in a month

562
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,460
and met someone new right away and even married him.

563
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,080
Plus, he's the CEO of the company where the old guy works.

564
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,390
I mean, how can a human being do that?

565
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:46,650
His mother was on her knees, begging and saying this would kill her son.

566
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,570
But she mocked and shoved her to the ground.

567
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,100
She went for the new guy for his money.

568
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,670
I can tell she's pretty, even though it's blurry.

569
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,790
That's why men go crazy for her.

570
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,630
Who cares if she's pretty? She's human trash.

571
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,920
I'd never go near a woman like that.

572
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,760
The ex must be in such shock.

573
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,910
Maybe she'll get kicked out of Taeja Group.

574
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,210
He really got mixed up with a crazy bitch.

575
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,790
Oppa, did you see what's online?

576
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,710
I should be a professional writer, right?

577
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,570
Yoo Se Hee, are you crazy?

578
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,410
My colleagues didn't know about this, and you...

579
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,100
I blurred out the faces.

580
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,810
People need such details to believe the story.

581
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,110
Take this down right now.

582
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,050
If you don't, I...

583
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,530
Hello? Hey, Yoo Se Hee! Yoo Se Hee!

584
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,610
Isn't this about Mr. Yoo?

585
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,400
Really? Is it true?

586
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,460
But why did that woman break it off with Mr. Yoo?

587
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,920
She dumped him when a more eligible guy came along.

588
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,700
Anyhow, it's amazing.

589
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,380
She was boy-crazy in high school, too. I guess marriage doesn't change a person.

590
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:59,530
What? Sunbae, you went to school with the CEO's wife?

591
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,870
Oh, didn't I mention that?

592
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:06,430
I mean, I only recognized her at the wedding, too. Shocking.

593
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,240
Seriously? She was like that back then?

594
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,160
She was going out with multiple guys at once. No joke.

595
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,370
She didn't come across like that to me.

596
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:22,340
Hey, how would you know? You only met her briefly.

597
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,530
Doesn't this also mean that our CEO has weird taste in women?

598
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,240
No, I think he's just more naive than you might think.

599
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:36,270
If someone like her decides to seduce a guy, it's game over.

600
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,380
- This is what happened in school.
- What happened?

601
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,700
How many guys was she seeing at once?

602
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,120
That I don't know.

603
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,630
The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep...

604
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,750
She's still not picking up.

605
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,850
What should we do?

606
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,830
We need to confirm with her if it's true before acting.

607
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,920
Confirm if it's true?

608
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,170
It's completely fake.

609
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,900
[010-0842-9230]

610
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,470
This is Seo Do Guk.

611
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,950
Are you with Han Yi Joo right now?

612
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,280
It's urgent.

613
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,320
Who is this? If you don't reveal yourself, I won't talk.

614
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,040
It's Kim Ji Won.

615
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,080
CEO Lee Jung Hye's secretary.

616
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,710
Who did you just say you were?

617
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:28,110
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

618
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:53,340
What's going on? Are you and your daughter-in-law in a fight?

619
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,100
A fight? No need for that.

620
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,910
Sure. Sounds like it's over.

621
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,440
Good for you.

622
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,550
Divorce isn't even a huge flaw these days.

623
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,600
- What?
- A guy like Do Guk is going to be okay.

624
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,040
Want me to find some nice second-wife candidates?

625
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,200
You think divorce is easy? Want me to make your son a divorcé first?

626
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,400
Don't bring up my happily married son?

627
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,490
Everyone here knows your son basically lives at bars.

628
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,300
- Does Prosecutor Min know that, too?
- Geez! Hey, you!

629
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,880
- Gu Bong Ja, let this go.
- How dare you speak to me like that?

630
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,610
I will kill you with my hands today. Did you see that?

631
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,870
- Let go!
- Don't you dare mess with me!

632
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,250
Let it go, Madam Gu!

633
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,460
Mind your own business!

634
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,940
Want me to call the cops and show them this video?

635
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,410
Mother, are you okay?

636
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,340
You want to threaten me, you adoptee?

637
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,010
You think anyone's going to believe you?

638
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,490
We'll have to see about that.

639
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,630
- What?
- You heard Mother.

640
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,550
One word from an adoptee and your son might be divorced-

641
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,530
How dare you!

642
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,200
- Who do you think I am?
- I just gave back what I got.

643
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,740
Oh! Oh! You filmed me illegally.

644
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,660
That's a crime, you know.

645
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,640
I could sue you.

646
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,590
Illegal?

647
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,980
That one isn't.

648
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:34,860
You hit first, Madam Gu. That should be evidence for assault.

649
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:38,720
Teacher! I can explain.

650
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,690
This bitch picked a fight with me first.

651
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:45,260
I think you should stop coming to my class.

652
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,510
Or do you want to make a bigger deal out of this?

653
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:49,910
I mean...

654
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,850
Fine! Shit! This is such bullshit.

655
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:00,460
Before you go, you should apologize.

656
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,630
- What?
- Apologize to my mother-in-law properly.

657
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:07,400
If not, I'm not going to stay still.

658
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,150
Who asked you to jump in and take a hit for me?

659
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,930
You thought I'd be grateful?

660
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,830
Don't meddle and do stuff like that.

661
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,210
It's not going to change my mind.

662
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:38,620
It's a hard thing to win someone over.

663
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,270
Especially when you had it and then lost it.

664
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,220
You know that, and you did such a thing?

665
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,300
A contractual marriage? A year term limit?

666
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,440
Is that why you said yes to my request?

667
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,870
Even if you can't get Do Guk to join Taeja, you can just break up?

668
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:58,840
I may not have liked you at first, but I warmed up to you. But you!

669
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,800
Never mind.

670
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,140
It's too late.

671
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,430
Mother, I was in the same boat. I...

672
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:17,670
She had to survive.

673
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:22,070
You don't know how Yi Joo was treated by them after being adopted.

674
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,950
Do Guk.

675
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,420
She still can't easily eat food someone else makes for her.

676
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:32,570
Someone in that house poisoned her food when she was young, and she passed out.

677
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,410
What did you say?

678
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,710
Look at this.

679
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,930
What the heck is this?

680
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,890
Lee Jung Hye paid Yi Joo's ex, Yoo Se Hyeok's mother, to do this on camera.

681
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:54,480
Han Yoo Ra and that woman's daughter schemed to post it on the internet.

682
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:58,100
"Exposing Han Yi Joo's messy private life"?

683
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,600
They would do such a disgusting thing? People who call themselves family?

684
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:05,750
They are hell-bent on destroying Yi Joo by any means.

685
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:10,940
We can't let those people get away with this kind of thing. Don't you think?

686
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,900
But this doesn't make what you two did go away.

687
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,460
The situation is really serious right now.

688
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,210
Your grandmother and father may be hard to win back.

689
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,140
Please help me, Mother.

690
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,650
- Do Guk...
- This is only the...

691
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,820
second favor I'm asking you in my life.

692
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,680
This time, say yes. Please.

693
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,860
It's not time to just sit here and listen to you two.

694
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,170
I need to meet her myself.

695
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:49,080
That's why I said she was inadequate for the Taeja Group from the start.

696
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,180
And now here we are.

697
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,690
I'm ashamed.

698
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,560
I don't quite understand.

699
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,920
Excuse me?

700
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,400
You care so much about what other people can see.

701
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,800
Your daughter might get kicked out for toying around with men.

702
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,600
You look even a little excited.

703
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,100
How could you say that?

704
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:23,020
I'm just trying to look stoic as an elder of the family.

705
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,030
Sure.

706
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:29,130
An elder should step up to correct what's wrong.

707
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:42,080
So, you agree that your son and my daughter should break up, right?

708
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,540
Yes.

709
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,900
I'll prepare the divorce papers right away.

710
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,830
Or should I move Yi Joo's things out first?

711
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,170
Hold on. What do you...

712
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:55,820
Oh, right. I didn't mean Do Guk.

713
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,490
I was talking about Jung Wook and Han Yoo Ra.

714
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,260
Pardon?

715
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,120
You want to leave the two of them alone?

716
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,880
- Yes.
- They lied to their families.

717
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,300
Their entire marriage was a grotesque sham.

718
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,310
Are you not even angry, In-law?

719
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,590
Angry? Of course, I was angry.

720
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:24,550
But I didn't want to just grant the wishes of people who want them divorced.

721
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,330
Besides, I'm not completely unrelated to the situation.

722
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,660
What do you mean?

723
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,210
I told Yi Joo this.

724
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,490
If she could bring Do Guk back to Taeja Group within six months,

725
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:35,800
I'd give my blessing for her marriage.

726
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:43,260
So, what I mean is that I also made a deal with that marriage.

727
00:55:54,950 --> 00:56:00,290
♫ Now I can see my halo ♫

728
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:04,850
♫ You can't cover up my mind ♫

729
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:10,120
♫ Now I can see my halo ♫

730
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:18,300
♫ Everything in red, and I'm not going back to who I was before ♫

731
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,990
♫ I can't be hurt no more ♫

[Perfect Marriage Revenge]

733
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,160
Jung Wook's mother is no ordinary woman. Can you win?

734
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,510
Take down Han Yi Joo.

735
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:37,810
News will break soon.

736
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,380
Hanwool will fail to acquire Savings Bank.

737
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,940
- Ever since she was planning the marriage...
- Honey!

738
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,810
Yi Joo wanted to ruin us.

739
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,750
Maybe she's using this time to scheme.

740
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,320
I found her.

741
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,010
My real mother?

742
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,110
Yi Joo, is it you?

743
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,770
You dare to grovel back to this house?

744
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:58,800
You want to die by my hand?
