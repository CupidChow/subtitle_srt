00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,470
I heard the families weren't a match anyway.

178
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,660
I don't think so. He just told us he's getting married.

179
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,900
No, I hear a lot of couples break up on their honeymoon.

180
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,200
What's the big deal with a breakup?

181
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,280
It's all talk, talk, talk...

182
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,210
No comment from me.

183
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,200
What? Did something really happen?

184
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,460
- This is Yoo Se Hyeok-
- Hello, Mr. Yoo, it's the bridal shop at Tembledon Hotel.

185
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,060
How have you been?

186
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,120
I'm calling to confirm the final dress fitting tomorrow.

187
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,030
What? A fitting?

188
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:57,780
Yes, the appointment is at three under the name Han Yi Joo.

189
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,740
You'll be accompanying her, right?

190
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,300
Um... yes.

191
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,150
Yes. Got it.

192
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,650
[Invitation to Seo Do Guk and Han Yi Joo's Wedding]

193
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,220
You printed these so quickly. Impressive.

194
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,610
The ceremony will be simple.

195
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,160
We can live together at my place, so no need for a registry.

196
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,440
Great. Very reasonable.

197
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,890
Fitting for Taeja Group.

198
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,210
You're coming to the wedding, right?

199
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,490
What do you mean? Of course. We're family.

200
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,490
I'm sorry. It's just so funny.

201
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,640
Unni, you hate us.

202
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,110
But you want us to be at the ceremony?

203
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,320
Why? Are you worried it'll be empty?

204
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,480
Han Yoo Ra! Where are your manners in front of a guest?

205
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,430
It's no use holding onto grown children.

206
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,600
Yi Joo is taken care of, so you can work on Yoo Ra now.

207
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,380
- What?
- Yookyung Group's second son is back from the US.

208
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,010
They plan to have him stay and train him for business. So, that's good.

209
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,510
I'll set it up for this weekend, so go out with her.

210
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,600
You want Yoo Ra to go on a blind date?

211
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,190
What? Is there a problem?

212
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,550
My appetite is gone.

213
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,910
What?

214
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,520
I should lose weight.

215
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,010
To get ready for the blind date my dad set up for me.

216
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,340
I have a friend's birthday party that day.

217
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,580
I know I should catch your bouquet, Unni. But can't make it.

218
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,640
I know you don't have any friends.

219
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,430
I'm sorry.

220
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,700
Did you really need to do that to Yoo Ra in front of Seo Do Guk?

221
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,090
She hasn't even healed!

222
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,870
This is your fault, you know?

223
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,460
- What?
- The way you raised your child.

224
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,270
I was humiliated in front of my future son-in-law.

225
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,360
She is so immature for her age because you overprotect her.

226
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,000
Besides, you're not even paying attention to work.

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,060
I don't know where your head is at these days.

228
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,880
Do you think you even deserve to be an executive?

229
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,870
Being an executive sounds nice, but I'm a contractor in reality.

230
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,920
- What?
- Speaking of,

231
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,470
when the Savings Bank acquisition goes through, I want a CEO position.

232
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,860
Then, make Yoo Ra head the gallery. How great would that look?

233
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,280
You know family is the only thing we can depend on.

234
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,960
Really?

235
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,660
Then, I'll give that position to Yi Joo.

236
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,730
What did you say?

237
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,060
Our son-in-law might be leading the Taeja Group one day.

238
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,980
His wife should have a leadership role somewhere.

239
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,980
She happens to paint, too. The gallery would be perfect.

240
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,190
You're just saying that, right?

241
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,230
Okay, fine. You win.

242
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,310
I'll make sure Yoo Ra's date goes well.

243
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,410
I wish you said that from the start.

244
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,860
What the heck...

245
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,460
Oh, is your medication still working?

246
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,410
I heard there's something better. I was thinking of switching.

247
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,690
Do whatever you want.

248
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,230
Yes, Honey. I will take care of it.

249
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,280
Like I always have.

250
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,690
This is where you made the appointment?

251
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,930
Secretary Byeon said this place is the best. Why?

252
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,600
You said you can always fire your secretary, right?

253
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,330
What?

254
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,530
I'm joking.

255
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,340
But this place is a little...

256
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,230
Mr. Seo!

257
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,300
Mr. Seo! Oh, Mr. Seo!

258
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,120
Oh, my! Oh, my goodness!

259
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,030
Oh, my God, is the sun setting east?

260
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,060
My Mr. Seo is getting married? Finally?

261
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,190
Oh, my, this is so daebak!

262
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,510
Congratulations!

263
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,180
Oh, my...

264
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,110
Daebak.

265
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,740
Let's go inside. It's so hot.

266
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,480
Come in.

267
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,220
I'm so sorry.

268
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,470
Sir, we must have entered the wrong name for the appointment.

269
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,980
We apologize for making you come all this way.

270
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,590
So, you're saying that Yi Joo didn't make the appointment?

271
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,860
No.

272
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,330
Apologize now.

273
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,810
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,500
This was all my fault. I'm so sorry.

275
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,080
Okay, then.

276
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,800
I think...

277
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,960
it's so beautiful.

278
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
You're the professional. What do you think?

279
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,130
Well, my professional opinion...

280
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,320
The silhouette is perfect. The model is flawless.

281
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,400
But the bride's facial expression is a bit dark.

282
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,250
- Why aren't you smiling?
- Sorry?

283
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,230
Gosh, seriously! Hello, bride!

284
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,230
The bride is the main character of the wedding.

285
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,420
The day you promise forever with the one you love.

286
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,150
Just follow me.

287
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:26,880
All right! Today, I am the happiest girl in the world.

288
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,260
Do Guk...

289
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,000
Just do it. You can do it!

290
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,620
I'm happy!

291
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,960
Happy!

292
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,870
Happy!

293
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,480
Se Hyeok...

294
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,720
S-Sir!

295
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,440
It wasn't enough to marry another man?

296
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,270
You had to pick the same bridal shop?

297
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,470
It wasn't like that. It was a coincidence-

298
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,530
You don't need to make excuses.

299
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:14,230
Honestly, when I saw you just now in the dress, I hated you.

300
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,270
Wow. You're really going to do this to me?

301
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,690
Mock me this hard?

302
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,580
I thought, "I don't need to feel sorry anymore."

303
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,740
I thought, "I'm the one who should be angry."

304
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,900
Stay away, Mr. Yoo.

305
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,120
But I don't need to.

306
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,000
You don't look happy at all.

307
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,400
You were so excited getting ready to marry me.

308
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,830
You're standing there like you're being sold off somewhere.

309
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,310
Why do I need to curse you?

310
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,460
I think...

311
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,070
you've already said enough malicious words.

312
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,570
Malicious words, CEO?

313
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,510
My most precious childhood friend and my boss are getting married.

314
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,660
I wish you two the best of luck.

315
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,840
Yi Joo!

316
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,980
I wish you happiness.

317
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,800
I don't know if you will be able to, though.

318
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,130
Be honest. You don't wish happiness for that marriage, do you?

319
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,950
Why wouldn't I? It's my own brother's marriage.

320
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,620
I figured it wouldn't be ideal from your position.

321
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,100
I don't know what Do Guk did to displease you,

322
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,490
but since they're getting married, please try to like him.

323
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,180
Isn't it an opportunity for Hanwool Group to get a pretty good son-in-law?

324
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,210
Even though it might be the contrary for you?

325
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,380
What is it you want to say?

326
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,750
Take a look at this photo first.

327
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,600
My father-in-law handed that over to Chairwoman Lee Tae Ja.

328
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,190
What is this?

329
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,600
All the interest he collected from the Chairwoman.

330
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,110
About 20 billion won?

331
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,740
According to the cafe owner, he was on his knees begging.

332
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,750
"I'll give back all your money. Let your grandson marry my granddaughter."

333
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,590
- What did you say?
- That's not the end.

334
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:40,360
He spent 10 billion won more to buy a painting for Chairwoman Lee Tae Ja.

335
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:55,460
[Bank transfers]
He even took out money from his non-taxable accounts, opened in his acquaintances' names.

336
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,210
What do you think this all means?

337
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:03,120
My father-in-law does not do anything that loses money.

338
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,370
The fact that he spent over 30 billion means he stands to gain more... no...

339
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,550
there is something much bigger to gain from this marriage.

340
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,680
So...

341
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,180
what do you think that is?

342
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,770
I'm not sure.

343
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:27,180
Perhaps Taeja Group? The thing you want to protect the most?

344
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,720
What?

345
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,320
You don't look happy at all.

346
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,260
This is Han Yi Joo.

347
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,740
It's Seo Jung Wook. I think we definitely need to meet.

348
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,930
All right.

349
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,840
Where should I meet you?

350
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,410
CEO Lee, I heard you're about to be in-laws with Taeja Group.

351
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,930
Yes. It worked out that way.

352
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,930
Congratulations.

353
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,450
I know the construction industry isn't what it used to be,

354
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,450
but Taeja Group is very solid.

355
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,220
If Yoo Ra and Jae Yeop are a match,

356
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,510
the synergy would be incredible.

357
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,550
Long time no see, Jae Yeop. It's been three years.

358
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,180
Wow...

359
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,070
Your style has become more daring.

360
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,990
Really?

361
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,520
Looks like you're more of a partier.

362
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,850
What? A partier?

363
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,290
Yoo Ra, say hello to his mother.

364
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,660
Hi, Ahjumma.

365
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,440
What?

366
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,350
Ahjumma?

367
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,590
That's what we called you when we were little.

368
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,820
What's wrong with it?

369
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,300
Well, I know this is a setup between two nobodies.

370
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,030
- But isn't it rude to act like this to my face?
- Nobodies?

371
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,150
That's you.

372
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,320
Not me.

373
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,680
Yoo Ra, stop.

374
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,450
Jae Yeop, you, too. Okay?

375
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,950
What is this?

376
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,900
Where are your manners?

377
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,790
I see. Manners?

378
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,100
That reminds me.

379
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,400
Ahjumma, you remember Se Young, right? Mayoung Corporation president's daughter.

380
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,360
Se Young?

381
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,770
Didn't she volunteer at church with you at school?

382
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:19,400
Yes. I heard Se Young, Jae Yeop, and

383
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,720
Se Young's boyfriend did it last week.

384
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,680
- What?
- Hey, Han Yoo Ra!

385
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,030
Shut your mouth.

386
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,210
So, what did the three of you do?

387
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,070
Yoo Ra, stop this right now.

388
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,130
Who knows. What would it be?

389
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,820
Why don't you tell her before she imagines something way worse?

390
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,460
Are you crazy or something? Shit!

391
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,370
What is this?

392
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,040
Who the hell are you?

393
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,390
Oh, my, Jae Yeop! Are you okay?

394
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,890
Hello again.

395
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,240
Right.

396
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,290
Are you following me by chance?

397
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,070
What do you mean?

398
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,570
Shit!

399
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,910
What? You want to fight?

400
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,860
You think you could?

401
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,520
CEO Lee, I'm never buying a painting from you again.

402
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,360
The two of you, stay out of my sight.

403
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,130
Got it?

404
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,410
Ma'am!

405
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,420
Excuse me, thank you for your help...

406
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,570
I thought you didn't want to meet.

407
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,610
What changed your mind?

408
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,820
You're the one who insisted on meeting.

409
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,530
I thought we might understand each other.

410
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,800
Maybe because we're in a similar situation.

411
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,080
Similar situation?

412
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,300
No family, no home. That kind of situation?

413
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,270
My parents divorced when I was very young.

414
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,950
Then, my stepmother came into the picture right away.

415
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,740
She had Do Guk, then Do Na.

416
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,820
In that house, I was half the person the others were.

417
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,680
Only I had a different mother.

418
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:52,490
I didn't come here to share stories about our backgrounds.

419
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,220
Then you must be curious about what happened to my leg.

420
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,980
Seo Do Guk must've given you an idea...

421
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,670
Did you come out because you couldn't believe him?

422
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,240
Because you want to hear the truth?

423
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,890
What are you doing?

424
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,100
I don't think Do Guk would do such a thing.

425
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,800
It's just that I wanted to hear from someone directly involved in the incident.

426
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,260
But I don't like your attitude.

427
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,560
Trying to manipulate a person on the sly.

428
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,080
That already tells me I shouldn't trust anything you say.

429
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,600
Han Yi Joo.

430
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,450
Why are you getting married?

431
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,200
Hanwool and H-Terier.

432
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,710
A wealthy company and a company that needs money.

433
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:56,560
It's not a bad match, but why is Hanwool so desperate... I mean...

434
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:02,500
why is Chairman Han Woon Jae offering bribes to make it happen?

435
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,440
What do you mean?

436
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,390
If you mean the painting he gifted to the Generous Person Foundation...

437
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,310
I don't care about a painting.

438
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:19,250
If someone like Chairman Han Woon Jae returned all the interest he received,

439
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,170
he must have a clear objective.

440
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:27,290
It would be good for us to lay our cards on the table and find a way to work together.

441
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,430
Interest?

442
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,720
What are you talking about?

443
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,890
Look, Han Yi Joo.

444
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,300
Get away from her. Now.

445
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,290
- Do Guk.
- What is this?

446
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,830
I told you to take your time so we could talk.

447
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,440
You dirty rat. Who knows what you'd be plotting?

448
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,970
I need to put up an iron-clad defense, no?

449
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,550
See?

450
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:03,540
Calling his hyung a rat because he wants to see his future sister-in-law.

451
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,570
Why would he do this if he wasn't guilty about something?

452
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,120
Shut your mouth.

453
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,500
Why?

454
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,610
If I don't, will you push me like you did then?

455
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,310
This time, make sure you kill me for real.

456
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,730
If not, I could run my mouth even worse.

457
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,520
Let go, let go!

458
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,760
Say that again! Let go!

459
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,380
Say that again. Say that again!

460
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,400
Let me go!

461
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Let go, I said! Let go!

462
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,570
Let go of me!

463
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,030
How dare you say that bullshit to me!

464
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,450
Say that again! Let me go! Let go!

465
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,620
Let go!

466
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,690
What?

467
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,790
You want to be set up with Seo Jung Wook?

468
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,780
- Why not?
- Of course, you can't!

469
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,610
You know, he's Seo Do Guk's...

470
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,490
I know. His older brother.

471
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,330
He's the official successor of Taeja Group.

472
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:21,500
Then he's above Seo Do Guk in status, in power.

473
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,820
That's the kind of guy I want.

474
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,600
What are you thinking of doing?

475
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,400
Something better than what you're thinking.

476
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,130
Let me know when you get a date.

477
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,060
Seo Jung Wook.

478
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,310
I told you not to meet with him.

479
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,280
That's the one thing I asked of you.

480
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,740
And you can't do it?

481
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,530
I wanted to help somehow. That's why I went.

482
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,360
I don't need your help, Han Yi Joo.

483
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,830
I'm fine. I told you I'm fine.

484
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,080
You're not fine at all.

485
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,500
He's the reason you can't go home and can't sleep.

486
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,170
Sometimes you can't even breathe. How is that resolved?

487
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,410
You're just avoiding it.

488
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,830
You want to know that badly?

489
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,580
Should I tell you everything?

490
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:44,490
Then, are you prepared to deal with what comes after?

491
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:45,800
What?

492
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,130
We...

493
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:55,130
can't just sit around joking and talking business.

494
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,560
It's going to get deeper.

495
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,400
It's going to be real.

496
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,960
You're telling me...

497
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,710
you're going to cross the line.

498
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,390
Don't you know?

499
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,320
I'm not saying that.

500
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,510
I just...

501
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,280
feel like you'll be in danger again.

502
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,750
See?

503
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,700
You're running away again.

504
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,180
Let me ask you, Han Yi Joo.

505
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:54,520
If you can't handle me, don't touch me.

506
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,500
I'm already...

507
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,810
holding back enough.

508
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,100
Manager Kim?

509
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,970
CEO Lee is investigating Chairman Han Woon Jae.

510
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,890
- What?
- You watch out, too, Miss Han.

511
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,380
Bye.

512
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:59,370
I must have lived a long time now.

513
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:05,560
Famous politicians and businesspeople have all been my regulars.

514
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,690
Yet you never came, but you've finally come.

515
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,560
Back then, I didn't have any questions.

516
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,900
But today...

517
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,240
I'm here because she asked.

518
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,000
Who is this girl?

519
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,570
Your most beloved customer who frequented this place.

520
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,070
She is Han Woon Jae's granddaughter.

521
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,700
Oh, I see.

522
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,290
What do you want to know about her that you came together?

523
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:40,670
What does this child mean to Han Woon Jae?

524
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:46,100
When his son was getting married, he said he needed to give back to society.

525
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:52,650
He allowed the marriage only if he adopted a child from an orphanage.

526
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,210
That is how she came into the family.

527
00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:00,160
Now, this girl wants to marry my grandson.

528
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,970
He came to see me, asking me not to disapprove.

529
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:06,900
With all the interest he got from me in his hands!

530
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,700
Watching him act like that gave me chills all over.

531
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,000
Chairwoman, you really hate Chairman Han.

532
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,080
Of course.

533
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,980
He chased after me for money so much that I thought about killing myself many times.

534
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,770
But he never blinked an eye.

535
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,200
Pardon me, but threats like "I don't have the money,"

536
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,630
"If you keep chasing me, I'll just kill myself."

537
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,490
Don't you think lenders hear that kind quite often?

538
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,720
- However...
- However?

539
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,680
The problem is that it does happen every once in a while.

540
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,980
People actually die.

541
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:49,040
Do you remember, Chairwoman?

542
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,610
The pregnant woman who died 25 years ago because of Chairman Han Woon Jae?

543
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:04,040
Her husband came home from work and found her hanging.

544
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,090
She was in her last month of pregnancy, carrying a whole child...

545
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,010
Aigoo, a private loan is so cruel.

546
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,790
H-Hey, who is this?

547
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,370
Excuse me.

548
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,160
Thank you for coming.

549
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,300
But how did you know my wife?

550
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,420
Oh, yes, I saw her here and there. Okay, then...

551
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,470
It's you, the loan shark. I saw you at the Myeongdong office.

552
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,090
Why are you here?

553
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,400
How dare you?

554
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,960
I was only...

555
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,740
trying to get the money I loaned back. I also came here to give it all back.

556
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,440
What? Give it back?

557
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,390
Please let me go...

558
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,970
Do you know how my child died?

559
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,940
She was 39 weeks old.

560
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:19,350
If she had been born today, she could have lived without going to the NICU.

561
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:25,870
That child died in her dead mother's womb, writhing in agony.

562
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:29,430
She was murdered by you!

563
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,410
Please spare me! Please!

564
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,240
After that, Chairman Han came to ask me...

565
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,950
How could he stop this curse?

566
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,090
A-And?

567
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,210
The General said...

568
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,100
you must resolve the resentment of the unborn child.

569
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,310
If you adopt an orphaned girl and raise her well,

570
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,880
your fortune will return.

571
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,440
I think he wanted to return your money for the same reason.

572
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,740
"Is this deceased spirit going to drag me to hell, too?"

573
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:18,320
"I'll give back what I got. Please spare me!"

574
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,470
But...

575
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,000
she is alive, though.

576
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,960
I'm not sure about that.

577
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,920
From what I can see, she's not dead or alive.

578
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,600
Mad. She is a mad woman.

579
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,200
I shouldn't have brought you here.

580
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,700
I'm the one who asked you to tell me everything you know about my grandfather.

581
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,320
Are you really okay?

582
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,900
To be honest...

583
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,550
I wasn't sure why my grandfather was doing so much for me.

584
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,150
I guess he was scared of what I might say.

585
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,980
I feel like I can ask him more questions now.

586
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,630
Thanks to you, Chairwoman.

587
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:20,260
I had said pity is not something one should feel for a future daughter-in-law.

588
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,840
I suppose I'm no different.

589
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,910
Chairwoman?

590
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,460
Chairwoman? How impersonal!

591
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,410
Call me Grandmother from now on.

592
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,610
- Chairwoman...
- Not again!

593
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,510
I know what you mean, Grandmother.

594
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:42,960
Let's go.

595
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,610
What are you doing? Hurry up!

596
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,060
Yes.

597
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,540
Where are you?

598
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,730
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

599
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,510
- I ate with Grandmother.
- Who?

600
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,980
The Chairwoman.

601
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,400
She told me to call her Grandmother from now on.

602
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,300
- We went on a date today.
- What's the occasion?

603
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,410
You know...

604
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,530
I owe you an apology, Do Guk.

605
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,330
I was careless.

606
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:49,510
Telling you to stop evading, while not knowing anything.

607
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,360
So, I want to lead by example.

608
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,450
I'll stop running away.

609
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,110
I'll confront it head-on.

610
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,540
That's the only way I can save...

611
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,420
myself and you, Do Guk.

612
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,070
What are you talking about? Where are you right now?

613
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:07,020
I need to meet someone.

614
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,420
I'll call you later.

615
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,300
You're okay, right?

616
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,960
Okay. Call me. Please.

617
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,970
[Invitation to Seo Do Guk and Han Yi Joo's Wedding]
Wow, my Yi Joo is really getting married.

618
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,120
It's all thanks to you, Grandfather.

619
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,390
I promise I'll pay you back for the painting.

620
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:34,470
Don't worry. It wasn't much.

621
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,630
Wait one second.

622
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:41,620
I have a gift for you. Let's see...

623
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,440
What are you giving me this time?

624
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,630
Get excited.

625
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:49,680
Grandpa,

626
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,240
you don't need to feel like you owe me.

627
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,490
What did you say?

628
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,420
What I mean is...

629
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,610
you should mourn the deceased and her child.

630
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,730
I can't replace them.

631
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,200
I know that.

632
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,560
But I ended up committing such a grave sin against you.

633
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,140
Here it is.

634
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,620
Here.

635
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,900
- What is this?
- You and your mother.

636
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,160
Your mother gave me this photograph.

637
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,440
I had it tucked away and found it just now.

638
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,510
Take a good look at your face.

639
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:49,910
Your mother and Jin Woong, exactly half and half.

640
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:53,470
What...

641
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,250
What do you mean...

642
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,880
Yi Joo.

643
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,570
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

644
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,620
Yi Joo.

645
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,900
- Are you all right?
- Father, it's me.

646
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,010
Open the door, please.

647
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,910
Yi Joo, hide yourself somewhere.

648
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,900
Get me the key to this room. Now!

649
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,020
Oh, hello.

650
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,600
I just woke up.

651
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,410
You're sleeping well.

652
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:41,340
You must be feeling good these days.

653
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,310
I've been getting exercise lately.

654
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,280
But...

655
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,110
what brings you here?

656
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:54,500
I heard you recently met with Chairwoman Tae Ja.

657
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,690
You even asked her for help in getting Yi Joo married.

658
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,830
How did you...

659
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,330
Why did you do that?

660
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:11,790
W-What do you mean why? Of course, I should.

661
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,080
My granddaughter wants to get married, and as a grandfather-

662
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,310
You kept your life through the loan games. You want to throw it away now?

663
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,040
- What?
- Be honest with me.

664
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,610
You want to switch teams, right? To Taeja Group.

665
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,240
If Seo Do Guk gets married,

666
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,990
you think he'll get back on the list to inherit the group.

667
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:45,330
That's why you're all in on Han Yi Joo's marriage.

668
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,300
But...

669
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,040
that's not going to happen.

670
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,910
Why...

671
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,500
why do you think so?

672
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,230
Because we're going to bet on his brother.

673
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:05,870
Rather than the younger brother who left to start his own company...

674
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:09,510
I think the older brother who's holding steady is more likely to win.

675
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:14,250
It might be better for you to be on our side.

676
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,010
Fine, Jung Hye. You're right!

677
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:40,120
Of course. You'll be the one who's going to visit my grave.

678
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,690
It's only right that I listen to you.

679
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,540
You are surprisingly reasonable today.

680
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:53,290
Then, will you give Yoo Ra the shares you're holding?

681
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,690
Sure, I should.

682
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,600
Why don't you schedule a board meeting?

683
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,300
Let's get it all done in one fell swoop.

684
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,180
Great idea.

685
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:09,530
Then, please don't tell Yi Joo things she doesn't need to know.

686
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,150
Can I trust you?

687
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:13,530
Things she doesn't need to know?

688
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:19,610
For example, "Yi Joo, you are our family's real offspring."

689
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:22,840
"You are your father's real daughter."

690
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,460
Things like that.

691
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,700
Jung Hye...

692
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,120
You knew everything?

693
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,140
Lower your voice, Father.

694
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:39,740
If someone were to hear, I would have to close their mouth shut, too.

695
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,630
Too much work.

696
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:05,000
Where did she go? She's not answering her phone...

697
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,750
Yes.

698
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,960
This is Seo Do Guk.

699
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,300
This is the police speaking. You are Han Yi Joo's emergency contact, correct?

700
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
What?

701
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,190
I got the phone call.

702
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,580
Yi Joo. What happened?

703
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,950
What's wrong? Huh?

704
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:23,000
We don't know, either. She won't say a word.

705
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:25,900
♫ To be loved, I guess it's not for me ♫
