10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,970
So, you agree that your son and my daughter should break up, right?

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,370
Yes.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,720
I'll prepare the divorce papers right away.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,710
Or should I move Yi Joo's things out first?

Hold on. What do you...

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,680
Oh, right. I didn't mean Do Guk.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,350
I was talking about Jung Wook and Han Yoo Ra.

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,100
Pardon?

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,920
You want to leave the two of them alone?

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,750
- Yes.
- They lied to their families.

20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,140
Their entire marriage was a grotesque sham.

21
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,180
Are you not even angry, In-law?

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,360
Angry? Of course, I was angry.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,430
But I didn't want to just grant the wishes of people who want them divorced.

24
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,140
Besides, I'm not completely unrelated to the situation.

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,440
What do you mean?

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,060
I told Yi Joo this.

27
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,440
If she could bring Do Guk back to Taeja Group within six months,

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,660
I'd give my blessing for her marriage.

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:44,170
So, what I mean is that I also made a deal with that marriage.

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,710
You seem very shocked.

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, because...

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,580
I didn't know you'd show such blatant favoritism for your child.

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,110
What do you mean by that...

34
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:13,510
You must consider the one you gave birth to as your only child.

35
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,250
But that is what you're implying.

36
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,770
Passing over the firstborn who worked hard all this time,

37
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,440
you want to put the one who left in the successor's seat?

42
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,200
Are you trying to fight me?

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,950
You started the fight.

"Stepmothers are going to be stepmothers, after all."

Yes, I'm fine.

108

I know that my wife and I caused you much concern.

109
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,330
I apologize.

110
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,980
I'm sorry as well.

111
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,320
I feel like I brought turmoil to a peaceful home. I feel bad.

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,610
But I hope you can consider the position Yoo Ra and I are in.

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,090
I'm sorry, but...

116
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,080
I need to touch on one more thing.

117
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:30,240
I thought it was strange that Mother accepted Yi Joo so willingly.

118
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,890
I heard you presented her with terms for her marriage.

119
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,860
Convince Do Guk to join Taeja Group within six months.

120
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,520
What kind of nonsense is this?

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,470
That's not true, is it?

122
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,120
It's all in the past.

123
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,800
I never thought it would happen, anyway.

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,740
So you just want to bury it?

125
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,070
- That you tried to take me down?
- What?

126
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,830
Twenty years ago, I fell off the boat because of your son, and now I can't use my leg.

127
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,450
Now, thanks to you, I might fall off my spot as the successor.

128
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,830
What am I supposed to do?

129
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,980
Mother and son sticking together.

130
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,580
I don't have a shot here, do I?

131
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,760
You can't help your mouth...

132
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,460
but bring that up again, huh?

133
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,860
What?

134
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:48,600
This video was taken 20 years ago at the accident scene inside the boat.

135
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,330
It has crystal-clear audio, too.

136
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,000
What do you... We looked everywhere back then.

137
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,870
People who were birdwatching got it on their cameras.

138
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,470
They reached out to us after a while. Do Guk wanted me to share it...

139
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,140
but I hesitated.

140
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,800
I was scared that people would ask why I'm unearthing something that's quieted down.

141
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,800
Trying to argue whose fault it is when the kid can't even use his leg.

142
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,090
I thought people might say she's a stepmom, after all.

143
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,870
You think Do Guk and I are sticking together?

144
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,130
It's the opposite.

145
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,230
This is all because I ignored my son's pleas.

146
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,240
So what?

147
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,060
Are you suggesting we all watch this together here?

148
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,880
After all this time? For what?

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,170
So you want to bury it again?

150
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,790
Why?

151
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,850
For you?

152
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,710
Did I really push you that time?

153
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,470
"Why don't you just fall off and drown? I can't stand having you around."

154
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,300
You said that while you shoved me, and you slipped and fell, no?

155
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,230
It was 20 years ago.

156
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,200
I was too young. I panicked after what happened.

157
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,130
You can't remember?

158
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,570
Then, let's all take a look together.

159
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,170
- Mother!
- Everyone stop!

160
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,270
Give it to me.

161
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,910
Now!

162
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,690
Mother, why would you do that?

163
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,930
Do you understand what it took Do Guk to bring that here?

164
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,220
Mother!

165
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,060
- Grandma!
- Mother!

166
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,780
Grandma!

167
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,830
No matter how much I tell you to stop fighting,

168
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,880
you won't listen to an old woman.

169
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,250
It's no use.

170
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,560
So...

171
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,230
I'm going to try a new tactic.

172
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,310
Maybe you two must battle it out properly to end this fight.

173
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,340
Really figure out who's the winner.

174
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,610
Grandma, what do you mean?

175
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,270
Do Guk, come back to the company immediately.

176
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,730
Jung Wook, Do Guk, who will be the successor...

177
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,130
I will decide in a year. Got it?

178
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,850
That's what I wanted to discuss today.

179
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,300
Yes. I will come back to Taeja Group.

180
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,820
And...

181
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,210
I will compete with Hyung.

182
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,440
Jung Wook, you?

183
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,010
Yes, Grandma. As you wish.

184
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,290
I'm going to call a board meeting soon.

185
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,170
Regarding Seo Do Guk's appointment as Vice President.

186
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,040
Any way it could get thrown out?

187
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,470
No.

188
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,950
It's a request directly from the Chairwoman.

189
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,410
But even if it's just for show,

190
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,890
there will be a moment to prove that he's worthy of leading Taeja Constructions.

191
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,600
We just need to keep tarnishing his image until then.

192
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,420
Like he shoved himself into the role by force.

193
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,410
Got it. But...

194
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,330
I have a favor to ask.

195
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:49,070
Chairwoman Lee promised Chairman Han that the Savings Bank acquisition would go through.

196
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,400
Could you find out how that's going?

197
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,040
Hey, why don't you refute those comments?

198
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,730
I heard Yoo Se Hyeok's sister posted it.

199
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,000
I only know that through an insider tip.

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
There's a police investigation. As soon as there's a case, I'll respond.

201
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,380
But still, Taeja Group should be stepping forward first.

202
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,050
Do Guk's family is going through a lot these days.

203
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,560
Do Guk is having a hard time. I don't want to stress him out.

204
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,040
Su Jin, I'll call you back later.

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,260
When did you come home?

206
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,330
Just now.

207
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,590
- What are you doing?
- Let's eat.

208
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,960
You haven't eaten yet, right?

209
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,480
You must have eaten already. I can just snack on...

210
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,920
What?

211
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,860
Makes me so sad...

212
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,550
when I think about how you won't eat proper meals without me.

213
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,010
What?

214
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,280
I need you by my side to have an appetite, too.

215
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,600
What should I make? Mushroom and rice?

216
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,080
Sounds good.

217
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,470
Blahblah is going crazy, too.

218
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,460
Going back to Taeja Group in the middle of all this?

219
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,340
People say the wife is pushing him to go to a better company.

220
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,240
What should we do, Mr. Yoo?

221
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,150
- What?
- It's our job to take care of the risk owners.

222
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,100
Oh. That...

223
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,600
I think it might be better to just ignore it right now.

224
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,980
Let's not make a big deal of it until the investigation ends.

225
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,860
This is what I don't understand.

226
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,460
Mr. Yoo, you're not a total outsider to this case.

227
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,260
Don't you want to clear your own name?

228
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,800
I heard you had something to tell me.

229
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,990
I heard from the Deputy CEO.

230
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:59,680
I heard you suggested that we don't do anything about it.

231
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,440
Right. I did.

232
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,490
Are you trying to avoid the issue?

233
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,090
Or are you trying to make it a bigger one?

234
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,840
- CEO Seo, I just...
- Yes, I know.

235
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,600
- I know you want to screw me over, Mr. Yoo.
- What?

236
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,410
I know you entered my home without permission.

237
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,680
I know what your sister Yoo Se Hee did.

238
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,400
All of it.

239
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,910
Let's see, Mr. Yoo. You committed trespassing and burglary.

240
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,990
Your sister, spreading false information, defamation, and...

241
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,640
I could come up with much more.

242
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,780
If you and your sister head off to jail together...

243
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,370
how would your mother feel?

244
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,100
CEO Seo, this was all impulsive on my part.

245
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,180
I told my sister many times to delete it, but she's so immature...

246
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,840
Turn in Han Yoo Ra.

247
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,970
Tell me how that contract ended up in Han Yoo Ra's hands

248
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,600
and how she is connected to what Yoo Se Hee did.

249
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,550
If you tell me the full story, I'll take that into consideration.

250
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,970
Give me some time to confirm what happened with my sister.

251
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,530
If the cops find anything, your chance of getting off easy is over.

252
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:02,260
Don't do anything if you want to find out what happens when you mess with my wife.

253
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,070
Did you see what was online?

254
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,800
It's crazy.

255
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,070
This whole thing is so unfair to Madam Gu.

256
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:16,390
Teacher, you need to keep the water cleaner around here.

257
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,070
Excuse me. What's wrong with the water here?

258
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,110
- I like it.
- What?

259
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,890
All the ingredients we use here are top quality.

260
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,450
I heard the Teacher even got a really nice water filter.

261
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,040
It tastes good.

262
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,510
What a character.

263
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,470
Teacher.

264
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,770
I wondered what it would be like without your mother-in-law.

265
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,690
But turns out I worried for nothing. You're strong, Yi Joo.

266
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,400
I'm sorry I keep giving you reasons to worry.

267
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,220
Then, can you do me a favor?

268
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,340
Go ahead, have some.

269
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,040
How is it?

270
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,740
Is it okay?

271
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,940
I must trust you, Teacher.

272
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,370
I have a hard time eating food someone else made.

273
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,510
But I can eat things that you or Do Guk make.

274
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,290
It tastes good, like I can feel your heart in it.

275
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,620
My heart?

276
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,640
How much you care about me.

277
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,420
You're just trying to keep me here to have the membership numbers up, right?

278
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,210
What? What did you just say?

279
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,080
I'm joking.

280
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,370
Teacher.

281
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,180
I might not be coming to class anymore.

282
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,360
Yi Joo, if it's because of what happened earlier...

283
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,060
You already know...

284
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,840
that I signed up to get Do Guk's mother to like me.

285
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,110
Thankfully, you let me in.

286
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,800
Now, I have a lot of other things to do.

287
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,630
But I didn't know it would be so sad to leave.

288
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,740
So many things happened here.

289
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,090
I met a great teacher, too.

290
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,120
We can...

291
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,380
meet outside of class, right?

292
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,510
- What?
- As friends.

293
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,470
We can get a meal every once in a while and catch up on our lives.

294
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,040
What do you think?

295
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,330
Why are you so nice to me?

296
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,660
Yi Joo, you work hard at everything.

297
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,440
When I see you...

298
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,890
I want to cheer you on.

299
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,630
Okay.

300
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,320
Then, as friends...

301
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,220
I have a favor to ask.

302
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,070
I want to learn to make this one dish.

303
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,160
Should we make it after we're done eating?

304
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,610
I haven't even told you what it is.

305
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,670
If a friend is asking, I'll always help out with anything.

306
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,700
- Can you help me with this?
- Yes.

307
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,320
You must be wondering why I didn't get the scar removed.

308
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,730
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,010
I left it there on purpose.

310
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,850
Something happened that I don't want to forget.

311
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,460
Was there an accident?

312
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,680
There was a fire.

313
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:06,640
I couldn't even go near the fire before, and now I do this for a living.

314
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
All right, then.

315
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,320
- Shall we begin?
- Okay.

316
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,830
Aigoo, that feels nice.

317
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,680
That feels nice.

318
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,040
Aigoo.

319
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,270
Aigoo, my calves, my thighs.

320
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,800
My whole body feels better.

321
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,320
What is all this?

322
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,400
You're up.

323
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,580
Wait. What are you doing here?

324
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,520
I wanted to make you some food, Grandmother.

325
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,080
Food?

326
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm not good at cooking.

327
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,070
Right, that I can tell.

328
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,940
I used to be afraid of food. Even eating it.

329
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,530
- What?
- When I was little...

330
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,570
someone poisoned my food at home.

331
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,190
Since then, it's been hard to eat food someone else made.

332
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,860
What did you say?

333
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,520
That's why I was never interested in food.

334
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,960
I just treated it like something you need to survive.

335
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,680
But now, I want more.

336
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,000
The meals that Do Guk makes are so good that I want more.

337
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,480
I want to make food myself and feed him.

338
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:12,610
And I keep wanting to do the same for Mother and for you, too.

339
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:18,080
I made it hoping that it might make you feel better.

340
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,870
Could you try a bite?

341
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,260
It's bland!

342
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,370
What are you doing? Go get the salt.

343
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,050
Okay!

344
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,870
I can come again, right, Grandmother?

345
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,280
Do you like my Do Guk?

346
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,520
Sorry?

347
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,380
Yes. I do. A lot.

348
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,360
How do you think Do Guk feels?

349
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,570
I think he feels the same way. Probably.

350
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,890
Fine. Go home. I'm tired.

351
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,300
Okay.

352
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,200
Have a good night.

353
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,890
A contract? Why did you do that?

354
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,200
Did I nag you to get married?

355
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,100
- Or did you need money?
- Grandma.

356
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,020
You know me.

357
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,460
If it was for money, I wouldn't have written such a ridiculous contract.

358
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,720
Then why the heck did you do it?

359
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,230
Because I wanted to...

360
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,680
keep Yi Joo around by any means.

361
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,880
- What?
- When I met Yi Joo,

362
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,580
I found a home.

363
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,520
A home I've looked for my entire life.

364
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,640
So, please...

365
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,490
don't kick us out, Grandma.

366
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:36,320
I spent my whole life building homes for other people.

367
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,240
I couldn't do it for my own grandson.

368
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,390
But he says you are home to him.

369
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,410
How could I be against that?

370
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,550
I found Lee Geum Young.

371
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,350
She said she couldn't go far since she had to watch the shop.

372
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,390
Her life had lots of ups and downs since she was fired.

373
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,690
Excuse me.

374
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,370
I'm on my break. Come back in the evening.

375
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,240
By chance, are you Lee Geum Young?

376
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,780
What?

377
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
Auntie Young...

378
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,890
Yi Joo? Is it you?

379
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,860
Is it really you, Yi Joo?

380
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,800
- Auntie...
- You're alive.

381
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,260
Yi Joo is alive.

382
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,910
Aigoo, Yi Joo.

383
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,580
So, you're married?

384
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,430
I'm so happy for you.

385
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,560
Your husband is good to you?

386
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,900
Yes.

387
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,280
If you kept living with us, you would have met him.

388
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,100
I know!

389
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,510
If I hadn't gotten kicked out so unfairly...

390
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,280
If it's all right, we would like to hear about what happened.

391
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,470
It was around when Yi Joo started middle school.

392
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,660
That woman came home and started throwing things, breaking them.

393
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,310
She was especially mean to Yi Joo that day.

394
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,880
Then, Yi Joo got sick after eating something that evening.

395
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,920
The day I passed out?

396
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,840
Yes. The doctor came and said you had ingested arsenic.

397
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,430
And that woman said that I had done it.

398
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,990
How ridiculous!

399
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,950
I was so mad that I yelled back.

400
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,730
"If anyone, it would have been you, Madam! You hate her, not me!"

401
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,010
So that's how...

402
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,220
I got kicked out without being able to pack properly.

403
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,040
But I couldn't stop worrying about Yi Joo.

404
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,450
I wanted to see her face one last time.

405
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,170
I snuck back in at an hour I thought no one would be around.

406
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,120
I heard footsteps and hid right away.

407
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,850
It was Lee Jung Hye.

408
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,410
She started saying the strangest things.

409
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,600
How dare you grovel back to this house?

410
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,410
Why? You want to die by my hand for good?

411
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,200
I thought she knew I was hiding here, and I was about to go out...

412
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,920
Right then, the Chairman came home.

413
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,620
Lee Jung Hye left the room right away.

414
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:07,480
I hid for a bit, then ran away once everyone went to bed.

415
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,450
Lee Jung Hye, that woman was completely two-faced.

416
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,340
To the Chairman, she acted like she was so sophisticated.

417
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,870
In private, she would bitch and moan if something didn't taste right.

418
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,750
She even brought a guy around sometimes.

419
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,530
Some guy who looked like he was up to no good!

420
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:32,290
Then Lee Jung Hye must've put the poison in your food.

421
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,430
She was especially cruel to me when I started middle school.

422
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,620
She probably learned that I was my father's biological daughter.

423
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,380
But how did she find that out?

424
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,050
And why did she say that to Lee Geum Young?

425
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:49,810
How did Lee Jung Hye come to marry my dad?

426
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,990
She was an assistant in the secretary's office.

427
00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:01,500
She was polite, good at her job, and got on with Jin Woong.

428
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,480
After your mother and Jin Woong broke up,

429
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,200
Jin Woong went through a hard time, and the two of them bonded.

430
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,400
Hold on. Let's see.

431
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,540
Here.

432
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,780
What is this?

433
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:28,500
I had nothing else to give to you, so I thought I'd collect these.

434
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,370
Thank you, Grandpa.

435
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,970
[Fire Started by a Cigarette Kills Mother and Daughter]

436
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,350
But there's something else I want.

437
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,910
What is it?

438
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,520
Hanwool.

439
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,610
You own more than 30% of the shares.

440
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,920
If you give them to me-

441
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,150
- I was planning on it.
- Really?

442
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:56,520
I'm getting my shares ready for you with Lawyer Kim's help.

443
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,650
If I don't do that, Lee Jung Hye will swallow them up.

444
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,680
In terms of timing, since the company is in shambles right now...

445
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,670
we can do it by surprise when there's a big issue-

446
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,600
The news will break soon.

447
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,560
Hanwool will fail to acquire Savings Bank.

448
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,350
Are you sure?

449
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,450
Jin Woong will be shocked.

450
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,650
That was his lifelong dream.

451
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,780
The Savings Bank acquisition isn't going to go through?

452
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,730
They say the official news will break in about a week.

453
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,250
I had someone look into it.

454
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,870
It seems like they never intended for it to pass from the start.

455
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:53,890
And yet she told her father to go harder with promotion and all.

456
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,890
If this leaks, stock prices will plummet.

457
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,330
Will that cause a problem for your finances?

458
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:05,830
The old man is in charge of the shares anyway.

459
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,870
Oh, I heard Chairman Han Woon Jae is in cahoots with Han Yi Joo while in hiding.

460
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,790
Maybe they're using this time to scheme.

461
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,570
That would be a good thing.

462
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:28,280
We're not sitting around doing nothing, either.

463
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,550
The post my sister made has been deleted.

464
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,930
I made sure she'd never do anything like this again.

465
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,870
So? Is that it?

466
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,610
Rumors that started while you were dilly-dallying

467
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,960
are all over the articles about Taeja.

468
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,590
On apps that review companies, stories about me run rampant.

469
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,600
How can I make you feel better?

470
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,340
I already told you.

471
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,490
Give me proof that Han Yoo Ra was involved.

472
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,610
Yoo Ra was not involved.

473
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,370
- What?
- This was all my fault.

474
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,400
I will write a letter of apology if you would like. I will resign if you say so.

475
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,670
- But Yoo Ra had nothing to do with this.
- Mr... Mr. Yoo.

476
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:21,370
By chance, is something going on between you and Han Yoo Ra?

477
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,980
What if there is?

478
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,620
As a man, I want to protect the woman I have feelings for.

479
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,570
Is that wrong?

480
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,510
Even though Han Yoo Ra has another man?

481
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,360
What?

482
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,060
VP Seo, there's an issue with the ready-mixed concrete.

483
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,750
Some of the concrete supplied by Soohan does not meet the quality standards.

484
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,590
Since the distribution ratio was manually manipulated and the purity went down...

485
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:57,150
You've been getting rebates from those companies to build a slush fund, right?

486
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:01,080
These whispers started from inside of Soohan.

487
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,900
This means someone in the industry is sending us a warning.

488
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,740
We should be careful for now...

489
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,250
Careful? Timeline is the utmost priority right now.

490
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,270
You know we're behind schedule because of the union.

491
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,250
Got it, sir.

492
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,670
What is it like at Seo Do Guk's right now?

493
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,730
Quiet.

494
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,870
I worked on the group's executives, as you asked.

495
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,390
It's been 30 minutes, and he's not here. I'm so annoyed.

496
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,330
A man can get caught up when he's doing big things.

497
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:00,110
How long are you going to treat Seo Jung Wook like that?

498
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,170
- What did I do?
- Treat him like a man.

499
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,780
Insecure men like him need it the most.

500
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,670
You chose him for a reason.

501
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,720
Make him undoubtedly yours.

502
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,700
I know that much.

503
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,750
Bye. He's here.

504
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,870
You made it.

505
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,610
Did you wait long?

506
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,800
I just got here.

507
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,440
Prep for the board meeting is going well?

508
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,300
Of course. What would you like to eat?

509
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,480
Will you order for me, Jung Wook?

510
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,300
What?

511
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,430
We're all business with each other.

512
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,060
We're going to be married soon.

513
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,550
It's time to switch to boyfriend-girlfriend mode.

514
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,370
Usually, men say that kind of thing first.

515
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,300
Is that so?

516
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,550
I'm too impatient to just wait for it.

[Affidavit]

518
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,160
What do you think I did?

519
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,230
Do you have proof?

520
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,600
I called you in because I do.

521
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,110
You see the written complaint here?

522
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,470
This will go faster if you cooperate, you understand?

523
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,630
If I answer, is it going to be bad for me?

524
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,280
It won't be, so answer correctly.

525
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,080
You might be making it worse for yourself like that.

00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:24,540
He gave back all the interest he ever got from her.

702
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,930
The painting he donated to the foundation...

703
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:30,370
It was already sold, and he paid for it to bring it back.

704
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,470
Why would my father do all this?

705
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,610
That's not it.

706
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:42,650
He even moved nursing homes behind our backs.

707
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:44,500
With Yi Joo leading the way.

708
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,490
So why did everyone do this?

709
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:57,160
Your father is not someone to take losses.

710
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:03,580
If all of Hanwool goes to Yi Joo,

711
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,390
and Seo Do Guk inherits Taeja Group...

712
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:09,290
wouldn't that be a nice picture?

713
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,420
All of Hanwool to Yi Joo? What does that mean?

714
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:19,430
Yi Joo already wanted to ruin us when she planned her marriage.

715
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:23,590
- What?
- Then you welcomed Seo Do Guk as a son-in-law.

716
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:26,890
Asked her to help with the Savings Bank acquisition.

717
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,790
Taeja Group must have thought us laughable.

718
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,150
You never trusted us.

719
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:39,810
Are you happy now? Are you?

720
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,270
- Excuse me, Chairman.
- What's going on?

721
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,720
Stock prices are plummeting after the failed acquisition.

722
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,770
Affiliated companies are also calling with complaints.

723
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,110
Please go. We'll come back with solutions soon.

724
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,830
What do you think your father would say now?

725
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:15,880
If he and Yi Joo wanted to ruin us for good.

726
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,430
A trust, right?

727
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,110
What did you say? What does that mean?

728
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,230
What have you been doing this whole time?

729
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:32,850
You moved nursing homes and didn't even say where or pick up the phone.

730
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,720
Well, I had a reason to stay under the radar.

731
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:42,560
But why can't I put my own shares in a trust?

732
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:48,140
Your daughter-in-law petitioned for a conservatorship under Han Jin Woong's name.

733
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,330
What?

734
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:53,740
I told you, Lawyer Kim! You should have delayed it!

735
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,530
They brought a dementia diagnosis and everything.

736
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:00,210
The court had no choice but to accept it.

737
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,220
Anyway, I did my best, Chairman.

738
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,510
Aigoo.

739
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,080
I rendered him mentally incapable of making his own decisions.

740
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,700
His location was unknown, and the court couldn't get in touch with him for the evaluation.

741
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,960
It ended up being good for us that they went into hiding.

742
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
- That means...
- I saved your company.

743
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,950
I stopped Han Woon Jae from giving it all away to Han Yi Joo.

744
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:38,800
You understand who you can trust now, right?

745
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,670
Good work.

746
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:45,500
You did good work, Honey.

747
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,210
No problem.

748
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:52,650
As long as you know that, I'm fine.

749
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,580
When the lawyer gets here, just say this.

750
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,380
You'll delegate the management rights for a while.

751
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,670
Of course, when you feel better, I'll give them right back.

752
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:21,970
So, just let me handle it and get some rest.

753
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,710
Okay?

754
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,830
Lee Jung Hye did that?

755
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,680
I'm sorry.

756
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,410
I was careless.

757
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,190
No, I was, too.

758
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,090
But here's the thing.

759
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,190
There's something that's bothering me.

760
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,920
- What is it?
- What Lee Jung Hye said.

761
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,510
Lee Geum Young thought she was talking to her,

762
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:05,490
but if so, Lee Jung Hye wouldn't have just let her go.

763
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,240
That means...

764
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,720
she was talking to you, Yi Joo.

765
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,690
If she said, "How dare you grovel back to this house,"

766
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:18,960
that means she already knew her husband had another child.

767
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,520
Then...

768
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,880
When she said, "Do you want to die by my hand for good?"

769
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,830
That, too.

770
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,220
It sounds like she already tried to kill you once and failed.

771
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:33,220
How dare you grovel back to this house?

772
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:38,020
Why? Do you want to die by my hand for good?

773
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,650
Am I being way too sensitive?

774
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,530
Am I, Yi Joo?

775
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,860
Ma'am, why are you sitting in the Chairman's seat?

776
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:15,230
When he gets here, he'll be mad. Please-

777
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:18,460
The Chairman is not coming.

778
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,260
And this is my seat. For the near future...

779
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,250
No, maybe for a long time...

780
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,920
- What?
- What do you mean...

781
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,070
I have been delegated the Chairman's management rights

782
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:39,290
and as of today, I'm the owner of this seat.

783
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:44,540
♫ Now I can see my halo ♫

784
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:49,170
♫ You can't cover up my mind ♫

785
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:54,490
♫ Now I can see my halo ♫

786
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:03,100
♫ Everything in red, and I'm not going back to who I was before ♫

787
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:12,760
♫ I can't be hurt no more ♫

788
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,820
[Perfect Marriage Revenge]

789
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,460
Lee Jung Hye tried to kill me and my mom.

790
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,000
She paid the guy she was seeing.

791
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,980
Yoo Ra, no one can look down on us now.

792
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,170
No, everyone will look up to us.

793
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,920
Tell Chairman Han Jin Woong and hear his answer.

794
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,530
You wanted me to end up like this, right?

795
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,300
We don't need a daughter like you, either.

796
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:35,620
Let's go our own ways. You're not my daughter anymore.

797
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,940
You're not my daughter anymore.

798
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,250
I am your birth daughter, Father.

799
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,900
Kill his daughter.

800
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,050
This time, do it right.
