Doesn't change where you come from, though.

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,140
Father can't make it today. He's not feeling well.

You didn't expect him to walk you down the aisle, did you?

Hello.

20
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,570
I'm sorry. The bride needs a moment to rest.

21
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,970
Are you trying to ruin everything?

Please don't mention it.

That's right, Mother.

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,080
Stay enraged.

What?

77
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,050
Soo Mi, isn't that a wedding dress?

78
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,690
Only crazies do that kind of thing.

79
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,660
The party ended early.

80
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,640
Oh, the dress code was all white.

81
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,360
You understand, right?

82
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,620
Excuse me, could you please move to the back?

83
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,310
Why? We're sisters.

84
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,780
Unni, look over here.

85
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,300
My sister just got married!

Please give her your blessings.

87
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,780
Wow, Yoo Ra, you're way prettier.

88
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,130
Daebak! I wish I was you.

89
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,390
I almost thought you were getting married!

90
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,910
I nearly had a heart attack.

91
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,660
Why would they say that I'm prettier?

92
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,740
People say things they don't mean, right?

93
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,880
Here we go! One, two, three!

94
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,040
- Must be nice.
- What is?

95
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,760
Keep living your online life.

96
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,470
I'm going to...

97
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,090
live my real life with the one I love.

98
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,320
Right. You should meet a nice guy soon, too, Sister-in-law.

99
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,990
Love your smiles, bride and groom!

100
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,130

101
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,750
Hey.

102
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,950
Want to have a glass of wine?

103
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,790
Sorry. I want to wash up and get some rest.

104
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,580
I couldn't really sleep last night.

105
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,390
Oh. Sure. Get some rest, then.

106
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,850
Good job today.

107
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,210
Thank you.

108
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,230
Good night.

109
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,330
See you tomorrow.

110
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,260
I'm going on a trip to Gangneung. I'll be back in two days.

111
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,330
A trip...

112
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,100
she says.

113
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,370
Right.

114
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,730
My Yi Joo...

115
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,870
went on a honeymoon by herself.

116
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,650
Aigoo.

117
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,050
One, two...

118
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,020
I'll always be by your side.

119
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,470
You don't have to try to do everything alone.

120
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,840
He keeps saying things like that to me.

121
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,710
But it doesn't make any sense.

122
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,690
How can somebody be always by my side?

123
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,160
There you are. Finally.

124
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
How did you...

125
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,900
Didn't you leave a note so I could find you?

126
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,250
Gosh, but why the ocean?

127
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,720
I don't like water.

128
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,360
What do you mean?

129
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,020
That makes no sense. It's so pretty here.

130
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,900
Sure.

131
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,050
It is beautiful.

132
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,080
To me, it's also horrific.

133
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,910
When I was little...

134
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,930
I went to a party on a cruise with my father and brother.

135
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,190
I wanted to play a joke on my brother, who was holding onto the rails.

136
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,320
But he was startled and dropped his cell phone.

137
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,290
The one thing his birth mother left behind when she left home.

138
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,930
So?

139
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,640
He told me to get in the water and find it.

140
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,840
He held me by the collar and shoved me. I hung on for dear life.

141
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,990
Then...

142
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,520
What happened?

143
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,430
What is going on?

144
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,170
That boy pushed him into the water.

145
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,610
That's not possible! Really?

146
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:47,060
Really! I saw them fighting. I saw him pushing him!

147
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:53,070
Dad! H-Hyung fell off the ship...

148
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,240
Do Guk, did you do it?

149
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,490
Did you push Hyung into the water?

150
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,960
I-It was a mistake. Really. It was a mistake.

151
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,320
He's alive!

152
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Jung Wook! Can you hear me?

153
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,550
- Dad...
- What?

154
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,460
My leg...

155
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,480
My leg!

156
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,990
It's okay. It's okay.

157
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,010
We can go to the hospital.

158
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,460
Ambulance! Call an ambulance!

159
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,900
So, that's when your brother's leg...

160
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,730
He banged against the rails as he fell and got nerve damage.

161
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,500
After that, my brother constantly reminded me.

162
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,500
How was I still in that house after what I did to him...

163
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,580
Eventually, I left home.

164
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,590
You didn't have to come.

165
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:59,420
- What?
- When Jung Wook called me to the boat cafe,

166
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,340
and now, too.

167
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,700
You didn't have to come.

168
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,300
I'm doing a lot better after treatment.

169
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,400
And that time, I was worried you were in danger.

170
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,900
I lost my cool.

171
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,180
That must have been painful.

172
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,580
I didn't know.

173
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,860
That's not what actually pains me.

174
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,500
It's you ignoring me.

175
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,350
You really don't know why I came all the way here?

176
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,760
I don't know.

177
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,290
How would I know that?

178
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,430
I need you to know.

179
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,200
I missed you.

180
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,590
That's the only reason why.

181
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,500
I like you.

182
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,010
A lot.

183
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,810
♫ I will stay by your side ♫

184
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:14,030
♫ Without saying a word ♫

185
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:20,250
♫ I will stand there always ♫

186
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:28,300
♫ I will be there for all your days ♫

187
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:35,110
♫ I always want to be near you ♫

188
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:41,360
♫ I don't want to be just a moment for you ♫

189
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,670
♫ I want to be in all of your moments ♫

190
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,380
♫ Am I asking for too much? ♫

191
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,720
Those two must be having fun just about now.

192
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,690
[Yoo Ra]

193
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,080
Se Hyeok! Where are you?

194
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,470
Huh? Oh.

195
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,010
I'm... I'm out. What's up?

196
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,910
Then, can you pick me up?

197
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,760
I'll text you the address. Hurry up!

198
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,850
What? Yoo Ra!

199
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,210
H-Hello?

200
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,570
Could you move?

201
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,140
I thought your boyfriend was coming to get you. Not yet?

202
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,950
Yeah. Mind your own business.

203
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,230
Don't be like that. Come upstairs, and let's drink.

204
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,270
Wow, your perfume smells nice.

205
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,590
Or is it just your skin?

206
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,310
Let it go! Let it go right now!

207
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,890
Give me my phone, or I'll pull out the few strands you have left.

208
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,700
Here, here.

209
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,930
Hey!

210
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,880
Oppa!

211
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,270
Yoo Ra, are you all right?

212
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,830
F***! You bastard!

213
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,890
F***!

214
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,840
Go after them!

215
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,720
Go after them!

216
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,190
Oppa, are you crazy?

217
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,430
Why are you blushing?

218
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,760
Sorry.

219
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,380
But all I see is you right now.

220
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,390
- What?
- But...

221
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,110
when you did that, that was really cool.

222
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:28,210
You, too. You were kind of cute. Just now.

223
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,340
Let's go now. Be careful, and don't make a sound.

224
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,300
It's about time for bed.

225
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,520
- Want to shower first?
- What?

226
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,060
No.

227
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,040
Then...

228
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,060
should I shower first?

229
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,690
Not that, either.

230
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,170
Then what do you want, huh?

231
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,690
I'll shower first.

232
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,390
So...

233
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,140
Stay right there. Don't move.

234
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,940
What are you doing?

235
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,320
Don't! If you try to look, you're dead.

236
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,760
Die? Why die?

237
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,130
Then let's just...

238
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,400
be fair and see each other.

239
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Be fair? What kind of logic is that?

240
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,730
I'll shower first, then.

241
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,920
- Are you going to look?
- Are you crazy?

242
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,560
Why would I?

243
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,910
What's that?

244
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,840
What?

245
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,260
- You didn't know?
- I didn't.

246
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,850
You knew, and you were messing with me?

247
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,580
You pushed me down before I even had a chance to press the button.

248
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,210
That's-

249
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,000
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, no need to apologize.

250
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,570
My heart fluttered.

251
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,110
Let me know if you'd sneak a peek.

252
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,620
Gosh, what's there to see?

253
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,950
Are you asleep?

254
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,050
You're not going to shower?

255
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,100
Yi Joo.

256
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,800
Honey?

257
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,910
Are you actually asleep?

258
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,930
Nothing I can do, I guess.

259
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,240
Goodnight.

260
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,260
Let's spend the whole day together tomorrow.

261
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,250
You're up?

262
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,380
Why do you look surprised?

263
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,160
I mean...

264
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,620
You just popped out.

265
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,110
Did you take a shower?

266
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,780
Yeah.

267
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,770
You should wash up, too, so we can leave.

268
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,250
Okay.

269
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,870
So, are you okay?

270
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,850
- About what?
- Well...

271
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,210
if we start dating, you know.

272
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,740
- What?
- Our parents will be so confused. Yi Joo, too.

273
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,330
Is that okay with you?

274
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,670
It's not a big deal.

275
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,650
Unni is the one who changed lanes first.

276
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,630
Right.

277
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,150
- I know, but...
- Oppa.

278
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,330
- I'm thirsty.
- Oh, hold on a second.

279
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:53,610
Taeja Constructions' Han riverbank redevelopment project seems to be on thin ice.

280
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,350
After the executive committee agreed to a proposal to increase the budget without consulting the union,

281
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,260
the union held them accountable, dismissing the executives.

282
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,980
The newly formed executive committee...

283
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,690
- Looks like Seo Jung Wook got himself in trouble again.
- The lawsuit to annul the agreement...

284
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,040
Seo Jung Wook?

285
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,780
Yeah. If the union is going that far, you can't bounce back.

286
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,690
They might even be dismissed as the city's pick.

287
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,590
Vice President.

288
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,880
Did you bribe them?

289
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,920
The executive committee wouldn't take our side for no reason.

290
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,670
Speak for yourself. What happened?

291
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,520
I didn't do anything unethical.

292
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,160
A construction site is full of surprises.

293
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,170
Business needs a bit of oil to run smoothly. You know that.

294
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,440
Money? It could happen in construction.

295
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,180
I wouldn't even tell you to be completely clean.

296
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,170
But you should not cause harm to others.

297
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,150
If you went about a certain way to get the job,

298
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,260
you better do the best job to save your face.

299
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,930
In front of other companies who lost the bid and to the people who'll live in that building.

300
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,200
Yes, Chairwoman.

301
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,260
If the construction timeline gets pushed back,

302
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,350
it's a big damage to the company and the residents.

303
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,550
You understand what I mean, right?

304
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,410
Yes. I'll handle it.

305
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,460
I can promise you that.

306
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,230
What are you going to do, Vice President?

307
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,970
What can I do?

308
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,370
I need to hand some cash to the new committee.

309
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,900
But they all know that receiving money caused issues last time.

310
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,170
When someone refuses money, it means it's not enough.

311
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,710
I'll give them a little more than they're expecting.

312
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,100
We don't have that kind of money anymore.

313
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,360
The slush fund we took out of safety management is gone.

314
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,110
Our only option is to ask Taeja Group to be a guarantor,

315
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,670
and printing commercial papers-

316
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,840
Asking headquarters a favor in a time like this?

317
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,730
I thought you wanted to climb up with me to the group.

318
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,620
But private loans are your only option

319
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,840
to borrow money discreetly.

320
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,320
What did you say? Private loans?

321
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,770
- Do Guk.
- What?

322
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,500
It's still hard for you to see water, right?

323
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,030
You want me to show you a good method?

324
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,510
Don't look and just feel. Like this.

325
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,280
Wait...

326
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,500
♫ On the way to see you today ♫

327
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,990
♫ What should I wear? What should I wear? ♫

328
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,160
♫ I know it's the first time we're meeting like this ♫

329
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,830
♫ But can I hold your hand? Can I hold your hand? ♫

330
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,900
♫ Awkward look on your face, fumbling words ♫

331
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,490
♫ You're still pretty to me ♫

332
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:26,780
♫ Feels like we're riding on a happy breeze, on top of the clouds ♫

333
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,820
♫ I've been waiting for a long time ♫

334
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:38,890
♫ Even just yesterday, I was all alone ♫

335
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,410
♫ I didn't know I would meet you like this ♫

336
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:52,100
♫ I'll tell you the feelings I have hidden that I've never told anyone ♫

337
00:31:52,100 --> 00:32:01,440
♫ Wherever you are in this big world, I'll be by your side ♫

338
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,260
♫ I tend not to say many words ♫

339
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,360
♫ But to you, I'll always be warm ♫

340
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:25,630
♫ Feels like we're riding on a happy breeze, on top of the clouds ♫

341
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,690
♫ I've been waiting for a long time ♫

342
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,260
- What?
- I wanted to feel it.

343
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,670
Why?

344
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:39,060
♫ Even just yesterday, I was all alone ♫

345
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,350
You told me to feel it. Come here.

346
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:51,000
♫ I'll tell you the feelings I have hidden that I've never told anyone ♫

347
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,640
♫ Wherever you are in this big world, I'll be by your side ♫

348
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,510
♫ I'll always smile brightly for you ♫

349
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:06,180
♫ I'll be your strength, can you trust me?♫

350
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:12,320
♫ So you can always lean on me, I'll be on your side ♫

351
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,680
♫ I will be your everything ♫

352
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,610
I promise.

353
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,770
I'll only hold your hand and sleep. Really.

354
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,090
Sleep well. Down there.

355
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,460
I have a bad back.

356
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,340
Are you going to carry me around tomorrow?

357
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,410
Fine. Sleep here, then.

358
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,370
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll go down there.

359
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,130
It's just sleeping! Just sleeping.

360
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,910
Are you having dirty thoughts or something?

361
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,260
What?

362
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,530
You don't think you could control yourself next to me in bed?

363
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,460
Like you might pounce on me?

364
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,120
Who's pouncing who?

365
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,650
You're not making any sense.

366
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,990
My gosh. Okay, fine. Move.

367
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,330
Aigoo.

368
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,400
Then...

369
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,340
Do not cross this line.

370
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,540
Are you in sixth grade?

371
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,830
"If you cross this line, everything is mine!" Like that?

372
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:36,590
So, if I cross this line, I'm Han Yi Joo's.

373
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,690
Stop babbling on.

374
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,670
Can you turn off the lights?

375
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:32,460
What are you so afraid of?

376
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,620
You looked so sad all day while we were together.

377
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,980
What are you talking about?

378
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,530
I had a lot of fun today.

379
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,060
I don't know.

380
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,560
It seemed like you knew you wouldn't get this again.

381
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,000
Like it was your last time.

382
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,070
You looked like someone trying to get the most out of it.

383
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,830
The reason you keep pushing me away...

384
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:04,070
And why you can't see me as just a guy...

385
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,380
Is that why?

386
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,430
Are you afraid we won't stay together?

387
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,560
Being normal...

388
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,550
is the hardest thing for me.

389
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,060
What?

390
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,860
I've never lived like that before.

391
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,640
And I never will.

392
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,690
Yi Joo...

393
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,880
I can't sleep if you keep talking to me.

394
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,340
I'll just go sleep over there.

395
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,120
Let go.

396
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,920
Be honest with me.

397
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,590
Don't you trust me?

398
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,760
Do you think my feelings for you

399
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,980
aren't real?

400
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,590
That's right.

401
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,210
I don't trust you.

402
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,310
But it's not just you, Do Guk.

403
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,100
Whenever I put my trust in something,

404
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,650
I end up being wrong.

405
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,220
What are you talking about?

406
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,620
I...

407
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,110
You know...

408
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,660
I'm the real...

409
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,660
I'm the real daughter.

410
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,500
- What?
- I...

411
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,460
I'm my father's real daughter.

412
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,760
I heard Grandpa and Lee Jung Hye talking.

413
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,800
Lee Jung Hye knew.

414
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,530
It sounded like they knew about my birth mother, too, but...

415
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,710
That's all I got to hear.

416
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,880
When I go back,

417
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,140
I'm going to look into it for real.

418
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,860
It must've been...

419
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,050
so hard on you.

420
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,070
Don't hold back.

421
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,700
You can cry.

422
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,230
At least, with me...

423
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,400
I want you to feel at ease.

424
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,840
Whatever it is you're trying to do, I'll help you.

425
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,070
So...

426
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,190
I can't reciprocate your feelings.

427
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,040
It's okay.

428
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,600
I can't love anyone.

429
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,570
No.

430
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,210
- I shouldn't.
- But I can.

431
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:26,680
The person who's more into it has the lower hand.

432
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,490
Didn't you know?

433
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,830
Use me as much as you want.

434
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,810
Coming from you...

435
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:39,580
I'll take it all.

436
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,880
My head is so complicated.

437
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,660
I don't want to think about anything.

438
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,650
What can I do?

439
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,490
So you don't have to think at all.

440
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,080
Want me to help?

441
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,420
Yeah.

442
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,910
Hold on. I can't breathe...

443
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,940
I can't hold back anymore.

444
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,900
Perhaps Hanwool can help you out, Mr. Vice President.

445
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,490
If you're willing to work with us,

446
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,210
please give me a call.

447
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,540
[Lee Jung Hye]

448
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,510
Hanwool...

449
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,040
- Hi, Teacher.
- Hey, Yi Joo.

450
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,100
I'm sorry to bother you on your honeymoon. It's a bit urgent.

451
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,090
It's okay. What's going on?

452
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,950
You know, the painting I bought from you?

453
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:41,310
I thought it looked similar in style to a piece that my friend in America posted about.

454
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,780
Even the signature is the same.

455
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,820
He said he bought it from an auction, artist unknown.

456
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,340
He got so excited that he posted it on social media.

457
00:42:55,340 --> 00:43:01,610
He's a famous art collector, so the comments are blowing up.

458
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,710
[Comments: I have his work at home, too! / Who's the painter? Tell us! / I think Han's work is pretty expensive...]

459
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,540
But Yi Joo, you told me you've never sold a painting before.

460
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,640
So what happened?

461
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,000
I see my mother has given me a surprise present.

462
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,300
What? What do you mean?

463
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,150
Thank you for letting me know, Teacher.

464
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,910
I'll stop by to tell you in person sometime.

465
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,270
Because of the pregnant woman's death while I was a loan shark,

466
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,130
I did bring you into this house. That is true.

467
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:51,800
But a lot happened in between those times.

468
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,410
When I learned that Jin Woong was seeing someone,

469
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,700
your mother was already pregnant with you.

470
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,070
She came to me with a full belly,

471
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,750
asking me to give them my blessing.

472
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,520
It reminded me of the woman who died.

473
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
I said, absolutely not.

474
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,780
I told her to walk away.

475
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,030
I gave her money.

476
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,360
And then?

477
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,670
Maybe two, three years after that...

478
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,570
she came back, begging me to put you on the family registry.

479
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,640
I screamed at her cruelly and kicked her out.

480
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,940
Soon after,

481
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,850
I heard there was a fire at your house that killed you and your mom.

482
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:38,660
I was so terrified that she died because of me again.

483
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,850
I had no choice but to go to the shaman.

484
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:44,760
What happened next?

485
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,980
Right...

486
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,430
What happened next was the problem.

487
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,670
The General says...

488
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,810
You clueless being!

489
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:03,500
How can you not recognize her?

490
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:08,010
The child who is right next to you!

491
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,010
Then we did the paternity test...

492
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:18,330
and found out that you were the child whom I thought was dead.

493
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:23,670
I never imagined that child would come back to our family again.

494
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,670
And Lee Jung Hye...

495
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,870
knew this, too.

496
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:30,040
No, I really didn't...

497
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,080
I'll give you back your money soon. I'll be back when I have it.

498
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,380
No. That was a wedding gift for you.

499
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,270
You're a businessman, Grandpa.

500
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,690
No matter what money, no matter who, you get it back.

501
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,740
Let me ask you one thing.

502
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:50,000
Please don't tell my father about this.

503
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,760
Yi Joo.

504
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,000
What are you trying to do? Huh?

505
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,990
I'm going to let him know who I am.

506
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,260
And everything you all did...

507
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:11,080
I'll make you regret it.

508
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,600
So watch me, Grandpa.

509
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,650
You've been sick for a while now.

510
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,540
Don't you think you should cut down on work?

511
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,560
We're about to see whether our group will leap forward or not.

512
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,270
If anything, I should be pushing harder, not cutting back.

513
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,350
I just worry you might collapse again.

514
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:44,210
It might be too late for regrets, then.

515
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,960
How about the kids? Where are they?

516
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:05,710
You need to gain some weight.

517
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,410
Eat plenty.

518
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,590
Are you feeling better?

519
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,560
I heard you passed out.

520
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,070
I'm okay.

521
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:25,020
I feel so terrible in front of my son-in-law.

522
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,540
I couldn't even make it to my own daughter's wedding.

523
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,460
It's all right. We're just worried about you, Father.

524
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,970
That's why...

525
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:44,450
we discussed a way to help you.

526
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,100
You two did?

527
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:51,040
The Han Gallery. I thought you could give it to me.

528
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,150
W-What? Give you what?

529
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,240
You've wanted to move over to financials for a while now.

530
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,680
You said you were sick of dealing with spoiled, rude madams.

531
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,530
In that case, the gallery should obviously go to me.

532
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,350
Why would you go after that?

533
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,500
Why is that obvious?

534
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,600
- Pardon?
- The gallery is a Hanwool asset.

535
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,770
Yoo Ra, do you think you deserve to be its owner?

536
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:15,190
Why is that?

537
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,340
Well, because...

538
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,880
dealing art was something Mom did, and...

539
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,810
You started the gallery in the first place so I could inherit it.

540
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:29,700
And Dad, you saw what I can do.

541
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,760
Our gallery is super hot right now.

542
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,360
In terms of social media followers, we're first in the industry.

543
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,690
Do you even have any data showing that led to more sales?

544
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,800
What did you just say?

545
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,730
I think Yi Joo should take care of the gallery.

547
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,670

548
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:56,250
Premium-branded interior design has to include art.

549
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,730
There will be a synergy effect for sure.

551

Yi Joo, you, too.

552
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,320
Just because you can draw a little doesn't mean you can...

553

Mother, I found out that you've been selling my paintings abroad.

557
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:34,460
Since you promoted me as an anonymous artist, the response is explosive.

558
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,140
It's true.

559
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,110
You did great with this. First time in a while.

601
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,750
that Yi Joo has never sold a painting.

602
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:56,610
Did that woman sell that painting behind Yi Joo's back anonymously?

they told you to take your time and fact-check, but you just uploaded it.

613
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:30,350
Auntie, the fact is...

614
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:34,130

No reason. Kids can be like that.
