Your father wants to partner with Taeja Group by any means.

149
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,300
He can't just oppose the marriage in front of them.

150
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,130

151
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,340

152
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,150
That's not going to happen.

153
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,300
Don't worry about anything, Yoo Ra.

154
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,800
I will take care of it.

155
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,790

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,120
I like it.

181
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,010
- What?
- You asked why I'm doing all this for you.

182
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,590
Because...

183
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,550
I've always liked to cook.

184
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,640
You posted the article, right?

185
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,230
Staging such a provocative photo.

186
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,070
Spending money to spread the article. Why?

187
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,670
Because I'm scared Han Yi Joo will get cold feet.

188
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,600
- What?
- I just really want the offers you made me.

189
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,150
I need to make sure I get all of the benefits you promised me.

190
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,410
Stocks, IPO...

191
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,770
gosh, what else?

192
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,520
Unless you back out first, I won't.

193
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,950
Really?

194
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,280
Then let's make things official between us.

195
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,470
A prenup?

196
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,240
Separate finances. Don't ask, don't tell private lives.

197
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,790
Everything we discussed last time.

198
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,430
As for the length of the marriage contract...

199
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,490
Well, we can negotiate it.

200
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,080
Let's make it...

201
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,900
one year.

202
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,340
I would like to add one clause here.

203
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,660
What?

204
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,740
We get permission from our families before the wedding.

205
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,570
That's how it will be meaningful.

206
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,690
Lee Jung Hye, Han Yoo Ra, and my father.

207
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,360
They all need to be at the ceremony, giving us their blessing.

208
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,740
If you want investments, you'll need your grandmother's approval anyway.

209
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,190
I think it's a clause we both need.

210
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,520
You agree?

211
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,690
Agreed.

212
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,170
We are now officially business partners. Right?

213
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,440
Yes.

214
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,910
Then we need a base camp.

215
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,810
- Base camp?
- A place to discuss strategy.

216
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,310
A place to rest after returning from the battlefield.

217
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,210
Don't you think we need that?

218
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,300
Speaking of...

219
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,900
what do you think of this place?

220
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,080
This is your place.

221
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,020
How about you move in here?

222
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,070
You want...

223
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,700
the two of us to live together?

224
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,620
- Are you crazy?
- I'll...

225
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,550
go to my parents' place today.

226
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:18,330
If we want their permission, shouldn't we at least do that?

227
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,280
But...

228
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,230
how can I be in someone else's place...

229
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,240
Here's everything you need to cook.

230
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,150
Nothing's been opened, so it's all safe.

231
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:55,870
And this is our communal space.

232
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,930
If you're bored, you can play games. And...

233
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,230
this is my room. Unfortunately, I will not be here.

234
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,940
So, don't go in there just because you miss me.

235
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,560
And...

236
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,760
this is your room.

237
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,920
I bought some toiletries.

238
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,790
Whose taste is this?

239
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,030
Was it you, Seo Do Guk?

240
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,670
If you don't like them, let me know.

241
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,150
I can always fire my secretary.

242
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,550
No. I like them.

243
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,300
Make sure you give him a nice bonus.

244
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,680
So, when are you going to move in?

245
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,300
Are you sure it's okay for me to live here?

246
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,780
This is already your home, Han Yi Joo.

247
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,780
You can come whenever you want.

248
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,780
Are you getting deja vu like I am?

249
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,400
Right.

250
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:58,030
We upgraded from a hotel room key to a front door key.

251
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,490
That day, Han Yi Joo made me use that key,

252
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,660
and I decided to take a chance on my future.

253
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,740
So don't lose.

254
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,160
For this fight...

255
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,130
I'll be with you.

256
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,630
Secretary Byeon.

257
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,420
Secretary Byeon?

258
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,140
- Secretary Byeon!
- You scared me.

259
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,770
What do you need?

260
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,330
Is it true? That CEO Seo is getting married?

261
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,410
- I know, right?
- Who is she exactly?

262
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,170
How amazing is she that she captivated CEO Seo?

263
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,040
I know, right?

264
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,460
This makes no sense.

265
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,180
I hear Mr. Yoo is getting married, and now CEO Seo.

266
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,320
Mr. Yoo?

267
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,520
I heard you met her, Secretary Byeon.

268
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,840
In front of the building.

269
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,860
Geez, hate working late. I hate working this late at night.

270
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, my.

271
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,600
I brought you some food.

272
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,300
- Wow, Mr. Yoo.
- Are you staying very late?

273
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,680
Is that his girlfriend?

274
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,330
I think so.

275
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,950
- You must be exhausted.
- She's pretty!

276
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,090
I made a lot. Make sure you try them all.

277
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,970
What is it? Is something wrong, Secretary Byeon?

278
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,230
Yes.

279
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,140
There is something very wrong.

280
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,660
What's going on with Secretary Byeon?

281
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,050
He's like that after hearing CEO Seo is getting married.

282
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,520
What?

283
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,590
Mr. Yoo, you know who CEO Seo is marrying, right?

284
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,100
Ms. Kang Si Ah and Ms. Seol Soo Mi.

285
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,510
Over something that hasn't been substantiated, no...

286
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,800
As employees of the executive office, you should not be spreading unverified rumors.

287
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,800
I just thought since there's an article and all...

288
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,050
I'm sorry, Mr. Yoo.

289
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,100
Please be more mindful from now on.

290
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,280
[Yi Joo, please call me once you've had a chance to think. I will be waiting for you. Always.]

291
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,490
<i>Sure, whatever.</i>

292
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,690
How's your mom doing?

293
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,920
She can't get out of bed!

294
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,570
What is wrong with your sister?

295
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,670
Some kind of pre-wedding depression, probably.

296
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,090
What does she have to be depressed about?

297
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,810
She was crazy for my brother.

298
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:30,180
I mean, what a psychopath...

299
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,260
It's okay.

300
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,250
I know you're upset.

301
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,650
Right? This is what friends are for.

302
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,620
But maybe you and your mom could try to convince my sister, no?

303
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,360
Me and my mom?

304
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,120
I'll take this.

305
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,690
Maybe your family can sweet-talk her into changing her mind.

306
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,360
I know my sister really loved Se Hyeok.

307
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,990
Yoo Ra.

308
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,970
Hey, Han Yoo Ra!

309
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,040
You are too nice.

310
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,260
If your sister was half as nice as you...

311
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,690
Ten thousand, hundred thousand, million, ten million...

312
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,120
Get it. I have some gift cards.

313
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,140
Really? It's okay, right?

314
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,990
I saw something like this on Seo Do Na's social media. How is it?

315
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,950
So, the woman my brother is marrying is the same woman that

316
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,090
his Chief of Staff was marrying until recently?

317
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,860
<i>Yes, Honey. I saw it with his own eyes. It's true.</i>

318
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,630
Is she like, a femme fatale? Devastatingly hot?

319
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,970
Devastating...

320
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,770
No, the opposite.

321
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:10,660
It's more like a damsel in distress who brings out a man's protective instincts.

322
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,180
Hoya, are you into her, too?

323
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,080
Do you want to marry that girl instead?

324
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,830
<i>No, no, Honey.</i>

325
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,780
<i>I was just saying that's her vibe.</i>

326
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,580
<i>You know my type.</i>

327
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,880
This Hoya thinks someone like Do Na, who can tear apart

328
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,830
a man with one look is much more attractive...

329
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,510
Right?

330
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,580
Then I'm going to tear you apart later, Hoya.

331
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,310
Hey, Han Yoo Ra.

332
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,980
Wow. It's Seo Do Na.

333
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,450
It's been so long! How are you?

334
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,240
No need for niceties.

335
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,810
- What's with your sister?
- What?

336
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,540
I heard she was engaged to someone else until recently. Is that true?

337
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,570
Y-Yes, i-t's true!

338
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:58,140
- Who are you?
- My handle online is "seheezzang."

339
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,020
You know me, right? I comment on all of your posts.

340
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,960
Oh, you don't know...

341
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,510
Since you have many followers.

342
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,440
Her father used to be our chauffeur.

343
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,260
The person my sister was going to marry is her brother.

344
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,570
What?

345
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,410
Your sister has such dynamic taste in men.

346
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,630
My sister...

347
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,860
isn't mentally well.

348
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,090
I hate saying this, but...

349
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,110
she has a victim complex.

350
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:39,150
I mean, she was adopted young. She twists other people's good intentions.

351
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,240
She wants to win against me somehow...

352
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,510
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

353
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,090
Nothing. I just didn't expect you to say that.

354
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,500
What is?

355
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,090
Since she's your sister, I thought she would be a girl like you.

356
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,050
The kind who's so desperate to lock down a man that she'd wrestle others, tooth and nail.

What? Wrestle?

358
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,150
But it doesn't sound like you're talking shit about someone in your class.

359
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,280
You don't even consider her to be on your level.

360
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,690
Then, she's not the kind of girl you are.

361
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,600
Han Yi Joo is so weird.

362
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,140
- My brother was so good to her-
- I'll see with my own eyes.

363
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,610
I only trust my own judgment.

364
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,180
Yi Joo, let's talk.

365
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,750
I have nothing to say to you.

366
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,590
If you change your mind and break it off all of a sudden,

367
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,320
how about Se Hyeok? What is Se Hyeok supposed to do?

368
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,330
Do you even know how he's feeling right now?

369
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,310
He must be relieved. He won't have to be sold for money.

370
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,660
- What?
- The store my family is giving you.

371
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,590
You already signed the contract, didn't you?

372
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,610
You got the premium in advance, and now you're in a bind.

373
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,970
How do you...

374
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,260
I did that because that was a great spot.

375
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,700
I had no idea you would be like this.

376
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,380
- So pathetic.
- Pathetic?

377
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,200
If you're going to suck someone dry, make it your son.

378
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,810
Stop trying to ruin my life, too.

379
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,170
- Shit.
- What are you doing? Let go!

380
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,780
You need to learn your lesson.

381

Bad girl, how dare you talk to me like this...

382
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,930
Aigoo, I'm going to die.

383
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,880
Get out of my sight now.

384
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,390
I will. I will, but...

387
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,900
Scheming?

388
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,070
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

389
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,230
So please, take my Se Hyeok back.

Hey, Han Yi Joo! You've gone too far.

393
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,700
You threw yourself at my brother first.

394
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,070
You kick him to the curb, and now you do this to my mom?

395
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,820
Are you even human? Huh?

396
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,780
Are you crazy? Lower your voice.

397
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,040
Wow. You still have some shame, I see.

398
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,550
Everyone, take a look at this woman.

399
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,010
She left her boyfriend a month before the wedding

400
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,570
for a man who has more money. That bitch!

401
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,950

409
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,290
<i>This happened to someone else I know...</i>

410
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,550
<i>That is so scary.</i>

411

413

414
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,570
You're a great actress, Jae Sook.

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,870
How's your butt? Are you okay?

416
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,100
Yes.

417
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:13,270
But, Ma'am, will this cause Yi Joo to take Se Hyeok back?

418
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,300
Of course.

419
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,180
Yi Joo is just lost in a fantasy.

420
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,470
We need to completely break her down to have her be herself again.

421
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,450
Then, we can welcome her back with grace.

422
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,480
This is for all of us.

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,530

Of course.

You were great today.

427
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,550
If it keeps hurting, go to the doctor.

Oh, yes.

Instead of realism, it is a more subtle portrayal.

00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,900
Not bad. Good job.

451

The canvas, the paint you prepared...

452
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,960
Everything was authentic, so I felt like I was in Paris in 1890.

453

457

No, any more will be too much.

458
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,710
Yi Joo, you need to learn when to stop.

459
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,700
Otherwise, you might make a huge mess.

Why were you in the office?

00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,210

I want to sell some paintings.

Please give back the pieces you have in storage. I'll take them.

465

Focusing on beating up one person.

508
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,530
Obviously, I don't mean literally beat them up.

509
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:15,240
Pick the strongest and take them out. That's the best way.

510
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,330
Who is that in that family?

00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:22,070

But he gave in to my aunt within two years.

514
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,780
Her grandmother-in-law can't even boss her around.

515
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,610
So I should fight her? Do I even have a shot?

516
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,710
Ta-da!

517
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,240
What is this?

521
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,780
There's a lot of gossip and drama among the members.

522
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,510
She's probably getting an earful because of you.

523
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,550
So, you want me to strike her directly.

524
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,070
Show up on the battlefield of rich women,

525
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,400
and announce, "I am the woman you heard about?"

526
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,410
It makes you look like the bigger person. She might like that.

527
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:28,830
Go get devoured or hit back. Do whatever you want.

528
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,260
<i>But keep one thing in mind.</i>

529
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,580
<i>The more you try to get her to like you, the less she will.</i>

530
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,040
What am I supposed to do?

531
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,060
What do you think?

532
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,700
Oh, it's beautiful!

533
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,320
I keep getting things like these.

534
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,430
I am so blessed. What should I do?

535
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,280
Madam Gu, did you get a new ring?

536
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,980
Goodness, our teacher has such a sharp eye.

537
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,290
How did you even notice this?

538
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,080
It's so pretty!

539
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,590
She does have a sharp eye.

540
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:31,210
That's how she set up Prosecutor Min to be your son's wife!

541
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,870
That's what I'm saying!

542
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,500
This ring was a gift from Prosecutor Min, too.

543
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,100
Every morning, I bow in the direction of our teacher's house.

544
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,310
I didn't do anything.

545
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,980
I just had the two of them meet each other.

546
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,690
Look at how sweet she is.

547
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:56,100
How could we not be thankful?

548
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,230
Of course, I'm always thankful to Madam Cha, too.

549
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:08,760
Thanks to her son dumping her, Prosecutor Min became my daughter-in-law.

550
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,660
That picky second eldest.

551
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,380
I wondered who he would end up with!

552
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,620
I heard he's getting married, right?

553
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,730
I think you heard a rumor.

554
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,830
Aren't you hoping it was a rumor?

555
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:29,790
- What?
- I get it as a fellow mother.

556
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,140
You must not want to believe it.

557
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,960
The boy who thought he was way too good for a prosecutor

558
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,050
falls for an adopted girl who doesn't even know her parents

559
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,140
and doesn't even respect his own parents!

560
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,960
I don't even want to think about it.

561
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,340
Did you just insult my son?

562
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,510
Insult?

563
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,180
I just felt bad.

564
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,310
Do you want to feel bad about your own face?

565
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,670
Hey, hey! Madam Cha, what are you doing?

566
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,990
Let me go.

567
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:04,500
Gu Bong Ja, you need to get smacked.

568
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,710
What are you doing? Stop!

569
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,820
Aigoo, aigoo!

570
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,450
I must be famous around here.

571
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,230
Who are you?

572
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,740
Are you the one interviewing today?

573
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,260
Yes.

574
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,060
Nice to meet you.

575
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,100
I'm Han Yi Joo.

576
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,160
- See you!
- Bye.

577
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,420
Great work today.

578
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,870
I know Su Jin's mother well,

579
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,780
so I did accept her recommendation, but...

580
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:01,650
Isn't it going to be awkward between you and Madam Cha?

581
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,940
I'm here, so things don't get awkward.

582
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,910
So...

583
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,480
you want her approval to marry her son.

584
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,040
You came here to convince his mother.

585
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,900
That has nothing to do with cooking class.

586
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,500
I'm sorry.

587
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,970
But...

588
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:28,870
I heard this is where the marriages of the rich and powerful of our country get arranged.

589
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:33,140
I think I am in the right place.

590
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,610
Plus I need to learn how to cook.

591
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,970
Then show me.

592
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:43,150
What I asked you to bring to the interview.

593
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,070
What is this?

594
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:01,960
I asked you to bring something you made yourself.

595
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,990
You never said it had to be food.

596
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,490
So, you brought a painting?

597
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,650
I would have never imagined...

598
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,460
Painting is what I'm good at.

599
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,770
I thought you might accept it as a bribe.

600
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,430
I don't need a bribe.

601
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,720
I'll buy it.

602
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,770
Have you ever sold a painting?

603
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,060
What? No.

604
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:42,880
Then, you're a new artist, and this is a small canvas, so...

605
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,870
here you go. Take it.

606
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,150
I don't like owing anything.

607
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,870
Thank you.

608
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,590
So am I accepted?

609
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:04,350
Twice a week. 4 to 6 p.m.

610
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,190
I'm in your care.

611
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,900
I doubt you signed up for an expensive cooking class just to learn to cook.

612
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,430
How about it, Han Yi Joo? Do you have time for a cup of tea?

613
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:33,850
Yes.

614
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,630
I told her to come. It's okay with you, right?

615
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:18,170
How is it more awkward between father and son than strangers?

616
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:22,160
How can you say that, Mother?

617
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,190
Why aren't you eating?

618
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:28,720
You don't have an appetite?

619
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,850
No, Father.

620
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,870
I'm eating.

621
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,320
It's because his girlfriend isn't here. Am I right?

622
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,370
Of course not. Amazing Madam Lee Tae Ja is right here.

623
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:46,540
Aigoo, thanks for saying that.

624
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,880
Long time no see, little brother.

625
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,460
Right.

626
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,580
Do Guk is getting married. Are you seeing anyone?

627
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,800
If I had the time, I'd rather find one more spot for an apartment building, Grandma.

628
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,690
Are you a workaholic?

629
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,350
I'm against that.

630
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:15,230
A happy family leads to better work.

631
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:21,850
Who would give away their precious daughter to a guy like me?

632
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:24,450
Jung Wook, nothing is wrong with you!

633
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,380
You should put your support behind someone who has a shot.

634
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:42,790
The guy who stole the hearts of all the rich girls finally has someone he loves.

635
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:47,500
You must be so eager to come back home after moving out.

636
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,820
You don't like me being here, either.

637
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,770
Don't worry. As soon as Mother changes her mind, I'll leave.

638
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,760
What if she won't change her mind?

639
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,530
What?

640
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,960
You can't change where you come from.

641
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,310
I heard she's adopted.

642
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,910
So what?

643
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,790
She must not have gotten much love under a stepmom.

644
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:26,360
She must be twisted inside from favoritism.

645
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,850
Isn't that what people usually think?

646
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,210
Is that what you think, Jung Wook?

647
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,360
I'm just saying that's what people think.

648
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,300
And prejudice is a scary thing.

649
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,290
What you said earlier...

650
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,330
it was a cheap shot.

651
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,450
- What?
- Stop trying to get a reaction out of me.

652
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:20,300
People will just say you have a victim complex if you continue.

653
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,830
What did I do?

654
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:31,210
Maybe it's not my victim complex, but your delusional thinking.

655
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,390
So I'm wrong.

656
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:42,830
Sure. I actually wish that was true.

657
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:46,830
Do Guk, you seem different.

658
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,620
I don't want past events to control me anymore.

659
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:57,250
Nothing changes from holding onto the past.

660
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,260
My little brother grew up while I hadn't seen him.

661
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,020
It must be nice to get married.

662
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,210
Of course, it's nice.

663
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,910
The person who changed Seo Do Guk.

664
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,410
I wonder what kind of woman she is.

665
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,130
Sure.

666
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,570
You can see her at the wedding.

667
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,550
Wipe that look off of your face.

668
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:41,540
We don't have to make it so obvious that we hate each other.

669
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,380
Why can't it be obvious?

670
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,640
What?

671
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,400
I don't want to act fake.

672
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,010
You can if you want to, though.

673
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:05,330
I heard you like an einspänner, so I ordered ahead.

674
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,960
Thank you.

675
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:13,120
Yuzu tea for you, Unni. It's hot.

676
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,220
The two of you don't get along?

677
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,620
No. Of course, we get along-

678
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,180
No, we're not very close.

679
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,050
Well, it's not my family business. It's okay.

680
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,300
But...

681
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,350
two sisters fighting over the same man, how can I say...

682
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:50,380
it's not a pretty sight to see. Am I wrong?

683
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:54,810
So I think, how about you give up, Han Yi Joo?

684
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:58,300
- Pardon?
- Yoo Ra was the one who met him first.

685
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:03,560
I think she is more on Do Guk's level anyway.

686
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,660
It looks better for the big sister to give in.

687
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,040
But...

688
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:15,590
I have never let Yoo Ra have something in my whole life.

689
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,100
Really?

690
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,320
Han Yi Joo, are you more selfish than you look?

691
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,300
There's never been anything that was mine in that house.

692
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,580
Unni, what do you mean?

693
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,670
Madam Cha might get the wrong idea.

694
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,100
I know what you mean,

695
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,760
but this isn't going to be solved by the two of us negotiating.

696
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,100
Seo Do Guk's wishes matter, too.

697
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:43,680
Also, moving forward, I prefer not to meet with Yoo Ra present.

698
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,300
Talking back at every sentence...

699
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,870
Han Yi Joo, are you always this rude?

700
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:51,040
Mother, you're the rude one, not Han Yi Joo.

701
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,270
I don't know what the hell is going on.

702
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:01,040
Wait, h-how did you...

703
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,480
Did you call him, Han Yi Joo?

704
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,230
No, I didn't.

705
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:07,190
I came to pick you up and walked into this.

706
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:10,200
I wanted to win some points.

707
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,400
But I don't feel like it anymore. Let's go.

708
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,180
Stand up.

709
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,470
My goodness. This is ridiculous.

710
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,880
Han Yi Joo, you show up here out of nowhere.

711
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,020
My own son is so antsy about what I might say to his girl.

712
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,850
I'm the one who should be offended here.

713
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,890
- Mother, that...
- I'm sorry for showing up out of nowhere.

714
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,500
I may be out of line, but...

715
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,050
I thought you might understand how I feel as Do Guk's mother.

716
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:41,410
Me? Why?

717
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:46,320
You also overcame your family's disapproval to marry. Just like us.

718
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:51,470
No! My situation was completely different from yours, Han Yi Joo.

719
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:54,650
- Pardon?
- He was a divorced man with kids.

720
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:57,050
I was a beautiful young woman.

721
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,400
With a great personality, assertive, opinionated.

722
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,500
Look at my looks, too. It was basically charity on my part.

723
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,320
So, mine was for love. Completely.

724
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,400
But Yi Joo, honestly, you are not good enough for Do Guk.

725
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,160
I heard you just broke off an engagement, right?

726
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,730
There's a sea of girls who want to snag a catch like Do Guk.

727
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,720
How will you prove that you're not just one of those girls?

728
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,800
- I...
- Do you love Do Guk?

729
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:36,760
You want to marry him so badly and can't answer that?

730
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:49,240
You must be curious why I decided to break off my engagement.

731
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,920
It's because I was betrayed.

732
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,930
I found out that he was going to take advantage of me.

733
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:04,440
I swore that I would never fall in love again.

734
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:08,590
But then, I met Seo Do Guk.

735
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,190
I thought...

736
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:23,230
at the least, he would never betray a woman, his person, like that.

737
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:27,910
And even if he did, he has an assertive and

738
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,880
opinionated mother who wouldn't let him get away with it.

739
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,220
What?

740
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:41,740
I'm sorry about today.

741
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,770
I'll see you soon, Mother.

742
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:10,140
Oh, I was at the store with my mom when I got your call.

743
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:13,370
She told me to give you this.

744
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,940
Oh, no, I didn't prepare anything.

745
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,220
No worries. Don't stress about it...

746
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:24,500
Next time. "Give and take" is my motto.

747
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:42,240
I'm sorry about that. I should have stopped it.

748
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,740
Don't mention it.

749
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:48,900
But you look kind of tired.

750
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,400
- I couldn't sleep.
- Why?

751
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,300
Are you worried about me?

752
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,940
No. I'm just asking.

753
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,830
I don't like going home to my family.

754
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,190
Just like you.

755
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,190
Right.

756
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:14,420
We have that in common.

757
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:21,170
Can you take me to your place?

758
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:26,470
I don't want to go home tonight, either.

759
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:31,700
Under one condition.

760
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,130
Condition?

761
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,670
Can I...

762
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,560
have a glass of water?

763
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:51,670
Are you...

764
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:55,310
trying to tell me I'm not welcome?

765
00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:00,140
- What?
- It's so awkward all of a sudden.

766
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,510
- Is this some kind of...
- Some kind of what?

767
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:06,100
You can't stand the sight of me, or...

768
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,270
you see me as a man.

769
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,540
The former.

770
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,270
My goodness...

771
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,920
How are we going to get our families to approve like this?

772
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,890
- What?
- The two of us...

773
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:25,390
need to get to know each other better and get closer.

774
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:30,030
That's how we'll appear as a real couple to others. No?

775
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,550
I guess so.

776
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,940
You have a point.

777
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,570
Right?

778
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:42,700
- So...
- I'll organize my personal information in portfolio format.

779
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,500
- Give me your email address.
- A port...

780
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,180
That won't be necessary.

781
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:55,790
We can just talk about it.

782
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:58,990
Then, you want to play 20 questions?

783
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:01,910
Or should we just take turns asking and answering?

784
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,100
Have one. It'll help.

785
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,320
Why alcohol all of a sudden?

786
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,270
Let's just talk until we finish these.

787
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:25,970
Since you're a lightweight, Yi Joo.

788
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:31,400
That time was because I wasn't feeling well.

789
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:43,720
You wanted revenge against Lee Jung Hye and Han Yoo Ra.

790
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,100
You know what the best way is?

791
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:52,910
Love me.

792
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,580
- What?
- In any case, you and me...

793
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:58,810
we don't meet the standards of corporate arranged marriages.

794
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:04,490
Compared to Taeja, Hanwool is too small for this to be mutually beneficial.

795
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:09,080
So, we need to go the other way.

796
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,880
Apart from corporate gains,

797
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,770
a man and a woman love each other so much and want to get married.

798
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:23,230
That's how you get the families to approve us as you want.

799
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:26,850
So, you're saying...

800
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,280
commit to acting like we really love each other.

801
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,160
Can you do it?

802
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,820
Of course.

803
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:41,750
Wow. You look like you could kill something.

804
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,670
You seem bursting with resolve.

805
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,940
I do well under pressure. I'm good at the real thing.

806
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,310
- Show me, then.
- What?

807
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:50,710
Tell me you love me. I'll grade you.

808
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,670
Why don't you go first?

809
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,470
If I do,

810
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:12,230
can you even handle it?

811
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:15,270
You couldn't even imagine, Han Yi Joo.

812
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,050
What?

813
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:19,540
How much...

814
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,800
I love you. And...

815
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,750
how long I've loved you.

816
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,650
How was that? Did you get any butterflies?

817
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:52,580
How come you went into business and not acting?

818
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:56,340
Thanks, but I was pretty good at business.

819
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:01,630
Do Guk! I think you should go.

820
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,600
What? Right now?

821
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,430
I'm not even going to remember what we discussed.

822
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,600
I'll put my info in an excel sheet and email it to you.

823
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,000
- I drove here.
- I know. So you should...

824
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:21,110
Just one night. You'll let me, right?

825
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,490
How many did he have?

826
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:40,570
Hey, if you're going to sleep, go inside. Huh?

827
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:46,380
Why is he sweating so much?

828
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:46,030
Seo Do Guk.

829
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:50,580
What are you dreaming about?

830
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:55,210
Who are you talking to? About what?

831
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,170
The more I get to know you,

832
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,960
the less I know who you are.

833
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,710
Oh, my God.

834
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:44,150
- Han Yi Joo?
- Oh, Mother?

835
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:48,160
Mother! Nothing happened. Really.

836
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,380
Don't treat me like I'm ancient.

837
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,140
I'm open-minded.

838
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,260
I studied abroad, you know.

839
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:58,240
Oh, you did. Maybe it's because I didn't.

840
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,350
But he...

841
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,180
Son? Seo Do Guk?

842
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:13,670
What's wrong with him?

843
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:16,080
What do you mean? He's asleep.

844
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,850
He's sleeping through all this noise? Seo Do Guk is?

845
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:20,090
Should I wake him up?

846
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:21,640
No!

847
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:27,370
He hasn't slept well all his life. Leave him be.

848
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:32,660
Are you leaving already?

849
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:40,650
All right. I can tell you this, Han Yi Joo.

850
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,750
Let's do it. A family introduction. With everyone.

851
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:47,190
- Pardon?
- Under one condition.

852
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,780
Can you keep a secret from Do Guk?

853
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,470
They want the families to meet?

854
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:54,960
Yes.

855
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,050
They asked about this weekend.

856
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:06,490
Hey. Cancel my reservation at Yooshinjung this weekend.

857
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:09,110
Make up some kind of excuse.

858
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:10,570
Okay.

859
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:14,720
Yooshinjung? Wasn't that with the Financial Services people?

860
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,040
I was going to spend money to make connections.

861
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,110
But we're about to be in-laws with the Taeja Group.

862
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,790
We can just use their connections now.

863
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:29,890
Not like this, though.

864
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:33,300
Madam Lee Tae Ja will be there from their side.

865
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,880
We need to be on their level.

866
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,360
Yes. It's me.

867
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,000
Can I put my father on?

868
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:45,610
Father.

869
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:46,710
[Grandfather]

870
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:48,500
It's Grandfather.

871
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:55,960
Yes.

872
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,790
Yes, Father.

873
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:08,160
Got it. Please take care of yourself. Bye.

874
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:14,640
He says, good luck with Yi Joo's wedding.

875
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,910
He approves.

876
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:23,880
What did you do? Huh?

877
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,670
Grandpa, please open the door!

878
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:31,730
If you keep doing this, we have to call the cops.

879
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:33,320
It's not going to work.

880
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:39,120
Even with our staff, he pretends not to hear unless it's what he wants to hear,

881
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:48,770
What he wants to hear?

882
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:52,970
<i>Yi Joo, you can't die...</i>

883
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,040
<i>You can't!</i>

884
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,700
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

885
