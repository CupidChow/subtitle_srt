[Episode 10]
Why do you need the basement storage key, Manager Kim?

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,760
It's always been here.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,360
Where is it?

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,510
Well...

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,490
She said she was getting rid of it because it's useless.

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,660
The point of that place is to store useless things.

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,890
Please give me the key.

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,210
Well, she said not to let anyone into the basement.

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,870
Let's say you left your desk for a minute.

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,590
And I went downstairs on my own.

21
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,780
Chairman, are you all right?

22
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,650
We will move to a vote so we can speed things along...

23
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,400
Wait!

24
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,870
I don't know if my son consented to this,

25
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,670
but I certainly do not as the majority shareholder.

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,810
Grandpa...

27
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,430
Let go of her hand right now!

28
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,590
Father, how did you...

29
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,970
Manager Kim?

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,650
Father, you have no right to weigh in on management anymore.

31
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,500
If anyone else interferes with the meeting, I will call the police-

32
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,670
What do you mean I have no right?

33
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,540
Oh, because I have dementia?

34
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,430
That was your fabrication!

35
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,400
What happened?

36
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,140
How could she do that?

37
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,470
What do you mean I fabricated it?

38
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,880
There's proof.

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,010
The courts already verified it!

40
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,760
Verified?

41
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,580
How can anyone verify a diagnosis you made up?

Shareholders.

Then, when the conservatorship is terminated,

45
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,140
all of my shares will be returned.

46
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,970
Chairman, does that mean you'll return to management?

47
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,470
Well, it's not exactly that.

48
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,920
Excuse me?

49
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,170
I will turn all of my shares...

50
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,610
over to my eldest granddaughter.

51
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,050
What?

52
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,600
How could this be?

53
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,670
Does this make sense?

54

Yes, Manager Oh. What's...

57
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,980
Ms. Han! Something happened.

58
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,430
At the shareholders' meeting...

59
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,300
You're handing over management to your granddaughter?

60
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,300
But she has never worked at our company. That's too...

61
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,860
May I have the floor?

62
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,260
Everyone, why do you assume that as family and as a large shareholder,

63
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,240
I would participate in management?

64
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,770
I saw with my own eyes what my family's greed and incompetence did to the company.

65
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,100
I have no intention of repeating those mistakes.

66
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,670
So, I plan on listening to executives who have worked for Hanwool for a long time.

67
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,670
And after a discussion with the strategy team,

68
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,570
I will invite a management professional to run Hanwool.

69
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,720
How can you trust her?

70
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,450
She could just sell off her shares.

71
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,750
If you want to convince the wise shareholders of Hanwool,

72
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,020
you need to back up your claims.

73
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,800
I agree with Han Yi Joo.

74
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,100
Sorry for the late introduction.

75
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,060
My name is Lee Ji Won.

76
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,360
I'm a shareholder who's followed Hanwool for a while.

77
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,830
Although Lee Jung Hye and I...

78
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,800
have some unfavorable history.

79
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,780
Lee Ji Won?

80
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,770
Yi Joo...

81
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,960
B-By chance, is she...

82
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,720
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

83
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,990
You were alive.

84
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,580
Thank goodness...

85
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,810
Thank goodness.

86
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,520
Long-time shareholders here know Chairman Han very well.

87
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,460
Does it look like he has issues, like Lee Jung Hye claims?

88
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,190
Grandpa.

89
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,460
I am...

90
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,080
someone with many issues.

91
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,890
When I look back, a lot of things I did were wrong...

92
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,280
and I tormented others because of my own greed many times.

93
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,360
I realize that finally, at this age.

94
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,090
Before it's too late, I want to be penitent

95
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,530
and I want to help everything return to its place.

96
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,540
I know it's shameless,

97
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,170
but just this once...

98
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,430
please put your faith in me.

99
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,220
We accept you!

100
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,260
Welcome back!

101
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,330
Welcome back, Chairman!

102
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,260
Applause, applause!

103
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,260
Chairwoman! Chairwoman!

104
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,090
Shouldn't you go after her?

105
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,710
Let her be. I know where she's going.

106
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,800
Yi Joo, you told me...

107
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,660
I should have approached you honestly from the get-go.

108
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,940
You're right.

109
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:48,220
Approaching you under false pretenses to make you like me for whatever reason...

110
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,210
It wasn't the right thing to do.

111
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,110
I should have let you resent me as much as you wanted.

112
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,530
Then, I should have worked hard to win your trust.

113
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll be ready when you are.

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,340
When you feel like you can hear me out...

115
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,020
see me again.

116
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,410
I'll be waiting.

117
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,170
Please take care of my Yi Joo.

118
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,370
Of course.

119
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,180
[Han Jin Woong and Han Yi Joo are a paternal match]

120
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,200
Honey!

121
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,900
There's a problem with the company.

122
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,450
- What?
- At the shareholders meeting...

123
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,050
your father said he's giving all his shares to Yi Joo.

124
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,630
Then, that Yi Joo says...

125
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,650
she has no desire to run the company.

126
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,480
She wants to bring in a management professional?

127
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,340
Who does she think she is, talking about your position like that?

128
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,030
Right.

129
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,350
The position you wanted to take by any means.

130
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,900
What?

131
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,500
- What are you-
- Did you think I wouldn't know what you wanted?

132
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,050
Welcome, Chairman and Ms. Han.

133
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,440
Who...

134
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,150
Long time no see, Madam.

135
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,910
Don't you remember me?

136
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,620
I thought you might have gotten better at housework after kicking me out...

137
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,940
but I see that's not true.

138
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,840
A-All of you...

139
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,590
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes, Chairman.

140
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,120
What did you say the first agenda item at the shareholders' meeting was?

141
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,720
The dismissal of Chairman Han Jin Woong.

142
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,240
The second was the appointment of Director Lee Jung Hye.

143
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,600
Yes.

144
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,650
T-That was because of Yi Joo.

145
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,210
You were sick.

146
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,420
If I hadn't done anything, Yi Joo would have stolen the company. I had no choice-

147
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,460
That would be better than you stealing it.

148
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,290
Because Yi Joo is my child.

149
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,830
That's a lie!

150
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,800
The papers Yi Joo gave you are fake!

151
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,840
This is not from Yi Joo. I did the test myself.

152
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,980
What did you say?

153
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,140
Don't you understand? Yi Joo is my birth daughter.

154
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,980
Dad.

155
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,830
What do you mean by that?

156
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,680
What is going on? Are you all pranking me?

157
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,880
That doesn't make any sense. How can she...

158
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,360
Why wouldn't it make sense?

159
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,280
- What?
- Does this seem like a joke to you?

160
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,690
Really?

161
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,710
When did you find out that Yi Joo was Jin Woong's child?

162
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,590
I... I had no idea.

163
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,070
If I knew Yoo Ra's father had another child, I would not have stayed quiet.

164
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,400
And you...

165
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,300
What are you so proud of?

166
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,290
- Are you proud of having a bastard child?
- What?

167
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,820
You're the same, Jung Hye.

168
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,680
You pushed yourself in here with Yoo Ra in tow.

169
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,200
That's different!

170
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,500
Yoo Ra is his real child.

171
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,310
Han Yi Joo, she is fake!

172
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,120
Get out.

173
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,150
Honey.

174
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,400
Please listen to me.

175
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,590
Mr. Choi, what are you doing? Get her out of here!

176
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,050
- Yes, Chairman.
- Honey...

177
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,260
Honey... Honey, Honey!

178
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,310
Honey!

179
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,600
- Mom!
- Yoo Ra, stay right here!

180
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,480
- Yoo Ra!
- If you leave now, I'm done with you, too.

181
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,140
- Yoo Ra!
- Mom!

182
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,340
Wait a minute!

183
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,980
Looking good.

184
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,040
Are you happy now?

185
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,060
Seeing me like this?

186
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,410
Lee Jung Hye, why did you try to kill us?

187
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,130
Were you that scared?

188
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,940
You weren't sure if you could win Father on your own?

189
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,890
Is that why you tried to kill my mom and me?

190
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,270
What?

191
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,790
I did what?

192
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,800
This is absolutely ridiculous.

193
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,500
Now you're accusing someone of murder?

194
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:40,070
Do you have any proof that I did?

195
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,190
I'll find it.

196
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,450
I can't believe he only kicked you to the curb.

197
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,310
I guess Father has some love left for you.

198
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,550
But I don't.

199
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,470
I need to at least put you behind bars.

200
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,060
Really?

201
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Go ahead and try me, then.

202
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,770
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but do you have a different card we can try?

203
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,200
[Not Authorized]

204
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,870
Maybe a different one?

205
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,560
They're company cards. They should work.
[Not Authorized]

206
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,180
Try it again.

207
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,690
What are you doing in these humble quarters?

208
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,660
I just need to dry my clothes. Go out for a few hours.

209
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,150
Hey, are you even going to be able to pay me?

210
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,200
What? That's just chump change.

211
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,050
Room 302.

212
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,490
What happened to Lee Jung Hye the great?

213
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,160
How did you know she'd come here?

214
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,610
Who else would Lee Jung Hye meet with in her situation?

215
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,500
She says she'll pay me 300 million won if I kill a girl named Han Yi Joo.

216
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,300
How much can you pay?

217
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,780
A wiretap?

218
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,860
Here's an advance.

219
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,670
If there's anything good...

220
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:30,170
I'll give you double what she promised you.

221
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,670
Thank you.

222
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,420
- What?
- You're upset and not eating, huh?

223
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,310
You'll ruin your body.

224
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,590
Ji Won is alive...

225
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,380
She looks healthy and well.

226
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,230
She's already met with Yi Joo.

227
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,640
We should go see her and beg for forgiveness.

228
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,500
I can't see Ji Won. I'm too ashamed.

229
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,850
I'm sorry, Jin Woong.

230
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,490
This is all my fault.

231
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,700
- I opposed your relationship.
- No.

232
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,870
I'm the one who didn't recognize my own daughter.

233
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,370
Father, I actually thought...

234
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,610
Yi Joo was more like me than Yoo Ra.

235
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,290
I didn't like that. So, I neglected her even more.

236
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,570
I didn't like that a girl from someone else's blood was more like me.

237
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,400
How can I ask her for forgiveness?

238
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,990
What in the world...

239
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,560
How could something like this happen?

240
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,940
Chairman Han Jin Woong was your birth father?

241
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yi Joo, will you be all right? Lee Jung Hye won't just sit back.

242
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,070
She went as far as to poison you.

243
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,500
What do you mean? Poison?

244
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,040
She did that when Yi Joo was little.

245
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,790
What does she have against Yi Joo?

246
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,320
So, what will you do with that family?

247
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,810
Will you be able to accept your father?

248
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,200
I don't know yet.

249
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,380
But I think I'll be weighing in on company matters.

250
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,020
The company? You mean Hanwool?

251
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,980
My grandfather is giving me his shares.

252
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,480
Chairman Han Woon Jae's?

253
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,370
Isn't the Chairman a majority shareholder?

254
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,490
I'll bring in a management professional to run the company.

255
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,790
A professional? Someone outside your family?

256
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,950
Yes. Everything that happened in my family...

257
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,380
stemmed from the desire to take over the company.

258
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,090
The family doesn't need to be the ones to run the company.

259
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,940
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

260
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,850
No, you are right.

261
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:14,200
Running a company should be the job of someone who is good at it.

262
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,180
Yi Joo, you are a wise person.

263
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,020
Even after all that hardship, you turned out so well.

264
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,000
What? The family doesn't need to run the company?

265
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,710
Who does she think she is?

266
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,240
[Han Yoo Ra]

267
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,140
[Han Yoo Ra]

268
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,490
[Director of Accounting and Liability]

269
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,950
Yes, this is Seo Jung Wook.

270
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,190
Mr. Vice President.

271
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,200
I checked on the leaders of affiliated companies, as you asked.

272
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,820
The ladies are moving together

273
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,330
and making contact with Madam Cha Yeon Hwa.

274
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,940
- My mother?
- Yes.

275
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,280
Well...

276
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,480
Madam Cha, how is the Chairman doing?

277
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,850
We were so scared to hear that he fainted.

278
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,920
He's doing a lot better.

279
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,290
Thank you for asking.

280
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,900
Thank goodness.

281
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,270
But since he's getting older...

282
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,130
Is there anything else you want to ask me?

283
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,440
We should know.

284
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,320
In the family of President Seo Young Kyun...

285
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,280
Between your two sons, who is going to be the successor?

286
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,910
As for that...

287
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,930
we're still waiting to see...

288
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:11,200
who has the capacity to lead the Taeja Group well.

289
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,310
- But...
- But?

290
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,540
But?

291
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,850
I'll have to thoroughly discuss it...

292
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:21,500
with my husband, and we'll be on the same page, pushing for the same child.

293
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,730
Is that a good enough answer?

294
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,640
Well, I guess...

295
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,320
She won't say it out loud, but Madam Cha...

296
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,260
Everyone knows.

297
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,340
My mother's birth child is Seo Do Guk.

298
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,140
What if you had a conversation with the President?

299
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,820
Am I not your son?

300
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,300
You want that to be my pitch?

301
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,750
That applies to my rival, too.

302
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,160
I need something else.

303
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,170
Something other than what we've seen.

304
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,900
Why is it so hard to get in touch with you? I called many times.

305
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,080
I've been busy.

306
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,100
So, what does that mean?

307
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,970
Han Yi Joo is Chairman Han's birth daughter?

308
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,930
Dad did a paternity test.

309
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,200
But aren't those things almost always scams?

310
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,330
Strands of hair, fingernails, or toenails are enough to test.

311
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,680
You get results in a day, too.

312
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,500
How do you know that, Jung Wook?

313
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:39,120
Because I tested my father and Seo Do Guk.

314
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,810
Anyway, seems like your territory is going to get even smaller.

315
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,760
You and your sister might be trading places.

316
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,630
Trade places?

317
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,930
You've never known what it feels like to be a burden at a stranger's house, right?

318
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,210
But I know.

319
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,270
If someone who's been treated that way is now recognized as "real,"

320
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,000
she'll never let that go.

321
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,650
Then what can I do?

322
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,960
Han Yi Joo got Mom kicked out and got Dad on her side.

323
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,800
What can I do? What should I do?

324
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,430
What are you doing?

325
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,960
I'm decluttering my paintings.

326
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,650
I don't want to make sad paintings like these from now on.

327
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,680
Don't throw them away.

328
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,350
- Why not?
- Because they're good.

329
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,340
Your paintings.

330
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,570
Since when do you like them?

331
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,000
But you know my paintings that Lee Jung Hye sold abroad?

332
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,240
- Yeah.
- There's one that I really want to track down.

333
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,430
I've asked everywhere, but I can't find it.

334
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,200
It's pretty big, so you can't miss it.

335
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,810
Well, what is it like?

336
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,690
The title is...

337
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,100
"Frozen Spring."

338
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,290
I thought my life would be forever winter back then.

339
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,030
I wanted to show it to you, too.

340
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,420
We can welcome spring together now.

341
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,050
That's good enough for me.

342
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,010
What should we do when spring comes? I have an idea.

343
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,760
Really? What is it?

344
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,120
- We should register our marriage.
- What?

345
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,500
- What?
- Why are you so surprised?

346
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,850
Were you going to try it out after the wedding...

347
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,280
and ditch me if you weren't feeling it?

348
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,820
What do you mean? Of course not.

349
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,840
I just...

350
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,410
Are you still nervous?

351
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,850
No.

352
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,270
Okay. Let's do it.

353
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,760
I want to.

354
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,900
Really?

355
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,210
Yes.

356
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,220
Those two must be relaxed now, thinking it's all over.

357
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,320
The timing is right for us to retaliate.

358
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,580
Do you have a good idea to do that?

359
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,700
I'll take care of that.

360
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,250
Yoo Ra, you can do what you can do.

361
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,370
What I can do...

362
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,910
Sell the paintings you have stashed away for the slush fund.

363
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,720
You might get fired from the gallery soon.

364
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,720
You should collect the money from the paintings before that.

365
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,390
If we're going to bribe the executives, we'll need the cash.

366
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,050
I'll think about it.

367
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,170
And your room in the Taeja Hotel...

368
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,730
Can I stay there for a while?

369
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,830
Sure.

370
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,450
Get some pretty new clothes, too.

371
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,450
Thank you, Jung Wook.

372
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,030
We should help each other out.

373
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,620
At least while we are partners who need each other.

374
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,900
Eat. You're looking even thinner.

375
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,580
Wow, your hair is so soft.

376
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,970
You look pretty.

377
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,110
Did you just notice that?

378
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,080
I'm saying you look prettier every time I look at you.

379
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,240
Let's...

380
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,350
have a baby soon.

381
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,240
- A baby?
- Yeah.

382
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,300
I want at least two.

383
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,570
What do you think?

384
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,120
I don't know. I've never really thought about it.

385
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,570
Same here.

386
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:53,590
But thinking about a child who looks like me and the person I love coming into this world...

387
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,150
It must feel so joyful.

388
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,890
When we have a baby, I'll work from home more.

389
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,850
And on weekends, I'll go out with them so you can rest.

390
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,150
Do Guk, you're getting ahead of yourself.

391
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,880
Oh, am I?

392
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,650
Let's give it some thought.

393
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,470
I'll be optimistic about it.

394
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,970
Sure.

395
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,740
We've gone through many tough things together so far.

396
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,840
And we'll continue to. Right?

397
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,240
Of course. No matter what happens, we will.

398
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,790
[Solnoori Psychiatry]
So you need to prove that her grandfather doesn't have dementia.

399
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,190
Yes. About the evaluation and the results,

400
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,490
you might need to testify in court.

401
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,750
Is that okay?

402
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,840
That won't be a big deal.

403
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,660
But I'm telling you right now, I will only tell the truth.

404
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,960
If the evaluation results aren't good...

405
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,910
Of course. You're an honest doctor.

406
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,030
- What?
- That's why...

407
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,410
you told my wife all about my illness at that time.

408
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:09,520
Hey, you should have told her that first.

409
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,260
- Speaking of, are you-
- Okay.

410
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,130
I got it.

411
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,240
- What else?
- What?

412
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,430
Huh? You look like you have something else to say.

413
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:26,020
What is it? I don't do counseling for relationship issues.

414
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,580
- You're psychic.
- Dang it...

415
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,830
Actually...

416
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,610
- there's something I haven't told my wife.
- What?

417
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,090
Is that becoming a hobby of yours?

418
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,780
I didn't lie.

419
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,950
It won't hurt anyone, either.

420
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,640
So...

421
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,310
do I still need to tell her?

422
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:53,670
Do Guk, if you decide what you do or don't tell her...

423
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,710
you'll start hiding everything that makes you look bad.

424
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,170
Do you think that's a healthy relationship?

425
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,210
I don't know what it is, but spill it soon.

426
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,020
You should tell her before she finds out herself

427
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,880
for the best chance of her understanding.

428
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,350
Mom?

429
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,990
Yoo Ra!

430
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,740
Look at your face. Why do you look so thin?

431
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,740
Mom...

432
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,260
I don't know what to do.

433
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,420
Why? Did something happen?

434
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,080
Well...

435
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,120
I'm pregnant.

436
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,530
- What?
- I'm pregnant!

437
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,530
My period was way late, so I checked...

438
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,550
- Mom?
- I'm so proud of you.

439
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm so proud of you. That's my daughter.

440
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,600
How far along are you?

441
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,580
Does Seo Jung Wook know?

442
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,530
- Not yet.
- Why didn't you tell him? Hurry up and tell him.

443
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,380
What are you so happy about?

444
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,300
- What?
- Think about it.

445
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,950
That family won't welcome me just because I have a kid.

446
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,570
What do you mean?

447
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,060
This child is Taeja Group's only heir.

448
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,000
Chairman Lee Tae Ja says she's a meritocrat or whatever,

449
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,670
but she's a huge sucker for her grandsons.

450
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:08,000
If she hears you're having her great-grandchild, she'll love you.

451
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,720
First, I'll look for a good gynecologist.

452
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,520
Gosh, I'm going to have so much to do.

453
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,460
Mom, where have you been?

454
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,180
What? A friend's place.

455
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,050
You're not coming home?

456
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,980
After being humiliated like that?

457
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,730
Not until your father begs for forgiveness.

458
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,070
What?

459
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,570
Han Yi Joo being Dad's birth daughter...

460
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,220
You really didn't know, right?

461
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,590
Of course not. Why would I lie?

462
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,540
Are you suspicious of your mom, too?

463
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,110
It's not that. Why would I?

464
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,900
Right?

465
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,850
My beautiful daughter.

466
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:01,080
I protected you and raised you all this time.

467
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,960
Yoo Ra. Be proud.

468
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,540
No one can stop us now.

469
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,430
You want an advance?

470
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,720
That's the industry standard. Half up front.

471
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,280
Since when are you a rule follower?

472
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,420
I don't know if you'd be able to pay me the lump sum.

473
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,980
My daughter is the CEO of a gallery.

474
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,790
We can prepare tens of millions in a second.

475
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,910
Sure, ma'am.

476
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,880
You've heard of the artist Sun Jin, right?

477
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,320
The guy who killed himself in the mountains? He's famous.

478
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,050
I have an unreleased piece of his.

479
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,920
If I show it, people will fight to buy it.

480
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,060
This is Lee Jung Hye and Jo Dong Soo?

481
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,660
- How did you get it?
- We wiretapped Jo Dong Soo.

482
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:07,690
That woman is certainly going to do something.

483
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,830
So are you saying that painting is at the gallery?

484
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,780
No. Somewhere else.

485
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,870
It'll be ready soon.

486
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,160
Come to think of it, whenever Lee Jung Hye needed a lot of money,

487
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,680
she would go find a Sun Jin piece.

488
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,770
That's what she's planning this time, too.

489
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,500
You don't know where she's getting those paintings?

490
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,830
No. They were always directly shipped to the gallery.

491
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,600
If we could find out where they're shipping from...

492
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,700
Hold on.

493
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,950
See this?

494
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,770
It's a 40-year-old painting.

495
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,050
How could the area covered by wood and exposed area be the same color?

496
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:54,170
It's been painted over with coffee-colored paint to make it look older and covered with cloth.

497
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,710
That means it's fake.

498
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:02,000
Right. It was proven that the Sun Jin pieces Lee Jung Hye brought in were fake.

499
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,920
Lee Jung Hye isn't hunting down Sun Jin's pieces. She's making them.

500
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,950
- What?
- Excuse me?

501
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:11,320
An imitation artist must be painting them somewhere.

502
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,630
If we can raid the place, she can be charged with forgery.

503
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,250
No.

504
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,550
You're wrong about that.

505
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:21,500
- What?
- I know more about Sun Jin than anyone else.

506
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,880
The paintings Lee Jung Hye brings in are by Sun Jin.

507
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,020
I'm certain.

508
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,360
No. I'm certain they're fake.

509
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,970
You have the proof, Manager Kim.

510
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,640
- What do you mean...
- The Sun Jin piece I gave you...

511
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,140
Get it authenticated.

512
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,180
If I'm wrong, I'll give you my entire net worth.

513
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,340
What is this?

514
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,630
It's as you can see.

515
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,010
I'm...

516
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,260
having a baby.

517
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,470
Is it mine?

518
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,980
- Is it?
- Do you think if you insult me like this...

519
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,280
I'd go away on my own, by chance?

520
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,630
It is your child.

521
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,590
I'm going to keep it and raise it.

522
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,450
As Taeja Group's...

523
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,460
As your heir.

524
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,470
First...

525
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,410
you're wrong.

526
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,590
I'm not trying to insult you. I wanted to check.

527
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,950
What?

528
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,730
Good job, Yoo Ra.

529
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,060
Do you mean that?

530
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,960
Of course.

531
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,880
Making a family?

532
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,520
Of course, that's a good thing.

533
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,110
- Father.
- Hey.

534
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,800
You haven't been to a spot like this in a while, right?

535
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,310
What's the occasion? Meeting outside the house.

536
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,680
Just because. I also wanted to talk to you quietly.

537
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,450
If you're asking me for a favor, it's not going to happen.

538
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:37,220
You heard about the affiliated companies and their leaders, right?

539
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,050
You know.

540
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,960
To your grandmother, I'm just one of the head count.

541
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,000
Don't resent me.

542
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,350
It was never my decision who would be the group's successor.

543
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:00,200
Resent? I already did that a long time ago.

544
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,120
What?

545
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,500
When I was little...

546
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,720
you told me I was all you needed, then got remarried.

547
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,600
then got married again.

548
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,970
Why did you make me feel so alone in this big house?

549
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,750
- Jung Wook, that...
- Father.

550
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,630
That's not what I wanted to talk to you about.

551
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,340
Actually...

552
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,830
Yoo Ra is pregnant.

553
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,950
What? She's pregnant?

554
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,100
You're in a bind, right?

555
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,850
I felt the same way.

556
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,390
On top of my situation, if I said Yoo Ra was pregnant,

557
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,010
I thought things would only get worse.

558
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,700
But after some thought, I felt so bad for Yoo Ra.

559
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,190
So I made up my mind. We're keeping it.

560
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,190
It might not be so easy.

561
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,460
Your grandmother...

562
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,990
might not accept it.

563
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,630
But I can't abandon my family.

564
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,460
You didn't abandon me, either.

565
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,850
Jung Wook...

566
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,910
Go ahead, eat.

567
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,250
It's just us two, the first time in a while. I want to enjoy the meal.

568
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,030
CEO Han! You have a guest...

569
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,890
A guest?

570
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,000
Who are you?

571
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,060
You don't remember?

572
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,690
I said hi to Jung Hye in front of your house.

573
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,370
I guess it's true you're the CEO.

574
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,010
So, you can buy and sell paintings here if you're the CEO?

575
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,460
You can't just come in here.

576
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,840
- What?
- Didn't you hear me?

577
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,210
Please leave.

578
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,390
Want me to call the police?

579
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,130
Shit...

580
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,260
Damn.

581
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,760
W-What are you doing?

582
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,010
Hey. Your mom and I go way back.

583
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,940
Go way back? What-

584
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,600
Have some manners for your mom's friend.

585
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,830
If I had a child back then, she would be right around your age.

586
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,290
Oh? Hold on.

587
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:27,510
You do look a little bit like me.

588
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,860
That can't be.

589
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,260
Huh?

590
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,520
She couldn't have had a baby without telling me.

591
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,230
She knows what I'm like.

592
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,880
What is this?

593
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,840
It belongs to your mom.

594
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,530
She left it at the motel.

595
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,260
Hey!

596
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,410
Yoo Ra, where have you been this whole time?

597
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,770
How have you been?

598
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,880
You don't have to worry about me.

599
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,930
I came to see you because I have a question.

600
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,650
A question?

601
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,900
Who is Jo Dong Soo?

602
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,280
Do you know, Grandpa?

603
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,380
How do you know that man?

604
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,680
He showed up at the gallery.

605
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:51,620
He looked like he was up to no good.

606
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,220
I'm wondering if he's holding money over my mom's head.

607
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,420
Jo Dong Soo...

608
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:02,700
Your mother was with him before she met Jin Woong.

609
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,990
Not only that...

610
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,450
You know your mom had you because of my disapproval, then married Jin Woong, right?

611
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,320
She hired that man...

612
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,680
and tried to kill Yi Joo and her mother.

613
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,940
Nonsense!

614
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,980
How could that...

615
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,330
Han Yi Joo told you all this, right?

616
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,040
You believe everything she says?

617
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,690
It's all true.

618
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,920
This is who your mother really is.

619
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,860
Lee Jung Hye...

620
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:49,030
She will use and ruin anyone who gets in her way, even family.

621
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:53,810
I'm saying you won't be an exception, either.

622
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,930
Look here.

623
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:12,880
They should be different colors from oxidation.

624
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,060
But the part that's covered and the part that's exposed are the same color.

625
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:20,820
It's been tampered with to make it look like an older painting.

626
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,230
You're saying this painting is a fake?

627
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,840
But it's so strange...

628
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,780
The colors, composition, the signature...

629
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:35,060
The piece itself is perfect.

630
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,650
No way.

631
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,300
Our piece is a fake?

632
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,100
It's being authenticated. We'll have the results soon.

633
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,590
The gallery will have to close, then.

634
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:48,550
Why are you going this far?

635
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,190
Then why are you doing this to me?

636
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,990
- What?
- You know I'm our father's birth daughter.

637
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,990
Shouldn't you at least say you're sorry?

638
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,990
Everything I went through in that house. Are you faultless?

639
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,730
Or you...

640
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:06,410
Do you still believe what Lee Jung Hye says?

641
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:09,160
Keep Mom's name out of your mouth. I don't want to hear it.

642
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,530
You should know by now.

643
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:15,460
All Lee Jung Hye knows how to do is lie.

644
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,840
She told me all my life.

645
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,780
That I'm fake, and you're real.

646
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,010
What does that mean?

647
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,870
- Do you mean that I'm fake?
- What?

648
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:24,660
You just said my mom only knows how to lie!

649
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,960
So you're real, and I'm-

650
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:36,170
You must know something.

651
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:37,900
Right?

652
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:42,140
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

653
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:57,230
Mom, Han Yi Joo came to the gallery today.

654
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,570
Yes, Madam.

655
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:01,200
I'm out of the country for a bit.

656
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,980
I needed to clear my head.

657
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,930
My husband told me to go take a break.

658
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:10,510
Yoo Ra? She's doing well.

659
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:15,940
Actually, she's pregnant.

660
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,230
The folks at Taeja Group are so happy.

661
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:22,260
She's going to marry their eldest son soon.

662
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,170
I know, right? Double in-laws.

663
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:31,050
Of course, Yoo Ra's husband will be the group's successor.

664
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,420
[CEO Han Yoo Ra]

665
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:46,040
I actually thought Yi Joo was more like me than Yoo Ra.

666
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,970
You do look a little bit like me.

667
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,610
Your mother was with him before she met Jin Woong.

668
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,140
You should know by now.

669
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,710
All Lee Jung Hye knows how to do is lie.

670
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,710
She told me all my life. That I'm fake, and you're real.

671
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,000
Yoo Ra, you're real. Han Yi Joo is fake.

672
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,230
You're real, and she's fake.

673
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,020
Yoo Ra, you're the real one.

674
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,250
Yi Joo is fake!

675
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,270
It can't be.

676
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,140
It can't be true.

677
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,210
I'm just going to double-check that it's not true.

678
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,760
Yeah.

679
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,990
Yoo Ra, where were you all day yesterday?

680
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,040
I couldn't get in touch with you. I was so worried.

681
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,390
Why do I need to tell you everything?

682
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,300
What about Seo Jung Wook's parents?

683
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,440
Did you set up a time to see them?

684
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,490
Want to eat something?

685
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:08,940
You like the brunch here, Mom.

686
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,810
I need to get to the gallery.

687
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:14,310
I'm going to set aside a few pieces.

688
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,640
They'll be heavy.

689
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,790
I have someone helping. Waiting outside.

690
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,200
Really?

691
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,600
But Mom, I have a question.

692
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,510
What is it?

693
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,340
I'm going to ask you for the last time.

694
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,920
Did you really not know that Han Yi Joo was Dad's birth daughter?

695
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,070
Mom.

696
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,750
Are you sure you didn't do anything bad?

697
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,890
And...

698
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:48,540
am I Dad's birth daughter?

699
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,000
- What is this, all of a sudden?
- Answer me.

700
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:55,910
Yoo Ra.

701
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:01,180
I'm also going to speak only once, so listen carefully.

702
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,390
Han Yi Joo is a liar.

703
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:07,340
I haven't done anything wrong.

704
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,400
And of course!

705
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,330
You're Dad's birth daughter!

706
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,700
Okay.

707
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,130
Is that so?

708
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,790
What's wrong? What's going on?

709
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,900
No, it's nothing.

710
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,950
Yes, Manager Oh.

711
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,660
Got it.

712
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,340
The gallery? What's up?

713
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,990
Our gallery is being charged with selling a fake piece.

714

Han Yi Joo reported us.

715
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:47,990
- What?
- And...

716
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:51,450
Manager Oh told the police that you're here.

717
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,930
- Let's leave now.
- I'll right here.

718
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,420
I thought someone was waiting for you.

719

See you later, then.

Let's go sell them in Japan.

728

This is where she's been making the fakes?

741

I thought I was aware of her every move.

742
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,980
She had me wait outside when she went to visit Chairman Han

743
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,100
and went into another room as well.
