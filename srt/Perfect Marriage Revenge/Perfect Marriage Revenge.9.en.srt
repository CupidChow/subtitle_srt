Auntie, it's me.

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,770
I sent you a photo. Do you know who it is?

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,380
Well? I'm not really sure. Why?

13
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,630
His name is Dong Soo. Jo Dong Soo.

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,450
He must be in his mid-fifties now.

15
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,800
Maybe that's the man who came to see Lee Jung Hye.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,830
Dong Soo?

17
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,260
Jo Dong Soo...

Oh, yes!

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,310
Every time he came, he would say, "Jung Hye, Dung Soo is here!"

20
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,740
That's right, Dong Soo!

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,380
When I learned that Jin Woong was seeing someone,

22
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,640
your mother was already pregnant with you.

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,540
I said, absolutely not.

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,800
I told her to walk away.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,510
I gave her money.

26
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:05,010
Soon after, I heard there was a fire at your house that killed you and your mom.

27
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,010
How did Lee Jung Hye come to marry my dad?

28
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,360
She was an assistant in the secretary's office.

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,630
She was polite and good at her job.

30
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,650
After your mother and Jin Woong broke up,

31
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,950
Jin Woong went through a hard time, and the two of them bonded.

32
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,920
She even brought a guy around sometimes.

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,600
Some guy who looked like he was up to no good!

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,350
How dare you grovel back to this house?

35
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,170
Why? Do you want to die by my hand for good?

36
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,850
Yi Joo. Are you all right?

37
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,580
Lee Jung Hye...

38
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,740
tried to kill my mom and me...

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,530
By paying a man...

40
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,730
- she was seeing.

Are you feeling better?

44
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,300
I can't figure it out.

45
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,430
Why would Lee Jung Hye do that to me?

46
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,220
Stop thinking about it.

47
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,840
Why search for a reason?

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,820
She's not the type of person we can understand.

49
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,430
Then...

50
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,690
why did those things happen to me?

51
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,430
It wasn't enough for her to try to kill me.

52
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,290
She adopted me from the orphanage.

53
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,610
All that hatred and bullying...

54
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,540
for no reason?

55
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,860
Then why did those things happen to me?

56
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,420
Why?

57
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,850
Han Yi Joo must not know, right?

58
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,740
That her being alive at all is a crime.

59
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,010
I don't know how she survived the fire...

60
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,410
but if so, she should have been tucked away in the orphanage.

61
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:03,430
I think about how she tried so hard to get me to notice her...

62
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,070
You know, she's just like her mother.

63
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,190
Acting like she doesn't want anything, that she's so innocent.

64
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,110
Then eventually, trying to have it all!

65
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,660
Don't resent me for this.

66
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,870
You're the one who got yourself tangled up with that woman.

67
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,100
This is all your karma.

68
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,660
Deal with it.

70
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,880
What are you doing here?

71
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,240
I thought about your question.

72
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,770
But even after a whole night, I can't come up with anything.

73
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,640
Why you should have gone through any of it.

74
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,510
Han Yi Joo was just a small child then.

75
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,740
Those things happened when she should have been receiving overflowing love.

76
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,630
They're bad people.

77
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,370
You didn't do anything wrong. Not at all.

78
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,450
So, tell Chairman Han Jin Woong.

79
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,050
Why did you do this to me?

80
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,030
Get mad at him, then get his answer.

81
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,210
You have the right.

82
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,050

83
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,940
You're right.

84
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,940
I put it off, saying it wouldn't make a difference.

85
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,950
But that's not true.

86
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,890
It was because of what his answer might be.

87
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,210
I was afraid of it.

95
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,980

- What?
- Your wife said not to let anyone in.

99
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,680
Should we make her leave?

100
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,900
No, let her in.

103
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,240
Why? Didn't you want me to end up like this?

104
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,870
I did?

What do you think she's doing at your company right now?

111
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,240
I have been delegated the Chairman's management rights

112
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,890
and as of today, I'm the owner of this seat.

113

She must be telling a room full of executives...

114

Chairman Han Jin Woong might not be coming back.

115
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,620
What did you say?

116
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,780
Well, I'm sure it's just temporary.

117
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,930
The Chairman will be back soon, right?

118
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,900
Everyone, you don't seem to understand the situation, do you?

119
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,810
What did you say? Understand the situation?

120
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:58,220
Are you saying we should just sit still and wait for the Chairman to come back? In this crisis?

121

She'll make a power move to strengthen her position.

122

The maximum interest limit laws are making loan business a challenge as a whole.

You all know that the acquisition of Savings Bank, which we wanted for a long time, failed.

124
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:17,670
I would not take this seat to simply be a stand-in, doing nothing at a time like this.

125
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:26,810
I'm here with a heart of a general at the frontlines of a battle.

126

We don't need a daughter like you, either. Let's go our own ways.

What did you say?

134
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,040

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,310
You can check for yourself.

180
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,480
If you still can't believe me after that...

181
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,000
you'd be choosing not to believe me.

182
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,280
The thing you told me over the phone.

183
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,690
I didn't have the chance to say thank you.

184
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,130
You were a big help.

185
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,560
The only ones who knew of that video's existence were

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,300
Lee Jung Hye, myself, and Mr. Yoo's mother.

187

When I went through Mr. Yoo's mother's phone...

188

But why are you helping us?

190

You work for Lee Jung Hye.

192
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,840
Is that why you called me here?

193
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:11,480
It's not any less than what you two have against her.

194
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,550
It's family-related.

195
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,870
Then, you and I must be on the same page.

196
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,660
Right now...

197
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:27,880
I could maim her to death and it wouldn't be enough.

198
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,790
But I can't do that. So I thought...

199
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,010
how can I torture Lee Jung Hye?

200
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,140
What could be her...

201
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,820

202
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,830
Why did you bring him home?

203
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,890
You should've let him stay at the hospital.

204
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,400
Okay, he's all set.

205
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,860
It'll be better for him to rest at home.

I think I need to run the company in your dad's place.

209

You can help me out, right, Yoo Ra?

210
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,760
Then, can I run the gallery?

211
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,280
- What?
- That was the plan anyway.

212
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,150
I'll do a good job.

213
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:40,450
When Dad sees it later, I'll make him realize that I'm capable.

217
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,390
Of course.

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,660
Honey, my wrist is hurting.

356
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,490
Your wrist is hurting? Oh, no...

357
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,040
- It hurts.
- Oh no!

358
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,620
Hey.

359
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,330
All of you, leave. Right now.

360
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,110
- Gosh, come on.
- Stop it!

361
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,150
I'll get the alcohol.

362
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,410
Yi Joo, you look so pretty when you smile.

363
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,890
Is that what got Seo Do Guk to fall for you?

364
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,640
What?

365
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,740
Yi Joo was always pretty.

366
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,320
So smile, Unni.

367
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,140
We're all on your side. Don't worry.

368
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,970
- Okay.
- Shall we do cheers?

369
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,070
Cheers.

370
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,250
Oh, we're out of alcohol.

371
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,020
What did you say?

372
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,470
You don't have any alcohol? My goodness!

373
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,510
I'll go get some.

374
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,090
I'm sorry. I know this is a difficult time for you.

375
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,270
Having them over is too crazy, right?

376
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,330
They're trying to cheer us up.

377
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,170
Thanks to them, I'm smiling.

378
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,780
You...

379
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,620
seem a little different.

380
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,460
How do I say this?

381
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,840
You seem more at ease.

382
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,190
I saw someone who reminded me of the old me.

383
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,880
Why? Didn't you want me to end up like this?

384
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,930
Go away! Mr. Choi!

385
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,500
Mr. Choi!

386
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,960
I pitied him. He had no one he could trust.

387
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,960
Wrapped up in nothing but directionless anger.

388
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,940
He reminded me of myself before I met you.

389
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,530
I'm not going to live like that anymore.

390
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,300
Because I have you, and my family.

391
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,740
Right.

392
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,970
Let's make sure to become happy.

393
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:03,910
So, Chairman Han Woon Jae's health issues led to the son taking over suddenly, causing problems.

394
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,270
What if the angle was like, "Do you really want that to happen again?"

395
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,800
Well, yes. You need some emotional appeal for the shareholders, too.

396
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,510
Wow. Su Jin, you are so smart.

397
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,050
This is nothing.

398
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,610
I've been doing this for years, you know.

399
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,090
What are you guys doing?

400
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,340
What is that?

401
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,270
Hanwool's shareholder list. Do Na brought it.

402
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,460
How did you get that?

403
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,400
We'll make a draft of the letter to be sent to small shareholders.

404
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,390
The people who have more than that, you should meet in person.

405
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,350
Here's the list.

406
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,590
[Shareholder List]

407
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,810
Thanks, you guys.

408
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,360
I haven't done anything for you, and you've done so much...

409
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,970
Stop being so serious. It's nothing.

410
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,630
My intelligent wife is right.

411
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,800
Family should help each other out.

412
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,380
Excuse me? I'm a friend.

413
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,930
Does an acquaintance count?

414
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,780
What are you going to do today?

415
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,770
Looking over the shareholder list.

416
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,660
You're so busy.

417
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,370
You never rest.

418
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,070
Neither do you.

419
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,360
I thought you weren't starting at Taeja Group until next week.

420
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,880
Yeah, I just have something to take care of before then.

421
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,000
We're so similar.

422
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,950
I'm in a better mood now.

423
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,950
Nice!

424
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,020
It's nice.

425
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,550
Jo Dong Soo.

426
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,590
I've been...

427
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,430
in and out of jail, but you're the first one to get me tofu.*
(Customary to eat tofu when they come out of jail)

428
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,430
I also paid the settlement.

429
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,610
That's why you got out early.

430
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,690
A person is bound to be moved by the small gestures.

431
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,290
So what do you want to know?

432
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,140
It's about Lee Jung Hye.

433
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,510
The fire incident.

434
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,710
Lee Jung Hye had to do with it, right?

435
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,420
You happened to put out your cigarette on top of a pile of wood.

436
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,270
The home happened to be made out of wood and completely burned down.

437
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,870
I'm asking if any of that was intentional.

438
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:23,150
I got to hear my ex's name out of a handsome guy's mouth.

439
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,500
- Your ex?
- The end.

440
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,100
The money you spent on me.

441
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,910
That covers that much info.

442
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,180
Just because you have money doesn't mean you can shake out someone's past like that.

443
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,640
Then...

444
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,750
how about you buy your future?

445
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,570
I've lost my appetite.

446
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,380
I'll wait for your call, then.

447
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,480
What does family mean?

448
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,970
To help each other out in times of hardship.

449
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,670
My husband grew the company that my father-in-law started.

450
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:25,410
Now, Yoo Ra and I are trying to protect it.

451
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,490
I can't say I've been a perfect mother.

452
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,040
But how she could she do this to someone who raised her?

453
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,170
All I want is this one thing.

454
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,890
When Yoo Ra's father is back,

455
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:46,660
I want to show him that his company is all right.

456
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,560
Lee Jung Hye and Han Yoo Ra are poking around everywhere.

457
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,620
The shareholders are responding, too.

458
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,330
That's why they've been active on the news, on social media.

459
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,110
Did you look over the shareholders list?

460
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:05,420
I'm looking at it now. There's someone who owns 4.9% of our stocks.

461
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,540
I think they purposefully bought just under 5%, to not have it be public...

462
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,640
Someone you know?

463
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,270
No, it's just a common name.

464
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,650
Where do they live?

465
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,100
It might be best to go meet with them.

466
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,920
Lee Jung Hye is using proxies to get them to delegate votes...

467
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,560
Hello?

468
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,120
A cooking teacher?

469
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,330
Yes. She teaches a cooking class using the name "Jamie."

470
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,200
I've heard of her.

471
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,650
She runs in the rich wives' circle.

472
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,390
- Did you make contact?
- I did, but...

473
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,400
she turned down a meeting with you.

474
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,200
Is that the end?

475
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,510
She owns 5% of our stocks. We need to meet her and get her on our side!

476
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,180
I'm sorry.

477
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,620
- Drink this.
- Okay.

478
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,080
I'm curious.

479
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,330
Why did you want to see me, Yi Joo?

480
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:37,910
You have a lot of stocks in Hanwool Financials, Teacher.

481
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,710
Oh, that?

482
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,750
I'm pretty good at investing.

483
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,810
It's not a promising company, really.

484
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,890
With all their issues lately, their prices went down.

485
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,910
Should I guess what you're trying to ask me?

486
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,340
Do you know what I'm trying to ask you?

487
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,080
You want my help going up against Lee Jung Hye.

488
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,730
I've already asked around the ladies who own Hanwool stocks.

489
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,290
Many bought art from CEO Lee, so it won't be easy...

490
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,010
Why did you look into that?

491
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,620
What do you mean?

492
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,750
Because you and I are friends, Yi Joo.

493
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,510
Yi Joo?

494
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,880
When I think about it...

495
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,200
It was strange from the start.

496
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,660
Why are you so nice to me?

497
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,830
Yi Joo, you work hard at everything.

498
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,670
When I see you...

499
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,040
I want to cheer you on.

500
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,140
Why did someone like you want to help me?

501
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,420
I left it there on purpose.

502
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,730
Something happened that I don't want to forget.

503
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,680
A scar from a fire.

504
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,460
Why did you say you don't want to forget?

505
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,860
Yi Joo?

506
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,520
What are you talking about?

507
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,940
You gave Su Jin's mother free vouchers.

508
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,700
Saying you wanted to expand your young clientele, to give them out to her daughters' friends.

509
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,820
As if you wanted me to come here.

510
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,020
That's not...

511
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,210
Why would I do that?

512
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,500
You are Ji Won's...

513
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,310
You are the daughter Lee Ji Won and I had?

514
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,500
The name Lee Ji Won.

515
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,140
Is she who I think she is?

516
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,930
Teacher, are you...

517
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,220
my birth mother?

518
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,520
It's true.

519
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,930
Wait, wait.

520
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,520
Wait, Yi Joo...

521
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,840
I...

522
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,010
I didn't...

523
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,320
abandon you.

524
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,320
You didn't abandon me?

525
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,900
After the fire, I...

526
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,740
I was in a coma

527
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,640
for six months.

528
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,220
When I woke up...

529
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,870
my father told me you were dead.

530
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,980
I couldn't bear to stay.

531
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,140
So I went to America, like my father wanted.

532
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,350
Father, w-what did you say?

533
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,030
Your child...

534
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,940
is not dead.

535
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,770
I filled out...

536
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,140
the death certificate...

537
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,230
and dropped her off at the orphanage.

538
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,830
Then...

539
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,700
Are you saying that Jung Won is alive?

540
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,570
That doesn't make any sense... No way...

541
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,230
Father? How could you do that to me?

542
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,420
Why did you do that?

543
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,920
- Father!
- I'm sorry.

544
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,530
I...

545
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,770
I...

546
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,880
for you...

547
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,410
Father! Father!

548
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,890
No! Father! Father!

549
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,550
I came back when my father passed away...

550
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,260
and I heard that.

551
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,290
The fact that you are my daughter, Jung Won...

552
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,540
I only found out recently.

553
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,240
You should have told me right away.

554
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,860
I wasn't sure if it was okay

555
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,070
to show up now.

556
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,690
I just wanted to be by your side even as a friend...

557
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,500
and help you.

558
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,450
Be honest.

559
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,130
You were afraid I would resent you.

560
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,230
You didn't even have the courage of a mother to face your child's anger.

561
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,540
You should have said you were sorry.

562
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,370
Even if I rejected you, you should have come back again and again, so I know.

563
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,230
So I know that my mom had her reasons.

564
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,610
That she was sad to lose me.

565
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,630
That's why she...

566
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,840
That's why she's letting me hate her.

567
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,820
Did you even love me?

568
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:10,010
Yi Joo.

569
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,910
No, Jung Won.

570
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:22,210
When you gave me that painting of the flower...

571
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,530
I was so happy.

572
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,350
You wouldn't remember, but...

573
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,640
I always left flowers around the house for you.

574
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,500
You were my everything.

575
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,760
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

576
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,450
I'm sorry. I couldn't protect you...

577
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,830
I...

578
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,030
only know how to paint wilted flowers.

579
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,470
Lee Jung Hye made me that way.

580
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,510
If I had known you were my daughter earlier...

581
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:23,560
If you truly feel apologetic to me,

582
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,230
help me.

583
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,380
So I can take revenge on that woman.

584
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,070
This doesn't make any sense.

585
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,690
They said she was dead.

586
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,250
But how...

587
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,540
How are they both alive?

588
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,140
Jo Dong Soo, how did this bastard screw it up so badly?

589
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,080
What do I do?

590
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,840
What do I do now?

591
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:03,580
What if those two team up and try to take me down?

592
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,480
CEO Lee, it's Lawyer Kim.

593
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,390
Yes?

594
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,740
Chairman Han Woon Jae called me.

595
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,290
He wanted to know how he could help Han Yi Joo.

596
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,390
How should I handle it?

597
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,900
Really?

598
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,060
Then...

599
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:38,430
I need some help from you, Lawyer.

600
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,320
You're home late.

601
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,410
You don't know how your husband has been waiting for his wife.

602
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,410
Are you all right, Honey?

603
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,370
It doesn't feel real yet.

604
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:22,570
And we have something more urgent to deal with.

605
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,740
I don't want to think about anything else right now.

606
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,570
Actually...

607
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:30,230
I met with Jo Dong Soo.

608
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,160
- What?
- He was in jail.

609
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,690
I wanted to check him out first and see if he's dangerous.

610
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,680
So what did he say?

611
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,270
As expected.

612
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,970
He doesn't want to incriminate himself by opening his mouth.

613
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,880
Then, is there no way?

614
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,370
I'm not sure.

615
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,180
That might be up to Lee Jung Hye, perhaps...

616
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,170
Lawyer Kim, you told me there would be a way.

617
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:07,900
Why won't you tell me?

618
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:13,700
Well, I can cancel the request for conservatorship,

619
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,510
but turns out the process is quite complicated.

620
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:20,810
Then, what if I show up at the shareholders' meeting and blow up everything?

621
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:24,110
Show them that I'm fine, nothing is wrong with me.

622
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:27,980
Let everyone see for themselves in front of the shareholders.

623
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,840
I'm sorry, Chairman.

624
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,510
What are you sorry for?

625
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,300
What is this?

626
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,470
Hey! What is this?

627
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,510
Lee Jung Hye. You really...

628
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:53,040
Playing hide-and-seek with your daughter-in-law?

629
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,420
You got caught, Father.

630
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:04,740
- What is this?
- You should be giving to your real granddaughter.

631
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,200
A letter of transfer for your shares. Sign it.

632
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,590
If I do...

633
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,320
will you spare Jin Woong and Yi Joo?

634
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,780
That depends on what you do, Father.

635
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,660
What are you doing?

636
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,150
I swear to the heavens.

637
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:53,040
Lee Jung Hye, if you ever touch my children...

638
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,190
I will kill you first. Do you understand?

639
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:59,650
How funny. How are you going to pull that off, old man?

640
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,780
Let me go. Do you really want to die?

641
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,700
Sure! I'll die!

642
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,410
If something happens to me, you think I'll go to hell alone?

643
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,910
I'm taking you with me.

644
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:12,780
I'm taking you and pushing you into the fire first.

645
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,970
Crazy old man.

646
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:24,550
Keep an eye on him. Don't let anyone come in.

647
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,210
My grandfather is missing?

648
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:32,260
He went out last night. We have footage of him getting in the car...

649
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,620
A car? What about the license plate? Can I see it?

650
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:41,100
Well, it was too far away, and the image quality isn't good...

651
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,210
Lee Jung Hye did a lot of work.

652
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,630
Mom is convincing her network, but it hasn't been easy.

653
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:52,070
Okay. Keep working on it. I appreciate it.

654
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,140
Lee Jung Hye!

655
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,630
Who...

656
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,660
Someone I know.

657
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,820
Manager Kim, take Yoo Ra home.

658
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,310
- I should stay with you.
- Go.

659
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,710
Who is that?

660
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,600
Nice house.

661
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,680
Look at you, finding a spot without a single living thing around.

662
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,820
If you show up at my home again, I won't let it slide.

663
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,760
What will you do, then?

664
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,660
Why are you here?

665
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,270
Someone came to see me.

666
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,970
Asking about the fire.

667
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,130
What did he say?

668
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,700
He was asking if you hired me to do it.

669
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,170
How come you didn't manage to cover your tracks?

670
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,240
You're the one who botched the job.

671
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,300
That woman and her daughter.

672
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,200
Neither of them died.

673
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,460
They're both alive and well!

674
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,530
What? The whole building burnt down. How?

675
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,350
Who came to see you?

676
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,270
A perfectly fine-looking guy...

677
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,420
So?

678
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,410
You didn't tell him, did you?

679
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,930
You think I want to go back to jail?

680
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,910
I'm not going to say anything.

681
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:04,210
I'll cut you slack for taking money from me for that incident.

682
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:07,940
So, do one more job for me.

683
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,520
A job?

684
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,210
Kill the daughter.

685
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,680
This time, do it right.

686
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,410
[Special Shareholders' Meeting]

687
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,460
You're up, Honey.

688
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,880
Must be a big day.

689
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,650
Every day is a big day for me.

690
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,460
What is this?

691
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,040
The results of a paternity test, proving Yi Joo is my birth child.

692
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,200
What did you say? Who gave you-

693
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,070
Yi Joo gave it to me.

694
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,400
You really didn't know about this?

695
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,040
What are you doing?

696
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,740
You trust something that Han Yi Joo handed to you?

697
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:15,170
I'm doing everything I can to save your company...

698
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,610
and you're on her side, after what she did to us?

699
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,180
Then, you're saying this isn't true?

700
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,470
Of course it isn't!

701
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,640
Forging a piece of paper like this is no big deal.

702
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,660
She's trying to divide us during this important time.

703
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,220
Can't you see that?

704
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:42,020
I have a packed day.

705
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,310
I need to head out.

706
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:48,000
Let's talk about it later. It might take a while.

707
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,980
Sounds good.

708
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,230
I'll see you later, then.

709
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,310
Works for me.

710
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:28,350
Everything will be different later.

711
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:37,030
Hello, we will now begin Hanwool Group's Special Shareholders' Meeting.
[15th Special Shareholders' Meeting]

712
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:40,380
The Chairwoman will now kick us off.

713
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,340
Hello shareholders, my name is Lee Jung Hye.

714
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:52,270
Thank you for taking the time of your busy schedules to attend this shareholders' meeting.

715
00:53:55,510 --> 00:54:00,380
The first item on the agenda is the internal CEO transition.

716
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:05,770
The resolution to dismiss Chairman Han Jin Woong due to his health issues...

717
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,960
We will now be voting on the first agenda item.

718
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,080
Are there any opposing shareholders present?

719
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,860
Yes.

720
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:30,240
From the moment Chairman Han stepped back from management until now,

721
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:36,620
the company has maintained that he has "health issues," without further explanation of his condition.

722
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,770
Don't you think you owe us a more detailed explanation?

723
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:45,300
Of course, we hope that Chairman Han will recover soon.

724
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,040
But we made this difficult decision since he is unable to carry out his duties in his current state.

725
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,170
Is that really true?

726
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,560
What?

727
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,820
Why isn't he able to come back, exactly?

728
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:05,520
And what is the rationale for the job going to a spouse rather than a management professional?

729
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,000
Most of all, did Chairman Han consent to these proceedings?

730
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,730
What do you think you're doing? You can't use force

731
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,890
to silence a shareholder from speaking!

732
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,610
Let this go. Let go!

733
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,130
Let go! Let go!

734
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,960
We will move to a vote so we can speed things along...

735
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,640
Wait!

736
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,150
I don't know if my son consented to this,

737
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:09,990
but I certainly do not as the majority shareholder.

738
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,140
Grandpa...

739
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,710
Let go of her hand right now!

740
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:38,490
♫ Now I can see my halo ♫

741
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:43,090
♫ You can't cover up my mind ♫

742
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:48,250
♫ Now I can see my halo ♫

743
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:56,700
♫ Everything in red, and I'm not going back to who I was before ♫

744
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:06,290
♫ I can't be hurt no more ♫

745
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:12,040
[Perfect Marriage Revenge]

746
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,340
What did you say the first agenda item at the shareholders' meeting was?

747
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,690
The dismissal of Chairman Han Jin Woong.

748
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,400
Did you think I wouldn't know what you wanted?

749
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:23,370
Approaching you under false pretenses to make you like me, for whatever reason, was my fault.

750
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,040
I need something else.

751
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,310
Something other than what we've seen.

752
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,500
I'm pregnant.

753
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,480
I'm so proud of you. That's my daughter.

754
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,090
Does Seo Jung Wook know?

755
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,010
I've known your mom for a long time.

756
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,490
If I had a child back then...

757
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:37,500
Hold on. That can't be.

758
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,080
♫ You can't cover up my mind ♫
