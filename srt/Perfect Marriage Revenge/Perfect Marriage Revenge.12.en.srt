There's a lot of damage to his abdomen.

117

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,480
But the baby didn't do anything wrong.

184
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,140
So what do you want?

185
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,310
Let me...

186
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,670
Let me stay here.

187
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,570
Blood...

188
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,750
can't just be cut off.

189
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,430
This baby belongs to this family.

190
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,020
You need to be responsible for it.

191
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,500
That's rich coming from you, Han Yoo Ra.

192
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,410
Aren't you the one who cut off your mom when she became no help to you?

193
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,920
- T-That's...
- Stop it.

194
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,760
She has a point.

195
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,920
Regardless of what the adults did,

196
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,000
the child hasn't done anything wrong.

197
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,720
That's what I'm saying, Grandmother!

198
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,420
But that's only true if the child...

199
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,260
is Jung Wook's.

200
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,070
I'm sorry?

201
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,920
Let's take a test to see if the baby is Jung Wook's.

202
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,010
Then we can talk about us taking the baby in.

203
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,780
Of course, it's Jung Wook's!

204
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,700
This is insulting to me!

205
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,220
If it was another family, I'd believe you.

206
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,600
But this kind of thing happens in your family, Han Yoo Ra. No?

207
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,080
But...

208
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,640
I haven't even given birth.

209
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,360
I hear that in other countries, there are ways to test.

210
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,630
So, what would you like to do?

211
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,120
You don't look well, Ms. Han.

212
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,300
How's your father doing?

213
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
He's at the nursing home.

214
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,110
What I said at the police station was quite shocking, right?

215
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,880
I thought you might be connected to Sun Jin in some way.

216
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,830
I didn't know you were father and son.

217
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,730
I was sent to an orphanage so young that I had no memories of my father.

218
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:05,330
But I took a peek at the records, and there was his information, big and clear.

219
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,820
That's when I realized that there are plenty of kids who have parents

220
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,360
and still get sent to the orphanage.

221
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,940
When I found out where Father lived and made my way there,

222
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,480
I saw Lee Jung Hye frequent the house.

223
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,640
They seemed like lovers.

224
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,520
Soon after that, I saw on the news that Father killed himself.

225
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,890
So, you got close to Lee Jung Hye because you suspected her?

226
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,320
As I spent more time with her, I became more convinced

227
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,090
that she could definitely kill someone for her own benefit.

228
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,550
I never imagined that she would be using him as a slave.

229
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,540
She's going to get what she deserves.

230
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,520
Whatever you do, it all comes back to you.

231
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,890
In that case, good things are going to come to you.

232
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,870
You were the only one in that house who treated me like a person.

233
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,080
Vice President Seo is going to wake up soon.

234
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,820
Hello.

235
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,220
I remember you liked flowers.

236
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,240
You didn't have to see me.

237
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,920
But thank you.

238
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,480
I was hesitant as well.

239
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,500
I wasn't sure how I should be toward you.

240
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,710
But the more I thought about it, the more I felt bad for Yi Joo.

241
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,660
I have no right to hate anyone.

242
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,340
Yi Joo...

243
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,280
She's still in so much pain.

244
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,680
This is all my fault. Don't blame yourself.

245
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,230
You're right.

246
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,040
It is your fault.

247
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,210
How could you not know your own daughter by your side?

248
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,090
Our Yi Joo...

249
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,130
Our daughter...

250
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:29,700
She was by your side as your child all her life. How could you not know?

251
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,330
I'm sorry.

252
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,530
I'm sorry, Ji Won.

253
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,710
You don't have to accept my apology.

254
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,850
I'll spend the rest of my life making it right with you and Yi Joo.

255
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,550
How far...

256
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,620
did we go around to get here?

257
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,530
Do Guk, you're going to do great.

258
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,880
[Operating Center]

259
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,100
Do Guk.

260
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,670
I finally realized it.

261
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,870
The reason I came back.

262
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,820
Meeting you...

263
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,290
taught me who I am.

264
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,140
What I want...

265
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,390
What makes me happy...

266
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,400
Who I really am.

267
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,780
The reason some force gave me my life back...

268
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,850
wasn't meant for revenge.

269
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,680
It was so I could live my life properly.

270
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,430
There's so much I want to do with you.

271
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,770
So, please come back.

272
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,390
I'll be waiting for you.

273
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,580
Okay?

274
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,530
I think...

275
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,300
I heard Yi Joo's voice just now.

276
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,370
Where am I?

277
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,430
I won't be seeing you again.

278
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,370
I'm back to before I came back.

279
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,990
I had just said goodbye to Yi Joo.

280
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,110
How's Grandmother doing?

281
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,610
She's conscious.

282
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,780
Thank goodness we found her early.

283
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,410
But she won't tell us what happened.

284
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,800
- I'll be right there.
- It's okay.

285
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,330
She's resting. Come tomorrow.

286
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,590
Don't worry about it too much.

287
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,560
- Still.
- Oh, by the way,

288
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,590
what's going on with Han Yoo Ra's family? Was it crazy?

289
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,160
- What?
- You don't know?

290
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,370
My friend was at the event.

291
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,360
Han Yoo Ra's older sister got caught for making fraudulent pieces, then ran off.

292
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,630
Their mom is crying all over the place.

293
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,020
How could she do such a thing?

294
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,400
No. She's not that kind of person.

295
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,510
- What?
- See you at the hospital tomorrow.

296
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,160
Take good care of Grandmother.

297
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,900
Are you their spokesperson, Ms. Han Yi Joo?

298
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,960
Why do you say hello and thank you on their behalf?

299
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,370
Because they're family.

300
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,480
That's the kind of person she is.

301
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,470
What have they done to her?

302
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,520
Han Yi Joo? Han Yi Joo...

303
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,150
No. No!

304
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,450
If there is God, please hear my prayer.

305
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,910
She's done nothing wrong.

306
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:18,790
She's never known love in this life. She's only been through pain.

307
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,690
Please, for him who deserves to be loved...

308
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,850
Just one more time...

309
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,830
Please give back life once more...

310
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,090
to her, who wants to love.

311
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,380
This time, let him love as much as he wants,

312
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,270
and let him be loved as much as he wants.

313
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:54,160
I promise we will live this life to the fullest and spend it together.

314
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,730
So, please...

315
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,490
Yi Joo!

316
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,000
Yi Joo!

317
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,500
Where did you go...

318
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,120
leaving me all alone?

319
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,880
It's not fair.

320
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,990
What?

321
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,910
I haven't left your side in two months.

322
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,760
I leave for a second, and you come back?

323
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,910
Teasing you and giving you a hard time...

324
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,460
is the greatest joy of my life.

325
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,600
You're so mean.

326
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,120
I'm...

327
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,370
back.

328
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,510
Yes.

329
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,150
You did good...

330
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,820
You did good.

331
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,430
Mother! Honey!

332
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,410
Do Guk! Aigoo! You're home!

333
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,510
Aigoo, you're home! You made it!

334
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,570
You did good. You did good.

335
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,420
You, too.

336
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,980
You did good.

337
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,040
You've been through so much.

338
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,980
You, too, Father.

339
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,620
It must have been painful for you because of Hyung.

340
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,730
Do Guk...

341
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,400
Yes, Father.

342
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,310
Even if we're in a fight,

343
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,420
we reach out our hands when one of us is struggling.

344
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,340
That's family.

345
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,070
Trying to hurt each other with nothing but resentment...

346
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,230
That's...

347
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,230
worse than being strangers.

348
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,360
You need to...

349
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,970
work to keep your family together.

350
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,030
I've only now realized that.

351
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,270
What is this?

352
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,590
My mom sent some meat for you to eat.

353
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,160
Your mother did?

354
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,340
She took good care of me while you were in a coma.

355
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,560
Thanks to her, I think our baby is growing well.

356
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,040
I'm so grateful.

357
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,060
Our baby must have had a lot of good food.

358
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,890
Let's go say hi to her tomorrow.

359
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,200
And how are your father and grandfather doing?

360
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,620
They're good.

361
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,800
They're going to finance a public foundation together.

362
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,960
Your grandmother is giving them some advice.

363
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:00,020
Are you concerned about Han Yoo Ra or Lee Jung Hye?

364
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,450
Well?

365
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:05,580
It would be a lie to say not at all.

366
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,030
Same here.

367
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:13,080
My brother's going to be a bad memory I think of sometimes.

368
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,180
I'll probably feel some useless guilt, too.

369
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,470
But let's not forget that they made their own beds.

370
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:27,020
Let's let go of all the resentment and hatred with them, yeah?

371
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,730
Yeah.

372
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh, come on. I just had one.

373
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,900
That's your fourth one.

374
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,990
Go move the dishes.

375
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,600
You only do this to me.

376
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,700
You're the only one who makes me mad!

377
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,640
I won't ask you for anything else, so please behave later.

378
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,340
Don't be mean.

379
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,510
Of course! Trust me, Mom.

380
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,860
I'll be the most angelic sister-in-law ever.

381
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,220
Aigoo.

382
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,380
They must be here.

383
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,650
Let's do this.

384
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,380
Hello!

385
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,180
Hello.

386
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,900
Oh, my goodness, welcome!

387
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,770
Nice to meet you, Mother. My name is Choi Joo Ri.

388
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,430
This is for you, Mother.

389
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,280
My goodness, you shouldn't have!

390
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,020
It's my thank you gift.

391
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,480
You raised Se Hyeok to be a great man.

392
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,110
Mother, this is so good.

393
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,500
Really?

394
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,920
You must have worked so hard to make all this for me.

395
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,290
Not at all. This is just how we usually eat.

396
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,870
Usually? We always get delivery.

397
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:07,290
Se Hee, do you have time next week?

398
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,230
Want to go to the department store together?

399
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,530
The department store? For what?

400
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:15,040
We're getting married. I should at least get you a purse.

401
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,910
Gosh. A purse? She has many purses.

402
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,320
When's good for you? I'm free tomorrow.

403
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,960
Let's find a day, then.

404
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,110
You have to come, too, Mother.

405
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,180
Me?

406
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,670
Me, too?

407
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,390
Really?

408
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,210
You don't have to do that.

409
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,140
Who is that?

410
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,230
Delivery. I'm expecting something.

411
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,950
- Eat plenty.
- Thank you.

412
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,180
What are you doing here, Han Yoo Ra?

413
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,320
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

414
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,360
How did you...

415
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,970
Yoo Ra.

416
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,050
Oh, my goodness! Are you pregnant?

417
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,980
How have you been?

418
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,090
Long time no see, Oppa.

419
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,460
Are you married?

420
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,660
Who's the baby daddy?

421
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,430
Your brother.

422
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,890
- What?
- What did you say?

423
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,690
Han Yoo Ra, what are you saying?

424
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,770
Didn't you hear me?

425
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,270
This baby...

426
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,390
is yours.

427
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:31,240
What the heck is she saying? Are you crazy?

428
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,610
This is insane.

429
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,120
Did you sleep with her?

430
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,080
Did you sleep with her?

431
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,940
Se Hyeok, please say something.

432
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,650
It's not true, right?

433
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,310
I'm sorry, Joo Ri.

434
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,210
W-Where, where are you going?

435
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,030
Wait, you know. Something is very wrong right now.

436
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,430
Se Hyeok would never do this.

437
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,760
- I'm sorry.
- Wait...

438
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,710
Hey! Joo Ri! Joo Ri!

439
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,660
Aigoo, oh, no...

440
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,000
We're doomed...

441
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,760
We're totally doomed...

442
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,920
How impressive, Oppa.

443
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,900
You already got yourself a girl.

444
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,070
Is it really mine?

445
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,340
Yeah.

446
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,830
You hated me.

447
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,710
If you thought I was such a loser, why are you having my baby?

448
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,290
I didn't know it was yours.

449
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,730
- What?
- I didn't want to believe it, either!

450
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,150
That I'm having your child.

451
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,960
So...

452
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,850
what do you want now?

453
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,400
I have nowhere to go.

454
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,550
I'm going to live here.

455
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,510
- Who says?
- Will you kick me out, then?

456
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,800
When I'm carrying your baby?

457
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,300
What?

458
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,830
Does this whole situation feel shitty to you?

459
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,870
You don't even know yet.

460
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,330
Having a baby and raising him in this tiny house...

461
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,830
Then you'll know...

462
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,290
what real hell is.

463
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,770
So...

464
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,130
you're going to stay with those people?

465
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,320
You can't stay somewhere like that...

466
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,870
Got any other ideas?

467
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,650
You should have faked the papers or something!

468
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,340
Or get some dirt on Seo Jung Wook!

469
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,170
That's what you did and look at you now.

470
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,760
This is where you are!

471
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,120
What?

472
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,630
Han Yi Joo seems to be doing well.

473
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,090
Sure, whatever.

474
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:50,530
After she ruined us like this.

475
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,730
Aren't you mad?

476
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,710
If I am, then what?

477
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,470
You want me to avenge you or something?

478
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,510
What? Why not?

479
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,600
You can't do this, and you can't do that...

480
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,970
Then why are you even here?

481
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,960
Give me money.

482
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,600
What? Money?

483
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,830
I can't live in that house.

484
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,280
You must have some cash stashed away somewhere.

485
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,900
I don't have any money.

486
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,290
Everything was seized and frozen.

487
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,930
I came all the way here to hear you nag.

488
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,450
I'm not visiting you anymore.

489
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,200
Don't look for me when you get out.

490
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,290
What do you mean by that?

491
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,040
Don't you get it?

492
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,830
I'm abandoning you right now, Mom.

493
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,660
Hey!

494
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,150
Hey, Yoo Ra! Yoo Ra!

495
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,010
Yoo Ra! Yoo Ra!

496
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,830
5683, are you all right?

497
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,700
I'm fine.

498
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,070
I can...

499
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,910
walk by myself.

500
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,170
It's soft.

501
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,060
Han Yi Joo, you look pretty.

502
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,790
I think my morning sickness is gone.

503
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,760
Thank goodness.

504
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,080
I was worried that you weren't eating.

505
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,900
Are you busy today?

506
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,040
I have a meeting with Father and Grandpa about the foundation.

507
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,760
Then, I'm meeting Do Guk in the evening.

508
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,500
Meeting him? Out?

509
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,470
We're going to file for marriage today.

510
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,690
Really?

511
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,330
If we keep putting it off, we'll get busier. So we'll do it now.

512
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,050
That's good.

513
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,870
I thought you might have to file after you have the baby.

514
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,100
Do you have any good news?

515
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,140
What good news?

516
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,190
Oh, right. A while back, I met with Jin Woong...

517
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,660
- and we broke up properly.
- What?

518
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,510
We never got a chance to break up face-to-face.

519
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:08,120
Should I say we finally got some closure?

520
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,850
I think I needed that, so I could see him again comfortably at times like friends.

521
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,270
You should start dating, Mom.

522
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,250
I heard you're quite popular.

523
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,700
Having a grandchild will be fun enough for me.

524
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,160
It's fun to hang out with Madame Cha, too.

525
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,940
Hang out with me, too.

526
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,100
Let's go to the movies or the spa.

527
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,890
Sure. Let's do that.

528
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,720
Your food is the best.

529
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,190
President Seo Young Kyun of Taeja Construction has resigned.

530
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,950
Through their board, Taeja Group announced that

531
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:01,670
VP Seo Do Guk of Taeja Constructions was voted as the candidate to succeed him.

532
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,650
At the end of this month, a stockholders' meeting will be held

533
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:08,080
where Candidate Seo is expected to be named President.

534
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,290
Hey, Sunbae, I just found it at the store.

535
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:17,890
Okay. Thanks. The meeting ran long.

536
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:18,980
Yeah. Thank you so much.

537
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,800
Don't worry. See you later!

538
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,130
What is this? Are we strangers?

539
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,050
Meeting after meeting, that's it?

540
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,440
Our company stocks are going into the foundation.

541
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,870
We can't skimp on these meetings.

542
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,910
