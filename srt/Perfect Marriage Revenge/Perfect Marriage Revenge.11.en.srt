[Episode 11]

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,720
This is where she's been making the fakes?

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,010
I thought I was aware of her every move.

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,920
She had me wait outside when she went to visit Chairman Han

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,930
and went into another room as well.

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,120
Where's Do Guk?

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,630
I'll go see what's going on inside.

17
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,050
- Pull over.
- Why?

18
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,590
Pull over!

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,650
What now?

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,600
How did she know!

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,090
What? What is it?

22
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,250
I'm here. Where are you?

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,510
I'm almost there.

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,340
Hit her.

25
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,580
That's Han Yi Joo, the one I told you to kill.

26
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,590
Let's run her over, get the paintings, and go.

27
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,340
I'll give you half of whatever they sell for.

28
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,440
You don't want to get paid?

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,250
Hurry up!

30
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,280
Yi Joo! Get away!

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,590
What?

32
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,610
Yi Joo.

33
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,100
Are you all right? Huh?

34
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,650
Are you hurt anywhere?

35
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,960
No...

36
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,770
Do Guk.

37
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,110
Are you really okay? Huh?

38
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,730
Yes. Of course. You protected me, Do Guk.

39
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,520
Look, I'm totally fine.

40
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,670
Thank goodness.

41
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,990
I... I was so scared...

42
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,920
That I might lose you, like last time.

43
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,160
I was so scared. Thank goodness...

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,070
Do Guk.

45
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,300
Yes.

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,570
What do you mean?

47
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,570
Lose me again?

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,400
Oh, well...

49
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,070
Over there!

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,810
Hey! Stop right there!

51
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,760
- Stay still!
- Let go of me!

52
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,920
I said let go!

53
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,050
Ms. Han!

54
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,870
Let me go!

55
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,910
What happened?

56
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,930
- Let this go!
- Are you all right?

57
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,120
I am okay. What about the imitation artist? Did you find them?

58
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,330
Yes. Lee Jung Hye was paying for another room.

59
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,110
Let go. Let go!

60
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,780
Let go!

61
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,990
You guys...

62
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,290
I said let go!

63
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,670
Please just stay still!

64
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,750
You would never be allowed near someone like me.

65
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,430
- You...
- You recognize me.

66
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,770
Right. I am the great artist Sun Jin.

67
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,150
He looks a lot like him.

68
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,620
But Artist Sun Jin died in the mountains-

69
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,210
They never found his body, though.

[Statement]

71
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,400
All this ruckus over a fender bender? I'll pay for the repair.

72
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,270
Jo Dong Soo, you are here as a suspect in the attempted murders of Lee Ji Won and Han Yi Joo.

73
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,420
Remember how there was a fingerprint on the gas can that exploded during the fire?

74
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,600
We were finally able to run it.

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,500
- It was yours, Jo Dong Soo.
- So what?

76
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,690
Since you entered the victims' home to commit the crime, it establishes intent.

77
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,420
That was a long time ago.

78
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,870
Far past the statute of limitation.

79
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,140
You went abroad quite often to gamble.

80
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,750
Criminal Law 250 Clause 3.

81
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,870
If a criminal stays abroad for the purpose of avoiding lawful punishment,

82
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,800
- the statute of limitation is paused for the duration. So!
- In conclusion...

83
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,270
if we take out the time you were out of the country,

84
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,720
the statute of limitation is not over.

85
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,010
Who are you?

86
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,290
Why are you sticking your nose in someone else's business?

87
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,980
You...

88
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,770
You tried to kill me.

89
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,010
She strongly requested a re-investigation.

90
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,790
That is why we re-analyzed your fingerprint.

91
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,900
You dared tried to kill me and my daughter...

92
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,960
I hope you rot in jail for the rest of time!

93
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,700
Hey! Don't touch me!

94
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,020
She told me to do it.

95
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,950
Are you out of your mind? You're going to put it on me?

96
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,500
That woman and her daughter, neither of them died.

97
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,060
They're both alive and well!

98
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,320
What? The whole building burnt down. How?

99
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,260
I'll cut you slack for taking money from me for that incident.

100
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,550
So, do one more job for me.

101
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,010
- A job?
- The daughter...

102
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,470
Kill her.

103
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,600
This time, do it right.

104
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,310
No. That's fake. That's all fake!

105
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,440
There's another crime that Lee Jung Hye committed.

106
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,220
She used the fact that the Artist Sun Jin was cognitively impaired

107
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,210
to imprison him and make him paint.

108
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,810
She faked his suicide to raise the value of his work.

109
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,870
She must have earned hundreds of millions from it.

110
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,250
Manager Kim...

111
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,500
- who do you think you are?
- I am!

112
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,920
Sun Jin's son.

113
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,320
T-Then, you...

114
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,950
That's why you were by my side this whole time...

115
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,760
All the files that show Lee Jung Hye's embezzlement and the slush fund she established...

116
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,330
I will turn them in today.

117
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,420
Let me call my husband... no...

118
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,900
Let me call Yoo Ra.

119
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,300
If she finds out, she won't stay still.

120
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,410
Hanwool Financials' audit team will give you full cooperation.

121
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,110
The Han Gallery is also going to turn over evidence.

122
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,350
What?

123
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,930
Don't you get it?

124
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,250
It means no one is on your side.

125
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,870
Han Yi Joo...

126
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,170
you...

127
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,040
Hey! Stop her!

128
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,300
Let go! Let go!

129
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,980
Let go!

130
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,050
Let go!

131
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,650
Let go... Let go!

132
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,220
How did you know we were here?

133
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,330
I've frequented police stations trying to catch Jo Dong Soo.

134
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,180
But...

135
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,580
I heard there was an accident. Are you hurt?

136
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,740
No.

137
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,110
I'm okay.

138
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,290
Okay, that's good, then.

139
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,010
Thank goodness.

140
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,410
Excuse me.

141
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,670
Yi Joo went through a lot today, so we're going to head home now.

142
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,470
Oh, I didn't even realize.

143
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,190
Go ahead.

145
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,030
We'll make time to say a proper hello sometime, Mother.

146
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,730
Mother?

147
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,280
Yes.

148
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,670
Please.

149
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,860
All right, then.

150
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,800
Let's go.

151
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,860
You should eat. You haven't eaten anything.

152
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,140
I don't feel like eating right now.

153
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,370
Here.

154
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,170
Is Manager Kim going to be okay?

155
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,260
Are you worrying about another man in front of me right now?

156
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,700
What do you mean? He helped us out so much.

157
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,000
You helped him, too.

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,220
Don't worry about him anymore.

159
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,700
You have enough to deal with on your own.

160
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,080
If you get involved with some other thing and are in danger again...

161
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,440
I don't even want to imagine.

162
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,940
It's all over.

163
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,300
I know you're worried about me, but...

164
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,560
Oh, right.

165
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,590
What did you mean earlier?

166
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,610
You said, "I can't lose you, like last time."

167
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,200
- I don't remember.
- What?

168
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,740
It's probably just something I said. It was so chaotic.

169
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,740
I'm tired. Let's wash up.

170
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,400
I'll get it. I'll get it.

171
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,780
Are you okay? Let me see.

172
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,660
Oh, it's...

173
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,390
What is that on your wrist?

174
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,110
What?

175
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,030
What do you mean?

176
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,080
Can you see this?

177
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,440
You can see it, right?

178
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,480
So, you pretended not to know this whole time?

179
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,200
While hiding yours from me?

180
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,690
What is this?

181
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,210
Did you...

182
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,360
also come back like me? To a year ago?

183
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,500
Why can't you talk to me? Why can't you answer my questions?

184
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,080
Yes.

185
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,410
You're right.

186
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,500
I also came back.

187
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,290
Like you.

188
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,050
How?

189
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,140
What happened to you that day?

190
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,870
That day...

191
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,500
- your car and my car were in a collision.
- What?

[Hanwool Group Director Lee Jung Hye Arrested for Embezzlement of Company Funds Worth 10 Billion]

193
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,800
Lee Jung Hye's arrest is everywhere on the news.

194
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,400
It doesn't matter anymore.

195
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,140
It's not good for us to be associated with her.

196
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,820
Isn't that what you wanted?

197
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,430
I like how you think.

198
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,210
What would you like to eat?

199
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,550
So, how long are you going to keep me at the hotel?

200
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,640
I should have some stability for our child to be healthy.

201
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,990
How can I keep living in a hotel room?

202
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,620
Hold on.

203
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,110
Yes.

204
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,250
What did you say?

205
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,420
I understand. I'll take a look right now.

206
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,910
Where are you going? We have to finish our conversation.

207
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,880
It's urgent.

208
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,990
This is urgent for me, too!

209
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,480
I told you. I abandoned my mother and chose you.

210
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,290
We need to have a wedding before I start showing.

211
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,160
Set a date to meet each others' families. Fast.

212
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,050
My car and your car were in a collision?

213
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,950
To be precise...

214
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,050
my car collided with yours.

215
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,180
And then?

216
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,570
I tried to save you while you were unconscious.

217
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,050
Then I passed out, too.

218
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,990
When I woke up...

219
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,450
it was a year ago.

220
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,360
I thought I had to meet you somehow.

221
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,290
But you...

222
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,850
came to me first.

223
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,030
Why didn't you tell me that day

224
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,960
that you came back, too?

225
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,720
Why?

226
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,840
How could I have told you...

227
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,200
that I'm the one who killed you?

228
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,650
I was struggling.

229
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,830
I thought you might have a hard time accepting it, too.

230
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,140
That's why I couldn't tell you.

231
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,680
Yi Joo!

232
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,100
Where are you going? It's late.

233
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,900
I'll be at a hotel for a while. I need some time to think.

234
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,360
Then I'll leave.

235
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,830
- What?
- You should be somewhere safe.

236
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,400
Please, I'm begging you.

237
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,420
And...

238
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,990
pick up the phone.

239
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,500
Has your life ever flashed...

240
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,700
before your eyes? I've seen it.

241
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,060
Every moment of my life...

242
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:41,570
spreads out right in front of me like a photo album.

243
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,260
But the surprising thing was,

244
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,080
I didn't have any.

245
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,180
Moments that I wanted to hold onto. How does that make sense?

246
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,290
That means I've never been happy.

248
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,720
I should have told you then.

♫ There's nothing more I can do ♫

250
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,310

♫ To you, I say it again ♫

252
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,690
How hurt is he?

253
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,150
He fell from the third floor.

254
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,380
There was no guardrail and no safety net installed.

255
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,790
They're saying he'll likely pass within the night.

256
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,860
So there's still time.

257
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,220
- Excuse me?
- Contact the contractor company that hired him.

258
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,590
What are you trying to do?

259
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,160
The dead can't speak.

260
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,520
We can compensate, but we won't claim responsibility.

261
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,280
Vice President, I don't think that's right.

262
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,350
- What did you say?
- I mean, here's the thing.

263
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,250
They didn't have time to properly prepare safety equipment

264
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,990
trying to make our ridiculous schedule...

265
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,800
- If you can't handle this, get out.
- What?

266
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,730
I said plenty of people want to climb the ladder of this group with me, right?

267
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,340
I don't need someone who's going to act like a saint.

268
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,550
Vice President, that's not what I'm saying...

269
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,020
I misspoke.

271
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,530
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

272
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,060
I'll make sure this never happens again.

273
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,140
I'll contact the company right away.

274
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,750
Hurry up before Seo Do Guk catches a whiff.

275
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,710
An accidental death?

276
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,300
What the hell happened?

277
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,210
It was an injury that turned out to be fatal.

278
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,090
It's unfortunate, but...

279
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,910
he was not being careful himself while he was the Safety Director.

280
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,390
The contractor company already handled the accident circumstances and the compensation process.

281
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,660
You're going to end it at the contractor company's investigation?

282
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,060
As constructors, we need to understand the situation.

283
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,470
We should stop construction and investigate thoroughly.

284
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,600
Do you know how much loss we incur in one day of lost work?

285
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,790
- Is that what's important right now?
- Well, isn't it?

286
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:05,810
The workers who get paid by the day will miss their paychecks.

287
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,340
The residents planning to move in will get anxious.

288
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,190
The media will have a field day tearing us apart.

Taeja Group's battle for its successor and whatnot...

290

Does Taeja Constructions need to take that on just to satisfy VP Seo Do Guk's curiosity?

291
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,590
Look here, VP Seo Jung Wook!

292
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,810
If you have something against me, say it in private.

293
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,740
Don't nitpick when company business is going on.

294
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,420
I don't need to tell you again. You need to leave.

295
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,210
Please leave.

296
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,300
Geez...

00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,160
Who are you?

298
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,420
Yes?

299
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,600

- What?

302

Like you said, thugs are all over the place.

303
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,700
It's obvious.

304
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,490
Something's fishy. That's why they won't let anyone talk to the deceased's family.

305
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,220
Then, there's no way to approach them...

306
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,290
No. Secretary Byeon, I think you're perfectly capable.

307
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,860
I am?

308
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,400

312
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,850
Hello. I'm from Taeja Group.

313
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,390
- What?
- I'd like to ask you about Mr. Kim's accident.

314
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,490
Could we talk for a moment?

315
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:53,830
They said it was all my husband's fault.

316
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,670
That there's no use fighting and that I should just settle quickly.

317
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,140
They said they have papers as proof...

318
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,330
Papers?

319
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,730
By chance, did you get to see them?

320
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,740
I saw on the news there's been a fatal accident.

321
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,040
Is everything okay at work?

322
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,830
Yi Joo, how are you feeling? I'm worried about you.

323
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,980
Welcome.

324
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,050
Oh, here.

325
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,400
You shouldn't have. Thank you.

326
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,180
But Mr. Seo didn't come with you?

327
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,470
Oh, I'm sorry. That was too much, wasn't it?

328
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,900
No. That's not it.

329
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,610
We're...

330
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,950
taking a little space right now.

331
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,310
What?

332
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,660
Can I ask why you two fought?

333
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,480
We didn't fight. It's just...

334
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,600
He's always been too good to me from the beginning.

335
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,820
One day, it made me think.

336
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,380
Maybe it's not because he loves me but because he pities me.

337
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,520
Maybe he was good to me because he felt sorry.

338
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,010
What do you mean?

339
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,760
No man in the world would do that much for a woman he pities.

340
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,890
The way Seo Do Guk looks at you, his actions...

341
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,900
That's love, no doubt.

342
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,530
Why would you think such a thing?

343
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,890
"Nobody loves you."

344
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,580
"Even your own mother abandoned you."

345
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,710
"Who would ever love you?"

346
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,250
Lee Jung Hye used to tell me that all the time.

347
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
How...

348
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,820
how could she say such things...

349
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,920
Maybe I was brainwashed.

350
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,860
So, I was scared.

351
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,390
I thought maybe someone like me didn't deserve to be loved.

352
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,160
Yi Joo, even though you went through so much all alone,

353
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,170
you didn't stray. You turned out well. Do you know who did that?

354
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,880
You did.

355
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,820
You protected yourself.

356
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,880
So, you need to be proud of yourself.

357
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,630
You need to love yourself.

358
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,170
Because...

359
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,250
you deserve to be loved. More than enough.

360
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,950
So...

361
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,030
don't let the words of someone evil get to you.

362
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,460
Thank you for saying that.

363
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,310
But I...

364
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,510
I didn't want to be alone.

365
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,600
I needed my mom.

366
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,490
Just...

367
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,880
I was so jealous...

368
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,320
of children who were loved...

369
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,080
just for being born.

370
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,460
As your mom...

371
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,060
I'm really sorry.

372
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,560
Then...

373
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,700
the things you didn't get to do for me...

374
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,660
can you do them all now?

375
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,460
Sure.

376
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,130
I will.

377
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,080
I'll make you feel...

378
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,100
more loved than anyone else.

379
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,130
They say that the two of them are having a baby.

380
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,070
I wasn't sure when to share the news with what was happening at work.

381
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,020
But we couldn't just keep putting it off.

382
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,550
Yoo Ra will start showing soon, too.

383
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,620
Is this for real?

384
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,790
We don't know the gender yet, but it's a healthy baby.

385
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:38,700
They say a child brings joy to a home.

386
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,570
Yi Joo.

387
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,060
Are you here to see me?

388
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,690
I brought you clothes and stuff you might need.

389
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,500
Want to come in for a second?

390
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,190
Let me get you a cup of tea.

391
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,190
Something warm, right?

392
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,220
I saw the news.

393
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,750
Did you?

394
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,250
Is everything okay?

395
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,730
How did a fatal accident even happen?

396
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,630
Actually, I'm not sure what to do.

397
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,390
If I keep digging into it, the company will take a hit.

398
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,190
It will hurt my family, too.

399
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,370
So there's a problem.

400
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,550
So you just want to pretend it doesn't exist?

401
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:24,330
Do Guk, do you still not get it?

402
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,330
The more challenging something is, the more you need to share it.

403
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,710
That's how you trust and respect the person you're with.

404
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,930
Hiding it...

405
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,320
isn't being considerate.

406
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,690
It just leads to more hurt.

407
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,630
Yes.

408
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,620
You're right.

409
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,590
I told you Mommy would be home early tonight.

410
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,640
I'll bring home chicken.

411
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,340
I promise.

412
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,820
See you later.

413
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,030
Vice President.

414
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,870
I didn't cross any lines by calling you, did I?

415
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,220
You did not. Please, go ahead.

416
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,360
Sure. I'll cut to the chase.

417
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,320
Give me the paperwork on Kim Soo Chul...

418
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,530
the worker who died.

419
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,720
As for that...

420
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,480
I'm sorry.

421
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,520
That's not within my powers.

422
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:39,150
I heard you talking with your child just now.

423
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,890
How old is your child?

424
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,240
Third grade.

425
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,850
Right.

426
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,220
That family has a child, too.

427
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,590
That family?

428
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,850
Kim Soo Chul's wife...

429
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,250
is pregnant.

430
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,230
She's in her last month...

431
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,600
A child will come into this world soon.

432
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,420
If he's faultless, the least we can do for that newborn child

433
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:15,320
is letting them know their dad didn't get drunk and fell to his death by his own bad decisions.

434
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,660
I know how you must feel.

435
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,470
VP Seo probably promised you an executive position when he became president.

436
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,540
You've endured everything so far because of that promise.

437
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,450
But...

438
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,040
I think it's best you give that up.

439
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:40,000
Because I came into Taeja Constructions.

440
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,240
What is this?

441
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,520
This is the paperwork that played a pivotal role in getting the family to settle.

442
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,370
A designation letter for the position of Managing Supervisor.

443
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:59,940
[Designation for Managing Supervisor]
It says that Kim Soo Chul himself is the Safety Director on site.

444
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,240
Therefore, he is responsible for an accident involving himself.

445
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,840
But why are you reviewing this now?

446
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,280
Upon examination, the signature does not match the deceased's handwriting.

447
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,690
- What did you say?
- His colleagues said they've never seen this document.

448
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,970
The contractors said he was drinking until the morning of.

449
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,250
But that's not true, either.

450
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,670
And this entire picture was Seo Jung Wook's idea.

451
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,040
What?

452
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,870
I got these from the Director of Finance.

453
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,210
Every corrupt thing Seo Jung Wook has done,

454
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,260
including how he made a slush fund. It's all in there.

455
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,770
There must be a misunderstanding.

456
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,180
How could Jung Wook...

457
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,650
I didn't know he had gone this far.

458
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:59,070
- Excuse me?
- I wasn't kidding when I said I would watch you two for a year.

459
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:05,530
I knew Jung Wook was meeting with affiliated companies and throwing money at them.

460
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,370
Mr. Jang has been keeping me in the loop.

461
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,510
So your grandmother also knew.

462
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,860
Thank you for helping me have a tough conversation.

463
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:24,160
No, it's easier said than done. You did the work, Do Guk.

464
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,940
Good job.

465
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,180
Get some rest. You must be exhausted.

466
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,270
Yi Joo, hold on.

467
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,320
I...

468
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,060
need to tell you something.

469
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,100
But before that...

470
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,640
there's something I want you to see.

471
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,870
In my room, there's a door.

472
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,550
If you open the door, you'll find what you've been looking for.

473
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,810
What I've been looking for?

474
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,600
There's one I want to track down, but I can't find it.

475
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,130
What is it like?

476
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,360
The title is "Frozen Spring."

477
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,280
"Frozen Spring."

478
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,040
Why would Do Guk have this?

479
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,140
You wanted to see me, Father?

480
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,800
You're going out for lunch, right? Should I make a reservation somewhere nice?

481
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,260
You lied to me.

482
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,700
What...

483
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,910
Playing dumb again?

484
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,580
How much more are you going to disappoint me?

485
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,830
Please calm down, Father.

486
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,820
You need to explain what you're talking about...

487
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,010
- It was Do Guk, right?
- What?

488
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,040
Wasn't it? This is all Do Guk trying to slander me-

489
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,300
These papers are with the Auditing Team now.

490
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,700
What did you say?

491
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,530
Please help me just one more time, Father.

492
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,910
You know I'm about to be a father soon.

493
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,780
I can't be in jail when my baby is born.

494
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,930
Then, you should've behaved properly from the start.

495
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,470
Why did you do this? Falsify documents?

496
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,000
- Why did you have to go that far?
- I...

497
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,170
did it all for the company.

498
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,640
Please help me out just one last time, Father. Please?

499
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,360
[Press conference regarding Taeja Construction's apartment site accident]
Today, I stand before you.

500
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,080
Recently, at Taeja Constructions,

501
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,580
- an accident happened on an apartment construction site.
- It's too late.

502
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,970
I am here to tell you the truth.

503
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,590
The death of Kim Soo Chul...

504
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:27,670
was the result of an extreme schedule leading to the lack of proper safety measures at the site.

505
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,760
It was entirely the fault of the company.

506
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:39,350
However, our executives framed the victim as responsible and forced the family into settling.

507
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:44,340
This incident has made me reflect on my own beginnings.

508
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:49,050
A place where you eat, sleep, and rest with your loved ones.

509
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,410
Home is where you coexist like that.

510
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,640
What kind of home one grows up in determines who they are.

511
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,370
When I grow up, I want to do the work you do, Grandma.

512
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:08,160
The work that I really wanted to do...

513
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,350
How important is the work I'm doing right now?

514
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,070
I have reflected deeply on how I'd forgotten those principles.

515
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,950
We claimed to be building apartments for people...

516
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:25,040
but our eyes were blind to the person standing in front of us.

517
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,440
We will embark on a review of the entire construction process.

518
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,510
In the worst-case scenario, we will consider rebuilding it.

519
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:43,970
We will visit the surviving family, apologize, and offer proper compensation.

520
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:50,010
VP Seo Do Guk here will be leading this process.

521
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,550
Once again...

522
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,010
we sincerely apologize.

523
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,490
What?

524
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,130
What about Seo Jung Wook?

525
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,220
Is it over for him now?

526
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,210
Mr. Seo Jung Wook.

527
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,790
You are under arrest for embezzlement, slush fund creation, and falsification of documents.

528
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,510
Come with us.

529
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,130
Take him.

530
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,130
It must have been a hard day.

531
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,980
I'm okay.

532
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,950
Did you see your painting?

533
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:06,640
But why do you have it, Do Guk?

534
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,190
How I first knew about you...

535
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,660
was through that painting.

536
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,660
Amazing!

537
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,500
Man, how do you like the painting?

538
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,410
It makes me think.

539
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,220
Yeah?

540
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,540
In what way?

541
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,860
It feels like spring.

542
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,220
But it also feels like...

543
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,620
winter.

544
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,220
It's like spring has frozen over.

545
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,500
Yeah. You know, I think you're right.

546
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,710
The name of this painting is "Frozen Spring."

547
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,250
Really?

548
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:06,490
I fell in love with this painting by an unnamed artist.

549
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,050
I ended up buying it.

550
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,650
As I was looking for the artist, I found out it was you.

551
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:17,970
At the time, you had just married Mr. Yoo.

552
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:23,000
I watched you in secret.

553
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,560
But when I saw you at the party celebrating the Savings Bank acquisition...

554
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,350
I got angry.

555
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,250
At your family for treating you that way, and...

556
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,090
at you for taking it.

557
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,920
Are you their spokesperson, Ms. Han Yi Joo?

558
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,530
Because they're family.

559
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:58,180
But really, I was angry at myself for not being able to do anything about it.

560
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:02,550
I regretted speaking that way to you.

561
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,200
On my way back, the accident happened.

562
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,710
Then you came back in time?

563
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,330
Yes.

564
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,800
I was back in 2022, a year ago.

565
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,590
I'll cut to the chase.

566
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,330
How about you marry me instead of Yoo Ra?

567
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,420
You were a completely different person.

568
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,140
Is it for revenge?

569
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,750
For Han Yoo Ra and Lee Jung Hye?

570
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,110
Yes.

571
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,240
That's why I chose you.

572
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,450
When you said you needed me to get revenge against your evil family...

573
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,160
I was glad. Really glad.

574
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,000
So, why? Why did you accept my offer?

575
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,750
Because I realized...

576
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,830
that I was already in love with you.

577
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,250

The numbers are getting darker.

Does it mean that something will happen on that day?

I don't know.

There's somewhere I want to go with you.

Huh?

594
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,550
You remember me, right? I came with Chairwoman Lee Tae Ja.

595
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:03,080
Of course. You must be the Chairwoman's grandson.

596
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,800
Oh, yes.

597
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,670
So, what do you two want to know?

598
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:14,220
I heard you told my grandfather that I was my dad's birth daughter.

599
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,010
But did you also tell my stepmother?

600
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:27,380
I remember Chairman Han had something round attached to his stuff.

601
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,620
- That thing must have told her.
- You mean...

602
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,920
there was a recording device?

603
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,840
This is all coming from the General. I don't know.

604
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:40,130
But did you come all the way here to ask me that?

605
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,530
I mean...

606
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,880
I'm not sure how to explain it.

607
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,260
We were given a year.

608
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,800
If we want to come out unharmed, what should we do?

609
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:13,220
Only one should be dead, but two died.

610
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,730
That's why things got twisted.

611
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:20,550
- What?
- That's all the General said.

612
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,950
Then...

613
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,940
if one of us were to die, would the other one live?

614
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,440
Do Guk!

615
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,880
You should think of a way to stay alive together.

616
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,810
Why jump to one of you dying first?

617
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,830
Do you mean there's a way we can stay alive together?

618
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:47,590
I'm not sure. The gods know better than me about what happens six feet under.

619
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:51,720
There's no way we can know the heavens' true intentions.

620
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,210
But if I were you, I would stop being afraid and follow god's will.

621
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,520
God's will?

622
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,290
It's nothing too complicated.

623
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:05,120
Use the year, the time he gave back to you, to live well.

The answer will come to you.

625
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,600
But we told her...

626
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,090
that we were given time.

627
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,980
We never told her we were given back time.

628
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,940
Let's do as she said.

629
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,260

00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,840
I'm at a cafe near your house. Can you step out for a second?

717
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,800
Oh, well...

718
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,980
What's going on?

719
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,260
What is it? Tell me.

720
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,320
Well...

721
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:58,830
Your brother tried to commit suicide in jail.

722
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,250
What?

723
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,440
- And?
- He was taken to the hospital...

724
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,210
but he disappeared.

725
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:17,410
The police are everywhere around the hospital, so they'll have him any minute.

726
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:23,100
Vice President? What's wrong?

727
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,650
Vice President!

728
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,290
Yi Joo!

729
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,990
Yi Joo!

730
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,540
Yi Joo!

731
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:55,070
Where are you?

732
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:04,870
♫ Now I can see my halo ♫

733
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:09,500
♫ You can't cover up my mind ♫

734
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:14,700
♫ Now I can see my halo ♫

735
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:22,600
♫ Everything in red, and I'm not going back to who I was before ♫

736
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,820
♫ I can't be hurt no more ♫

[Perfect Marriage Revenge]

738
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,680
She ruined us like this, and all alone...

739
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,290
Aren't you even mad?

740
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:43,550
You want me to avenge you or something?

741
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:47,190
I thought about the best way to torture Seo Do Guk.

742
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:51,580
It would be to lose Han Yi Joo, the one he loves.

743
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,390
Yi Joo, please stay alive.

744
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,010
If there is a god, have mercy on the person who deserves love...

745
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:04,700
Give back life once more to the person who wants to love...
