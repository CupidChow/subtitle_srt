Han Yi Joo, what are you doing?

12
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,270
I like it now.

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,210
This...

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,920
is my breakup gift.

15

Stop!

16
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,490
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

20
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,770
- I can't waste another moment from now.
- So...

w-where a-are you going now?

22

to Han Yoo Ra, the one you love.

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,820
You're not denying it. I knew it.

27
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,280
Ring me up.

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,180
I like it. I can wear it out, right?

29
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,760
Sure.

30
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,990

I don't look good in blue.
[Episode 2]

34
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,100
It washes me out. I can't let people think a ghost is haunting the big day.

35
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,900
The shop is suggesting I wear a pink ribbon.

36
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,580
<i>Or change the top altogether. What do you think?</i>

37
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,520
Mother, I...

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,770
Got it, got it.

39
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,380
I'll just do the ribbon. Get back to work.

40
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,580
I'm just worried about those fancy in-laws.

41

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,950
Where's my sister? Is she changing?

44
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,020
She left.

45
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,150
She left? Where?

46
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,970
Yi Joo...

47
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,230
doesn't want to marry me.

48
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,190
What? Say it again.

49
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,020
I'm not marrying Se Hyeok.

50
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,760
I feel under the weather.

51
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,460
Go get some chicken. I'll boil it for dinner.

52
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,980
Yes.

53
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,040
Didn't you hear me?

54
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,340
Or do you just pretend not to hear the things I say?

55
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,590
What?

56
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,300
What is she saying, dressed like that?

57
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,300
- Calling off the wedding?
- Mother...

58
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,610
- Do you think we could postpone the wedding?
- What?

59
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,730
I've been distant these days, busy with work.

60
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,370
I think that was hard on Yi Joo.

61
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,170
I'll adjust the dates with the venue and the invites.

62
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,310
If it's okay with you, I want to have the wedding after I make it up to her.

63
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,170
Nobody is listening to me, I see.

64
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,510
How many times do I need to tell you?

65
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,020
Want me to say it here? The reason why I'm not marrying you?

66
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,160
- Yi Joo!
- If you're in a fight, take care of it outside.

67
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,820
I won't watch this in my own house. Got it?

68
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,760
I'm sorry, Mother.

69
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
What's with you? You're misunderstanding something.

70
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,480
I decided to marry you by my own free will.

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,830
That's how badly you want to be near Yoo Ra.

72
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,530
Be honest.

73
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,020
You have no chance with Yoo Ra, so you chose me.

74
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,610
I come from a rich family, so I can help out.

75
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,290
I'm adopted, so you don't feel so inferior.

76
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,360
Most of all, the fact that you could be close to Yoo Ra must have been the biggest factor.

77
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,930
Wow. Now that I say it out loud, you're trash, Se Hyeok.

78
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,830
Yi Joo, how can you say that to me?

79
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,800
It's your mother.

80
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,370
Yes.

81
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,670
<i>- Hello, my new daughter! I'm at the hanbok shop...</i>
- Please don't say anything.

82
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,570
I just didn't like the color, so I got a new one.

83
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,440
It's a little more expensive...

84
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,300
but a special day calls for a special outfit, right?

85
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,740
Why is she quiet?

86
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,040
Hello? Hello?

[Power off]

88
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,980
Did you just hang up on my mother?

89
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,250
You told me not to say anything.

90
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,030
Go tell her that the wedding's off.

91
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,480
Hey, Yi Joo!

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,140
You... you know my situation.

93
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,090
My father lost all his money in the stock market before he passed away.

94
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,340
All my mother has is debt after she got scammed.

95
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,980
I can't tell my family.

96
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,700
This marriage is the only thing they're counting on.

97
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,600
Yi Joo. I'll be good to you.

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,860
I'll make up for hurting you. So...

99
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,060
How?

100
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,550
Huh?

101
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,930
How are you going to make up for it?

102
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,560
I'll... I'll do all the chores.

103
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
I'll take out the trash. I'll do the cooking and the laundry.

104
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,160
I'll come home right after work.

105
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,900
I won't go out with colleagues if you don't want me to. And...

106
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,330
Please...

107
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,780
Yi Joo, you...

108
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,760
You liked me.

109
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,210
No.

110
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,670
That wasn't liking someone.

111
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,300
What?

112
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,400
<i>Trying so hard to impress your own parents...</i>

113
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,800
<i>and somehow smiling through all of it. You reminded me of myself.</i>

114
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,980
<i>I felt bad for you like I felt about myself.</i>

115
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,870
I was wrong.

116
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:11,430
I saw myself in you. Doing anything you can just to be loved.

117
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,290
I felt bad for you.

118
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,180
So...

119
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,430
it was like useless self-pity?

120
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,960
But I'm not like that anymore.

121
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,710
I'm done being pathetic.

122
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,550
<i>She was dying to get married.</i>

123
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,940
Why is she being like that?

124
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,900
Mom, just postpone her wedding.

125
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,800
- What?
- You know she was crazy about Se Hyeok.

126
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,600
If she's being like that, she must have a reason.

127
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,490
- You are way too nice.
- And...

128
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,170
maybe I can get married first?

129
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,120
You like Seo Do Guk that much?

130
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,050
Mom, I've never really wanted anything.

131
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,820
You and Dad always took care of everything for me.

132
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,310
But the moment I first saw him, this is how I felt...

133
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,960
I want that guy to be mine.

134
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,720
I've never felt this way.

135
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,190
I want to marry him.

136
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,750
I guess it's our family's first wedding. It should be you, Yoo Ra.

137
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,000
But what if she wants to go through with it?

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,970
She already says to call it off with her own mouth. She'll step aside.

139
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,560
But are you sure you can get Seo Do Guk?

140
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,240
The second son of the Taeja Group and the CEO of a successful company.

141
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,100
He must know that he's a catch.

142
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,280
Whose daughter am I?

143
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,620
I want a daughter like me, too.

144
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,560
If she's half me and half Do Guk, she'll be so pretty.

145
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,510
Of course!

146
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,650
Sons or daughters, it doesn't matter. Have at least two.

147
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,870
I'll watch them for you.

148
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,750
Yoo Ra, what do we do...

149
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,890
Now that you mentioned it...

150
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,230
I want him, too.

151
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,430
It's me. When are you free?

152
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,690
I have to talk to you about something important.

153
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,080
So, to summarize what you just told me,

154
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,910
Yoo Se Hyeok loves another woman besides you.

155
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,420
She is your younger sister, Han Yoo Ra.

156
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,860
That's why you called off the wedding?

157
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,560
Wow, daebak!

158
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,320
Hey. How come you're so calm?

159
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,800
- How come you're freaking out?
- What?

160
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,920
You're a reporter.

161
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,440
Did someone die? Is there a war?

162
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
It's nothing.

163
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,930
Right. At least nobody died.

164
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,780
And you don't have any plans to kill someone?

165
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,340
What?

166
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,410
You're so funny.

167
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,380
You really are the gossip expert, Reporter An Soo Jin.

168
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,890
I knew I could talk to you.

169
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,390
No, I don't get it.

170
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,390
You're not thinking straight right now.

171
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,700
I've seen a lot of people like you in my line of work.

172
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,860
Reality is so overwhelming, so you send your mind off to another galaxy.

173
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,090
What? Don't treat me like I belong in a psych ward.

174
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,060
Hey, who talks like that these days?

175
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,110
I'm just saying our hearts can be broken.

176
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,240
So, should I introduce you to a good doctor?

177
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,520
I have some cousins...

178
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,020
Yes. Please connect me.

179
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,520
Really?

180
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,000
Your cousin, Seo Do Guk.

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,570
What about him?

182
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,280
He's not a doctor, he's a CEO-

183
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,670
Hold on.

184
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,580
You can't...

185
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,140
So, it's not a family epic. It's a revenge tragedy.

186
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,990
No, no. If he's your sister's man...

187
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,770
This is pure melodrama.

188
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,440
Who's my sister?

189
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,830
What?

190
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,530
<i>What do you think? Don't we look better together?</i>

191
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,420
<i>That's right.</i>

192
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,410
<i>You liking me?</i>

193
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,010
<i>I knew it.</i>

194
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,510
<i>Only someone as clueless as my sister wouldn't see it.</i>

195
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,090
Someone who deceives and uses me.

196
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,460
How can I call them family?

197
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,020
She's not even my real sister.

198
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,860
Han Yi Joo...

199
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,970
you really are in your villain era.

200
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,020
I'm being serious.

201
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,300
I want Seo Do Guk.

202
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,680
So tell me if there's a reason it's going to be hard.

203
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,300
Be honest. Objectively.

204
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,420
Fine. Objectively, there are three reasons.

205
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,590
Three? Really?

206
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,180
First, the difference in your families.

207
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,750
You know what kind of family he's from, right?

208
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,700
- Everyone in South Korea knows Taeja Group.
<i>- Next up.</i>

209
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,570
<i>Taeja Constructions has been selected as the Seoul city's first construction</i>

210
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,020
<i>for the redevelopment project along the Han riverbank, announced earlier this year.</i>

211
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,970
<i>As the city of Seoul loosened its regulations around the maximum height of apartment buildings,</i>

212
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,130
<i>redevelopment of the older apartments along the riverbank has been discussed.</i>

213

<i>Noblesse Amitier will be the first building to benefit from the new laws.</i>

[Noblesse Amitier redevelopment closing ceremony]

215
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,980
We oppose reckless redevelopment!

216
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,850
Shut down the business that only serves the 1%!

217
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,540
<i>Shut it down! Shut it down!</i>

218
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,210
Distribute public rental housing as promised!

219
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,940
<i>Distribute! Distribute!</i>

220
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,680
We oppose reckless development!

221
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,700
Shut down the business that only serves the 1%!

222
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,220
- Mr. Vice President.
<i>- Shut it down! Shut it down!</i>

223
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,840
The number of public rental housing on the development site

224
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,260
has become one-third of the original plan.

225
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,480
This is due to the newly relaxed reconstruction regulations causing invasions in the planned site.

226
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,250
However, there is talk that the construction company, Taeja Constructions, had an influence.

227
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,550
You're saying that Taeja Constructions controls the government's budget for public housing?

228
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,180
That's a huge compliment.

229
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,420
We'll have to work harder to meet your expectations. Thank you.

230
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,390
Mr. Vice President!

231
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,750
Please, just one more comment.

232
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,030
Take your time attacking me.

233
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,430
As you can see, I can't run away very fast.

234
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,370
<i>Yes. A net value of over 60 trillion,</i>

235
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,940
<i>12th in the nation, the mega-corporation Taeja Group.</i>

236
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,700
Look. Half of those buildings were built by Taeja.

237
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,820
The other half, they probably supplied the materials.

238
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,670
A family like that-

239
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,280
Hanwool Financial Group is nothing to them.

240
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,070
"Financials?" They just gambled with private loans and got lucky.

241
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,610
But he went on a blind date with Yoo Ra.

242
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,100
That?

243
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,320
Your mother, Lee Jung Hye, somehow made it happen.

244
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,120
Oh, my goodness! So nice! My gosh!

245
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,770
It was so difficult to get this.

246
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:54,250
I thought it had to be good enough for your taste.

247
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,110
I love it. Look at these colors...

248
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,720
Oh, Ma'am! So great to run into you here.

249
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,960
This must be your son.

250
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,540
Oh, yes.

251
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,170
And who is with you?

252
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,870
Oh. Yes.

253
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,620
<i>The Chegang Group lady set it up, pretending it was a coincidence.</i>

254
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,090
Then she called up everyone and bragged about the painting.

255
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,830
She said it was a gift from Lee Jung Hye, but everyone knows.

256
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,910
It wasn't a gift. It was a bribe.

257
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,850
Well, she must have thought setting them up was enough.

258
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,630
You know so many guys are crazy for Yoo Ra.

259
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,900
So what's the second reason?

260
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:04,000
They say you're not marrying the man. You're marrying his family.

261
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,830
What do you think the women in that family are like?

262
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,770
<i>First, his grandmother.</i>

263
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,780
<i>Started out as a carpenter. She built what is now Taeja Group.</i>

264
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,160
<i>Madam Lee Tae Ja.</i>

265
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,530
In my old age, I can't control my strength.

266
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,420
Mother, stop blaming your age.

267
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,350
- What did you say?
- You just don't like it.

268
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,480
What Jung Wook is doing.

269
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,510
Look, people in construction shouldn't be greedy for money.

270
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,010
Do Guk wouldn't have.

271
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,290
Right, you shouldn't have let him go.

272
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,000
- What good is regret when he's gone?
- Stop it!

273
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,960
What did you do, huh?

274
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,970
If I had taken Do Guk's side, I would have been called an evil stepmother.

275
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,500
An elder needs to hold everyone together in times like that.

276
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,240
Right. I should have done my elder duty.

277
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,700
See how you look down on me.

278
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,930
Even my daughter-in-law is trying to be my equal...

279
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,990
Mother? Your tea is cold.

280
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,330
- Drink it.
- I don't want it.

281
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,200
<i>My aunt, who never lets grandma have the last word.</i>

282
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,390
<i>Cha Yeon Hwa.</i>

283
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,980
Mom! Grandma!

284
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,040
You should be at work.

285
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,280
What's going on?

286
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,340
I was in the neighborhood.

287
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,190
We have mangoes, right?

288
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,650
I'll take them.

289
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,680
Do Na is just nuts.

290
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,260
A fearless grandmother-in-law, a mother-in-law who never backs down,

291
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,930
plus an insane sister-in-law.

292
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,390
It's hell.

293
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,250
If hell was a combo meal, it's those three.

294
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,740
Got it. What's the last reason?

295
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,530
You still can't give it up?

296
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:59,470
Fine. The last reason is the biggest.

297
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,620
It's called Seo. Do. Guk.

298
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,220
Why? He's a fine catch for a husband.

299
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,150
He's good-looking, rich, and professional.

300
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,130
You only know the half of it.

301
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,510
<i>His face? Handsome, of course.</i>

302
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,730
<i>But he's annoying.</i>

303
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,130
<i>I got mangoes for you. What do you mean you can't eat them?</i>

304
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,220
Honey, what am I supposed to do?

305
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,550
I need to work late tonight.

306
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,770
I'll eat here...

307
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,070
Seo Do Na. Stop bullying your husband.

308
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,810
Hyungnim...

309
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,460
When we're at work, he's not your husband or my brother-in-law.

310
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,570
He's just a secretary to CEO Seo Do Guk.

311
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,300
Only I'm allowed to bully him.

312
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,190
I was almost moved to work hard.

313
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,490
- How much?
- What?

314
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,380
Secretary Byeon, isn't money what moves you the most?

315
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:20,520
If I doubled your salary, would you stay here forever?

316
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,310
Let's go inside, CEO.

317
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,890
<i>As much as he's rich, he's annoying.</i>

318
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,390
Hello.

319
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,590
What's the urgent report?

320
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,520
CEO Seo, Good Place, and Design A are merging.

321
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,800
I thought we saw that coming.

322
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,170
It's happening way too fast.

323
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,580
Turns out KGD Investments, the majority shareholder of the two companies, led the efforts.

324
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,450
Still, their business is valued at a tenth of ours.

325
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,950
You don't have that much pride in your company?

326
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,790
<i>As much as he's a professional, he's annoying.</i>

327
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,500
So you just mean he's annoying.

328
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,580
The most annoying thing in the world is a man who knows he's hot stuff.

329
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,780
Grandma always liked Do Guk more than Jung Wook.

330
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,850
But he still left, doing his own thing, and started his own company.

331
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,710
So, he's not going to date just any woman.

332
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,570
No matter how hard Han Yoo Ra tries...

333
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,920
I only need ten minutes.

334
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,890
- What?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

335
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,260
Seo Do Guk is meeting Han Yoo Ra.

336
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,470
Just find out where and when.

337
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,140
Hello, Seo Do Guk.

338
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,600
Could I sit for a second?

339
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,370
Han Yi Joo?

340
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,190
<i>Did he know me before I got married?</i>

341
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,980
Do you know me?

342
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,180
I know my date's family.

343
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,100
You're Han Yoo Ra's older sister, and...

344
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,040
fiancée to Chief of Staff Yoo Se Hyeok.

345
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,490
You got it wrong.

346
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,780
I was adopted young, so I'm not Yoo Ra's real sister.

347
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,270
I also broke up with Yoo Se Hyeok.

348
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,260
What are you saying?

349
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,370
I'm saying...

350
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,640
I'll cut to the chase.

351
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,120
How about you marry me instead of Yoo Ra?

352
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,140
If it's for the business anyway.

353
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,180
If you're okay with it, I'd like to go somewhere quiet and explain.

354
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,240
I heard you were boring.

355
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,000
But you're more fun than I thought.

356
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,050
What did you say?

357
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,850
So, why should I choose you?

358
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,370
Given the chance, don't you think I'd rather pick the better woman?

359
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,140
Maybe the one who's more assertive.

360
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,710
Or...

361
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,240
the one who's sexier.

362
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,200
What is this?

363
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,850
I think you know from the way you look at it.

364
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,530
I'm not so sure.

365
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,590
I don't like a guy who tests me like this at the first meeting.

366
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,850
If a woman makes me want to use this at the first meeting,

367
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,640
I think she might be worth my future.

368
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,400
Unni?

369
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,990
What... why are you two together?

370
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,230
Who's going to explain? Do Guk?

371
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,980
So, Han Yi Joo.

372
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,540
What are you going to do?

373
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,100
This is so weird.

374
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,810
Unni! Can we talk over there?

375
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,140
I don't think so.

376
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,310
Because we need to use this.

377
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,750
What do you think, Seo Do Guk?

378
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,420
Of course, Han Yi Joo.

379
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,780
Let's go upstairs.

380
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,260
Do Guk!

381
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,480
What?

382
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,510
Se Hyeok, what did you just say?

383
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,920
We need to postpone the wedding.

384
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,600
Why? Is it because of the hanbok?

385
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
She was offended by my asking?

386
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,240
- No, Mother...
- Oppa.

387
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,400
Be honest. You messed up big, right?

388
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,160
Why would your brother mess up?

389
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,660
Then why did he get on his knees?

390
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,560
Wow, daebak.

391
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,270
What? What are you saying?

392
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,690
What did you do wrong? Huh?

393
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,280
I don't think you stole money...

394
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,380
Wait, did she find out that you like Yoo Ra?

395
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,470
I think I'm right.

396
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,890
I told you to keep your mouth shut!

397
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,010
- Hello?
<i>- Oppa...</i>

398
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,300
What's wrong? What happened?

399
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,690
What?

400
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,130
[9th Floor / Registered Floor 27]

401
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,700
Aren't you going to open it?

402
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,230
Why isn't it working?

403
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,100
Don't look so anxious.

404
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,920
If you're not careful, you'll get eaten.

405
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,270
- Yoo Ra!
- Oppa.

406
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,150
Is there some kind of emergency contact network?

407
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,740
Is there any way to talk to Do Guk? Anything?

408
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,770
First, calm down. You might have misunderstood the situation.

409
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,960
Misunderstood?

410
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,060
They headed upstairs in an embrace like they were showing off.

411
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,590
They're not picking up, and they haven't come downstairs.

412
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,220
So what do you think?

413
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,650
What do you think a man and woman are doing in a hotel room?

414
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,860
- This is...
- I book it when I'm working.

415
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,330
It's easy to focus here alone.

416
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,830
I brought you here since we're talking business, Han Yi Joo.

417
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,380
Or...

418
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,700
were you thinking of something else?

419
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,800
You were being weird, talking about getting eaten.

420
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,840
I meant if you look nervous during a negotiation,

421
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,300
you'll be easy prey.

422
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,160
It's business common sense. Remember it.

423
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,290
Why are you speaking to me casually?

424
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,010
Maybe you don't remember.

425
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,090
You did it first.

426
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,630
We're around the same age anyway.

427
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,270
So why don't you tell me?

428
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,480
What you were trying to say earlier.

429
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,990
[Han Yoo Ra]

430
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,330
<i>I'm going to wait right here.</i>

431
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,190
<i>Until you come outside.</i>

432
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,400
It might take a while.

433
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,380
You should stay the night.

434
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,530
What?

435
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,110
If you don't have plans, stay the night.

436
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,780
I don't have plans.

437
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,350
But I'm not just going to sleep here.

438
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,280
What?

439
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,260
You said you want to get married.

440
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,350
The most important thing in a marriage.

441
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:31,060
The thing that people actually mean when they say "differences" during a divorce.

442
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,450
It's important to me.

443
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,290
Could I...

444
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,830
check now?

445
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,890
Honestly...

446
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,890
you're not my type.

447
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,210
- What?
- Try seducing me first, then.

448
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,840
I don't know if we'll feel the same way, though.

449
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,750
What?

450
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,710
You're not going to seduce me?

451
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,240
Yes, this is it.

452
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,670
Confident. Making the other person want to listen to you.

453
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,190
Your grandmother wants you to get married, right?

454
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,510
Come home or...

455
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,480
get married and start a family.

456
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,020
If you pick the former, she'll give you Taeja Group.

457
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,330
If you pick the latter, she'll invest in your current company.

458
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,460
To achieve your goal of having your company go public.

459
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,960
How did you...

460
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,200
Don't be so surprised. I can tell you information about your competition, too.

461
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:02,830
Firstly, the companies talking about merging? That's going to fall apart.

462
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,310
American interest rates are going up, so private equity funds are headed there.

463
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,190
Is it Yoo Se Hyeok?

464
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,980
He's the only one who would give you this much insider information.

465
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,400
I don't think you would tell Yoo Se Hyeok this much insider information.

466
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,530
- You don't trust him that much.
- Precisely.

467
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,600
But why me?

468
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,860
Why did you choose me?

469
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:03,400
It seemed like you had enough taste to know my value.

470
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,380
And your looks aren't bad, either.

471
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,280
What? Are you embarrassed?

472
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,060
No.

473
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,040
Thank you for the compliment.

474
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,950
So, is that all you wanted to say?

475
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,750
I won't get on your nerves.

476
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,800
While we're married, I'll leave you alone.

477
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,950
We'll keep our finances separate.

478
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,960
After a while, I'll divorce you.

479
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,550
What do you think? Choosing me as your business partner.

480
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,690
I wish I could recruit you for our sales team.

481
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,670
You're more convincing than any employee I have.

482
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,850
So? Your answer?

483
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,340
I'm curious about you.

484
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,390
The person, Han Yi Joo. She's quite interesting.

485
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,570
It's going to get better.

486
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,290
What are you going to do?

487
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,510
What?

488
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,330
Yi Joo. What are you going to do about her?

489
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,930
You're going to make her stay, right?

490
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,500
How? Have you thought about it?

491
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,600
I need to hear about what happened today first.

492
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,570
How can you be in such denial?

493
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,640
My sister only had eyes for you.

494
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,670
What did you do to make a person change overnight?

495
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:42,260
It's like she wants to ruin all of us.

496
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,000
- Yoo Ra.
- Don't touch me.

497
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,030
I'm sick and tired of this.

498
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,460
Yoo Ra!

499
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,210
I think you're drunk.

500
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,160
Why don't we call it a night?

501
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,580
Drunk?

502
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,070
Who?

503
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,720
You, Seo Do Guk?

504
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,370
Then...

505
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,590
why don't you head to bed first?

506
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,950
That's mine.

507
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,010
I'm not stealing it.

508
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,050
Tie it up. What are you doing?

509
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,240
You're too thin.

510
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,760
What?

511
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,150
If you want to marry me, gain some weight first.

512
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,810
I don't want my wife dying before me.

513
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,700
I...

514
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,530
already died once.

515
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,510
Has your life ever flashed before your eyes?

516
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,650
I'm not dead. How would I have seen that?

517
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,190
I've seen it.

518
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,740
Every moment of my life...

519
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,300
spreads out right in front of me like a photo album.

520
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,530
But the surprising thing was,

521
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,890
I didn't have any.

522
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,290
Of what?

523
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,310
Moments that I wanted to hold onto.

524
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,640
How does that make sense?

525
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,580
That means I've never been happy.

526
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,700
That kind of life...

527
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,270
is meaningless.

528
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,870
I don't know why I held on so tightly.

529
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,220
You're drunk. Get some rest...

00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,120
Well...

707
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,460
Yes, of course, Mother.

708
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,760
- So what's wrong with you?
- Pardon?

709
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,380
You're my son.

710
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,610
How come my blood skipped you and went straight to him?

711
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:48,030
Mother, how could you say such a thing...

712
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,300
Tell me.

713
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,550
Aigoo, stop!

714
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,450
Stop the side conversations.

715
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:58,830
Mother, I was in the middle of a very important conservation with my son.

716
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,540
I'm also having a very important conversation with my son.

717
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,120
Yes, it's Seo Do Guk.

718
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,540
<i>It's me, Han Yi Joo.</i>

719
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,170
Why was your phone off?

720
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,410
What is this number?

721
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,230
Do you...

722
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,600
have any idea how long I waited?

723
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,220
It's a long story.

724
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,700
So, um... I want to meet up to talk.

725
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,320
Where should I meet you? Your house?

726
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:37,740
Aren't we moving a little too fast?

727
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,830
I'm locked up right now.

728
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,100
If you come right now, I'll make a proper business proposal.

729
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,480
I can give you information on stocks in your industry. So...

730
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,530
<i>If you want favors, speak politely.</i>

731
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:52,050
<i>I'm two years older than you.</i>

732
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:54,490
- What?
- For example...

733
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,890
"Please rescue me, my prince." Or something like that.

734
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,160
This guy is crazy.

735
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,080
Forget it, then. Should I come tomorrow?

736
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,160
Okay, okay!

737
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:13,250
Res... rescue me. You... pr... primo dummy!

738
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,720
Primo... pri... hel-

739
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,060
What strange phone call was that?

740
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,840
I'm sorry, but I'm heading out.

741
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,560
You just got here.

742
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,480
You haven't seen your grandmother in forever. Where are you going?

743
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:37,800
Grandmother. The woman who might be my wife is in danger.

744
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,850
I can't just sit and watch. I'm heading out.

745
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:42,920
I heard she's adopted.

746
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,460
How is she different from her sister, whom you were set up with?

747
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:54,090
Her education? Looks? Or her place in the family?

748
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,160
I don't think it's any of those things.

749
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,540
And you still want to marry her?

750
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:04,630
I want to get to know her.

751
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,960
For the first time in my life.

752
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,350
Pri- I mean, Hyungnim!

753
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:16,460
Honey. It seems like Do Guk means it.

754
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,710
Right? His eyes are completely smitten.

755
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,570
No more side conversations, I said!

756
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,110
Thank you for your phone.

757
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,220
Your battery's almost out. Go charge your phone.

758
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,430
You're up to all kinds of things now.

759
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,000
You should knock, Mother.

760
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,650
Did you just call Seo Do Guk?

761
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,840
Why? You want him to get you out of here?

762
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,210
You're flattering yourself after spending one night together.

763
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:14,410
Do you think that meant anything to Seo Do Guk?

764
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:18,080
You threw yourself at him, and he had some fun.

765
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,550
- What did you just say?
- Or...

766
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:24,450
do you really think Seo Do Guk would love someone

767
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,450
who doesn't even know where she came from?

768
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,490
Is that what you want?

769
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,850
Please, come back to earth.

770
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:40,930
What man is going to love a girl abandoned by her own mother?

771
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,900
Se Hyeok at least accepts you.

772
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,000
You should be prostrating yourself and be thankful.

773
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,770
But what are you doing?

774
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:55,040
Yi Joo, think about your days in the orphanage.

775
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,340
You were such a good girl, desperate to be adopted.

776
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:03,510
And thanks to that, you're here now.

777
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,180
I...

778
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,490
- I...
- No need to say more.

779
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:14,890
Tomorrow morning, I'll call Mr. Yoo's parents to go ahead and rush the wedding.

780
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,350
- So, you...
- Han Yi Joo.

781
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:26,880
Come out. Now.

782
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:48,510
You are the second son of Taeja Group?

783
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:51,570
I'm sorry for the late introduction. I'm Seo Do Guk.

784
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,640
This was quite unexpected...

785
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,680
So, what brings you all the way here?

786
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,230
Please speak to me casually. That's better for me, too.

787
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:07,000
I came to ask for your blessing to marry your daughter.

788
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,240
Marriage? With Yoo Ra?

789
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,580
No.

790
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:18,640
- With Yi Joo.
- What?

791
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,280
What are you talking about?

792
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,450
Seo Do Guk. This is ridiculous.

793
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:28,760
You were set up with Yoo Ra, but now you're marrying Yi Joo?

794
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:35,640
Thank you for flattering me, but...

795
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,460
I know that you got the Chegang Group lady to...

796
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:44,110
I mean, you asked her if she could...

797
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:47,020
set up a date with Yoo Ra.

798
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,130
But I'm not a fan of arranged marriages.

799
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:53,680
I told Han Yoo Ra no.

800
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:59,190
But she kept contacting me, putting me in an awkward position.

801
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:05,100
Then, you already turned down Yoo Ra?

802
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,640
- Yes.
- And...

803
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,480
you want to marry Yi Joo?

804
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,950
That's correct.

805
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:16,230
We wish to walk down the aisle as soon as possible.

806
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:19,890
As her father, what do you think?

807
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,380
My goodness...

808
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:31,110
If you two like each other, I have nothing more to say.

809
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:32,730
- Honey!
- Dad!

810
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:35,670
Lower your voice. We have a guest.

811
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,160
This doesn't make any sense.

812
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,530
When did you two get together?

813
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:50,140
You called off the wedding because you said Se Hyeok liked me.

814
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:56,010
So, I was so scared that I did something wrong.

815
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,300
If what you're saying is true,

816
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:03,930
you and Seo Do Guk got involved before you broke off the engagement.

817
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:09,590
Yesterday was the first time

818
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:15,150
Yi Joo and I met one-on-one.

819
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:19,020
You slept together that night and decided to get married?

820
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,700
If you meet the one you're meant to be with,

821
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,490
that's what happens.

822
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:29,070
I hope you meet someone like that, Han Yoo Ra.

823
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:37,070
But Mr. Seo, doesn't this all seem too rushed?

824
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:42,080
Yi Joo must not have even processed her breakup.

825
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,940
I'll be at her side to support her.

826
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:00,220
That's my job.

827
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,260
All right, then.

828
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:16,100
I will consider this your approval.

829
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,650
Why don't you stay for dinner?

830
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:22,400
I'm sorry, but I'd like to take Yi Joo out.

831
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,530
We need to talk, anyway.

832
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:28,430
Right. At this stage, you want to spend all your time together.

833
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:31,110
Then, see you later. Soon.

834
01:02:55,770 --> 01:03:00,890
I think Yi Joo grew up receiving more love than I thought.

835
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:03,300
Locking up your grown daughter for not coming home last night,

836
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,890
and even taking away her phone...

837
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,720
Don't worry about her from now on.

838
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,870
I'll protect Yi Joo.

839
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,900
I canceled important plans to come here.

840
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,860
Han Yi Joo, you need to give me something in return.

841
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,320
Fine.

842
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:51,570
What should I start with?

843
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:54,580
The merging companies' stocks?

844
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,790
Have you eaten?

845
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,430
It's late. Let's talk after we eat.

846
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,100
Sure.

847
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,430
We'll go with your recommended dishes.

848
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:44,060
What's wrong?

849
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,930
I can't eat this.

850
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,340
I can't really eat stuff like this.

851
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,910
Stuff like this?

852
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,240
Then, what do you usually eat?

853
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,880
Stuff from the convenience store.

854
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,340
Pre-made things wrapped in plastic.

855
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:17,330
What?

856
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,880
Where are we going?

857
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:40,660
I heated it up.

858
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:45,480
Or, do it yourself.

859
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:00,760
About what you wanted to hear...

860
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:06,070
The war in Ukraine might go on longer than expected.

861
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:09,050
Then, there will be issues with the supply of construction materials.

862
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:10,470
So stock up on what you can-

863
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:12,720
No thanks. I don't want to hear this.

864
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,210
At least have one more bite.

865
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,320
You don't look good.

866
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:24,580
Why?

867
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:29,350
Do you feel bad for me?

868
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,370
What?

869
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:33,420
You saw.

870
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,600
How they treat me back there.

871
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:45,670
My room isn't even half the size of Yoo Ra's, with no sunlight.

872
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:50,160
No color, no proper furniture.

873
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,820
It's monotone and minimalist.

874
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,690
It's nice. Latest trend.

875
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:14,450
You heard how my so-called mother speaks to me.

876
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:18,980
One night?

877
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,190
It means nothing.

878
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:25,060
He was just having fun.

879
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,410
With a nobody.

880
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:34,940
A girl abandoned by her own parents.

881
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,500
- Who would love her?
- Stop it.

882
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:42,300
You don't need to keep thinking about such nonsense.

883
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:55,590
The family I've had for my whole life wants to get rid of me,

884
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,950
but you...

885
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:03,210
You're on my side. You came to rescue me.

886
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:06,310
You worry about me like this.

887
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:13,430
- That's...
- Money is great, I guess.

888
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,950
Now, I have a reliable partner.

889
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,600
It feels good.

890
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:48,970
Han Yi Joo.

891
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:01,850
What happened to you in that house?

892
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,480
Somebody...

893
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,760
poisoned my food.

894
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:24,180
It was the housekeeper, apparently.

895
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,960
She was fired right away. I never got to see her again.

896
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:34,520
But I liked her.

897
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:42,970
Since then, I don't know who I can trust.

898
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,830
Did she really do it?

899
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:50,820
And if not,

900
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:56,530
was it someone else? Who?

901
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:03,350
Who feels like this about their own family?

902
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:07,920
Afraid that someone in your family might hurt you.

903
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,350
I'm...

904
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:16,010
weird, right?

905
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:20,550
I'm broken, right?

906
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,920
I want revenge.

907
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:38,580
Against the people who made me like this.

908
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,140
I want revenge.

909
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,800
Tell me. The real reason you want to marry me.

910
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,940
Is it for revenge?

911
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:58,860
For Han Yoo Ra and Lee Jung Hye?

912
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,270
Yes.

913
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,470
That's why I chose you.

914
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:08,580
Han Yoo Ra wants Seo Do Guk.

915
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:12,310
If Yoo Ra is hurting,

916
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:16,570
Se Hyeok, who loves her, will also hurt.

917
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,640
Mother too. She would die for her real daughter.

918
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:23,860
Everyone will suffer.

919
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,850
Yes...

920
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:33,300
This is what I wanted to hear.

921
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,680
I told you. I like a woman who's assertive.

922
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:15,800
What is this...

923
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:24,340
If I'm going to rescue a princess, I should come prepared.

924
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:30,600
This is just a placeholder, okay?

925
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,320
Is that all right with you?

926
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,300
Marry me, Han Yi Joo.

927
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:50,100
No.

928
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:54,320
Will you marry me, Yi Joo?

929
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,940
I didn't prepare anything.

930
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,660
What should I do?

931
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:19,650
Show me, then.

932
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,980
T-That's... n-not what you wanted?

933
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,670
I'm sorry. I thought...

934
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:52,180
That's...

935
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:55,480
not enough.

936
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,820
