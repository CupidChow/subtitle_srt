[Love Never Fails]
[EP40]

3
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
What I want

4
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,700
is just Hongning.

5
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,980
Stop!

6
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,980
How dare you bring her up?

7
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,300
Kunlun!

8
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,500
Luyao gave her life

9
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,260
not for you

10
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,660
to kill out of hate.

11
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,579
Hongning gave me back the phalange

12
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
not to make me

13
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,660
hold onto revenge.

14
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,420
What do you mean?

15
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,460
Phalange?

16
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,620
Where is she?

17
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,500
Baicha,

18
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,540
you still don't get it,

19
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,260
Hongning cared for you.

20
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,180
Back at Floralia Palace,

21
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,579
she risked her life for you.

22
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,180
Because she saw you

23
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,300
as a friend for life.

24
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,579
But you want

25
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,220
more and more.

26
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,500
The hate

27
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,500
grew deeper as well.

28
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,860
All because of you.

29
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,300
Yes,

30
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,980
it was all her fault!

31
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,260
Now matter how,

32
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,540
there's no excuse

33
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,020
for how you turned out.

34
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,220
You thought Hongning'd leave

35
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,020
after she ascended.

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,180
Hongning…

37
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,220
She wouldn't.

38
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,340
[His roots were wounded,]

39
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,300
[I don't have enough power]

40
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,900
[to save him.]

41
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,540
[Don't be scared.]

42
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,780
[I'm Hongning.]

43
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,820
[This is rainwater,]

44
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,340
[and this is fresh soil,]

45
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,220
[all for you.]

46
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,460
[Don't worry,]

47
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,660
[I'm here now,]

48
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,620
[I won't let them]

49
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,980
[hurt you anymore.]

50
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,020
[From now on,]

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,700
[we're friends.]

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,300
[From now on,]

53
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,300
[you're my best]

54
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,020
[and only friend!]

55
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,500
[Hongning.]

56
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,500
[Hongning!]

57
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,260
[No matter what,]

58
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,180
[I'll always pray for you!]

59
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,860
[Baicha,]

60
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,860
[take care of yourself!]

61
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,740
Thank you

62
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,740
for bringing her back.

63
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,620
Thank you for guarding her

64
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,580
all those lives.

65
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,019
Hongning

66
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,140
never forgot these.

67
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,460
Now,

68
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,820
let it all

69
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,260
end here.

70
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,940
Just kill me.

71
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,900
This ain't killing out of hate,

72
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,420
he had it coming.

73
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,180
[What I want]

74
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,300
[was never to rule Three Realms,]

75
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,820
[nor to live forever as a deity.]

76
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,940
[Hongning,]

77
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,180
[since I met you,]

78
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,460
[I finally saw it clear.]

79
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,659
[None of that beats]

80
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,900
[every ordinary,]

81
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,220
[noisy,]

82
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,660
[tiny]

83
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,020
[moment on earth.]

84
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,060
[I'd trade my Kylin blood]

85
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,740
[to bring peace to all realms.]

86
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,260
[Everything will be]

87
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,540
[just like you wished.]

88
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,059
[This world you love so much,]

89
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,659
[I'll guard it]

90
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
[with all I've got.]

91
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,180
Glad

92
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,500
you're alright.

93
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,380
I'm sorry.

94
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,980
If that's for what

95
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,060
happened to my Father,

96
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,540
then save it.

97
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,060
You don't hate me?

98
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,060
Everything today

99
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,100
is the result of his own choice.

100
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,900
And Luyao…

101
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,340
Don't go saying something

102
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,100
gloomy again.

103
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,060
She's the Matriarch

104
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,900
of the nine-tailed foxes from the NCR.

105
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,300
It's said they have nine lives.

106
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,140
Don't worry,

107
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,860
she'll be fine.

108
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,380
Sir,

109
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,860
it's all over now.

110
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,220
You once told me

111
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,380
to live for myself.

112
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,700
Now it's time for me

113
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,020
to find

114
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,220
my own path.

115
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,340
Lujiu,

116
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,820
take care.

117
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,700
Where do you think he's going?

118
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,540
Going where he thinks is right,

119
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,940
and doing what he believes in.

120
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,860
Look,

121
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,620
the demon army

122
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,740
backed off

123
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,860
when you gave the order.

124
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,100
Most demons

125
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,460
aren't looking for a fight.

126
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,060
It was Baicha who played on

127
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,220
their fear deep down.

128
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,020
Scared of getting crushed,

129
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,020
so they all jumped in.

130
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,260
What about the heavenly army?

131
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,700
Waiting by the Gate of Reincarnation.

132
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,260
Both realms

133
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,980
took a heavy hit

134
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,580
from this whole war.

135
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,140
But the mortal realm suffered the most.

136
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,620
With the war raging this long,

137
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,260
the mortal world

138
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,140
will surely be doomed to chaos,

139
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,700
waiting to be saved.

140
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,540
This is on me.

141
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,540
Bro,

142
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,380
now that it's over,

143
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,060
what's next for you?

144
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,460
What I ought to do.

145
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,660
You're blessed by Kylin,

146
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,980
fated to protect all.

147
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
You're both the Demon King

148
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,460
and

149
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,060
the last Emperor Star.

150
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,220
Demons and immortals share roots,

151
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,900
you should take the throne

152
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,660
and keep the realms in check.

153
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,660
But the demon realm

154
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,100
needs a ruler too.

155
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,100
Why can't I be

156
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,620
the Demon King?

157
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,460
How did I never notice

158
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,660
you're this

159
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,220
impossible?

160
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
You started it.

161
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,780
Now you're

162
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
turning this on me?

163
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,620
Kunlun,

164
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,060
when I was exiled,

165
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,580
you stood up

166
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,420
and took the Monarch's duty.

167
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,900
You know better

168
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,540
how to balance

169
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,780
the power of the realms.

170
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,380
You're the right one

171
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,980
for the throne.

172
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,220
Now you're tossing it

173
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,140
back at me?

174
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,220
I'm just as torn.

175
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,780
You know,

176
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,300
I grew up on tales

177
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,580
about heroes everyone admired.

178
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,860
Those tales

179
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,780
have broadened my knowledge

180
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,500
and expanded my horizons.

181
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,500
They've also

182
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,420
concretized the imagination of mortals,

183
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,180
helping them understand

184
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,700
life and death,

185
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,980
love, and righteousness.

186
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,300
Jinxiu,

187
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,780
thanks to you!

188
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,980
Your story

189
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,300
lit a fire

190
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,780
in me!

191
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,780
I've got to write your legend,

192
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,660
I don't care what the heavens say!

193
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,020
I'm writing it anyway!

194
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,860
I know you'll become

195
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,940
a legend for the mortals!

196
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,260
That's what real immortals

197
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,140
should be remembered for!

198
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,460
In any case,

199
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:37,940
I swear…

200
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,620
My old fellow.

201
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,500
If it weren't for me,

202
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,500
you'd have a good post by now.

203
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,260
I owe you.

204
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,140
Sir Jinxiu.

205
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,460
You're back.

206
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,740
I'm no longer

207
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,860
the Celestial Commander.

208
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,580
Calling me that

209
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,740
doesn't feel right.

210
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,340
Then I'll call you

211
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,260
Demon King.

212
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,020
Jinxiu!

213
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,100
I wanna go to the Withered Garden.

214
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,540
Jinxiu!

215
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,780
Jinxiu…

216
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,420
"The heavenly historian"

217
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,500
"once dared to call out"

218
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,700
"the heir to the Celestial Monarch,"

219
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,060
"the former"

220
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:26,940
"Celestial Commander,"

221
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,940
"the past Floral Deity,"

222
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,460
"the ex-Punisher,"

223
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,260
"by his name!"

224
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,300
Jinxiu...

225
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,180
Hell yeah!

226
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,100
Cool.

227
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,180
[No littering in the Withered Garden.]

228
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,260
[No hiding booze in the Withered Garden!]

229
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,700
[These are]

230
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,140
[all failed batches from the Wine Garden.]

231
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,180
[If only my besties,]

232
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,740
[Jiaobo and Ningmeng, were here.]

233
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,580
[Then I'd ask her]

234
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,460
[for more mint,]

235
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,260
[then the wine'd taste amazing!]

236
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,620
[Told you,]

237
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,060
[when you're down,]

238
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,260
[have a drink.]

239
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,380
[Shaoyao!]

240
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,500
[Sir Jinxiu!]

241
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,580
[Are you here to see me?]

242
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,380
[Nope.]

243
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,900
[Just dropping off flowers.]

244
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,740
[Thought you]

245
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,340
[came to see my cultivation.]

246
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,100
[Sir.]

247
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,780
[What is it?]

248
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,420
[Take care.]

249
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,620
[Sir,]

250
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,460
[can I be your Empress now?]

251
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Find her for me.

252
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,060
No matter when

253
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,020
or where.

254
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,020
Find her for me.

255
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,500
[The Celestial Realm]

256
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,460
[was built to last.]

257
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,860
[But sadly,]

258
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,300
[tragedy struck hard.]

259
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,380
[Now the immortal-demon war's over,]

260
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,220
[and the world]

261
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,540
[is back in one piece.]

262
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,060
Time to rebuild all realms.

263
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,820
Sir Kunlun,

264
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,060
son of the former Celestial Monarch,

265
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,140
once ruled in his place.

266
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,540
Wise and noble,

267
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,140
he cared for all,

268
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,540
and won the hearts of all.

269
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,180
So,

270
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,700
the throne

271
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,940
goes to Sir Kunlun.

272
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,820
He now holds

273
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,980
the Emperor's Seal!

274
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,100
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

275
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,900
The past unbreakable rules

276
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,620
were broken in just one day.

277
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,620
This change

278
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
is shaking the foundations.

279
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,620
It's hard for you all

280
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,980
to adapt so fast,

281
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,620
that's fair enough.

282
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,500
Immortals and demons

283
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,940
share same roots,

284
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,780
we should share the same rule.

285
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,900
From this day on,

286
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,980
be you immortal

287
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,300
or demon,

288
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,420
ascending or descending

289
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,780
will not be limited anymore.

290
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,860
The Demotion Pool is gone.

291
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,060
To be immortal or demon,

292
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,020
just report it.

293
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,860
No need for heavenly tribulation.

294
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,700
Cultivation in all realms

295
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,660
returns to its roots.

296
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,500
Doing good deeds.

297
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:22,940
From now on,

298
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,860
no more ranks!

299
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,940
[Awesome!]

300
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,700
I wanna be an immortal,

301
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,420
can you make it happen?

302
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,180
I want it to!

303
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,260
May I?

304
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,700
Sure.

305
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,700
Come on up.

306
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,220
I'll grant you immortal register.

307
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,020
Thanks!

308
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,140
Calm down!

309
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,500
I'm just…

310
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,180
No need!

311
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,340
Just testing you.

312
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,180
You keep your word,

313
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,980
you're a good guy,

314
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,180
then we trust you.

315
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:48,980
Right, Jiaobo?

316
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,620
Wait a sec!

317
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
What are you saying?

318
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,780
Your Majesty,

319
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,780
you really look like

320
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,700
ruler of all realms!

321
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,620
This war

322
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,700
left great damage in the Celestial Realm.

323
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,580
Envoy Plum

324
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,420
of Floralia Palace

325
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,180
will take over as Floral Deity

326
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,860
for restoration.

327
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

328
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,340
Great!

329
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,900
Chrysanthemum Attendant

330
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,340
will take over as Historian.

331
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

332
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,580
Uh…

333
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,340
Your Majesty...

334
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,180
Your Majesty!

335
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:33,940
Your Majesty.

336
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:34,900
What about me?

337
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,580
I...

338
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,540
Listen.

339
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,180
You're now my personal historian

340
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,820
and will work for me.

341
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,620
Hold up,

342
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,220
you're still salty?

343
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,420
No, uh…

344
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,660
Thanks, Your Majesty.

345
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,540
Who's that?

346
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,380
Official Chrysanthemum.

347
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,020
General Hengtian.

348
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,060
You'll take over as Punisher.

349
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,940
Please keep peace in Three Realms.

350
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,980
Anyone stirring trouble

351
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
should be punished.

352
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

353
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,580
- Hail Your Majesty.
- Hail Your Majesty.

354
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,260
Hail Your Majesty.

355
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,220
Hail Your Majesty.

356
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,380
Hail Your Majesty!

357
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,540
Hail Your Majesty!

358
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,500
Congrats!

359
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,380
Hail Your Majesty!

360
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,260
Congrats, my son,

361
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,180
you're now the Celestial Monarch.

362
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,180
Thanks, Mother.

363
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,780
You've created this magnificent scene

364
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,820
through your own efforts.

365
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,780
I once fought

366
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,700
this fate.

367
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,620
But in the end,

368
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,620
I still walked

369
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,220
your path, Mother.

370
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,180
Do you have something to say?

371
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,780
Yes.

372
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,260
"Anyone

373
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,420
stirring trouble

374
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,980
should be punished."

375
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,540
Was that meant for me?

376
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,060
Yes.

377
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,660
Mother, if you insist on backing

378
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,020
the Western Sea blindly,

379
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,780
waging war on the NCR,

380
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,660
then I can't sit back.

381
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,220
Let me ask you.

382
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,900
Put the identity

383
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,020
and title aside,

384
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,180
as your Mother,

385
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,820
have you ever blamed me

386
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,620
or hated me?

387
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,060
I believe you're aware of it,

388
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,380
then I won't say more.

389
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,380
Mother,

390
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,900
return to the Western Sea

391
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,260
and protect your homeland.

392
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,500
I'll come visit you.

393
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,620
Kunlun!

394
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,340
Kunlun...

395
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,860
[Shouldn't my brother alone]

396
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,900
[go through the immortal tribulation?]

397
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,700
[Why do I have to join?]

398
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,940
[Your Emperor Star is shining too,]

399
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,460
[so you must go as well.]

400
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,740
[Do you know you're both]

401
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,620
[chosen to go through tribulations?]

402
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,940
[In the Cangwu lifetime,]

403
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,420
[your stars]

404
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,380
[flickered.]

405
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,660
[You died saving]

406
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,780
[your fellow disciples.]

407
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,340
[You deserve to be the Monarch!]

408
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,980
[Sir Kunlun]

409
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,300
[descended for immortal tribulation,]

410
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,660
[I can't interfere.]

411
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,180
[But I hope you]

412
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,020
[give him your strength.]

413
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,820
[You bore it all,]

414
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,300
[endured my coldness,]

415
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,900
[simply because]

416
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,660
[you weren't my own]

417
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,460
[flesh and blood.]

418
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,380
[I only agreed]

419
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,940
[because I selfishly wanted]

420
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,020
[to drive you out of the Celestial Realm.]

421
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
[As the son of the Celestial Monarch,]

422
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,460
[shouldn't you lead the Realm]

423
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,380
[throughout this crisis?]

424
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,780
[Isn't it your duty]

425
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,500
[to step up]

426
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,780
[when the Realm is leaderless?]

427
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,780
[I've never run from duty!]

428
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,660
[Was it]

429
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,260
[really my fault?]

430
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:58,940
[Kunlun,]

431
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,340
[am I the one who's wrong?]

432
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,060
The Sky Fox rebels remain,

433
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,060
the NCR is unstable.

434
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,020
And it's your first time

435
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,420
dealing with guys from the NCR.

436
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,940
Remember,

437
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,140
don't let your guard down.

438
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,540
So now

439
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,660
you speak as

440
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,980
the Celestial Monarch?

441
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,940
Luyao is your sister,

442
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,380
if she could see you now,

443
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,020
it would warm her heart.

444
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
I'm not doing this

445
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,420
just for her.

446
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,900
I know.

447
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,420
Since I'm the NCR King,

448
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,140
is it too much to ask something

449
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,260
from you?

450
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,660
Go ahead.

451
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,780
First,

452
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,820
I'll abolish the old law

453
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,820
that banned demons

454
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,580
from cultivating.

455
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,980
In my land,

456
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,420
all are equal.

457
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,100
Second,

458
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,300
those who abused

459
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,580
immortal register

460
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,180
will lose their status,

461
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,300
and can't cultivate for 1,000 years.

462
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,380
Third,

463
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,380
the NCR promises

464
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,580
not to meddle

465
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,500
in other realms.

466
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,460
But if attacked,

467
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,140
we will fight back.

468
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,020
The Celestial Realm

469
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,260
may not interfere.

470
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,820
Deal.

471
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,260
You agreed so easily?

472
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,660
First,

473
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,460
immortals and demons

474
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,900
share the same roots.

475
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,140
Identity matters nothing.

476
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,620
Second,

477
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,100
you named only a few in the NCR.

478
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,740
Those who sincerely repent

479
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,340
should be forgiven.

480
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,860
Third,

481
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,340
as long as you don't start war,

482
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,180
I won't meddle in your rule.

483
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,260
You'll make a good monarch.

484
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,700
Will you be a good brother to me?

485
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,020
Jinxiu is my brother.

486
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,540
Always.

487
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,820
Luyao is my Empress.

488
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,300
Always.

489
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,900
As Luyao's brother,

490
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,900
will you be a good brother to me?

491
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,940
If she can come back,

492
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,780
and stand by what I did today,

493
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,700
I'll admit that she's my sister.

494
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,620
She will.

495
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,300
There's something

496
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,780
I want to tell you.

497
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,900
Say it.

498
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,620
I…

499
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,500
I can use my nine tails

500
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,300
freely now.

501
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,740
I know

502
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,660
she'd want to know that.

503
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
So I told you.

504
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,220
Wait!

505
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,380
Have you seen an ice block?

506
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,060
We've got this stuff everywhere.

507
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,020
If you want one,

508
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,420
move it yourself.

509
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,340
I just went to your NCR.

510
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:35,820
No,

511
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,220
it's Lujiu's now.

512
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,780
He's doing well.

513
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,980
And he's grown a lot,

514
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,220
way better with others.

515
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,500
There's nothing to worry about.

516
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,420
But you gotta come back soon.

517
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,900
I talked Lujiu into it for so long!

518
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,940
He finally calls you Sister!

519
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,980
If you stay away any longer,

520
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
he might change his mind!

521
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,820
You won't hear him say it then!

522
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,660
Well,

523
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,820
you left so fast,

524
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,980
didn't even take the talisman!

525
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,220
If you weren't so forgetful,

526
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,340
would I have found you?

527
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,220
Remember the first time when I met you

528
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,060
in Cangwu Academy,

529
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,980
you were just

530
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,140
a weak little fox.

531
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,940
[Your tail's showing!]

532
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,220
After all this,

533
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,300
how many tails do you have left?

534
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Have you turned into

535
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,020
a normal fox now?

536
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,340
[Let me tell you,]

537
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,860
[you stole my first kiss,]

538
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,100
[so I'm stuck with you]

539
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,060
[in every life!]

540
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,260
[If you don't come over,]

541
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,620
[I'll carry you back myself!]

542
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,740
Trust me,

543
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,740
at all events,

544
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,820
I'll find you.

545
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,180
We're already tied by the red thread,

546
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,420
and you promised to be my Empress.

547
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,020
Backing out now,

548
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,780
no way!

549
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,860
You actually came.

550
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,820
Thought you wouldn't make it.

551
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,659
No soul left in you?

552
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,540
Did you walk here

553
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,900
just by sheer will?

554
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,260
Bro,

555
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,860
you asked me here

556
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,139
just to brag

557
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,659
about how well

558
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,420
you've taken care of

559
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,460
these weak plants?

560
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,300
Maybe then

561
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,180
I could use my

562
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,060
Floral Seal

563
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,820
to help you command.

564
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,700
Look at you!

565
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,500
I'm not a kid anymore!

566
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,620
Bro,

567
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,940
the story about you

568
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,740
spread far and wide.

569
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,580
Every storyteller down below

570
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,580
can't stop telling

571
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,260
how you ended the war!

572
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,060
None of them has actually seen

573
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,900
your true face,

574
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,300
yet they worship you

575
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,380
as their guardian god.

576
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,500
You actually took the spot

577
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,540
of our NCR Matriarch.

578
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,580
Matriarch is as she is,

579
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,460
guardian of peace.

580
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,060
How can I take her place?

581
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:49,980
You believe it?

582
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,460
I do.

583
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,900
Then so do I.

584
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,540
Only my bro knows me best.

585
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,500
Kunlun,

586
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,340
we've been brothers forever.

587
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,500
We're not of the same blood,

588
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,020
but we have true feelings.

589
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,980
This bond's

590
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
forever in my heart.

591
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,460
Why do you sound so strange today?

592
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,900
I found her.

593
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,100
Where?

594
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,940
She went mortal.

595
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,780
So,

596
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,140
you want to be mortal too?

597
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,700
Bro,

598
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,020
we can help her cultivate immortality,

599
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,100
then you can both live

600
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,580
forever in Floralia Palace.

601
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,100
Kunlun,

602
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,860
I owe her too much.

603
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,860
If she can't be my Empress,

604
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,380
then,

605
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,460
I'll go with her

606
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,460
and live as a mortal.

607
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,260
But mortals live one lifetime only,

608
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,660
you'll forget her next life,

609
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,900
and she'll forget you too.

610
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:26,900
What's the point

611
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,740
of doing this?

612
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,180
Well then,

613
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,180
we can start over.

614
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,100
I'll meet her

615
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,900
every lifetime,

616
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,180
get to know her,

617
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,180
fall in love,

618
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,780
then part.

619
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,060
Isn't it...

620
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,180
kinda fun?

621
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,420
Alright.

622
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,340
When you find her,

623
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,900
I'll visit you in the mortal realm.

624
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,660
Give me that.

625
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,500
[Heavenly immortals,]

626
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,060
[please bless me.]

627
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,500
[I want to marry Sir Jinxiu.]

628
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,420
[If I win,]

629
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,340
[you'll marry me in heaven.]

630
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,700
[Alright.]

631
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,980
[That fur looks stunning!]

632
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,940
[Never seen fur this good!]

633
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,180
So pure white,

634
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:58,980
is it a demon?

635
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,260
Who cares?

636
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,420
Doesn't concern us.

637
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:02,740
[But,]

638
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,540
[that fur made into clothes]

639
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,780
[would look amazing!]

640
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,060
[More than that!]

641
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,540
[People would murder with jealousy!]

642
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,780
[Welcome!]

643
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,220
[Hot steamed buns!]

644
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,860
[Take a look here!]

645
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,420
[Hot steamed buns!]

646
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,340
[Wanna some?]

647
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,340
You again.

648
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,340
What do you mean?

649
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,620
You know me?

650
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,140
What's inside there?

651
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:32,860
Want to buy?

652
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,740
Take it.

653
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,420
That's a lot!
