3
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:05,810
Luyao,

4
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,050
you should know the way you are

5
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,250
is holding you back.

6
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,330
Mention your father's alive, and boom—

7
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,810
you jumped right on it.

8
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,610
I'll kill you

9
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,890
sooner or later.

10
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,329
I'll avenge my father.

11
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,530
You aren't my match at all.

12
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,690
Why bother?

13
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,250
Just marry me.

14
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,770
I can help you restore the NCR,

15
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,770
far stronger than that under your father.

16
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,930
You murdered the king

17
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,170
and usurped the throne.

18
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,370
We don't need someone

19
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:38,890
as greedy as you

20
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,850
to rule the realm!

21
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,329
A mere woman.

22
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,250
The masses hail you as an auspicious omen.

23
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,370
But when I become the king,

24
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,810
you are only auspicious

25
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,970
when I say so.

26
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,170
If I deny it,

27
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,250
you'll be nothing.

28
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:04,810
My Lord,

29
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,010
an envoy from the Celestial Realm is here.

30
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,290
Who?

31
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,770
He claims to bring you a gift.

32
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,170
Think carefully.

33
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,890
You're getting bolder.

34
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,329
How dare you sneak into Floralia Palace?

35
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,570
Don't worry.

36
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,810
Only here can we

37
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,570
reminisce properly,

38
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:39,970
don't you think?

39
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,010
Absurd.

40
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,730
You should leave.

41
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,170
With my current power,

42
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,130
I can hide myself well.

43
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,570
I won't put you in trouble.

44
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,610
He went to the NCR without you,

45
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,530
left you alone

46
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,890
in the palace.

47
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,930
It's for their own matter.

48
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,410
Unsettled, don't you?

49
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,210
'Cause you lack the authority or status

50
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,010
to be a part of it.

51
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,810
As immortals,

52
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,170
they can cross borders effortlessly.

53
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,890
But you can't do anything

54
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,570
without a proper status.

55
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,130
Even ascended to heaven,

56
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,250
you're just

57
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,170
a minor flower deity

58
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,570
tending withered blossoms.

59
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,570
Don't project your

60
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,850
insecurities onto me.

61
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,450
I won't force you to admit it anymore.

62
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,250
Muxian,

63
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,890
I know exactly

64
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,450
what you truly are.

65
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,970
I believe

66
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,490
you know it too.

67
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,130
Ask yourself,

68
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,210
when will your

69
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,130
demon king's power finally awaken?

70
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,410
It's been suppressed too long.

71
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,290
Once unleashed,

72
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,810
you can claim

73
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,210
everything you desire.

74
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,010
The time has come

75
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,410
to make those hypocritical immortals

76
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,810
feel our demonic might.

77
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,490
Listen,

78
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,010
not all in heaven

79
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,410
are hypocrites.

80
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,330
But they excel

81
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,810
at wearing virtuous masks

82
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,290
while

83
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,650
stabbing you repeatedly in the back!

84
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,170
I'm curious

85
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,610
how he'd feel

86
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,210
if he knew

87
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,930
you're approaching him

88
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,130
with ulterior motives?

89
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,330
I could tell him the truth,

90
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,210
and even leave the Palace.

91
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,130
From what I know of him,

92
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,690
Jinxiu might abandon

93
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,850
his throne for you.

94
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,930
But what of his parents?

95
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,210
Would they allow it?

96
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,170
Moreover,

97
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,890
there's the heart seal...

98
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,330
I never asked.

99
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,730
You may fool me,

100
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,090
but not him.

101
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,490
I know what I'm doing.

102
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,690
You should go now.

103
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,610
Long time no see.

104
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,050
General Sky Fox.

105
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,610
You're delivering the gift in person.

106
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,370
I'm truly

107
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,450
honored.

108
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,770
A millennium ago,

109
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,490
my brother failed Luyao

110
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,650
at the wedding.

111
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,570
Hearing she's found an ideal match,

112
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,210
he felt relieved

113
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,930
and sent me to bring you a gift on behalf

114
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,210
of the Celestial Realm.

115
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,930
Does he think

116
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,530
I've forgotten

117
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,130
what happened

118
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,770
on that day?

119
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,410
He deeply regrets his actions

120
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,730
and has prepared a grand gift.

121
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,730
Golden Lotus Dew.

122
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,690
You deserve it.

123
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,010
Golden Lotus Dew?

124
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,850
Didn't Sir Jinxiu

125
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,690
give it

126
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,170
to his lover?

127
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,409
This

128
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,930
one-drop-in-every-ten-millennia dew

129
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,050
was divided upon delivery

130
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,890
to the Celestial Realm.

131
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,770
Half to Jinxiu,

132
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,250
half to me.

133
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,650
It possesses

134
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,730
immense power.

135
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,730
We're always prudent.

136
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,370
We never

137
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,570
pin all hopes

138
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,250
on Jinxiu himself.

139
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,410
That does sound like your way.

140
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,890
You'll never jeopardize your future

141
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,210
for a mere woman.

142
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,690
Then I'll

143
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,010
accept it.

144
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,250
May I see the Matriarch?

145
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,090
I wish to personally return it

146
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,290
as a token of apology and blessing.

147
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,450
She's been in exile for years,

148
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,330
running on fumes.

149
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,890
She needs rest.

150
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,130
It's not convenient

151
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,210
for you to see her now.

152
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,850
If you wish

153
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,930
to see her in person,

154
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,610
I invite you

155
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,170
to attend my coronation

156
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,330
ceremony.

157
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,410
My brother asked me

158
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,290
to hand-deliver this

159
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,770
to her.

160
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,170
If she refuses to meet,

161
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,210
I'd

162
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,770
take my leave.

163
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,970
You are toying with me.

164
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,570
More than that.

165
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,370
I'll also take your life for her sake!

166
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,810
How arrogant!

167
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:56,690
Jinxiu.

168
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,090
Why are you here?

169
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,050
I told you about the wedding invitation.

170
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,410
How could I not save you?

171
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,250
But...

172
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:02,970
Enough talk.

173
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,210
Go save Luyao.

174
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,250
Leave it to me.

175
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:08,890
Alright.

176
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,490
One more step,

177
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,450
I'll kill her.

178
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,730
What are you doing here?

179
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,410
I promised to protect you.

180
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,450
I don't need that!

181
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,250
Just leave!

182
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,810
Stop there!

183
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,530
I swear I'll kill her!

184
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,690
You bastard!

185
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,850
Shameless!

186
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,770
As a general,

187
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,290
you're resorting to such threats.

188
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,410
How do you live up to your reputation?

189
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,650
Kunlun!

190
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,490
Insolent fool!

191
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,290
Alright then,

192
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,810
I won't marry you.

193
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,770
Tomorrow,

194
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,130
I'll ascend

195
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,410
the throne alone!

196
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,690
Got it now?

197
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,010
That's what we call

198
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,770
fighting fire with fire.

199
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,850
Kunlun.

200
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:38,850
Luyao.

201
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,770
Shall I do it, or will you?

202
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,130
I'll do it.

203
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,410
You're self-righteous

204
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,570
and insatiably greedy.

205
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,090
Everything you ever despised

206
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,450
has become

207
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,810
the weapon that kills you.

208
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,690
Thank you, Sir Jinxiu,

209
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,090
Kunlun,

210
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,850
for helping me slay my enemy

211
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,890
to reclaim my place.

212
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,290
Don't mention it.

213
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,010
This is what I owe you.

214
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,330
The debt had to be repaid.

215
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,850
Uh... I'm leaving now.

216
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,730
Kunlun,

217
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,450
stay to help

218
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,770
sort out the rest.

219
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,570
I will.

220
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,010
Take care.

221
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,370
See you.

222
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,850
Are you still mad at me?

223
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,010
I wouldn't dare.

224
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,570
Then why did you save me?

225
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,050
Don't you know how dangerous it's?

226
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:40,850
If...

227
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,130
I was afraid you'd leave,

228
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,170
marry another,

229
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,810
and I'd never see you again.

230
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,810
In the Three Realms,

231
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,410
I am the only one

232
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,330
who can

233
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,810
marry you.

234
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,450
Don't act so childish.

235
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,090
I didn't.

236
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,610
Listen carefully,

237
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,850
through every high and low,

238
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,490
I'm yours

239
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,970
to lean on.

240
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,330
True love

241
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,530
is based on mutual trust

242
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:37,970
and companionship.

243
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,530
I'll protect you,

244
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,970
walk you through the dark,

245
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:44,970
but

246
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,410
forge

247
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,010
your own sword along the way.

248
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,050
Besides,

249
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,050
I'll also grow stronger

250
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,690
to become your sturdiest shield.

251
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,410
That way, you can feel free

252
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,690
to do what you love

253
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,330
and be yourself.

254
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,370
Kunlun,

255
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,010
before

256
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,970
I spoke in anger.

257
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:10,810
Truth is

258
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,770
I don't care

259
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,530
about being a queen

260
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,410
or a king.

261
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,850
What I told you

262
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,130
has nothing to do with our status.

263
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,810
I still see you as

264
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,290
that little feisty fox I found.

265
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,690
No matter what,

266
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,330
you belong to me.

267
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,130
You once called me your demon pet.

268
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,330
So, as it turned out,

269
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,330
I'm the patronizing one.

270
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,130
Jinxiu, you are back.

271
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,170
You've been waiting?

272
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,490
I heard you came back today,

273
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,490
so I waited here for you.

274
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,250
[Report!]

275
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,730
Sir,

276
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,890
about the divine punishment thing

277
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,890
in the mortal realm,

278
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,890
we've found some leads.

279
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,450
I see.

280
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,770
Don't do anything yet.

281
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,530
Understood.

282
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,330
Go back and wait for me.

283
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,810
I'm coming with you.

284
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,690
Last time you left,

285
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,770
I didn't accompany you.

286
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,610
I wish

287
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,850
to go with you now.

288
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:42,810
Fine.

289
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,170
Mr Han is the owner of this Langhuan House.

290
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,890
He loves collecting rare

291
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,930
and priceless artifacts.

292
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,210
Any treasure

293
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,130
you can imagine in this world,

294
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,050
you can find it here.

295
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,050
Since it's so renowned,

296
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,290
why so few visitors?

297
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,330
Mortals have an unwritten rule.

298
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,530
Rare treasures

299
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,050
belong only to a select few.

300
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,290
Mr Han

301
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,010
capitalizes on that desire.

302
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,570
His Langhuan House

303
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,570
isn't open to the public,

304
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,850
only receiving nobility from Ganzhou.

305
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,170
Entry is permitted only with his

306
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,090
invitation.

307
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,170
Invitation?

308
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:31,770
Yes.

309
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,570
Let's go.

310
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,570
Young Master Jinxiu,

311
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,970
what an honor

312
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,570
to have you grace

313
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,370
my house.

314
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,170
Thank you for inviting me.

315
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,610
My pleasure.

316
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,650
I wonder

317
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,490
what rare treasure has prompted

318
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,970
such a grand auction.

319
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,330
Countless legends

320
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,930
speak of it.

321
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,650
Yet almost none have laid eyes upon it.

322
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,770
Sir, even you

323
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,970
will be astonished.

324
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,130
Please, come inside.

325
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:19,770
Attention,

326
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,890
this is Young Master Jinxiu.

327
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,370
- Mr Han.
- Mr Han.

328
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,250
- Mr Jinxiu.
- Mr Jinxiu.

329
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:24,970
- Mr Han.
- Mr Han.

330
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:25,410
Mr Jinxiu.

331
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,010
Mr Han.

332
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,850
After you.

333
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,050
Have a seat.

334
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,130
Gentlemen.

335
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,050
Gentlemen,

336
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,890
I wish

337
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,210
to express my deepest gratitude

338
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,170
for your presence today.

339
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,010
The treasures I've brought this time

340
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,450
will surely not disappoint.

341
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,970
Stop teasing us.

342
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,250
Just bring it out.

343
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,650
[C'mon.]

344
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,450
[My apologies...]

345
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,530
Sir, why came disguised as Jinxiu?

346
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,450
Do you have concerns?

347
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,450
I can't act

348
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,530
in the name of Punisher.

349
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,290
There are more urgent matters.

350
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,210
[What is it?]

351
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,370
Here's the clue.

352
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,930
Has legs yet seems legless.

353
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,970
Like a man, yet not a man.

354
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,730
Often found in tales and lore.

355
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,410
But never shows its true form.

356
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,530
How mysterious.

357
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,770
I've no idea.

358
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:32,810
Demon.

359
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,410
[Tell us.]

360
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,090
[Spill it already.]

361
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,850
[Alright,]

362
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,890
[I'll tell you.]

363
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,930
This treasure

364
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:39,810
is actually present

365
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,410
among us now.

366
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,250
Where?

367
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,250
Right here!

368
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:44,850
[This old man?]

369
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,930
[He's just some old man.]

370
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,530
[Yeah.]

371
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,250
[As you all can see,]

372
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,770
[this treasure]

373
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,130
appears human

374
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,810
yet is anything but.

375
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:56,770
Not human?

376
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,170
He's a turtle demon!

377
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,170
Demon?

378
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:00,890
A demon?

379
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,530
Gentlemen.

380
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,090
Don't worry.

381
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,570
This demon

382
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,490
has been subdued

383
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,970
by a sorcerer's

384
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,770
binding talisman.

385
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,570
He's

386
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,010
powerless

387
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,330
and harmless.

388
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,650
Behold.

389
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:18,690
See?

390
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,770
How fascinating!

391
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,690
No reaction at all.

392
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,570
No response.

393
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,530
[But, Mr Han,]

394
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,930
[how can you prove]

395
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,890
[he's truly a demon?]

396
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,290
[He seems]

397
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,210
[just an ordinary old man.]

398
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:28,850
[Yeah.]

399
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,650
[Exactly.]

400
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,490
Gentlemen.

401
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,370
be patient.

402
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:34,970
What?

403
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,570
Who's he? A sorcerer?

404
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:46,890
Look,

405
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,850
surprised?

406
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,610
Yes.

407
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,450
Thrilled?

408
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,610
Absolutely!

409
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:53,690
So thrilling!

410
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,330
This ancient turtle...

411
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,050
Nice.

412
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,690
It's a millennium-old spirit.

413
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,370
Kept within your home,

414
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,290
it can extend life and attract wealth!

415
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,730
Is this not

416
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,250
the finest spiritual treasure?

417
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,250
Indeed.

418
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,130
It'd be a terrible waste

419
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,490
if it's left unclaimed.

420
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,410
[True.]

421
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,370
[Without further ado.]

422
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,970
Same rules as before.

423
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,530
The bidding starts now!

424
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,930
If you are interested,

425
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,650
please raise your placard.

426
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,450
Base price is 500 taels of silver.

427
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,570
550!

428
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,690
- Alright.
- 600!

429
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,730
600?

430
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,330
[Do I hear higher?]

431
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,970
It's one thing if he hunts

432
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,210
for a living.

433
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,690
But he's already possessed consciousness,

434
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,290
no different from humans.

435
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,930
Why humiliated like this?

436
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,490
This is part

437
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,170
of the reason why I came.

438
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:50,850
[Any higher bids?]

439
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,090
I must save him.

440
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,090
Take your time.

441
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,250
I'll save him first.

442
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,570
There's another

443
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,730
matter to verify.

444
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,450
[800!]

445
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,650
[Do I hear more?]

446
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,370
1,000.

447
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,010
1,000?

448
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,010
1,000!

449
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,330
Jinxiu is indeed generous!

450
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,770
1,000 until now.

451
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,610
Any higher?

452
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:11,850
1,500.

453
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,810
[1,500!]

454
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,610
Any higher?

455
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,890
1,500...

456
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,010
Jinxiu,

457
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,090
you know, 1,500...

458
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,330
I meant 1,000 taels

459
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,490
of gold.

460
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,050
[Gold!]

461
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,850
[1,000 taels of gold!]

462
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,570
Jinxiu,

463
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,650
are you sure?

464
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,250
1,000 taels of gold?

465
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,490
My carriage is downstairs.

466
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,850
Have someone fetch the gold immediately.

467
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,170
It really is gold!

468
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,090
Gold!

469
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,250
This millennium-old turtle demon

470
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,170
now belongs to Jinxiu!

471
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,490
Mr Han,

472
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,530
you really think

473
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,170
I'd pay 1,000 taels of gold

474
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,970
just for a turtle demon?

475
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,410
Time to bring out

476
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,930
your other rare treasures.

477
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,450
There's more?

478
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,010
More? Really?

479
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,890
Jinxiu, forgive me.

480
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,050
I intended

481
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,210
to save the best

482
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,050
for last.

483
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,450
But since you insist,

484
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,770
I'll

485
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,890
bring it out now

486
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,130
for all to see.

487
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,650
Good!

488
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,770
Show us!

489
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,490
Let's see it!

490
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,130
Come on.

491
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:30,730
Here it comes.

492
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,810
Here it is.

493
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,050
Gentlemen,

494
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,690
the world

495
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,690
[knows of fox demons' allure]

496
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,850
[and legends of nine-tailed foxes.]

497
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,050
[A nine-tailed fox?]

498
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,210
[This demon]

499
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,650
[is truly exceptional among demons.]

500
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,370
[I acquired him by chance.]

501
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,490
[He was quite]

502
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,050
[deranged and crazy,]

503
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,850
nearly captured by a sorcerer

504
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,290
who almost removed his core.

505
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,490
That would've scattered his soul.

506
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,490
Out

507
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,610
of pity,

508
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,730
I then

509
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,930
brought him to Ganzhou.

510
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,930
[If he's lucky]

511
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,250
[enough]

512
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,770
to be taken home

513
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,410
by one of you

514
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,850
as an attendant or pet,

515
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,050
it'd be his great fortune.

516
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,090
What exactly is this?

517
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,610
A three-tailed fox demon!

518
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,090
[Know what?]

519
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,050
[As a demon pet,]

520
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,450
[he'd be quite suitable.]

521
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,650
[That's right.]

522
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,450
[I often]

523
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,650
[walk dogs with my wife.]

524
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,130
[Never walked a fox before.]

525
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,010
[I'd like to try.]

526
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,690
Lujiu!

527
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,610
You descended

528
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,810
just to find him?

529
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,050
Yes.

530
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,810
You've been searching for him?

531
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,290
He's followed me through lifetimes.

532
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,090
I can't bear to see him suffer so.

533
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,810
Do you know

534
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,050
I still have accounts

535
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,650
to settle with him regarding Cangwu?

536
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,570
Let's go back first.

537
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,290
Where's the fox demon?

538
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,090
How come he's gone?

539
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,490
You can go now,

540
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,170
the farther, the better.

541
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:50,770
Thanks.

542
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,610
Lujiu's core is severely damaged,

543
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,290
long imprisoned by binding talismans.

544
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,770
His consciousness is fragmented.

545
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,770
Without proper recuperation,

546
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:19,850
his life

547
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,330
may be in danger.

548
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,530
All fates are preordained.

549
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,930
It's heavenly law.

550
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:25,850
Hongning...

551
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,490
I have matters to attend.

552
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,050
I'll take my leave.

553
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,570
Hongning,

554
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,810
Lujiu isn't inherently evil.

555
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,570
The fire spread uncontrollably on Cangwu,

556
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,970
something was amiss.

557
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,170
I need to hear his explanation personally.

558
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,170
Killing is killing.

559
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,130
What's the point of questioning?

560
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,810
If it's truly his fault,

561
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,730
would you punish him?

562
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,530
If

563
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,450
he committed grave sins,

564
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,970
as the Punisher, I'd grant him

565
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,690
a proper send-off.

566
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,770
[Even awake, he couldn't explain.]

567
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,810
What are you doing here?

568
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,210
Returning from Wuzhang,

569
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,090
Luyao has also been searching for him.

570
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,250
Yesterday I received word

571
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,130
he's being sold like a pet,

572
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,130
so I came to investigate.

573
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,650
What do you mean

574
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,050
"couldn't explain"?

575
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,650
When Luyao reclaimed the NCR,

576
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,890
I saw her wield Spiritual Flame.

577
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,810
It only scorched Sky Fox,

578
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,770
not harming a single bystander,

579
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:28,970
perfectly controlled.

580
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,250
But at Cangwu,

581
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,610
Lujiu used it

582
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,770
uncontrollably,

583
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:33,930
targeting both good and evil.

584
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,490
Even my protective charms

585
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,210
were destroyed

586
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,930
when Lujiu lost control.

587
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,130
I went to the Bridge of Destiny.

588
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,970
The official overseeing reincarnation

589
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,770
told me

590
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,210
Lujiu bore a suppression seal

591
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,050
on his back.

592
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,730
[That may be the root cause.]

593
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,090
[And that seal]

594
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,650
was unique to Master Taiyi.

595
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,570
So you mean

596
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,090
that fire wasn't his fault.

597
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:13,810
Sir Jinxiu,

598
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:14,730
it's my fault.

599
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:15,970
Kill me.

600
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,410
Just do it.

601
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,690
Please kill me.

602
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,130
Please!

603
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,410
That inferno

604
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,610
has been burning

605
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,890
in his nightmares all this time.

606
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,410
Sir Jinxiu. Sir!

607
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:31,730
Lujiu.

608
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,490
Lujiu.

609
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,210
Sir Jinxiu.

610
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,690
You are safe now.

611
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,330
Lujiu...

612
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,250
Yes.

613
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,410
I've made a grave mistake,

614
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,650
dragging you all

615
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,890
into its devastating consequences.

616
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,290
You shouldn't have saved me.

617
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,770
Was it because of the Spiritual Flame?

618
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,370
Yes.

619
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,730
I don't deserve to live.

620
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:16,970
I thought

621
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,530
it could protect

622
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,290
the whole Cangwu

623
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,730
and save countless lives.

624
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,570
But instead,

625
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,690
it destroyed everything.

626
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:37,970
Lujiu,

627
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,010
I know you didn't mean to.

628
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,690
You were manipulated.

629
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,650
I failed Cangwu's disciples,

630
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,290
failed Hongning and her family,

631
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,210
failed Sir Jinxiu.

632
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,370
So many suffered because of me.

633
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,010
Hongning...

634
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:06,930
Hongning,

635
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,410
I'm so sorry.

636
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,970
Since regaining my memories,

637
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,090
nightmares torment me daily.

638
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,690
I remember vividly

639
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,650
a blood-drenched Cangwu

640
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,530
and their

641
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,970
dying faces.

642
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,690
They can never

643
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,810
reincarnate

644
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,770
because of me.

645
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,490
What do you mean?

646
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,490
Those killed by Spiritual Flame,

647
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,210
their souls were incinerated.

648
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,450
They are barred

649
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,370
from rebirth forever.

650
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,650
Jinxiu,

651
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,250
you still won't

652
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,130
explain to them?

653
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,290
Kunlun...

654
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,170
So,

655
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,610
back then,

656
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,730
Sir Jinxiu,

657
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,570
you...

658
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,970
My brother saved us.

659
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,890
Without his intervention,

660
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,610
our souls would've been consumed

661
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,250
by Spiritual Flame.

662
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:16,690
Only by doing what he did

663
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,290
could we be rescued.

664
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,570
So, you were saving them,

665
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,130
right?

666
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,210
What about my parents?

667
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,170
They've already begun new lives.

668
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,730
May I see them?

669
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,130
I'll return to the NCR

670
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,250
to inform Luyao.

671
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:56,850
If you wish,

672
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,130
I'll take you to them.

673
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,450
Honey,

674
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:11,330
come.

675
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,290
[After returning to the Celestial Realm,]

676
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,130
[it took me long to locate them.]

677
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,490
But they don't

678
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,090
remember you in this life.

679
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:41,810
[Delicious.]

680
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,490
[Smell it.]

681
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,330
[Good?]

682
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,010
[Yes.]

683
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:44,570
[Good.]

684
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,930
I'll serve you more.

685
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,130
Have some broth.

686
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:48,810
Okay.

687
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:52,850
Here.

688
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,450
Hon.

689
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,130
I was just passing by.

690
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,890
Your chicken soup

691
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,730
smelled wonderful.

692
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:10,810
This girl

693
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,370
looks so familiar.

694
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:13,330
Yeah.

695
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,610
I feel like

696
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,330
I've seen her before.

697
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,170
I cooked

698
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,690
the congee with

699
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,650
chicken broth.

700
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,690
That's why it smells good.

701
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,130
Miss,

702
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,850
how about you sit down

703
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,210
and have a bowl?

704
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,250
Here,

705
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:30,449
don't be shy.

706
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,250
Sit here.

707
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,370
Come on.

708
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,449
[This is my bowl.]

709
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,610
[It's clean.]

710
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,409
[Have a bowl of soup.]

711
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,250
[Thanks.]

712
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,050
[It's freshly cooked.]

713
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,090
I simmered it

714
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,330
for hours.

715
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,170
Miss, try it.

716
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:48,770
Hon,

717
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,449
this is yours.

718
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,090
Go on.

719
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:56,650
This girl

720
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,930
is so pretty

721
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,410
and elegant.

722
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,650
I really

723
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,930
adore her.

724
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,050
[So tasty.]

725
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,610
[Delicious!]

726
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,170
[What are you doing?]

727
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,850
[Only a little bit left.]

728
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:21,650
[But,]

729
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,770
[you cooked chicken broth today,]

730
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,850
[and it tastes so good.]

731
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,850
[Why can't I have more?]

732
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,730
[So you know]

733
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,090
[it tastes good.]

734
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,290
[Today is Hongning's birthday.]

735
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,450
[I barely afforded half a chicken,]

736
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,610
[and you ate most of it.]

737
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:36,770
[Mother,]

738
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,570
[father enjoys it. Let him have more.]

739
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,170
[Here.]

740
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,170
[Look, my girl!]

741
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,130
[See?]

742
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:42,930
[Go on.]

743
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:49,770
[Hongning,]

744
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,330
[I'm]

745
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,490
[full now.]

746
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,210
These side dishes

747
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,370
are fresh

748
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,970
from our garden.

749
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,130
All freshly made.

750
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,010
Try it.

751
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:06,810
What did Lujiu

752
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,890
go through after Wuzhang?

753
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,810
How could he be captured by a sorcerer?

754
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,450
Since you found me,

755
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,930
I've been searching for him.

756
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,690
No trace of him across all Three Realms

757
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,570
or at the Reincarnation Gate.

758
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,890
After regaining his memories,

759
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,170
he's been wandering aimlessly

760
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,090
in a daze,

761
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,810
seeking self-punishment

762
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,810
to atone for his sins.

763
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,490
Even so,

764
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,210
he didn't deserve this.

765
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,570
That Master Han imprisons

766
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:42,930
and traffics demons,

767
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,170
engaging in shady dealings.

768
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,290
It's utterly intolerable.

769
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,210
Indeed.

770
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,130
The demon trade in Ganzhou grows daily.

771
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,970
He's undoubtedly responsible.

772
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,610
So,

773
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,410
how will you punish him?

774
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,370
The Celestial Realm immortals

775
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,450
must not interfere in mortal affairs.

776
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,730
As the Punisher,

777
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:04,890
I need to be especially cautious.

778
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,290
Forget it.

779
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,410
The Celestial Realm cares nothing for demons.

780
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,130
I'll

781
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,850
punish him myself.

782
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,930
You're now a deity of Floralia Palace,

783
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,530
bound by heavenly laws.

784
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,290
Don't let impulse

785
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,570
cost you your future.

786
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,490
Besides, right and wrong

787
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,970
shall be judged by mortal laws

788
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,090
instead of personal

789
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,170
grudges.

790
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,610
Then how will he face justice?

791
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,330
19.

792
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,530
20.

793
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,090
21.

794
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,650
22...

795
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,530
These ill-gotten demon profits,

796
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,530
he can't afford

797
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:55,770
to spend them.

798
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:56,890
Precisely.

799
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,530
There are no laws on demon trade.

800
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,050
His wealth

801
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,770
is unjustly gained.

802
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,250
Such ill-gotten gains

803
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,330
warrant mortal punishment.

804
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,130
[He deserves it.]

805
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:32,930
[Exactly.]

806
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,010
He is cruel

807
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,730
and cold-hearted.

808
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,130
Once his ledgers fall into others' hands,

809
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,690
he'd definitely be exposed.

810
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,290
He amassed demon-trade wealth,

811
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,530
yet cannot explain to officials

812
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,650
the source of his riches.

813
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,010
So punishment is certain.

814
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,490
This is what you meant by mortal affairs,

815
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,770
mortal judgment?

816
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,890
Immortals shouldn't interfere.

817
00:38:59,010 --> 00:38:59,850
But I don't think

818
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,570
it's satisfying enough.

819
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,130
He'll be fine.

820
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,250
Jinxiu.

821
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,250
Sir Jinxiu.

822
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,450
Thank you

823
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:57,890
for finding Lujiu

824
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,370
and breaking his curse.

825
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,130
He served me for lifetimes.

826
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,210
This is what I should do for him.

827
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,650
What will you do next?

828
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,890
I'll take him back home.

829
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,530
He's of nine-tailed fox lineage.

830
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,650
We should restore

831
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:21,610
our clan together.

832
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,210
If you need help,

833
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,330
just ask Kunlun.

834
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,490
Jinxiu,

835
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,370
if the Celestial Realm found out

836
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,930
you saved Hongning's parents,

837
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:33,850
you'd be punished

838
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,370
and suffer backlash.

839
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,770
Your descent as the Punisher

840
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,770
will cause you trouble too.

841
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,170
You should go back now.

842
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,210
Don't worry about that.

843
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,010
Hongning!

844
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:46,570
Wait.

845
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,290
Hongning.

846
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,330
Meddling with mortal fates

847
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,610
brings backlash.

848
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,370
When were you

849
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,770
planning to tell me that?

850
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:19,730
You don't think

851
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,210
I can face it with you,

852
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,610
do you?

853
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,730
You concealed everything about Cangwu.

854
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,370
After finding Lujiu,

855
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,410
do you still wanna hide the truth from me?

856
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,250
Do you know how I suffered

857
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,090
and how torn I was?

858
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,170
I couldn't force myself to hate you,

859
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,330
I'd only blame myself for lacking principle.

860
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,570
I just didn't know

861
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,170
how to explain

862
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,890
without sounding

863
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,250
like making excuses.

864
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:48,850
Besides,

865
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,410
it all began because of me.

866
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,410
If not for me,

867
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:54,890
Sir Taiyi

868
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,730
wouldn't have set Lujiu up,

869
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,130
and none would've happened later.

870
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,770
I tried to tell you,

871
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,170
but what right had I

872
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,250
to say those?

873
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,650
Yet unknowingly,

874
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,810
I wronged you often

875
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,330
and hurt you deeply.

876
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,050
It's my fault.

877
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,290
I failed to take care of you.

878
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,530
I only hope, in time,

879
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,290
you'll see my heart clearly.

880
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,570
[This is Heart Seal.]

881
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,330
[The more you love him,]

882
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:21,810
[the more you'll suffer,]

883
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,930
[and the tighter it'll bind.]

884
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,250
[Since you wish to prove]

885
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,570
[your love with your life,]

886
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,450
[it serves you well.]
