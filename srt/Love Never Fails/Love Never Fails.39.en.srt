[Love Never Fails]
[EP39]

3
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,160
Celestial immortals are nothing special.

4
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,680
Groveling at my feet after all.

5
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
In that case,

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,759
might as well make the best use of you.

7
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,600
Lujiu.

8
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,080
Lujiu.

9
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,560
Lujiu.

10
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,840
Heaven sent you siblings

11
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,280
to aid me, didn't it?

12
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,760
In your dreams!

13
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,280
Despite what we've been through,

14
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,560
you haven't changed a bit,

15
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,120
still as detestable as always.

16
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,040
They say if someone

17
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,240
offers his life to make

18
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,760
a wish to a nine-tailed fox,

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,280
that wish will come true.

20
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,360
Is that real?

21
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
Of course it is.

22
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,640
Nine tails are

23
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,760
the most sacred symbol

24
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,360
of our Northern Celestial Realm.

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
But

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,120
I can't grow nine tails.

27
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,200
Then you can

28
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,000
make a wish to my nine tails

29
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,720
for your own to grow.

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,440
Lujiu,

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,960
it took so long

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,160
to finally realize

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
nine tails

34
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
never symbolized status.

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,000
They are

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,400
merely our fox clan's

37
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,640
false prestige

38
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,079
over the Northern Celestial Realm.

39
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,160
Nine tails

40
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,880
are nothing but chains

41
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,240
of duty and a curse.

42
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,440
It's not the time to talk about this!

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,560
Run!

44
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,680
Just run!

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,440
I once thought

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,040
if you couldn't grow nine tails,

47
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,840
you'd escape

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,920
this conflict with a rightful reason.

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,000
Yet

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,680
three tails or nine,

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,320
fate still finds us all.

52
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,440
Luyao of the Nine-Tailed Fox Sanctum

53
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,920
is willing to offer her life,

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,560
scorch her soul, and consume her body

55
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
with Spiritual Flame

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,240
to restore Lujiu's broken tails

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,760
and complete his nine.

58
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,240
Don't!

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
For a peaceful life,

60
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
burn my body,

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,440
scatter my ashes across the Three Realms

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,400
to cleanse this world's hatred.

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,080
No!

64
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,240
Don't!

65
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,760
Don't!

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,520
Luyao, what are you doing?

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,000
Absorbing my resentment like this

68
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,120
will tear your body apart.

69
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,360
Not to mention your Samadhi Fire

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,040
will burn your own soul

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,280
to ashes.

72
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,360
Luyao,

73
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,960
stop this!

74
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,600
Luyao,

75
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
don't be so cruel to me!

76
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,240
Please stop!

77
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,040
Kunlun,

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
remember what happened in Wuzhang?

79
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,080
Resentment has no cure,

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,400
except using one's body as vessel

81
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,320
to absorb it.

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,320
No!

83
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,760
Luyao,

84
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,360
I forbid this!

85
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,800
If you proceed,

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,880
I'll hate you,

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,200
never forgive you!

88
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll follow you,

89
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,000
blame you

90
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,120
for being heartless.

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,840
Asking for your help

92
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,760
is way too cruel indeed.

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,000
Let my inherent Samadhi Fire

94
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,640
send me on my way.

95
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Don't! Luyao!

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,080
I didn't mean it! Please stop!

97
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm begging you!

98
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,880
Let me do it!

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,440
Let me absorb the resentment!

100
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,240
Luyao!

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,920
Don't!

102
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,560
S-

103
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,280
Sister!

104
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,320
Sister!

105
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Sister!

106
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,640
Stop this!

107
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,160
I finally

108
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,000
heard you call me sister.

109
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,280
Kunlun,

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,880
if there's a next life,

111
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,640
I'll tell you sooner

112
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,120
that I love you.

113
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,360
Come here.

114
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,280
You... You stand no chance.

115
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,680
She's everything to me.

116
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Then why save me?

117
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,520
Don't you know how dangerous it was?

118
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,320
If...

119
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,080
I love you.

120
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,840
Luyao, don't do this!

121
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,159
Don't!

122
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,720
You are my only family now.

123
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,400
Please come home with me.

124
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
The Northern Celestial Realm needs you.

125
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,880
You

126
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,320
and that realm

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,280
mean nothing to me.

128
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I have no sister,

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,960
no home!

130
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,680
Luyao,

131
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
you'll never be my family!

132
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,600
Never!

133
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,600
Lujiu.

134
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,520
Lujiu.

135
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,520
Sister.

136
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,320
Luyao!

137
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,520
Luyao!

138
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,680
Jinxiu,

139
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,720
you should know

140
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,640
had I

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,200
not shown mercy,

142
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,600
you'd have perished

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,040
with Cixin.

144
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
I'd rather turn to ashes than acknowledge

145
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,640
my enemy as father for millennia.

146
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,800
Jinxiu,

147
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,680
do you really hate me so?

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,720
Hongning.

149
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,800
Jinxiu.

150
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,720
Jinxiu.

151
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm the one Heaven favors.

152
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,920
I survived the Kylin Lair,

153
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
endured the celestial fire.

154
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm the chosen one,

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,080
destined for greatness

156
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,960
and born to rule this world!

157
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,920
Baicha,

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,960
after centuries of strife,

159
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,840
what more do you want?

160
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,480
Why involve

161
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,360
the innocent?

162
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,160
In the Withered Garden,

163
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,760
Hongning helped you escape.

164
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,960
In Floralia Palace, Jinxiu protected you.

165
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,760
Yet you are paranoid, jealous, and discontented.

166
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,160
Let me ask you,

167
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,480
what did Wuzhang's people do to you?

168
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,440
What did Cangwu's

169
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,560
disciples do to you?

170
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,840
What did Luyao ever do to you?

171
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,600
You took their lives,

172
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,600
made them homeless,

173
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,280
denied Cangwu's disciples'

174
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,360
rebirth,

175
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,320
and reduced Luyao

176
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,960
to ashes!

177
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,080
As expected, only the resentment

178
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,720
of a senior immortal like you

179
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
holds such divine power.

180
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,960
Baicha, you killed my sister!

181
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,760
I'll hunt you

182
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,360
to the ends of the earth!

183
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,920
Bring it on!

184
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,520
Release your hatred!

185
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,360
The more you hate,

186
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,480
the stronger I become.

187
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,280
Jinxiu,

188
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
slow down.

189
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,080
Be careful.

190
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,960
Let me see.

191
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,600
We've got a flower thief here.

192
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,960
Father, mother.

193
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,480
Mother,

194
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
the red camellia you gave me bloomed.

195
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,280
I didn't let you down.

196
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,000
I've taken great care of it.

197
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,200
Do you like it?

198
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,320
Father,

199
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,800
I didn't steal.

200
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,320
One should take flowers by proper means.

201
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,560
This blooming red camellia

202
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,280
is filled with your devotion.

203
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,720
I love it.

204
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,520
This place

205
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,520
is neither reality

206
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,040
nor mere illusion.

207
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,320
[Isn't this what your heart]

208
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,440
[desires and longs for?]

209
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,360
My mother gave you to me.

210
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,560
You are red camellia,

211
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,600
and I'm peony.

212
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,760
We share the same roots.

213
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,000
From now on,

214
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
let me care for you,

215
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,240
okay?

216
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,480
Since you've gained sentience,

217
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,120
do cultivate hard

218
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,320
and grow quickly,

219
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,520
so we may be together forever.

220
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,400
[Could my bond with Hongning]

221
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,760
[trace back to my mother?]

222
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,040
Why stand in the rain?

223
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,800
From now on,

224
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,160
just stay safely in my palace.

225
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,000
[That's me.]

226
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,400
Our floral kind

227
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,000
lacks defensive power,

228
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,640
but possesses regenerative strength.

229
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,280
Even if struck,

230
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,880
don't be afraid.

231
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,599
Hongning.

232
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,200
I had so much to say,

233
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,160
but I couldn't speak in a floral form.

234
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,440
I was so anxious.

235
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,560
It's alright.

236
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,360
You have plenty

237
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,560
of time to tell me in the future.

238
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,200
Is this what my heart

239
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,600
desires?

240
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,480
Jinxiu.

241
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,240
Jinxiu.

242
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,200
Jinxiu.

243
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,960
Jinxiu, where are you?

244
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,480
I lost you again.

245
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
What Yaotian will do to you?

246
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,000
Jinxiu.

247
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,160
Jinxiu.

248
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Please take me to him.

249
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,000
It's Jinxiu

250
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,800
and me.

251
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,680
Jinxiu.

252
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,720
Jinxiu.

253
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,120
That's the plight in your mind.

254
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
It's not real.

255
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,440
You'll be trapped in there.

256
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,640
Come out, now!

257
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,280
Jinxiu,

258
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,360
it's not reality.

259
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,200
It's not your true life.

260
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Come with me!

261
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,160
You can't stay here.

262
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,320
[In here, immortals and demons coexist]

263
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,480
[in eternal peace.]

264
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,320
[Why can't Jinxiu stay?]

265
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,280
Jinxiu seeks coexistence

266
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,480
and peace across the Three Realms.

267
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,200
I'd sacrifice everything

268
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,680
to stay by his side.

269
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,600
If this is all false,

270
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,160
what does he truly seek?

271
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,600
[His ideal and love]

272
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,000
[are all here.]

273
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
[Why make him leave?]

274
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,200
Our thoughts

275
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,480
and experiences

276
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,160
shape who we are.

277
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,080
The pain, the trials,

278
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,480
good and bad,

279
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,320
joy and sorrow,

280
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,600
are all part of you.

281
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,040
If you strip it

282
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,400
all away,

283
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,440
you'll deny

284
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,320
the meaning of your life.

285
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,200
You'll be incomplete.

286
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,160
You won't be your true self anymore.

287
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,800
[Without self,]

288
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,000
[he'd willingly]

289
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,120
[sacrifice his body to the world.]

290
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
[It's the price]

291
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,160
[to protect all realms.]

292
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Why don't you do it yourself?

293
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,840
You sacrifice Jinxiu

294
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,800
for your own interest.

295
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,680
How unfair that is!

296
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,320
[Life's bitterness,]

297
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,000
[death's sorrow.]

298
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,560
[Immortals and demons, from heaven and earth]

299
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,560
[they came, to heaven and earth they return.]

300
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,440
Why force your duties and burdens

301
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,920
onto Jinxiu?

302
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,400
You're unworthy as the Celestial Monarch.

303
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,200
[You'll regret this,]

304
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,040
[so will Jinxiu.]

305
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,440
Being with my beloved,

306
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
why would I regret it?

307
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,400
I'm just a powerless red camellia,

308
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,560
but I do have

309
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,960
my own unique destiny to fulfill.

310
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,440
Jinxiu,

311
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,440
all creation awaits you.

312
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,360
You still have greater duties.

313
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Wake up!

314
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,000
Don't forget the splendor of the world

315
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,120
is where you belong.

316
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,240
I used my finger bone to sustain your life.

317
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,000
I should be

318
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,880
the one to reclaim it.

319
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,760
You haven't repaid your life debt yet.

320
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,640
How can you break your word?

321
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,840
You still dare obstruct me?

322
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,080
I've lost everything.

323
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,120
Killing you

324
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,200
matters more

325
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,400
than my own life.

326
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,720
Immortals have desires,

327
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,360
so do demons.

328
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Immortals, demons, mortals all crave.

329
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,960
How dare you claim

330
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,320
immortals are pure and sacred?

331
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,000
If not for your inner corruption,

332
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,720
how could my Unicorn Blade be empowered?

333
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,240
What I seek

334
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,360
has never changed.

335
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,960
During the immortal-demon war ten millennia ago,

336
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
countless lives were lost.

337
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,880
Rivers of blood ran deep.

338
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,360
The despicable nature of demons

339
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,040
and their savagery

340
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,680
were completely exposed

341
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,520
in that war.

342
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,800
I sacrificed my emotions

343
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,320
to plead with the Sage

344
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,360
for divine power

345
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,160
to reshape the order of the Three Realms.

346
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,800
From then on,

347
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,440
immortals and demons were separated,

348
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,800
free from chaos.

349
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,440
[The great order reigns supreme.]

350
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,720
[The laws of Heaven and Earth come first.]

351
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,880
[What I seek is absolute,]

352
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,800
unshakable order.

353
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,360
That is your law,

354
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,560
not the Heave and Earth's.

355
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,120
It is merely your own conjecture.

356
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,120
Since the dawn of creation,

357
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,160
immortals, demons, and mortals were established.

358
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,600
There must be a reason for their existence.

359
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,760
[Then]

360
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,680
[why would these happen?]

361
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,400
[Precisely because these demons]

362
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,800
[harbor resentment]

363
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,560
[and were born in savagery,]

364
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,520
their grudges linger after death,

365
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,040
transforming into filthy hatred,

366
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,480
corrupting the Three Realms.

367
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,720
The evil you speak of

368
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,440
is simply because they were born as demons.

369
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,160
Open your eyes and see,

370
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,600
resentment and conflict

371
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,960
rages everywhere now.

372
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,960
Is this the Three Realms you desired?

373
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,800
Is this the Three Realms

374
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,360
you sacrificed so much for,

375
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,680
even turning me into

376
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,480
part of the world to protect?

377
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,640
Ten thousand years ago,

378
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,200
the Sage warned me

379
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,520
that reshaping the order of the Three Realms

380
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,000
would bring unforeseeable consequences.

381
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,880
Your actions are bound

382
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,120
to return to haunt you.

383
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,440
If you can break the plight set by my true form,

384
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,200
I have no room left for retreat.

385
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,280
I can

386
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,560
dissipate my divine mark

387
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,800
and remove my divine bones.

388
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,360
But,

389
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,680
for the Three Realms

390
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,880
and all living beings,

391
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,640
I still hope you can

392
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,360
sprinkle your Kylin blood

393
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,240
across the world

394
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,640
to dispel

395
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
that lingering

396
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,880
resentment.

397
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,120
If it's for the peace of the world,

398
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,840
I have no hesitation.

399
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,320
I'll do it myself.

400
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,199
Jinxiu,

401
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,560
you really don't hate me?

402
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,360
I don't.

403
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,600
Baicha,

404
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,720
for your own selfish desires,

405
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,520
you incited war between immortals and demons,

406
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,080
causing suffering across the Three Realms.

407
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Stop this madness.

408
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,120
Because of me?

409
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,280
If not for the divide between immortals and demons,

410
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,720
I wouldn't have been banished to Mt. Baizhou,

411
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,920
cut off from immortality,

412
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,720
mocked and tormented beyond endurance.

413
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
The demons who endured such humiliation

414
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,080
would've never seen me as their king.

415
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,680
All of this

416
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,720
is your fault.

417
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,560
It's all your fault!

418
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,840
Withdraw your resentment.

419
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,280
You can't defeat him

420
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,960
with resentment.

421
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,520
Focus.

422
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,120
All I seek

423
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,640
is Hongning.

424
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,840
At this point,

425
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,920
you still dare mention her?
