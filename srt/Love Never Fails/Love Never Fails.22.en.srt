[Can I marry you?]

[The bride and groom enter the hall,]

Wait.

25
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,500
What's wrong, Master?

26
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,780
It's tradition in my hometown

27
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,580
to tie a red thread.

28
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,500
[Red thread?]

29
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,420

Red thread?

31
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,180
It's woven

32
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,380
from longing by the God of Marriage.

33
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,740
Once it's tied,

34
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,220
we'll never be apart.

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,740
Can't believe Master is so romantic.

38
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,300
I'll definitely do that

39
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,060
when I get married.

40
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,820
Lead the bride to the bridal chamber.

41
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,420
Wait.

42
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,740
Shouldn't...

43
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,100
Shouldn't the bride

44
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,380
and groom go together?

45
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,460
Master,

46
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,420
it's your big day today.

47
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
Are you in such a rush?

48
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,380
Aren't you going to have a few drinks

49
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,700
and share the joy with us?

50
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,540
Master,

51
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,659
those rules don't apply here.

52
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,100
This is tradition on Mt. Cangwu.

53
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,820
Get the bride to the chamber now.

54
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,540
Follow me.

55
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,260
Wait.

56
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,620
Give me a minute. I'll be right back.

57
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,220
Take her!

58
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,460
Nice!

59
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,660
Great.

60
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,700
Master, congratulations!

61
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,620

74
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,620

- Hey, guys.
- Guys.

81

- Come on, have a drink!
- Cheers!

Enjoy the dishes. Thanks for coming.

85
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,860
Enjoy the feast.

86
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,260
Help yourself.

87
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,820
Enjoy it.

88
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,659
We're leaving.

89
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,220
Have fun.

90
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,340
Take your time.

91
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,060
How are you doing?

92
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,340
Ningmeng!

93
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,500
Ningmeng!

94
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,380
- Hey, mate!
- Come on!

95
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,380
Raise your cups!

96
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,660
Cheers! Let's drink!

97
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,140
Bottoms up!

98
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,580
Drink well.

99
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,420
What a good day!

100
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,140

Thanks.

103
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,660
No more squirting lemon juice at people.

104
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,380
Got it! I promise!

105
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,300
Good. Alright.

106
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,620
Excuse me.

107
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,780
Sir, ma'am.

108
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,460
Nice to meet you.

109
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,460
Good, good.

110
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,260
Eat more.

111
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,060
Don't worry.

112
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,300
We'll take care of Hongning.

113
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,060
- Let's toast.
- Right.

114
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,620
Wonderful.

115
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,660
All right, everybody.

116
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,300
Enjoy it.

117
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,980
Why isn't Jiaobo here?

118
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,900
She should've arrived by now.

119
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,059
Report!

120
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,780
There's a barrier in Mt. Cangwu.

121
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,980
We can't get through it.

122
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,420
No worries.

123
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,780
Someone will break it.

124
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,980
Get ready!

125
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,100
[It's that camellia pixie again.]

126
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,060
[Jinxiu,]

127
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,220
[you knew she held the Demon King's power,]

128
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
[but still chose to marry her.]

129
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,460
[You defied the heavens and will be punished.]

130
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,020
Sir Jinxiu,

131
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,420
on your wedding day,

132
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,420
my gift to you

133
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,620
is on its way.

134
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,460
What's causing the disturbance?

135
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,060
[The barrier is cracking.]

136
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,940
[Oh no. I must check it out.]

137
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,100
Listen.

138
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,180
That must be Hongning's wedding, right?

139
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,180
How does that concern you?

140
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,660
Sir,

141
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,220
there are cracks in the barrier.

142
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,380
We can get through now.

143
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,500
The Demon King is hiding inside.

144
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,660
Kill any demon on sight.

145
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:08,860
Yes.

146
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,340
I'm telling you,

147
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,220
I knew it all along that

148
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,460
Master's got feelings for Hongning.

149
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,500
He treats her different.

150
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
She's dressed as a man back then.

151
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,940
Well, I didn't know that.

152
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,500
Master.

153
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,940
Where are you going?

154
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,620
Just keep going.

155
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,340
[Let's drink till you drop.]

156
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,180
Master?

157
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,140
[Let me top you off.]

158
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,180
No!

159
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,740
You can't go in there!

160
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,620
You have no spiritual power at all.

161
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,780
How can you fight me?

162
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,340
It's

163
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,020
Sir Jinxiu's wedding day.

164
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,780
You should go give him a surprise.

165
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,580
Let's tear the

166
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,020
Cangwu Academy apart.

167
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,060
- Let me out!
- Let me out!

168
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,020
Now!

169
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,820
Release!

170
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,460
Move! Hurry up!

171
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,500
Master,

172
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,020
why are you leading an attack on Cangwu?

173
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,060
Watch your tone!

174
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,700
If you hadn't been so stubborn,

175
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,140
I wouldn't have had to come myself.

176
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,060
Do we really have to

177
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,740
be enemies?

178
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,180
Jinxiu,

179
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,620
you're going against the Celestial Realm

180
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,540
for a camellia pixie?

181
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,220
Baibuqu!

182
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,540
Baibuqu...

183
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,220
Baibuqu!

184
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,300
- Baibuqu!
- Baibuqu!

185
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,980
What's going on?

186
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,420
What do we do?

187
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,100
Baibuqu!

188
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,500
The dungeon...

189
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,340
The dungeon...

190
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,100
The dungeon?

191
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,020
Someone! Go check the dungeon!

192
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,660
Yes!

193
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,220
Hang in there.

194
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,260
I'm sorry, Master Wenxin.

195
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,460
I failed my first

196
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,940
assignment.

197
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,380
- Baibuqu!
- Baibuqu!

198
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,500
- Baibuqu!
- Baibuqu!

199
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,780
Is he dead?

200
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,380
What about Hongning?

201
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,100
Let's go. Now!

202
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:19,820
Go!

203
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,380
Master Wenxin,

204
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:20,940
outside...

205
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,260
Demons are everywhere!

206
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,380
They've broken in,

207
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,620
killing many disciples.

208
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,020
We can't hold them off.

209
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,100
Reinforce the defenses!

210
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,620
Yes.

211
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,980
Bailing, go report to the Master.

212
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,500
[Baibuqu?]

213
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,540
What are you still doing here?

214
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,900
It's dangerous. Get back.

215
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,340
None of you are going anywhere.

216
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,340
- Bailing!
- Bailing!

217
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,420
So it's you

218
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,140
who opened the dungeon.

219
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,820
Kill them all!

220
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,220
All Cangwu disciples,

221
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,300
escort the guests to safety!

222
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,740
[Monster!]

223
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,740
- No!
- Shouhou.

224
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,780
No!

225
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,180
Mom!

226
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,300
No!

227
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,500
Mom!

228
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,340
Mom!

229
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,140
Mom!

230
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,420
Mom!

231
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,100
Mom!

232
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:52,820
Tiannanxing,

233
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,700
hold the demons off with me.

234
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,380
Bailing, take all the disciples

235
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,620
and get everyone out of here.

236
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Find Master and Hongning!

237
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,540
You go first.

238
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,420
Leave them to me!

239
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,500
You're already hurt.

240
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,420
Leave here now.

241
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,100
Tiannanxing!

242
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,980
Go!

243
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,700
Leave?

244
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,740
Not that easy.

245
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,300
Hurry up!

246
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,380
I...

247
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,660
Just go!

248
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,660
We'll be fine!

249
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,500
Okay.

250
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,620
Be careful.

251
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,260
Follow me!

252
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,700
Go! Quickly!

253
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,620
Tiannanxing!

254
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,660
Move!

255
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,700
Now!

256
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,940
Master Wenxin!

257
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,020
No!

258
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,700
Wenxin,

259
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,900
are you all right?

260
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,740
C'mon!

261
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,540
Are you okay?

262
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,420
Stay with me.

263
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,980
Tiannanxing,

264
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,940
you’re the best disciple

265
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,900
I've seen.

266
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,260
I swear I'll make

267
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,740
Cangwu proud.

268
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,420
You think you can stop me?

269
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,980
You're seeking death.

270
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,220
Wenxin! No!

271
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,220
Wake up!

272
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,180
Baicha,

273
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,140
Master saved you, took you in,

274
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,420
and treated you so well.

275
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,140
And this is how you repay him?

276
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,100
That kind, noble master you speak of

277
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,460
only let me stay here

278
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,860
because of Hongning.

279
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,340
You!

280
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,060
Do you even know

281
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,540
what he did to me?

282
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,740
I'll kill you!

283
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,380
Say it,

284
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
call him a heartless hypocrite,

285
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,660
and I'll spare your life.

286
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,940
We Cangwu disciples

287
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,660
live to save lives.

288
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,260
I would never give in!

289
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,980
Cangwu's backbone

290
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,860
will never break,

291
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,180
you twisted monster!

292
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,580
The silver needle

293
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,500
is coated with special poison.

294
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,980
You won't last long.

295
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,300
How funny.

296
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,460
You think you can kill me

297
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,780
with some silver needle?

298
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,660
You...

299
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,540
Time to

300
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,060
find the bride.

301
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,820
Guys.

302
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
Get everyone over here.

303
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,260
Here. This way.

304
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,260
Follow me.

305
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,740
Come on.

306
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,820
Quick.

307
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,900
[What's going on?]

308
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,940
[Why is my Spiritual Flame]

309
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,940
[out of control?]

310
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,780
[How could this happen?]

311
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,780
[Why can't I take it back?]

312
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,100
Immortals?

313
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,740
You're immortals, right?

314
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,380
Cangwu is attacked by demons!

315
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:53,980
People are still inside.

316
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,740
Please save them.

317
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,500
Ridiculous.

318
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,820
It's none of our concern.

319
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,980
Then why are you here?

320
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,460
We're asked

321
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,300
to arrest the Demon King, Hongning.

322
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,700
Where is she?

323
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,380
Demon King?

324
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,700
That's impossible.

325
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,740
We cultivate so hard

326
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,340
to become immortals.

327
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,940
So this is what immortals are like,

328
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,060
hypocritical,

329
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,740
indifferent to lives,

330
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
and utterly unjust?

331
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,340
Insolent demon!

332
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,620
How dare you slander the immortals?

333
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,460
Take him down!

334
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,300
Yes, sir!

335
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,140
Sir, he's the Emperor Star.

336
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,580
By decree of the Punisher,

337
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,740
anyone who obstructs us

338
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,940
shall be executed.

339
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,340
What are you waiting for?

340
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,140
Yes!

341
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,780
Yes!

342
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,100
Who's there?

343
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,620
Ice spirit Bailing,

344
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,740
slaying the Demon King is heaven's will.

345
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,380
How dare you defy it?

346
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,060
Who are you?

347
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,300
Stop running your mouth!

348
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,060
Get down!

349
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,180
You haven't changed a bit.

350
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,220
Today I'm going to discipline you

351
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,180
on behalf of the Celestial Monarch.

352
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,900
Don't forget who you are.

353
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,420
I haven't.

354
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,060
Now, I'm not the Celestial Commander,

355
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,780
but the Head of Cangwu Academy.

356
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,060
So stubborn.

357
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,460
Bailing.

358
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:01,860
Yes.

359
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,780
Go save Hongning.

360
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,300
Got it.

361
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,620
Go save Hongning!

362
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,500
Go!

363
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,260
Hurry!

364
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,580
- Please, go!
- Okay.

365
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,700
Xiu!

366
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,020
Lujiu, why is this happening?

367
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,740
Xiu!

368
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,500
[You're useless.]

369
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,780
[You're nothing but a failure.]

370
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,740
[This is my fault.]

371
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,460
[You're a total failure!]

372
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,500
[This is my fault.]

373
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,260
Sir, ma'am.

374
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,180
Xiu!

375
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,900
Xiu!

376
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,380
[I killed them with my own hands.]

377
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,500
[It's me. It's me.]

378
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,660
Bailing.

379
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,020
It's all my fault!

380
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,180
It's all my fault!

381
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,860
[It's all my fault!]

382
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,420
Master!

383
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,580
Bailing.

384
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,820
[Hongning!]

385
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,940
[Hongning!]

386
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,220
Hongning!

387
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,580
Hongning!

388
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,420
Hongning! Hongning!

389
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,700
Hongning, run!

390
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,580
Hongning,

391
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,540
run now!

392
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,180
Ningmeng?

393
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,020
Run, Hongning.

394
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,460
Come with me.

395
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,420
- What's happening?
- Let's go.

396
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,700
Hongning,

397
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,060
they're here to arrest you.

398
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,740
You have to go now.

399
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,380
Go!

400
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:33,780
I'm not leaving.

401
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,420
Trying to escape?

402
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,220
Ningmeng!

403
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,660
Ningmeng!

404
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:40,980
Ningmeng!

405
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,580
Ningmeng!

406
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,180
Run.

407
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,100
Ningmeng!

408
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,100
- Ningmeng!
- Just go.

409
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,380
Ningmeng!

410
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,340
Come with me.

411
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,940
They killed Ningmeng.

412
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,580
I have to avenge him.

413
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,620
Calm down.

414
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,580
The heavenly guards

415
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,820
have released all the demons.

416
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,460
Cangwu has been surrounded.

417
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,540
We can't take

418
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,740
them on alone.

419
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,060
Why would they do this?

420
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,020
Did you forget

421
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,500
what I told you?

422
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,540
Jinxiu married you.

423
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,180
But he just wanna

424
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,620
use the power of the Demon King

425
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,660
to gather the demon clans.

426
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,780
He reported it to the Celestial Realm.

427
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,980
They're here

428
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,580
to wipe all of you out.

429
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,700
No way.

430
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,940
He wouldn't do such things.

431
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,060
Hongning,

432
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,980
you still don't believe me?

433
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
I'll take you to him.

434
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,540
You'll see

435
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,700
who he really is.

436
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,100
Let's go.

437
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,300
The Spiritual Flame hurts so much.

438
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,940
Just kill me.

439
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
If it damages the soul,

440
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,340
we'll never reincarnate.

441
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,300
I swear I'll save you.

442
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,740
Master,

443
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,500
I'm sorry.

444
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,020
I couldn't protect them.

445
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,100
If they'd fought me head-on,

446
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,220
I wouldn't have lost.

447
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,660
Master...

448
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,740
I'm sorry,

449
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,860
Master.

450
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,180
I didn't listen to you.

451
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,980
I can't stop thinking about the Matriarch.

452
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,140
Now I'll never get the chance.

453
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,820
If you see her,

454
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,540
please tell her I like her.

455
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,300
Kill me.

456
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,620
[Kunlun,]

457
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,900
[I fail to protect you]

458
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,820
[from the death and parting.]

459
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,300
[When you return to the Celestial Realm,]

460
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,100
[you can tell her yourself.]

461
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,540
Put us out of this misery.

462
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
It hurts too much.

463
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,900
Go save Hongning.

464
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,980
Save Hongning.

465
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,780
Save her.

466
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,220
Please.

467
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,220
Dad!

468
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,980
Mom!

469
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,020
Dad!

470
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,060
Dad!

471
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,820
Mom!

472
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,260
Mom!

473
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,100
Dad!

474
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,500
Dad! Mom!

475
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,700
Hongning...

476
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:10,980
Dad!

477
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,860
Mom!

478
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,540
[I don't have much to give you.]

479
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,220
[So I bought a hand warmer.]

480
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,700
[It'll]

481
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,860
[be brought over]

482
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,780
[to you in two days.]

483
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,900
[Hongning, don't worry.]

484
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,620
[When I become village chief]

485
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,900
[and make more money,]

486
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,540
[I'll buy you a house of hand warmers.]

487
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,460
[So your hands]

488
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,860
[will never get cold again.]

489
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,980
[Demon King's power?]

490
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,980
Hongning.

491
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,460
Stay back!

492
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,380
Don't come any closer.

493
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,500
What is this bracelet?

494
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,500
It's to suppress the Demon King's power.

495
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,020
He's been lying

496
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,940
to you this whole time.

497
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,460
He used you to

498
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,900
gather everyone,

499
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,139
so they could slay them all.

500
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,500
[This bracelet]

501
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,699
[is a gift for you.]

502
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,380
[It can help you cultivate]

503
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,060
[and keep you safe.]

504
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,300
[Am I the Demon King?]

505
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,100
[Of course not.]

506
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,179
[We were invited here]

507
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,820
[by the Head of Cangwu Academy.]

508
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,340
Why did you lie to me?

509
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,020
Hongning.

510
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,020
No!

511
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,860
You murderer,

512
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
why did you kill my parents?

513
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,380
It's not what you think.

514
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,100
Why did you turn Mt. Cangwu

515
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,820
into a massacre?

516
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,260
Hongning!

517
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,780
Sir,

518
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,820
in my last life, I died

519
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,380
repaying your kindness.

520
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,580
In this one,

521
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,740
you said you'd love me,

522
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,380
protect me,

523
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,460
and stay by my side.

524
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,820
But I saw my family and friends

525
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,300
dying in front of me!

526
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,540
So the promise you made

527
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,900
was just a lie.

528
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,100
Our relationship

529
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,860
ends here.

530
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,900
Hongning, don't!

531
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,020
Hongning!

532
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,580
Hongning!

533
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,020
Hongning.

534
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,180
From now on,

535
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,820
we are

536
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,660
just enemies.

537
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,180
I'm really sorry.

538
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,180
You immortals

539
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,940
are all liars.

540
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,980
If there's another life,

541
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,380
I swear I'll find you

542
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,660
and...

543
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,180
kill you myself.

544
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,060
Hongning.

545
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,500
Hongning.

546
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,780
Hongning.

547
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,020
Hongning,

548
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,940
don't leave me.

549
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,900
Don't go.

550
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,820
I beg you.

551
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,340
Wake up.

552
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,180
Please wake up.

553
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,700
Hongning.

554
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,940
Hongning.

555
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,060
Hongning!

556
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,500
Hongning!

557
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,540
Hongning!

558
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,220
[Summon all demons]

559
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,700
[and gather all souls.]

560
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,900
[Bring Hongning back to life!]

561
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,620
Sir,

562
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,740
time's almost up.

563
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,820
Just cross through the gate.

564
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,660
Have all from Cangwu

565
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,300
passed through it?

566
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,740
Not yet.

567
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,380
Too many died there.

568
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,340
Our messengers

569
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
are still registering names.

570
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,420
They'll be here soon.

571
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,860
What's wrong?

572
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,460
No.

573
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,300
I can't go now.

574
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,140
Why not?

575
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,700
Sir!

576
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,140
The time is running out!

577
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,700
Sir Jinxiu?

578
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,420
Sir.

579
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,700
Sir.

580
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,540
Greetings.

581
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,820
What brings you here?

582
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,060
I need to get in.

583
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,260
No, no.

584
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,860
Well, Sir,

585
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:36,860
I'm sorry.

586
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,620
Oh no...

587
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,980
[Let him through.]

588
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,780
Don't tell others

589
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,500
about this.

590
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,100
Yes, Sir.

591
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,300
Even if I'm tossed into Demotion Pool,

592
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,620
I won't say a thing.

593
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,620
Come with me.

594
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,500
I've put up a barrier here.

595
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,780
No one will see you.

596
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,500
Just get straight to the point.

597
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,660
I need the truth.

598
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,140
Was it you who messed

599
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:09,940
with the bracelet?
