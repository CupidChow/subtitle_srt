00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,640
Year 94,000 of the Celestial Calendar

4
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,320
Floral Deity Jinxiu was bathing in his palace

5
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,880
when a 500-year-old camellia pixie...

6
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,880
It's been all night.

7
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,560
I really want to know, what's going on

8
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,960
with Sir Jinxiu.

9
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,760
Same here!

10
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,960
You think I don't want to?

11
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm the only witness.

12
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,760
I...

13
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm also tasked

14
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,280
with recording it truthfully.

15
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,960
I don't know...

16
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,880
Then write it!

17
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,120
How am I supposed to write it?

18
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,160
I haven't seen an autumn in many years.

19
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,800
If I put this down,

20
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,800
do you like winter in Celestial Court?

21
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,400
No way!

22
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,960
But Sir Jinxiu

23
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,640
has always been cold,

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,480
distant, and alone.

25
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,960
How did he end up like this?

26
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,760
You know,

27
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
he wasn't always like this.

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,360
Back when

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
the Kunlun Deity was still around,

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,200
he's quite a nuisance

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,200
to the deity.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,400
You know...

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,400
But this time,

34
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,280
how did a camellia pixie manage

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
to mess with him so much?

36
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,079
Sir Jinxiu, exposed before a camellia pixie?

37
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,280
I didn't say that!

38
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,560
Don't twist my words.

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,400
If I wrote that down,

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,360
it would cause a sensation.

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
How did you get all these scars?

42
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,600
Does it hurt?

43
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,440
Sir.

44
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,120
I remember you said the pastries

45
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,120
at Celestial Floralia were a bit disappointing.

46
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,440
Well, lately,

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,040
some new folks joined,

48
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,040
and they made top-grade pastries.

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,520
I brought you some.

50
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,000
Maybe another day.

51
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,040
Come on!

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,800
We need to settle the pastries

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,920
for Celestial Floralia early.

54
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,120
A lot of the materials here

55
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,440
need to be specially made.

56
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,040
If you don't settle it early,

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,800
we'll...

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,120
be in trouble...

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,040
You're not usually this proactive.

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,320
No, I mean...

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,480
Forget it.

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,960
Same as every year.

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,320
Look here,

64
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,200
there's another tray.

65
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,960
Maybe there's a surprise in it.

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,800
All flashy nonsense.

67
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,960
Just leave it.

68
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,440
Then...

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,160
I'll take my leave now.

70
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,920
Please give it a try!

71
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
Let's go.

72
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,200
Sir,

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
the one who made the pastries

74
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,440
is waiting outside.

75
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,320
Let her in.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,600
Bring her in.

77
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
So it's you.

78
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,800
Is there something on my face?

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,000
Why staring at me?

80
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,120
About that day,

81
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,240
-I really didn't...
-Stop!

82
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,760
What day?

83
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,800
Watch your mouth.

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,760
Mind your manners!

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,160
Greetings, Officer.

86
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,400
Not me.

87
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,440
It's him...

88
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,560
Fine.

89
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,760
You made these pastries?

90
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,200
After you left that day,

91
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,560
I couldn't find you anywhere.

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,960
No one knew

93
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,400
where you went.

94
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Tell me straight,

95
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,040
did you add something special

96
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,480
to these pastries?

97
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,600
Something special?

98
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,720
You mean mint?

99
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,800
The kind that regrows when plucked?

100
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,800
It was a gift from my friend Jiaobo.

101
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,120
Mint?

102
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,840
Sir, here's the thing.

103
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
The Mint Clan

104
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,720
are pixies from Mt. Baizhou.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,800
The Merfolk Clan

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,520
are from the Southern Seas.

107
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,440
Your friend Jiaobo,

108
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,080
likely haven't found his immortal fate.

109
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,080
That's why

110
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,240
we've never seen him before.

111
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,480
So, a pixie, huh?

112
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
What's wrong with pixies?

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,720
Is it tasty?

114
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,800
It tastes pretty good.

115
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,760
Soft, tender, smooth.

116
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,480
Different from

117
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,080
the ones before.

118
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,680
Of course it's different.

119
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,120
Those pastries before were terrible.

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,840
The ingredients you used

121
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,800
were fruits, rainwater, and honey brews.

122
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,640
I had to ask around

123
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,000
to get fresh flower fertilizer

124
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,880
from Tianma Stables.

125
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,000
Flower fertilizer?

126
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,880
Sir,

127
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,200
I haven't heard that term in centuries.

128
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Flower fertilizer?

129
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,120
Fresh flower fertilizer from Tianma Stables.

130
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,920
From horses...

131
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,960
Official Chrysanthemum!

132
00:07:59,480 --> 00:07:59,960
Got it!

133
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,920
Take her away!

134
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,520
Why did this to me?

135
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,640
Get some water!

136
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,080
Why?

137
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,240
Get water, now!

138
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,320
-Sir, are you alright?
-Floral Immortals,

139
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,360
-Why?
-Sir,

140
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,960
are you alright?

141
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,320
Sir! Sir!

142
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,920
Sir.

143
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,720
Please don't be mad.

144
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,000
She's just a pixie, after all.

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,680
If you ask me,

146
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,320
just banish her to the mortal world.

147
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,520
That won't be necessary.

148
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,320
She hasn't finished her punishment yet.

149
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,280
But sir, you just called her

150
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,400
crude

151
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,040
and wild.

152
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
Why the sudden change of heart?

153
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,640
This is all your fault!

154
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,400
I told you to teach her manners.

155
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,200
Where did that go?

156
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
Where is here proper dress?

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,480
Go get your punishment.

158
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,400
I'm the last to be blamed.

159
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,240
I've been busy writing.

160
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,840
And...

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,520
besides,

162
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,560
she's been getting punished too.

163
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,480
Always coming at me

164
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,880
'cause I'm the nice one.

165
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,280
Official Chrysanthemum,

166
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,600
say that again.

167
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,880
Yes, sir.

168
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,200
Hold it.

169
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,960
About today...

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,680
What?

171
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,720
Not a word to anyone!

172
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,080
Yes, sir!

173
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,560
I'm gone.

174
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,280
Where have you been, Hongning?

175
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,320
It's pouring out there!

176
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,280
Yeah.

177
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,640
Why is it suddenly

178
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,040
raining so hard?

179
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,720
Sir Jinxiu must be furious.

180
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,960
Flowers wilted,

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,920
then came the storm.

182
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,640
Even Envoy Plum said

183
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,160
he hadn't seen the Floralia Palace

184
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,600
so battered by wind and rain.

185
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,680
Is she really that temperamental?

186
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,880
And I still need to spoil her?

187
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,080
Forget it!

188
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,120
I don't owe her anything!

189
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,320
What are you mumbling about?

190
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,240
It's pouring down.

191
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,600
Officer, hi!

192
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,440
What did you call me?

193
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,040
Officer.

194
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,440
No, you're the officer!

195
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,600
You're officers!

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,080
I'm not.

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,760
When frost foretells the blooming season,

198
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,600
his elegant bearings paint the sky red.

199
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,320
Know who I am?

200
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,520
Of course I do!

201
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,160
Officer Chrysanthemum, right?

202
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,920
Did you hear that?

203
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Coming out of her mouth,

204
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
it sounds so tacky.

205
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,760
Call me Official...Chrysanthemum.

206
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,960
Official...Chrysanthemum!

207
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,440
Like you've been struck by lightning.

208
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,080
Stop laughing!

209
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,040
Let's go!

210
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,280
Wait!

211
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,840
Don't you think

212
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,960
you should wear thicker?

213
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,560
Might help you attract more lightning!

214
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,560
Come on!

215
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,480
Didn't we agree

216
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,240
to once

217
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,680
Let's go.

218
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,280
every three days

219
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,600
-instead of three times a day.
-Let's go!

220
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,080
Don't you die on me!

221
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,280
You scared me!

222
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,600
You nearly scared me to death!

223
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
And that was only the fourth strike!

224
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,280
I thought you'd get hit

225
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,600
at least thirty times today.

226
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Knowing

227
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
no lightning warding,

228
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,960
no shape-shifting spells,

229
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,720
you just can't

230
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,280
make it.

231
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,720
If

232
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,320
you really die,

233
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,520
I'll be held responsible!

234
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,160
It's alright.

235
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,680
I can handle it.

236
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,280
Didn't expect you

237
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,560
to be tougher than me.

238
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,360
Go on, keep coming.

239
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,360
Don't be like that.

240
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Makes me look cruel.

241
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,760
How about this,

242
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,040
go cause more troubles,

243
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
provoke  Sir Jinxiu,

244
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,080
get yourself banished to the mortal world.

245
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,440
At least you'd suffer less.

246
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,840
No.

247
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,320
No way I'm going back down.

248
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,880
It took everything to get up here.

249
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,200
As long as I can stay,

250
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,760
I'll do whatever it takes.

251
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,600
Official Chrysanthemum,

252
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,640
I'm here to attend Celestial Floralia.

253
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,680
The Celestial Floralia?

254
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,720
Wait,

255
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,520
you're just a little pixie.

256
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,640
It's already a miracle you even made it here.

257
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,960
Still not satisfied?

258
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,520
Well, I'm already here...

259
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
and got punished too.

260
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,680
Honestly, I'd love to keep you here.

261
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
In the past thousand years,

262
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,280
Floralia Palace hasn't

263
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,680
had this much excitement.

264
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,640
But even if you endure

265
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,520
all ninety-seven strikes,

266
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,280
you'll still have to leave.

267
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
Might as well leave early.

268
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,360
Official Chrysanthemum,

269
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,080
Can I attend Celestial Floralia

270
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,320
if I'm on the Floral List?

271
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,480
Exactly.

272
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Then how do I get on the list?

273
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,800
You need a Floralia Invitation.

274
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,080
How do I get one?

275
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,320
Don't even dream about it.

276
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,280
The Floralia Invitations

277
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,600
are all handed out by her.

278
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,680
And who's "her"?

279
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,280
Go on.

280
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,720
Everyone knows,

281
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,560
after a thousand years of cultivation,

282
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,800
one can ascend to a junior immortal.

283
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,720
After ten thousand years of cultivation,

284
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,960
to a senior immortal.

285
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,760
And after trials, senior immortals can become Deities.

286
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
You came representing your Flora Clan.

287
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,840
In Celestial Floralia,

288
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,200
you must present the flowers you cultivated

289
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,800
for Floral Deity's inspection.

290
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,280
If your blooms are chosen,

291
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,160
you'll be put in Floral List,

292
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,840
and allowed cultivating in Celestial Realm.

293
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,280
For now,

294
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,120
stay here

295
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,440
and tend to your flowers.

296
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,080
This is Floralia Invitation.

297
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,880
Follow the senior immortals,

298
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,320
and learn the proper etiquette.

299
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,560
You'll soon be guided

300
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,440
to your assigned planting grounds.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,800
Yes, madam!

302
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,320
Envoy Apricot.

303
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,920
Hongning,

304
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,360
what are you doing here?

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,840
Envoy Apricot,

306
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm here for you.

307
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,280
I want to join Celestial Floralia.

308
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,080
What did you just say?

309
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,480
I want to join Celestial Floralia

310
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,840
and stay at Floralia Palace.

311
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,880
So,

312
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,480
I came to ask for a Floralia Invitation.

313
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,400
You're truly ignorant.

314
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
The spots were decided long ago.

315
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,400
And being a lowly pixie

316
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,840
from Mt. Baizhou,

317
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,160
you dream too much.

318
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,040
As long as I can get one,

319
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,520
I'll endure any punishment!

320
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,800
Stop dreaming.

321
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,000
Get lost.

322
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,760
Pixie,

323
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,400
you defied me,

324
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,200
and now you ask for an invitation?

325
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,840
I mean...

326
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,400
You don't even have a good excuse,

327
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,640
just barging in like this?

328
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,480
Fine.

329
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,480
Since you have the guts to ask,

330
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,000
I won't make it hard on you.

331
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
After all, I care about the prosperity of Flora Clan.

332
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,440
And camellias have been declining for ages.

333
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,480
If you have the chance to participate,

334
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,520
it might not be a bad thing.

335
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,240
So that means,

336
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,920
I can get a Floralia Invitation?

337
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,640
Thank you, Envoy Apricot!

338
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,080
But this year's Celestial Floralia

339
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,280
has way more participants than before.

340
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,760
Flora Grove is getting crowded.

341
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,440
Being the last,

342
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,240
you go other places.

343
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,640
Follow me.

344
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,680
Plenty of space here.

345
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,120
Plant your camellias right here.

346
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,880
So basically,

347
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,800
growing camellias here

348
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,880
is all I need to do, right?

349
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,240
Correct.

350
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,200
A reminder for you,

351
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,200
if your camellias fail to bloom,

352
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
or the nectar isn't harvested,

353
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,080
you won't even qualify for Celestial Floralia.

354
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,040
Forget the palace banquets,

355
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,200
you won't even get into the outer feasts.

356
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,800
Don't worry!

357
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,880
I'll make the camellias bloom.

358
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I knew it.

359
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,080
Envoy Apricot wouldn't

360
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,400
make it easy for you.

361
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,720
Sorry, Hongning.

362
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,440
If I'd been more careful,

363
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,840
you wouldn't be trapped like this.

364
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,080
It's no big deal.

365
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,000
Just to grow some camellias, right?

366
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
How hard can that be?

367
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,840
Look at what's growing here!

368
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,640
It's just a bunch of weeds.

369
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,280
Weeding of the grass is not easy.

370
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,960
Be careful!

371
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,560
Take it easy.

372
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Huh...they are

373
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,079
kind of hard to pull up.

374
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,560
That's because it's not weeds at all.

375
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,079
It's called Difu grass,

376
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
a sacred plant

377
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
the Sir Jinxiu brought back

378
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,120
from the mortal world ages ago.

379
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,320
Envoy Apricot was supposed to tend to it,

380
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,920
but she accidentally

381
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,240
scattered seeds here,

382
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,920
and it spread out.

383
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,040
Difu grass feeds on other flowers' roots,

384
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,760
so If you want to plant flowers,

385
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,720
you'd have to clear all of it out.

386
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,000
She's making sure you can't grow anything.

387
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,840
Then I'll just

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,920
weed them out!

389
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,240
Are you crazy?

390
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,560
You can't get rid of them in a few days!

391
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,120
She couldn't weed out in hundreds of years!

392
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,000
This plant is wild too

393
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,920
that it might hurt you.

394
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,840
You can't be too careful.

395
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Let me help you.

396
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,520
You just said it's wild.

397
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,360
I'll do it myself.

398
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,200
Then be careful!

399
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,080
Watch yourself!

400
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,680
Are you okay?

401
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,760
I pull it out.

402
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,240
Take it easy, Hongning!

403
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,360
It's me.

404
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,040
Time's up.

405
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,400
Stop playing around.

406
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,240
Let's go do something exciting!

407
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm weeding.

408
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,760
Forget the weeds,

409
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,520
let's go play with thunder!

410
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,400
I...

411
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,120
It tastes way better now.

412
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,080
Have a try?

413
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,200
This cold wind is biting.

414
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,000
When will the Sir Jinxiu cool down?

415
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,760
We already had enough trouble with

416
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
that one locked up in the Phantom Reflector,

417
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,520
now we've got you.

418
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
Phantom Reflector?

419
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,440
Yes.

420
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
There's someone locked up inside,

421
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,360
someone he just couldn't let go of.

422
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,880
It rained

423
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,600
the day he left...

424
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,320
What happened?

425
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,160
[I'll tell a story.]

426
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,480
[Many years ago,]

427
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,800
[the his younger brother, Kunlun Deity,]

428
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,280
[got reckless and released the Ice Flame.]

429
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,120
[He froze Mt. Cangwu,
a crucial cultivation place of the mortal world.]

430
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,520
Envoy Plum.

431
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,200
Envoy Plum.

432
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,160
[Sir Jinxiu issued a punishment,]

433
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,720
[trapping him inside the Flora Scroll in Reflector.]

434
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,000
Sir Kunlun,

435
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,000
Sir Jinxiu has brewed this.

436
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,360
He asked me to bring you some to taste.

437
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,320
Not interested.

438
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,720
Sir Jinxiu has brewed

439
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,920
over 1,400 kinds of Blossom Brew over years.

440
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,440
Yet he brought only this one.

441
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,200
If you don't try it,

442
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
you might regret it.

443
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,080
What is this taste?

444
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,440
I've never had it before.

445
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,440
They say it's made with mint.

446
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,040
Mint?

447
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,520
What's mint?

448
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,480
I'm not sure either.

449
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,120
I'll take my leave.

450
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,040
Sister Plum,

451
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,680
Sister Plum,

452
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,200
why hasn't my brother come lately?

453
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,920
Is that old man Taiyi

454
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,720
pestering him again?

455
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,240
The Celestial Floralia is drawing near.

456
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,400
There's much to prepare.

457
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,560
Please understand, Sir.

458
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,360
It's alright.

459
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,400
As long as Sister Plum visits me more often,

460
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,360
I'm happy too.

461
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,920
I'll take my leave.

462
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,480
Sister Plum,

463
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,720
Sister Plum,

464
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,520
are you mad at me again?

465
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,880
How many petals have you counted?

466
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,880
250

467
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,800
I mean,

468
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,640
I usually have to count past 300

469
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,400
to fall asleep.

470
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,720
Today, I dozed off at 250.

471
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,280
So boring.

472
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,600
Didn't give me a chance to scare you.

473
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
Sit up straight. Legs down.

474
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,080
Alright.

475
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,960
You're acting like a fool.

476
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,240
The previously locked Fairy Feiqiong

477
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,160
finished counting six poles and eight eras

478
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,560
in just a few days.

479
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,360
How long would you like to be locked up?

480
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,520
It depends.

481
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,560
Maybe a few more millennia.

482
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,920
I had better

483
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,240
wait till Father and Mother have

484
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,880
another Celestial Monarch heir.

485
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,680
I don't see an ounce of improvement in you.

486
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,680
I've improved.

487
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,760
You know,

488
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,520
my tolerance to alcohol has improved a lot!

489
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,920
I told you that

490
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
without my permission,

491
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,720
you cannot touch anything in my Palace.

492
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,240
Fine.

493
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,400
I won't touch anything.

494
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,680
Then you feed it to me.

495
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,800
Would it kill you to let me have one sip?

496
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,120
If you want to drink,

497
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,600
then come out of

498
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,280
the Flora Scroll fair and square.

499
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,280
Fine.

500
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,600
Finally found a way to get me, huh?

501
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,080
Alright, I'll keep counting.

502
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,960
Sir,

503
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,760
Taiyi requests your presence to execute punishment.

504
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,280
Understood.

505
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,840
No.

506
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,760
Please, no.

507
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,040
Stop!

508
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,480
Please, no.

509
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,440
Punisher.

510
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Why is the Prince of the Northern Celestial Realm

511
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,840
among the punished?

512
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,520
This was personally arranged by the NCR's Monarch.

513
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,800
He said even after a thousand years,

514
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,360
the Prince failed to grow nine tails.

515
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,840
The Monarch fears losing face

516
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,040
if word gets out,

517
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
so he sent him here.

518
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,400
The divine punishment executes heavenly justice.

519
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,600
Being born with three tails

520
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,560
violates no heavenly law.

521
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,600
He doesn't deserve such punishment.

522
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,120
Release him at once.

523
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,880
But the Monarch of NCR

524
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,080
I said release him.

525
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,280
Yes, Sir.

526
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,120
Release him.

527
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,280
Why aren't you leaving?

528
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,280
Why did you save me?

529
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,880
I was just doing my duty.

530
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,200
You don't deserve such punishment.

531
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,160
I was born with only three tails.

532
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,960
Everyone despises

533
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,720
and hates me.

534
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,160
No one has ever

535
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,600
spoken of fairness to me.

536
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Three tails or nine,

537
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,480
it's only a matter of cultivation.

538
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
There's no fault in that.

539
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,000
Their hatred and disgust

540
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,800
are their own matters.

541
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,680
It has nothing to do with you.

542
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,720
I have done nothing wrong?

543
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,520
There is justice in this world.

544
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,880
Go and cultivate.

545
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,760
If fate allows,

546
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,080
we shall meet again.

547
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,320
But where should I go?

548
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,120
[Glory or loss,]

549
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,000
[we share it as one.]

550
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
Congratulations to the Monarch of the NCR.

551
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,120
Congratulations.

552
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,800
Congratulations.

553
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,080
In ten thousand years,

554
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,160
the Celestial Pool has once again
produced a drop of Golden Lotus Dew.

555
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,160
This a good omen

556
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,280
that NCR shall usher in an era of prosperity.

557
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,480
For tens of thousands of years,

558
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,080
the realm

559
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,880
has declined,

560
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
with invaders coming against us time and again.

561
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,960
Yet,

562
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,920
thanks to your loyalty,

563
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,320
and the rarest healing treasure under the heavens,

564
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,160
the Golden Lotus Dew,

565
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,200
we endure.

566
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,880
Luyao.

567
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,240
Father.

568
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,120
You are

569
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,680
my only heir.

570
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,360
Henceforth,

571
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,040
the responsibility for our realm's revival

572
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,000
rests upon you.

573
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,960
I will give it my all.

574
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,240
Luyao,

575
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,480
if you marry the Celestial Monarch,

576
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,200
I will gift you the Golden Lotus Dew

577
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,520
as your dowry.

578
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,360
But Father,

579
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,360
the Dew is so precious.

580
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,400
The Midheaven has long coveted it.

581
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,480
Our realm now can only survive

582
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,400
by their grace.

583
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,520
If you become the Celestial Queen,

584
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,600
the realm

585
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,960
shall enjoy everlasting peace.

586
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,120
Yes,

587
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,160
Father.

588
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
How is Lujiu lately?

589
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,120
Sent to the mortal world for cultivation.

590
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,640
Good.

591
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,400
He'll be freer there.

592
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,000
Matriarch,

593
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,400
Lujiu was born with aberrant three tails,

594
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,240
like a demonic immortal.

595
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,000
The Monarch considers it a disgrace.

596
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,320
Best not mention it before him.

597
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,400
Understood.

598
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,000
Hongning,

599
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,120
Hongning,

600
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,200
come with me!

601
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,320
The senior immortal is lecturing.

602
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,840
Coming, coming!

603
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,040
Hurry up!

604
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,040
Let's go!

605
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,440
Let's go!

606
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,520
Baochun, Shaoyao, and Furong,

607
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,080
you will cultivate under Immortal Baihe.

608
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,880
Fellow fairies,

609
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,240
you are obliged to teach junior immortals in

610
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,360
proper attire,

611
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,640
demeanor,

612
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
and cultivation foundation.

613
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,880
What about Hongning?

614
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,240
Shaoyao,

615
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,200
just do your assigned duties.

616
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,160
Yes.

617
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,880
Camellia pixie,

618
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,040
you're a demon.

619
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,400
You can't join us immortals.

620
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Just stay over here and watch.

621
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,400
So what about a demon?

622
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,440
Think you're superior?

623
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,960
Everyone, pay close attention.

624
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,000
Hold your brush steady.

625
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,600
Your brows must be drawn

626
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,920
fine and even.

627
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,200
When you bow,

628
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,760
keep your head straight.

629
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,240
Speak from your diaphragm.

630
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,640
Clivia!

631
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,040
Clivia!

632
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,160
Magnolia!

633
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,600
Magnolia!

634
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,800
Swordtail Orchid!

635
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Swordtail Orchid!

636
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,160
Daffodil!

637
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,400
Daffodil!

638
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,720
Jasmine!

639
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,360
Jasmine!

640
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,760
That's all

641
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,160
for today's etiquette.

642
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
When you go back,

643
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
train hard.

644
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,240
Envoy Apricot will test you one by one.

645
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,560
Yes.

646
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,680
Yes.

647
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,520
Hongning,

648
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,640
aren't you tired?

649
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,280
Not at all.

657

Who's making a racket?

658
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,360
It's you, Sir!

659
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,719
Why are you still here?

660
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,600
I'm staying for the Celestial Floralia.

661
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Look, I just got the Invitation.

662
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,000
From Envoy Apricot?

663
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,560
Yes.

664
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,280
Who taught you to speak in that strange manner?

665
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,679
Isn't this the proper pronunciation

666
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,080
for the Celestial Floralia?

667
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,880
I just learned it.

668
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,960
From whom?

669
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,240
They were having class over there.

670
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,600
I listened in on the side.

671
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,360
Hold still.

672
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,840
Go wash off those eyebrows.

673
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,000
No need, no need!

674
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,280
I'll do it myself later.

675
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,080
Thanks!

676
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,680
Your robe doesn't fit.

677
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,640
Wow, amazing!

678
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,440
Follow me.

679
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,000
Coming!

680
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,200
This way.

681
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,400
Here?

682
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,440
A little bit closer..

683
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,040
Alright.

684
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,360
Official Chrysanthemum,

685
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,920
what are you doing over there?

686
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,600
I...

687
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,120
I've got water boiling on furnace.

688
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,240
I forgot to tend to it.

689
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,320
I'll go back right away!

690
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,560
Stop!

691
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,800
I ordered you to take her for punishment.

692
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,000
Where exactly did you take her?

693
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,760
Sir,

694
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,720
she doesn't even know lightning-protection spells.

695
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,720
What if she got struck dead?

696
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,680
Don't let me see your face.

697
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:16,960
I'm leaving.

698
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,480
I...

699
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,960
Be careful!

700
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,320
-Don't fall.
-Alright, alright!

701
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,160
I'm going!

702
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,280
Done.

703
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,320
How come you can't even draw brows?

704
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm not talented in this.

705
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,320
We never practiced such things before.

706
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,160
Give it to me.

707
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,480
Stop moving.

708
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,440
What's wrong?

709
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,880
I...

710
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,000
I think my heart's racing a little.

711
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,520
Heart palpitations?

712
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,360
You know medicine?

713
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,160
A little.

714
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,480
Then check it for me... will you?
