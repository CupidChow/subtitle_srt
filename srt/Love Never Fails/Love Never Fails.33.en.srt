[English subtitles are available]

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,250
[Love Never Fails]

3
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,750
[EP33]

4
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,400
My respects, Father, Mother.

5
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,720
You're getting bold.

6
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,160
You're not the Monarch yet!

7
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
I intervened NCR internal war

8
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,000
without permission,

9
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,080
breaking the heaven rules.

10
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,960
I'll take the punishment.

11
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,280
You think

12
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,480
that's enough?

13
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,000
Every time

14
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,920
you act on impulse,

15
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,520
go off on your own,

16
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,760
and offer to take the blame.

17
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,160
How many punishments are enough?

18
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Your term as Floral Deity ends soon, and

19
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,400
the coronation's just around the corner.

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,360
You're the Emperor Star!

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Yet still so reckless,

22
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
with no rules at all!

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,560
How will you rule the Celestial Realm?

24
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,680
How will you protect your subjects?

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
How will you keep peace?

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,040
I was wrong.

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,400
I'll take it all

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,240
on myself.

29
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,640
Your Majesty,

30
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,800
the Floral Deity's term is ending.

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,079
We need to pick a successor.

32
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,360
Empress,

33
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,280
you decide on

34
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,680
the next Floral Deity.

35
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,880
Yes.

36
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
Luyao will soon

37
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,360
be Queen of the NCR.

38
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,120
She and Kunlun are deeply in love.

39
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,480
If they marry,

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,440
Kunlun might marry into the NCR family.

41
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,960
No way!

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,720
Kunlun is my son.

43
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,240
Luyao must marry into the Central Realm.

44
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,400
So now you remember

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,720
he's your son too?

46
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,560
Empress,

47
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,600
stop testing me.

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,040
Jinxiu keeps breaking rules,

49
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,680
and you keep letting him!

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,360
That's not favoritism?

51
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,720
Have you ever thought of Kunlun?

52
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,840
Kunlun is my son,

53
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,360
but Jinxiu

54
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,160
will and must be Monarch!

55
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,000
Your Majesty,

56
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,440
the Celestial Commander

57
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,240
fainted on the Punishment Altar!

58
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,800
Muxian.

59
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,400
His Majesty is here?

60
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,880
Where's Sir Jinxiu?

61
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,080
Is he badly hurt?

62
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,280
[Soul-binding Litany]

63
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
[can't hold back]

64
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,160
[his power anymore.]

65
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,120
Father,

66
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,640
stop wasting your power.

67
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,120
When did your true form

68
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
[start to wither]

69
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,760
[so fast?]

70
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,440
It's been like this since I

71
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,520
came back from State Wuzhang.

72
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,840
Then why hide it?

73
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,120
Why insist on taking Punishment?

74
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,280
I messed up,

75
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,320
I should pay for it.

76
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,680
But with this weak body,

77
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,640
how can you rule as Monarch?

78
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,720
Father,

79
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,400
there's something

80
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,640
I've wanted to say.

81
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,200
Go on.

82
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,160
Maybe…

83
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,960
maybe I'm not the right one

84
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,760
to take the throne.

85
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,360
Nonsense!

86
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,600
Heaven chose you!

87
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,000
[It's your fate!]

88
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,200
Focus on healing,

89
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,920
and stay in the Floralia Pavilion.

90
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,520
Yes.

91
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.

92
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,240
How is

93
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,200
the Withered Garden doing?

94
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,760
Thanks to your grace,

95
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,680
I cultivate daily

96
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
and tend to every flower.

97
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,520
Good.

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,680
Hi.

99
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,280
Does it hurt?

100
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,240
Not really.

101
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,679
I'm used to it.

102
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,240
But you did

103
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
the right thing,

104
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,679
why the punishment?

105
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,520
It's right in the Demon Realm,

106
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,880
but not in

107
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
the Central Realm.

108
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,200
Since when did you

109
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
side with demons?

110
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,040
They're living beings too,

111
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,720
not at fault.

112
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,200
Just because of an unchangeable origin,

113
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
they're forced to dance on the edge

114
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,520
of life and death by other realms.

115
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,000
What did they do wrong?

116
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,920
I may not have the power

117
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,400
to change everything.

118
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,040
But saving a few

119
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,440
is still something.

120
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
You'll get hurt doing this.

121
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,640
It's fine.

122
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,720
With quiet cultivation,

123
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
I'll get better.

124
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,720
Let me help.

125
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,000
You already gave

126
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,360
away all your energy

127
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
to Time Immortal to find me.

128
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,720
Don't waste more

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,160
on me.

130
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,400
But you're badly hurt,

131
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,760
I just want to help.

132
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,720
If it eases your pain, it's worth it.

133
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,360
Actually,

134
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,160
there's another way.

135
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,920
What is it?

136
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,680
Just come see me every day,

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,880
and look after me,

138
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,040
I'll recover in no time.

139
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,600
All these years,

140
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,680
you've really changed a lot.

141
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,280
Why do you say that?

142
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,960
Back when you were a camellia pixie,

143
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,640
you'd message me through the blue bird

144
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,800
with only two short words on them:

145
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,040
You there?

146
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
I didn't get it back then,

147
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,800
so I never replied.

148
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,640
Now that I think about it.

149
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,080
Those simple words

150
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,720
were your way of saying you missed me.

151
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,960
If I could go back,

152
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,960
I'd write back with all my heart,

153
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,440
saying I'm always there for you.

154
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
If you hadn't brought it up,

155
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,200
I might've forgotten

156
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,480
what I used to be like.

157
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,720
If you miss me,

158
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,280
just let me know,

159
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,560
don't keep it to yourself.

160
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,680
Alright?

161
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,680
Alright.

162
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,920
Keep this up,

163
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,520
and you won't last long.

164
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,680
You still dare come here.

165
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,080
What do I have to fear now?

166
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,120
He just took the thunder punishment,

167
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,120
and I've got the Unicorn Blade.

168
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,720
Taking his life

169
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,920
would be effortless.

170
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,680
Touch him and see!

171
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,400
You not afraid to die?

172
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,560
Since when have I ever been?

173
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,680
With my power now,

174
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,000
I can fight Floralia Palace.

175
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,040
If you turn back now,

176
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,960
there's still time.

177
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,000
No way.

178
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,920
But if your Sir finds out

179
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,680
about this Heart Seal,

180
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,440
you think he'll still believe in

181
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,400
your love for him?

182
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
He'll definitely think

183
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,480
you deceived him,

184
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,640
that your love was

185
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
never pure to begin with.

186
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,280
Hongning,

187
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,000
you chose this.

188
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,520
Heard His Majesty said

189
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,200
Muxian Fairy

190
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,240
has done well tending the Withered Garden,

191
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,560
and has been caring for
the Celestial Commander daily.

192
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,200
Yes.

193
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,560
Word is Muxian knows

194
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,320
some healing herb tricks,

195
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,640
and lately Sir Jinxiu

196
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,920
looks much better.

197
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,120
Sounds

198
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
very good.

199
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,560
[Then I'll play along,]

200
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,840
[let's see what tricks you camellia pixie]

201
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,120
[still have.]

202
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
Bad mood?

203
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Now

204
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,760
you're being sweet to me?

205
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,520
Actually,

206
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,280
it's nothing big.

207
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,560
I just gave Mother

208
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,480
some snacks and Blossom Brew I made,

209
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,040
[feeling]

210
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,840
[a bit nervous.]

211
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,040
Did you mess it up again?

212
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,440
Well, last time you made it for me,

213
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,320
it honestly didn't taste good.

214
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,720
You still ate it though.

215
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,680
Now I get how the Empress felt.

216
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,240
Are you making fun of me?

217
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,920
You've already won so many hearts,

218
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
don't get greedy.

219
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,240
True that.

220
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,280
I've got you,

221
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,600
that's more than enough.

222
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,880
[Muxian!]

223
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,640
Muxian!

224
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,800
Take the decree!

225
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,480
Your appointment

226
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,120
from the Empress!

227
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,280
[By decree of the Empress,]

228
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,880
[Muxian Fairy]

229
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,640
[helped State Wuzhang,]

230
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,840
[saved countless lives,]

231
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,360
[and took back the Emperor Star.]

232
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,160
[Your virtuous deeds shine bright.]

233
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,680
[Now you're appointed as Lord of Floralia Palace,]

234
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,440
[keeper of the Scepter,]

235
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,240
[and ruler of all flora in all realms.]

236
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,280
[From this day forth,]

237
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,520
[you shall serve as Floral Deity]

238
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,240
[and host the next Celestial Floralia]

239
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,160
[to bring glory to Floralia.]

240
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,200
Take the decree!

241
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,480
I'm off then.

242
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,480
Bye.

243
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,640
I thought the successor

244
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,640
would be Envoy Plum.

245
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,120
Didn't expect

246
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,800
Mother chose you instead.

247
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,800
But I'm not ready

248
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
to take on this role yet.

249
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,280
Why all of a sudden?

250
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,960
I'm swamped with duties in the Central Realm,

251
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,320
so I've been thinking of stepping down

252
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,680
as the Floral Deity.

253
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,760
This Celestial Floralia

254
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,680
is long overdue,

255
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,280
it's of great importance.

256
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I'll help all I can.

257
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,000
What's wrong?

258
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
Why so sad?

259
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,800
Why the tears?

260
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,200
The new Floral Deity

261
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,720
really cares for

262
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,680
the Flora Clan.

263
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,599
She won't treat us badly.

264
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,839
You don't get it!

265
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,720
We're not scared of the new Floral Deity.

266
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,040
We…

267
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,160
We just can't bear to see Sir Jinxiu go.

268
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,839
[Yeah, we'll miss him.]

269
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,440
Envoy Plum.

270
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,319
Sir.

271
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,640
Muxian's new role as the Floral Deity

272
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,040
was carefully decided by the Empress.

273
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,600
Still, over the years,

274
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,560
I've seen your dedication to

275
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,080
Floralia Palace.

276
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,600
You flatter me.

277
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,560
I only did my duty.

278
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,360
I hope you'll all

279
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,120
support her

280
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,560
like you did me.

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,600
Can I count on you?

282
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,640
Sir, don't worry.

283
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,880
I serve Floralia Palace,

284
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,040
no matter who's in charge,

285
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,640
I'll give it my all.

286
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,960
Me too.

287
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,320
Word of Muxian's new role

288
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,080
stirred up talk among the fairies.

289
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Sir Jinxiu must've noticed,

290
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,320
and he asked Official Chrysanthemum and Envoy Plum

291
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,520
to support her fully.

292
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,240
He planned well.

293
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,080
I'm sure they wouldn't dare refuse.

294
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,960
Muxian's no longer of the Flora Clan,

295
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,840
her taking over stirs gossip easily.

296
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,360
Sir Jinxiu promised Envoy Plum

297
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,440
she'd take over Floralia Palace.

298
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,880
She can't be happy now.

299
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,040
Everyone knows

300
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,280
Muxian is Hongning,

301
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,840
just no one

302
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,680
dares say it.

303
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,400
Still,

304
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,480
when you hide things,

305
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,880
clues always slip through.

306
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,720
What we need to do

307
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,360
is wait for her

308
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,640
to slip up.

309
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
If someone shields that liar,

310
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
ever think

311
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,440
what'll happen to them?

312
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,960
I don't know who you mean?

313
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,360
But the only one I protect

314
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,880
is my Master.

315
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,720
If that camellia pixie

316
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,160
had an ounce of sense,

317
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
why would Jinxiu

318
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,640
flaunt such a glaring flaw

319
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,960
for all to see?

320
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,040
Keep an eye on them for me,

321
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
and see

322
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,560
how they handle the gossip.

323
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,520
Yes, Master.

324
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,280
Sir.

325
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,720
Do you think

326
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,960
I should take the Floral Deity's place?

327
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,520
What do you think?

328
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,080
By birth, by rank, by skill,

329
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm not the right one.

330
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,640
But Mother's decree is out,

331
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,640
you can't turn it down.

332
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,800
But I just entered the Central Realm,

333
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,840
I'm afraid I'm not up to it,

334
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,800
I might mess it up.

335
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,240
Don't worry too much,

336
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,240
I'll have your back.

337
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,120
Muxian,

338
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,800
you rose to godhood through good deeds,

339
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,400
not born divine,

340
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,000
so you can only command through Scepter.

341
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,720
This Sacred Seal holds ancient power,

342
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,800
[it helps you to wield the Scepter.]

343
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
But keep cultivating every day,

344
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,520
one day,

345
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,200
you might still grow spiritual root.

346
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,000
[From now on,]

347
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,880
[you are Lord of Floralia Palace.]

348
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,640
Guard the Flora Clan well.

349
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,560
Thank you, Your Grace.

350
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,200
I won't let you down,

351
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,920
and protect Flora Clans.

352
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,520
At ease, everyone.

353
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,880
The heaven blessed me

354
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,800
and made me a fairy.

355
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,800
Though I lead Floralia Palace,

356
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,880
I still have

357
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,360
a lot to learn.

358
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,600
I need

359
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,720
your support and help.

360
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,880
I'll give it my all

361
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,840
to protect our Flora Clan.

362
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,440
Muxian,

363
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,600
from this day forth,

364
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,400
you will wield the Scepter.

365
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,120
Congrats, Floral Deity.

366
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,480
You may rise.

367
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,560
Yes.

368
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,720
This Celestial Floralia

369
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,440
is a millennium-once event and

370
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,800
it's coming soon.

371
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,160
Envoy Plum,

372
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,480
Envoy Wisteria,

373
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,400
and you, Orchid and Osmanthus.

374
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,400
I ask all four of you

375
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,480
to assist me in management.

376
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,760
Yes.

377
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,840
Yes.

378
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,920
Today

379
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,640
is your first day as the Floral Deity.

380
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,680
How does it feel?

381
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,240
Sir, you used to

382
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,520
nag me night and day

383
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,080
to follow the rules.

384
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,280
Back then I knew nothing

385
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,240
and made you mad.

386
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,680
Now,

387
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,240
I'm the one making the rules,

388
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,800
feels a bit strange.

389
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,720
You're one to talk.

390
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,480
Day one in Floralia Palace,

391
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,640
you snuck into the Wine Garden,

392
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,680
drank as a mop,

393
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,200
fairies steeped you like flower tea,

394
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,560
never heard of anything like that before.

395
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,440
[Name yourself, demon!]

396
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,640
I just worry

397
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,600
if I mess up,

398
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
it will implicate you.

399
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,160
Don't be afraid.

400
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,760
Floralia Palace has stood for a thousand years,

401
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,160
it runs like clockwork.

402
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,160
Plus,

403
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,720
Official Chrysanthemum and Envoy Plum

404
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,600
will help you.

405
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,600
No need to fret.

406
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,080
Good thing.

407
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,080
I've got a lot to learn

408
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,600
from them.

409
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,120
The most important thing now

410
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,320
is the Celestial Floralia.

411
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,760
If you're confused,

412
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,000
just ask me anytime.

413
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,720
It

414
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,640
will always bloom for you.

415
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,480
Heaven's on my side!

416
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,920
I am the chosen one,

417
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,920
king of all demons!

418
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,600
Greetings, Ma'am.

419
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,920
Rise.

420
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,320
Envoy Plum,

421
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,040
how's the Flower Fairy List

422
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
coming along?

423
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,480
The nominees are all here.

424
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,720
Please have a look, Ma'am.

425
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,560
Heard a dandelion survived a tribulation,

426
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,080
why isn't she on the list?

427
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,960
Dandelion?

428
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,800
I've never seen any dandelion clan.

429
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,200
This Datura

430
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,400
looks familiar.

431
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,280
She ascended

432
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,320
a thousand years ago.

433
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,200
[But she didn't bloom]

434
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,360
[at the last Celestial Floralia.]

435
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,400
[This time,]

436
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,920
[Wisteria Fairy recommended her.]

437
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,640
Hear her powers are top-tier.

438
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,320
Ziteng?

439
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,440
That whole mess with Baicha

440
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,560
was her doing, with Envoy Apricot,

441
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,920
all for selfish gain.

442
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,720
Alright,

443
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,000
go with the current list.

444
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,520
Yes.

445
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,760
And...

446
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,600
Ma'am, please order.

447
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,120
I'm new to Celestial Realm,

448
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,040
but back on Earth, I heard

449
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,880
plums bloom in frost,

450
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,640
known for their noble grace.

451
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,760
You're too kind, Ma'am.

452
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,760
[You've always had]

453
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,960
[Sir Jinxiu's trust.]

454
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,920
I gave you the Flower Fairy List

455
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,440
because I know

456
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,480
you won't be swayed,

457
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,320
you're the fairest of all.

458
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,520
I'd never dare abuse the post.

459
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,880
Thank you for the reminder, Ma'am.

460
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,400
Didn't expect Ziteng would

461
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,720
even meddle with the Flower Fairy List.

462
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
Ziteng became an envoy,

463
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,560
in charge of training and guiding

464
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,400
new floral immortals in Celestial Realm,

465
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,400
had plenty of clout,

466
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,040
and was close to the Empress.

467
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,800
Envoy Plum

468
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,640
didn't dare say a word.

469
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,360
Baicha got hurt

470
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,600
all 'cause of Ziteng and Envoy Apricot's

471
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,680
schemes.

472
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,960
Didn't expect Envoy Plum to turn out the same,

473
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,960
what a letdown.

474
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Look at you.

475
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,640
Thought you changed.

476
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,040
Turns out, same old you.

477
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,360
What's that supposed to mean?

478
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,440
Well,

479
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,520
the old camellia pixie

480
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,080
was fearless

481
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,680
and goofy.

482
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,160
Now,

483
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,120
you're calmer,

484
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,480
but deep down,

485
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,600
you are still the wild

486
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,080
and bold red camellia.

487
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,160
I told you, I'm not her!

488
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,840
Right,

489
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,000
of course you're not.

490
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,320
Let me say something,

491
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,080
but promise you won't get mad.

492
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,720
Go on.

493
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,880
That old red camellia,

494
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,400
sure, she was dumb and rash.

495
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,400
But,

496
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,320
she's got a heart pure as gold,

497
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,400
rare to find in any world.

498
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,320
[That heart of hers]

499
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,320
[is priceless, I swear!]

500
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,560
I just hope

501
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,560
she never throws away

502
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,760
such a rare gem.

503
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,280
A pure heart's touching,

504
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,360
but it's fragile too,

505
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,800
can't guard itself,

506
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,320
let alone others.

507
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,640
I get it.

508
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,640
You've still gotta protect

509
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,040
Sir Jinxiu.

510
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,840
Greetings, Sir Jinxiu,

511
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,960
Sir Kunlun.

512
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,000
Ma'am Muxian.

513
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,120
I go way back with Floralia Palace.

514
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,120
Ma'am Muxian

515
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,640
is not like some people

516
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,400
who kicked me out

517
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,680
before I even stepped in!

518
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,400
You flattered me, Sir.

519
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,400
Now that we're all seated,

520
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,640
let the Celestial Floralia begin.

521
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,000
Envoy Plum,

522
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,760
serve the wine.

523
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,280
[Serve Blossom Brew.]

524
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,000
Thank you for the wine, Ma'am.

525
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,560
It's been a thousand years

526
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,400
since the last Celestial Floralia.

527
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,000
This time,

528
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,760
I'll revise the Flower Fairy List

529
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,160
based on today's bloom.

530
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,000
[The rise and fall of the Flora Clan]

531
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,040
[lies in your daily cultivation.]

532
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,280
So I hope

533
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,760
no matter the results,

534
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,600
you'll keep cultivating hard

535
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,880
[and pushing yourselves.]

536
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,560
Sounds like something you'd say.

537
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,560
So chatty.

538
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,320
Envoy Plum,

539
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,760
begin the selection.

540
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,240
Yes.

541
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,720
Blossoms offering begins.

542
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,000
[The azalea clan]

543
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,040
[offers their blossoms.]

544
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,440
Greetings,

545
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,800
Ma'am.

546
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,080
The rose clan

547
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,120
offers their blossoms.

548
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,239
Greetings, Ma'am.

549
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,719
[The datura clan]

550
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,760
[offers their blossoms.]

551
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,239
Greetings,

552
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,760
Ma'am.

553
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,840
You may rise.

554
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,440
[Protect Ma'am!]

555
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
Why fighting?

556
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,440
You okay?

557
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,920
Why me?

558
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,320
You're the one I came for!

559
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,280
What grudge do we have?

560
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,960
For a thousand years,

561
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,720
I've always behave myself,

562
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,200
afraid of making the slightest mistake!

563
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,040
This Celestial Floralia

564
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,720
is my chance to make a clean break!

565
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,960
But by what right are you the Floral Deity?

566
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Why should you choose?

567
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,800
Ma'am Muxian was chosen by the Empress.

568
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Are you dissatisfied?

569
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,800
Putting on this pretentious act,

570
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,400
she thinks I won't recognize her?

571
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,640
[You ask what grudge we have?]

572
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,120
You should remember

573
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,920
you and I entered Floralia Palace together.

574
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,000
[I endured countless hardships,]

575
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,120
[suffered thunder punishment,]

576
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,120
almost losing my life

577
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,880
to ascend and obtain my immortal register!

578
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,200
[But you, a little pixie]

579
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,640
[who hasn't even earned an immortal register,]

580
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,040
[can rely on]

581
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,440
[Sir Jinxiu's grace]

582
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,640
[to act wantonly in Floralia Palace!]

583
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,640
[I really envy you,]

584
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,600
[being liked by Sir Jinxiu.]

585
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,680
[Unlike me,]

586
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,800
[doing dirty and tiring work.]

587
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,120
[If only I could be like you.]

588
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,440
[Here, take this!]

589
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,440
[It's really good!]

590
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
[So it's you.]

591
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,440
You've brought turmoil to Floralia Palace,

592
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,160
causing chaos in the Celestial Realm,

593
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,600
you caused Sir Jinxiu to descend for trials!

594
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,760
You owe countless lives for this!

595
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,320
You think, with your new identity,

596
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,360
everything in the past will be forgotten?

597
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
[I've aspired to be on the Flower Fairy List.]

598
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,800
and cultivated for a thousand years,

599
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
waiting for the next Celestial Floralia.

600
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,960
Finally, the day came,

601
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,000
and why should you decide my fate?

602
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,520
Why?

603
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,240
Muxian saved thousands of lives in Wuzhang,

604
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,680
that's why she ascended.

605
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,560
How dare you speak against her?

606
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,160
Saved thousands of lives?

607
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,240
If she hadn't descended,

608
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,080
there might have been no disaster at all!

609
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,680
[Wherever she goes,]

610
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,080
[trouble follows!]

611
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,600
[If she becomes the Floral Deity,]

612
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,800
it will surely bring disaster to the Palace!

613
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,720
Nonsense!

614
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,320
[Guards, take her away!]

615
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,440
How could someone with such

616
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,000
malicious intent pass your selection,

617
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,760
be on the Celestial Floralia's candidate list,

618
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,160
and even receive the Floralia Invitation?

619
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,880
It's my negligence.

620
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,080
Mother,

621
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,040
[the assassin is in custody.]

622
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,720
Let's not rush to blame Muxian.

623
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,800
[She's also a victim!]

624
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,320
[Mother,]

625
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,960
what Sir Kunlun said is right.

626
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,080
It's important to hold those accountable,

627
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,640
but also to trace the roots of the matter.

628
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,680
Mother, please

629
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,400
allow us to question Datura.

630
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,720
I appointed Muxian

631
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,720
out of consideration for your close bond with her

632
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,520
and her effort to take care of you.

633
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,320
[But on her first Celestial Floralia,]

634
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,640
[she caused such a big mess.]

635
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,800
Can't I blame?

636
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,200
Your Grace, I'll accept the punishment.

637
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,480
Are you involved in this?

638
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,480
Datura has been brooding over her failure

639
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,880
in the selection a thousand years ago,

640
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,960
[and I knew about it,]

641
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,040
[but didn't pay enough attention.]

642
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,200
[That's what drove her down this dangerous path,]

643
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,360
[resulting in this mess.]

644
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,160
[During my time in charge of Floralia Palace,]

645
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,280
I failed to guide her onto the right path,

646
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,320
[which is my first sin.]

647
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,080
[Knowing that she harbored resentment,]

648
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,800
I still foolishly sent out

649
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,880
the Floralia Invitation,

650
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,480
which is my second sin.

651
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,920
[I was in fear,]

652
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,560
[unable to face my own mistakes,]

653
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,760
and failed to admit them in the first place,

654
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,720
which is my third sin.

655
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,560
[Please punish me, Your Grace.]

656
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,840
Everything you said

657
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,000
is true,

658
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,920
but it still doesn't explain why

659
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,200
she accused Muxian of

660
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,400
[being the camellia pixie.]

661
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,320
I may have misled her.

662
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,800
I wasn't happy about Muxian

663
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
becoming the Floral Deity,

664
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,640
[so I complained to her.]

665
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,880
[But she was out of her mind,]

666
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,240
and what she said can't be taken seriously!

667
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,680
Jinxiu,

668
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,440
you've really made Floralia Palace lively.

669
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,320
If Datura's words are true,

670
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,280
you've chosen the wrong person.

671
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,040
Datura did try to

672
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,400
assassinate the Floral Deity,

673
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,520
her immortal register shall be revoked,

674
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,480
and she is to be cast into Kylin Lair.

675
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,440
Jinxiu,

676
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,400
what do you think?

677
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,280
Mother,

678
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,560
I'll help Ma'am Muxian

679
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,720
reform Floralia Palace.

680
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,160
[I won't let this]

681
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,120
[happen again.]

682
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,320
Muxian was negligent

683
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,880
in her duties,

684
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,080
and she'll be punished.

685
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,080
[Jinxiu,]

686
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,160
don't be too protective.

687
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,960
I understand.

688
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,600
Greetings, Sir.

689
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,960
Envoy Plum,

690
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,400
thank you

691
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,480
about today.

692
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,920
What do you mean, Sir?

693
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,560
I don't follow.

694
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,400
I know you took the blame

695
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,400
only to protect Muxian.

696
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,320
You didn't have to.

697
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,160
Now she's sealed in the Floral Scroll,

698
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,040
and you're stuck in the Withered Garden.

699
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,840
I dragged you into this.

700
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,240
Sir, you give me

701
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,720
too much credit.

702
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,080
I just didn't want

703
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,960
harsher punishment.

704
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,120
You said today

705
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,560
you weren't happy with Muxian

706
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,080
becoming the Floral Deity.

707
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,600
That's my lack of cultivation.

708
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,080
[After all this,]

709
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,920
I see I'm not fit

710
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,840
to be the Floral Deity.

711
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,760
Envoy Plum,

712
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
I want to ask you something.

713
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,080
Please do, Sir.

714
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,600
When you wrote Datura's name

715
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,600
on the Flower Fairy List,

716
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,520
was it really just wishful thinking?
