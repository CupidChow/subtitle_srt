[Love Never Fails]
[EP11]

3
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,600
Where

4
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,200
have you been lately?

5
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,360
I've been sending you messages through the spirit bird,

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,240
but you never wrote back.

7
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
Every time you message me,

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,680
it's just a simple "are you there?"

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,360
What would you want me to reply?

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,720
I didn't want to bother you.

11
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,400
I was hoping for you to say:

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,880
"I'm here."

13
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,960
Then I would continue thinking of you.

14
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,640
I never left.

15
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,320
Have you been thinking about me?

16
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,280
What about you?

17
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,280
I think about you every single day.

18
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,440
No wonder your cultivation

19
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,120
has been going backwards

20
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,640
instead of forwards.

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,200
Starting tomorrow, focus on your practice.

22
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,480
Am I hopeless?

23
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,280
My progress is so slow...

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,960
When will I ever be worthy

25
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,640
of becoming your empress?

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,160
The spiritual journey

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,280
is an uphill battle.

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,079
There are no shortcuts.

29
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,040
But I feel like

30
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,280
I can't do anything right.

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,400
Really? Because I heard recently

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,080
a certain little camellia from my palace

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,920
worked wonders in the Withered Garden,

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,080
bringing some bluebells back to life.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,000
And wasn't it the same little flower

36
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
who stayed up day and night

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,400
taking care of the Rosa Fairy

38
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,120
when she fell ill?

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,200
That's why she recovered so soon.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,960
You knew about all of this?

41
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,040
Of course.

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
How could I not keep an eye

43
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,920
on my precious little camellia?

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,520
But I still wish to pass my trials

45
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,200
before the season of falling petals.

46
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,840
Take your time.

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,200
Focus on your practice.

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,520
After this season passes,

49
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,000
there will be another,

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,160
and another after that.

51
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,079
I'll be here waiting for you.

52
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,800
I can't believe someone so perfect

53
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,800
exists in this realm!

54
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,560
Well,

55
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,880
I do try my best

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,920
to keep accurate records...

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
His Divine Highness

58
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
is simply perfect!

59
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh...you weren't talking about me?

60
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,840
Never mind...

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,640
Please continue...

62
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,760
My lord,

63
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,800
I've been working day and night,

64
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400
but my cultivation level barely grows.

65
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,440
Why is that?

66
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,560
Every immortal

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,520
has walked this path before.

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,800
There's no shortcut.

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,880
My lord,

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,159
aren't you the greatest historian of all?

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,920
You must know all the secrets!

72
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,120
Can you share any tips

73
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,120
for fast-tracking to immortality?

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,280
I certainly know,

75
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
but it's not for me to share.

76
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,520
Yeah right. Can't tell me?

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,200
More like you don't know anything!

78
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,240
Just pretending to be some wise old sage.

79
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,120
You doubt...

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,320
you doubt ME?

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,640
What are you implying?

82
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Is there anything that I'm not aware of?

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,880
Fine then! I'll tell you!

84
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,040
It's the forbidden arts from Mt. Baizhou.

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,800
Mt. Baizhou?

86
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,600
Me and my big mouth!

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,480
Um...

88
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,880
Yeah, I left a potion brewing...

89
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,960
I better go check on that...

90
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,360
Hey, thanks a lot!

91
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,360
There is such a forbidden art that

92
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,840
can summon the tribulation ahead of time.

93
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,320
However, in all my centuries,

94
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,080
I've never seen anyone survive it.

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,720
One wrong move and you'll be

96
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,560
dust in the wind.

97
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,240
Hongning,

98
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,200
you must not risk your life on this.

99
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,880
Yes, I understand.

100
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Thank you for your wisdom!

101
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,080
By the divine grace, I, Hongning,

102
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,080
humbly request the millennium tribulation.

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
May the Thunder God grant my request.

104
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,920
By the divine grace, I, Hongning,

105
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,840
humbly request the millennium tribulation.

106
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,760
Hongning!

107
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,360
Are you crazy?

108
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,680
Challenging the trial before you're ready

109
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,960
will only make it deadlier.

110
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,120
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

111
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,159
Have faith in me.

112
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,040
I survived the last tribulation, didn't I?

113
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,159
I'll get through this one too.

114
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
But what if something goes wrong?

115
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,760
Hongning, you saved my life.

116
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
I can't just stand here

117
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
and watch you throw yours away!

118
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,280
Ever since my earliest memories,

119
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,480
my heart has yearned for Sir Jinxiu.

120
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,400
He means everything to me.

121
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,320
For someone so precious to me,

122
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,880
I must do whatever it takes.

123
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,840
Must do whatever it takes...

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,640
for someone I hold precious...

125
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,760
One day when you find someone precious,

126
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,840
you'll understand.

127
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,640
I've already summoned the tribulation.

128
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,600
You should leave now.

129
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,400
I have to

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,840
do whatever it takes

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,240
for the one precious to me, right?

132
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,600
Hongning,

133
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,880
don't you see?

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
You're that someone to me.

135
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,200
Not another step!

136
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,960
Demon!

137
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,040
You were banished from the realm.

138
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,640
How dare you trespass!

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,360
Please, I need to speak with Sir Jinxiu.

140
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,480
What madness is this?

141
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Sir Jinxiu isn't someone you can meet!

142
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,560
My message is

143
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,760
utmost importance!

144
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,680
If not him,

145
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,320
please let me speak with Sir Kunlun,

146
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,360
Lord Chrysanthemum,

147
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,120
or even Envoy Plum!

148
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,320
Cease this foolishness!

149
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,440
Leave immediately,

150
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,720
or face the consequences!

151
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,720
I...

152
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,120
Demon,

153
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,440
how dare you show your face here?

154
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,360
Envoy Plum...

155
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,080
How dare you set foot in the Floralia Palace!

156
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,559
Apologies, Envoy Plum.

157
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,240
I'm driven here by

158
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,000
desperate circumstances.

159
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,520
The matter simply couldn't wait...

160
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,120
Seize this intruder at once!

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,960
What is it?

162
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,200
Apricot, leave us.

163
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,200
But...

164
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,160
Go ahead.

165
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,840
I beg you,

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,480
please ask Sir Jinxiu to save Hongning.

167
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
Save her?

168
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,240
She's summoned the tribulation ahead of time,

169
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,680
hoping to ascend sooner.

170
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,480
The trial is approaching,

171
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,320
and only he can save her now.

172
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,160
Why should he

173
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
interfere with Hongning's trial?

174
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,920
It's...

175
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,440
Because she is facing this trial for him.

176
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,200
Silence!

177
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,240
Do you know how dangerous your implications are?

178
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,120
Please, Hongning is...

179
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,040
Speak of this no more.

180
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,200
Depart from here immediately,

181
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,200
or

182
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,560
I'll have you thrown into the prison.

183
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,080
Baicha.

184
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,360
My lady...

185
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,320
She wouldn't help you.

186
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,760
Let me help you.

187
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,360
You'll help me?

188
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,480
About what happened before...

189
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,440
Though His Divine Highness punished me,

190
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,880
I don't believe I was wrong.

191
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,120
I did interfere with your path to immortality.

192
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,960
Consider this

193
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,840
my way of making amends.

194
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,760
Then...

195
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,440
could you help me reach Sir Jinxiu?

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,720
Certainly.

197
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,480
But he isn't here now.

198
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll take you to the Midheaven.

199
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,240
You've gone to such lengths to reach here,

200
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,760
all to beg him to save that pixie?

201
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,480
Your Divine Highness,

202
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,440
I know I was banished from the realm,

203
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,240
and trespassing here is a grave offense.

204
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,360
I'll accept any punishment.

205
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,520
I only pray

206
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,400
Sir Jinxiu will see her.

207
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,640
Hongning is a stubborn girl.

208
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,680
None but him

209
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,880
can stop her.

210
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,920
What could she have possibly done

211
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,560
to make you risk everything to save her?

212
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,000
I grew up as an orphan.

213
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,720
Hongning saved me.

214
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
When others bullied me, she stood up for me.

215
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
Only she showed me true kindness.

216
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,200
So,

217
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,560
I must return that kindness.

218
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,320
The depth of your bond

219
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
is deeply moving.

220
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,280
Unfortunately, this story

221
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,160
shall remain known only to me.

222
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,120
Your Divine Highness...

223
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,360
Your Divine Highness!

224
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,400
Sir Jinxiu's wedding approaches.

225
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
We cannot allow a lowly pixie

226
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
to create such chaos.

227
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,840
Should this become known,

228
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,640
what of our realm's honor?

229
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,440
Baicha,

230
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,960
bury this

231
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,560
deep in your heart.

232
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,880
Your violation of the law is unforgivable.

233
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,160
Guards!

234
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,280
Take him to the Kylin Lair!

235
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,280
Your Divine Highness!

236
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,440
I was ignorant of the truth.

237
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,560
Baicha kept insisting

238
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,240
it concerned the realm,

239
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,600
so I had no choice but to bring him here.

240
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,480
I beg your forgiveness!

241
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
I understand

242
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,800
your good intentions.

243
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
But this involves the Celestial Monarch.

244
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,440
It seems this trial of love

245
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,800
cannot be avoided after all.

246
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,640
Perhaps...

247
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,400
we could imprison that pixie in there too?

248
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,600
You have much to learn about love.

249
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,240
The more one tries to obstruct it,

250
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,640
the stronger it grows.

251
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,320
To resolve love's complications,

252
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,440
one must flow with its current.

253
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,640
What does Your Divine Highness suggest?

254
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,120
Let it be.

255
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,200
Since Hongning cannot meet him,

256
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,000
this thing ends here.

257
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,720
You've done your duty well.

258
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,040
Go and await your reward.

259
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,800
If you're not pursuing action against her...

260
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,520
should we

261
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,320
still inform His Divine Majesty?

262
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,640
I shall

263
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,720
handle it myself.

264
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,520
Understood.

265
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,520
I'll take my leave.

266
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,160
[For bringing Baicha to the realm without permission,]

267
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,800
[Apricot is hereby]

268
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,880
[stripped of her divine status.]

269
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Let me go!

270
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Your Divine Highness,

271
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,000
His Divine Majesty requests your presence.

272
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,640
Ningmeng!

273
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,280
Hongning, welcome back.

274
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,360
Hongning,

275
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,160
Baicha told us

276
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,200
about your tribulation.

277
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,720
You're not going anywhere today.

278
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,720
It's too late.

279
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,240
I've already summoned it.

280
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,080
Leave now,

281
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,520
before the divine lightning strikes.

282
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,400
Not happening!

283
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
Last time, if it weren't for us,

284
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,880
you'd have been struck down.

285
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
You've barely recovered

286
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,280
from your last trial,

287
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,280
and now this?

288
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,440
Do you have a death wish?

289
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,240
My cultivation has

290
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,640
made me different from before.

291
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,400
Have faith in me.

292
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,160
Not a chance!

293
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,400
No matter how much stronger you are now,

294
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,280
you're still the little camellia we raised.

295
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,840
We'll shield you from anything.

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,720
Let the heavens throw what they will!

297
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,640
These lightning trials?

298
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,720
We've got your back!

299
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,880
No, you don't get it.

300
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,600
This trial is far more severe than before.

301
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,080
You won't survive it.

302
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,800
Ha! Divine lightning? Big deal!

303
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,040
Truth is,

304
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,280
I could've ascended long ago, just never fancied it.

305
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,080
With my moves,

306
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,520
that cute little lightning

307
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,720
won't even...

308
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,080
Ningmeng!

309
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,640
Ningmeng!

310
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,320
Oh my!

311
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,400
Ningmeng!

312
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,440
-Look after him!
-Hongning!

313
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,400
Hongning, wait!

314
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,160
Greetings, father.

315
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,440
The oracles have spoken.

316
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
In three days,

317
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,600
you shall wed the Matriarch

318
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,120
of the Northern Celestial Realm.

319
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,000
Father,

320
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,080
I must respectfully decline.

321
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,800
I shall take my leave.

322
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,840
Father!

323
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,520
I've bound you with the Golden Lotus Dew.

324
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,840
You have no choice in this union.

325
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,920
Father!

326
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
Remain here

327
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,680
and reflect on your defiance.

328
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,200
The restraints will lift

329
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,360
once you come to your senses.

330
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,600
Father!

331
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,960
[Hongning is in danger. ]

332
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,720
[I must save her.]

333
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,000
Hongning!

334
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,840
Your Divine Highness...

335
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,680
Forgive me...

336
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,080
Your Divine Highness...

337
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,800
I am still...

338
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,120
not strong enough for the trial...

339
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Hongning, fear not.

340
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,280
I won't let you fade away!

341
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,400
Your Majesty,

342
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,320
Jinxiu's been kneeling for three days,

343
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,360
all to refuse the marriage.

344
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,360
Father,

345
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,320
I volunteer to renounce my divine status

346
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,400
and serve as guardian of the realm's borders.

347
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,880
You are the Floral Deity of our realm,

348
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,560
heir to my throne.

349
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,360
Yet you'd rather be

350
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,720
a simple guardian of Mt. Misty?

351
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,040
Your Majesty, please grant me this request.

352
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,840
Very well then.

353
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,720
Father!

354
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,920
You have no say

355
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,440
in this marriage.

356
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,440
I'll erase your awareness.

357
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,400
That should end your resistance!

358
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,160
Hongning!

359
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,080
You're back with us!

360
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,760
Shaoyao...

361
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,800
Easy there.

362
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,760
Shaoyao...

363
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,320
Did I survive the trial?

364
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,600
Hongning...

365
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,160
you're alright now,

366
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
you'd better leave now.

367
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,960
I made it through the trial.

368
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,080
I can stay at the Floralia Palace now!

369
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,920
What's with you?

370
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,360
Behold, Jinxiu, the Celestial Monarch!

371
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
[Hongning,]

372
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,200
[the royal wedding between Sir Jinxiu]

373
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,280
[and the NCR Matriarch is being held today.]

374
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,760
[Please stay strong.]

375
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,440
Behold, the Matriarch of the Northern Celestial Realm!

376
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,920
Let it be known that

377
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
on this blessed day,

378
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,360
Jinxiu and Luyao

379
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,760
shall be united in divine marriage!

380
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,320
What seems to be the problem?

381
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,600
Forgive me,

382
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,240
but the sacred thread...

383
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,400
it refuses to bind to his ring finger.

384
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,640
I fail to see the problem.

385
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,200
If one finger won't do,

386
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,320
try another!

387
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,960
It must be tied to the ring finger.

388
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,160
It symbolizes eternal union.

389
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,600
This is the sacred tradition in our realm.

390
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,280
Enough!

391
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,840
Let's not delay the auspicious occasion over this.

392
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
If the northern realm

393
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,760
doesn't share this custom,

394
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,840
we shall skip it.

395
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,880
Yes, Your Divine Majesty.

396
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,440
[Present the empress's seal!]

397
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,520
Sir Jinxiu!

398
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,720
Insolent girl!

399
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,280
How dare you disrupt this divine ceremony!

400
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,280
Little fairy,

401
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,200
today is the wedding of the Floral Deity.

402
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,480
In celebration,

403
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
we've allowed lesser immortals like yourself

404
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,000
to share the joy.

405
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,880
Come,

406
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,280
take the mead and find your place.

407
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,640
Sir Jinxiu,

408
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
you told me...

409
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,440
you would never wed the Matriarch...

410
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,600
Outrageous!

411
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,680
Sir Jinxiu,

412
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,440
who is this little fairy?

413
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,680
Sir Jinxiu...

414
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Isn't she the newly ascended camellia pixie?

415
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,360
She's trying to steal Sir Jinxiu from his bride!

416
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,080
My, Sir Jinxiu certainly has many admirers...

417
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,760
This little fairy is delusional,

418
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,040
thinking she could marry him.

419
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,400
Of course he would choose the Matriarch!

420
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,000
There were whispers of this,

421
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,560
but these things are best left unspoken...

422
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,720
I came today

423
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,440
to offer my blessings

424
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,880
to Sir Jinxiu and his bride.

425
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,880
I understand that

426
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
to be the Divine Empress,

427
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
one must possess noble lineage,

428
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,800
superior talent,

429
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,880
and sublime cultivation.

430
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,720
The Matriarch is destined for this role.

431
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Only she is

432
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,320
worthy to wed Sir Jinxiu.

433
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,760
I, Hongning,

434
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,440
wish you both

435
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,480
eternal harmony

436
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,080
and undying love.

437
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,040
Jinxiu!

438
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,000
Sir Jinxiu!

439
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,840
Golden Lotus Dew...

440
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,280
how did it vanish from within you?

441
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
I'll remove her at once!

442
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,400
Golden Lotus Dew...

443
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,000
A drop of it takes ten millennia to form...

444
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,640
in the body of such a lowly immortal?

445
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,480
Your Majesty,

446
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,400
is this how you honor

447
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,720
our realm's betrothal gift?

448
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,000
You insulted the Northern Celestial Realm!

449
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,240
Calm yourself, King of the North,

450
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,320
This shall be resolved.

451
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,760
How could she retain the dew?

452
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,200
Such foolishness!

453
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,360
Guards!

454
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,720
Seize Hongning!

455
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,400
Throw her into the Demotion Pool.

456
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,520
Recover the Golden Lotus Dew!

457
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,679
None shall harm her

458
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,239
while I draw breath!

459
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,600
Seize him and bring him back!

460
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,720
Hongning, are you alright?

461
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,320
Sir Jinxiu,

462
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,640
have I disappointed you?

463
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,800
No, you haven't.

464
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Did you choose the Matriarch because

465
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,120
I failed to become a High Immortal?

466
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,520
That's not it.

467
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,960
Then it's because I practiced forbidden arts.

468
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,560
So you're upset with me?

469
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,120
No.

470
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,440
Don't worry about any of those now.

471
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,840
You must leave now.

472
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,080
I promise to explain everything later.

473
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,520
Sir Jinxiu,

474
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,920
are you alright?

475
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Never mind me.

476
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,040
Just go,

477
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,720
listen to me. Leave now!

478
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,560
I won't leave.

479
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,640
Why not?

480
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,480
The Emperor says

481
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,440
the Golden Lotus Dew is within me.

482
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,680
If you hadn't given it to me...

483
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,120
I wouldn't have survived the tribulation.

484
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,080
I would have perished.

485
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,400
What foolish talk is this?

486
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,280
If I...

487
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,800
enter the Demotion Pool...

488
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,320
the dew will be recovered, won't it?

489
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,800
No, that's madness!

490
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,000
Hongning!

491
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,880
Hongning!

492
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,720
Hongning!

493
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,960
Stop!

494
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,480
Sir Jinxiu,

495
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,080
I shall not be your Divine Empress.

496
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,040
Please take back the Golden Lotus Dew

497
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,000
and find happiness with the Matriarch.

498
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,600
Please...

499
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,920
Hongning, don't do this!

500
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Please forget me...

501
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,760
Hongning!

502
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,040
Hongning!

503
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,480
Hongning...

504
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,960
This eye of mine has

505
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,120
roamed the world for three centuries...

506
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,680
It has finally caught something truly intriguing.

507
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,520
Be careful.

508
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,720
Hands off!

509
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,080
Jinxiu is confined for reflection.

510
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,880
You won't find him here.

511
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,280
Who says I'm here for him?

512
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,840
Wasn't my humiliation

513
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,520
in the ceremonial hall enough?

514
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
If not for him,

515
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,560
are you here for me?

516
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,360
My, this weapon of yours truly stings.

517
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,160
Why didn't you dodge?

518
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,840
Jinxiu is my brother.

519
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,200
He wronged you,

520
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,440
so let me make amends in his place.

521
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,080
Stop pretending to be nice.

522
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,520
You've got what you wanted.

523
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,240
Now you can mock me.

524
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,600
What's there to mock?

525
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,480
I've never liked you since we were young.

526
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,120
You're always

527
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
putting on an act:

528
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,360
angry but pretending to be fine,

529
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,600
unhappy but maintaining proper etiquette.

530
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,560
Don't act like you understand me.

531
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,000
I simply misplaced my heart.

532
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,000
Such things

533
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,480
aren't worth my sorrow.

534
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,400
Then why are you here waiting for Jinxiu?

535
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,600
It's not your concern.

536
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,120
Sir Jinxiu,

537
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,040
you dare to show your face here?

538
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,040
The incident at the wedding

539
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,880
was solely my fault.

540
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,840
Knowing my sins are beyond forgiveness,

541
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,360
so I came to atone.

542
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,440
Sir Jinxiu,

543
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,200
did you consider our realm's dignity

544
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,560
when you broke the promise?

545
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,200
General!

546
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,640
Sir Jinxiu,

547
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,840
your actions have utterly

548
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,680
humiliated our realm.

549
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,880
You've deeply wounded my daughter.

550
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Now,

551
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,520
how do you intend to atone?

552
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,720
I'm willing to descend to lower status

553
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,160
and become a guardian at Mt. Misty,

554
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,800
watching over our borders.

555
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,600
What?

556
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,040
But what of your marriage to the Matriarch?

557
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,680
Permission to enter!

558
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,080
My King, Her Highness refuses to see anyone.

559
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,520
Go ask her again!

560
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,280
At once!

561
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,000
Sir Jinxiu,

562
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,400
surely...

563
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,880
there are clearly other solutions.

564
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:24,840
Must you...

565
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,120
go to such extremes?

566
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,160
You're the Floral Deity of your realm,

567
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:29,840
and this...

568
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,520
why put yourself through this?

569
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,120
Your Majesty,

570
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,240
my decision to atone is unshakeable.

571
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,760
I merely hope this won't

572
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,440
damage the alliance between our realms.

573
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,280
Very well.

574
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,080
If that is your choice,

575
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,600
so be it.

576
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,800
Gratitude,

577
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,360
I shall bid my farewell.

578
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,760
What's gotten into his head?

579
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,960
He'd rather renounce his status

580
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,880
than take her as his bride?

581
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,640
Your Majesty,

582
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,560
he was clearly insulting her dignity!

583
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,640
Enough!

584
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,360
Go and tell

585
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,080
the Matriarch every word

586
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,760
he just said.

587
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,800
If he doesn't have the courage to face her,

588
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,880
let her try

589
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
to change his mind.

590
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,840
At this point,

591
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,840
you still want her

592
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,680
to throw herself at him?

593
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,760
You're missing the bigger picture.

594
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,520
The Celestial Monarch

595
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,360
becoming a foot soldier?

596
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,720
Who would believe that?

597
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,760
He's clearly

598
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,720
giving us a graceful way out.

599
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,640
Our realm

600
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,440
has become everyone's doormat,

601
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,040
all because you're nothing

602
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,040
but a spineless coward!

603
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,520
Watch your tongue!

604
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,480
I'll strip you of your rank in a heartbeat!

605
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,880
With our realm in such dire straits,

606
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,160
you have no right to call yourself king!

607
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,760
This is treason!

608
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,520
Guards!

609
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,120
Guards!

610
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,520
I offered you one last chance,

611
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,320
only because

612
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,800
you're Luyao's father.

613
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,320
What a waste...

614
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,800
you didn't seize it.

615
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,680
You...you...

616
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,480
My only regret is

617
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,040
not getting rid of you sooner.

618
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,520
They're all laughing at me, aren't they?

619
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,520
My lady, the King has been assassinated!

620
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,280
You have some nerve,

621
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,760
barging into my chambers like this!

622
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,320
Your Highness, the King's been assassinated.

623
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,400
General Fox sent us to escort you

624
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,640
to the inner palace for your safety.

625
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,640
Nonsense!

626
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,320
That treacherous fox

627
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,960
is the one behind this assassination!

628
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,640
Are you choosing to side with a traitor?

629
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,560
Your Highness,

630
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,160
Lady Qijing,

631
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,840
smart people know which way the wind blows.

632
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,960
If you keep resisting,

633
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,400
we'll have to do this the hard way.

634
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,200
Take them alive!
