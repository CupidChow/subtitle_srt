[Love Never Fails]
[EP02]

3
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,330
What are you doing up there?

4
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,450
Be careful, come down.

5
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,730
Wow, small world.

6
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,690
You can't trespass here.

7
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,810
Isn't this the Flora Grove?

8
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,329
This is the Wine Garden.

9
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,530
Only senior immortals are allowed.

10
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,170
Oh, I didn't know.

11
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,690
I just

12
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,610
climbed over a wall and ended up here.

13
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,170
Please don't kick me out.

14
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,690
You brought me up here.

15
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,410
You have to keep your word.

16
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,490
You know it's not easy to get up here,

17
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,890
you should be more discreet.

18
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,090
Come down.

19
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,250
I won't kick you out.

20
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,170
Thank you, Immortal.

21
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,010
Thanks, sir.

22
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,770
[Those with ribbons on their collars]

23
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,970
[are all senior immortals.]

24
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,130
[Don't offend them again.]

25
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,050
You're not a senior?

26
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,090
Of course not.

27
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,090
Are you here to steal wine?

28
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,250
Nonsense.

29
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,050
Disheveled and untidy.

30
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,290
Weren't you taken to punishment?

31
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,290
What are you doing?

32
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,970
What kinda floral deity are you?

33
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,610
You can even control water!

34
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,170
Leave immediately.

35
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,730
What's this?

36
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,410
What?

37
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,650
Let me have a sip.

38
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,570
Stop there.

39
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,730
You've drunk some,

40
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,930
why can't I?

41
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:07,970
Let go...

42
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,610
[It's right over there.]

43
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,650
[Follow me.]

44
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,690
Look,

45
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,810
it's beautiful here, innit?

46
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,450
Someone's been here.

47
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,290
Impossible.

48
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,650
You wouldn't even be here without me.

49
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,450
What are you doing?

50
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,409
Do you want the senior immortals

51
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,890
and the Floral Deity to spot us?

52
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,090
You may not know

53
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,610
that the Floral Deity is ruthless.

54
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,250
No mercy at all.

55
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,970
If spotted, our core,

56
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,409
registration and marrow

57
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,370
would all be gone.

58
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,610
Even threw into the Kylin Lair,

59
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,130
no chance of return.

60
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,970
Who said that?

61
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,930
Everyone in Floralia Palace knows.

62
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,170
I got the news.

63
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,530
That pixie will receive 100 strikes.

64
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,650
She won't last long.

65
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,890
Serves her right.

66
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,690
[You know Lvluo,]

67
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,410
[when she's locked in the Phantom Reflector,]

68
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,050
[she cried so hard.]

69
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,930
[So what?]

70
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,250
[Haven't I suffered enough?]

71
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,770
[All these years,]

72
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,690
[I've been weeding the Flora Grove,]

73
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,890
[and helping with]

74
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,970
[the entire Floralia Palace.]

75
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,730
[Isn't that tiring?]

76
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,050
[Yet the Floral Deity shows no appreciation,]

77
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,610
[always punishing me instead.]

78
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,290
[I do feel for you.]

79
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,090
The Floral Deity said yesterday

80
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,170
the Blossom Brew was missing something.

81
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,050
Don't worry.

82
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,970
It's been brewed for centuries,

83
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,770
and has never satisfied the Floral Deity.

84
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,450
[Just being picky.]

85
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,730
[In my opinion,]

86
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,570
[it's already perfect.]

87
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,850
Exactly.

88
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,610
Why can't I tell

89
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,530
something's missing?

90
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,290
The Floral Deity is so captious.

91
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,170
[Forget it.]

92
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,170
This year's Celestial Floralia

93
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,010
invited quite a few skilled brewers.

94
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,930
Ask them for me then.

95
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,370
I will.

96
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,290
What's that?

97
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,770
Why is the flower bell placed there?

98
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,450
[What a mess.]

99
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:33,610
Let's go.

100
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,610
100 heavenly strikes?

101
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,409
Will I die after that?

102
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:50,930
No.

103
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:53,970
Good.

104
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,890
The purpose

105
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,890
is to inflict pain without death.

106
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,610
Only through suffering

107
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,490
can one truly repent.

108
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,450
I think they left.

109
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,210
You...

110
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:16,850
You...

111
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,530
What?

112
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,010
I can detect floral scents,

113
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,850
but I can't identify yours.

114
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,810
What kinda flower are you?

115
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,410
Are you not a flower?

116
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,490
Are you a weed?

117
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,450
I...

118
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,890
But you smell quite nice.

119
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,370
Stop.

120
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:51,930
How insolent!

121
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,130
How do we get out?

122
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:10,970
Sir,

123
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,730
you know teleportation too?

124
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,130
You should leave now.

125
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,130
We've known each other this long,

126
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,010
you still haven't told me

127
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,730
what kind of flower deity you are.

128
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,130
This wine...

129
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,090
Are you even listening?

130
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,690
It tastes much better now.

131
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,610
Try it.

132
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,130
Do you realize that you've broken

133
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,290
3 divine laws before meeting me?

134
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,610
Mt. Baizhou may tolerate your impudence,

135
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,930
but not here.

136
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,970
Considering your celestial potential,

137
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,330
I brought you up to face judgment,

138
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,050
escape that den of demons,

139
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,090
and cultivate enlightenment.

140
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,690
But look at you...

141
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,570
Did you beg me to bring you here

142
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,490
just to rebel and sin?

143
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,370
No!

144
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,650
I came to repay a kindness.

145
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,010
Repay?

146
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,130
When I was just a bud,

147
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,130
a flower "goddess" saved me.

148
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,010
"She" sheltered me from storms,

149
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,010
planted me on Mt. Baizhou.

150
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,330
Though my tribulations

151
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,330
were agonizing,

152
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,490
I endured, striving to grow,

153
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,890
all so one day

154
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,410
I could ascend and repay "her".

155
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,890
After all this time,

156
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,930
are you certain you remember clearly?

157
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,930
Of course I remember "her".

158
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,610
Though I might not

159
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,010
recall "her" face perfectly,

160
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,170
but I know

161
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,410
"she" bears a mark

162
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,650
on brow.

163
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,970
"She" must be

164
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,170
breathtakingly beautiful

165
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,210
and kind-hearted,

166
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,330
a very nice...

167
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,210
Goddess?

168
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,450
Alright, whatever.

169
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,290
So what, if you remember?

170
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,810
What do you plan to do?

171
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,770
Take "her" home.

172
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,890
cherish "her" for eternity.

173
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,770
Take "her" home?

174
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,570
You must be insane.

175
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,290
These

176
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,770
are wonderful.

177
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,770
So this is how immortals live. It feels nice!

178
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,650
Foolish camellia.

179
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,770
I regret ever giving you my phalanx!

180
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,850
Greetings, Sir Jinxiu.

181
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,890
Summon Official Chrysanthemum!

182
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,610
At once, Sir.

183
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,530
[Sir Jinxiu.]

184
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,050
[Coming.]

185
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,890
My dear Floral Deity.

186
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,330
I was compiling the new season's archives.

187
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,890
Rushing to meet the deadline?

188
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,050
Already finished.

189
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,730
Just proofreading.

190
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,490
Sir,

191
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,370
I brought this premium orchid grass

192
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,370
from the mortal realm,

193
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,010
perfect for your baths.

194
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,410
Not only fragrant,

195
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,530
but good for your old wounds.

196
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,490
Enjoy.

197
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,370
I ordered you to take Hongning for punishment.

198
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,410
Where did you take her?

199
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,530
Hongning?

200
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,210
I've had it arranged.

201
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,850
She's been assigned to the Flora Pavilion

202
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,250
with other minor flower immortals.

203
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,250
You pick on me again,

204
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,770
always.

205
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,210
What's wrong?

206
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,290
What demon is this?

207
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,930
Why are you steeping me?

208
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,610
Steeping?

209
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,370
Oh, my!

210
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,930
Celestial 94,000-Year Tribulation, Season 3.

211
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,850
Sir Jinxiu steeped 500-year-old camellia pixie.

212
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,930
What are you writing?

213
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:25,970
I...

214
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,570
No, wait...

215
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,130
Well...

216
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,650
Please wait...

217
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,450
wasn't writing anything.

218
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,970
I... Take it away.

219
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,330
I was just writing about steeping tea.

220
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,450
Tea!

221
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,690
You're... so impossible.

222
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,850
Just take it away.

223
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,210
C'mon.

224
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,610
Sir,

225
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,770
it's my fault.

226
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,610
I failed to supervise Hongning.

227
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,610
I made a mistake.

228
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,530
But I did ask Shaoyao

229
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,810
to watch her.

230
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,490
I'll go ask her

231
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,050
what happened exactly.

232
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,490
Hongning came for punishment.

233
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,130
In the Floralia Palace,

234
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,050
all should be treated equally.

235
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,890
Shaoyao's born careless.

236
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,730
You failed to confirm that each fairy's

237
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,010
learning the rules in the designated place.

238
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,610
Now, you're trying

239
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,890
to shift blame.

240
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,650
I dare not!

241
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:17,970
I accept full responsibility!

242
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,010
Sir.

243
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,610
This year's Floralia

244
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,450
has more newcomers than ever.

245
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,810
She has to

246
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,850
teach them etiquette

247
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,010
and oversee wine brewing.

248
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,010
She's a little overwhelmed.

249
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,330
Right, I almost forgot.

250
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,970
The wine.

251
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,370
When will it be ready?

252
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,050
If you can't complete it,

253
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,130
I'll reassign the task.

254
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,570
Starting today,

255
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,090
you'll only manage the minor immortals.

256
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,250
But I...

257
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,170
When can you finish

258
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,330
weeding the Flora Grove?

259
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,490
My apologies.

260
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,810
You can leave now.

261
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,130
Yes, Sir.

262
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,650
Sir.

263
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,450
How is she?

264
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,450
She'll be fine

265
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,170
when she wakes.

266
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,650
Sir,

267
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,730
may I speak freely?

268
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,450
Hongning

269
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,730
is after all a pixie.

270
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,370
Keeping her here might...

271
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,530
Her celestial potential is profound.

272
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,170
She'll ascend eventually.

273
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,090
Besides,

274
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,330
she used to belong here.

275
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,530
Hadn't been for me,

276
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,970
she wouldn't have become a pixie.

277
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,450
It's her?

278
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,330
Her cultivation talent is exceptional.

279
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,650
With guidance, she could achieve greatness.

280
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,450
Though now,

281
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,490
she's only a rogue immortal.

282
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,730
After the Celestial Floralia,

283
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,330
we'll see her destiny.

284
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,170
Until then,

285
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,210
watch her closely.

286
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,050
Got it.

287
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,970
Totally.

288
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,890
Do you understand?

289
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,290
I do.

290
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,570
You want me to care for her, right?

291
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,770
No frivolous records.

292
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,570
As historian,

293
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,610
I document truthfully.

294
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,650
I mean you should focus on essentials,

295
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,770
not gossip.

296
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,690
No, wait.

297
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,050
Why did you take that out again?

298
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,250
I specialize in minor figures.

299
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,410
Just take it away.

300
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,450
Please.

301
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,090
I'll obey, Sir.

302
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,250
[Welcome to the Floralia Palace.]

303
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,250
I'm Shaoyao.

304
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,810
You'll all reside here.

305
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,650
Come to me if you have any questions.

306
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,490
Alright.

307
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,569
We'll follow you from now on.

308
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,369
- Good.
- Shaoyao.

309
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,250
Envoy Apricot.

310
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,210
We'll settle this later.

311
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:19,810
Where's Hongning?

312
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,450
Find her for me right now!

313
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,849
[Hongning.]

314
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:24,930
[Hongning.]

315
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,730
Am I dry now?

316
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,170
Yes, you are.

317
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:32,930
Now, get down.

318
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,570
Let's go.

319
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,330
Hurry, hurry.

320
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,290
Hurry up!

321
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,170
Envoy Apricot.

322
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,170
How dare you, a pixie,

323
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,450
trespass the Floralia Palace?

324
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:56,930
I'm sorry.

325
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,450
I didn't mean to.

326
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,570
I just got lost.

327
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,610
Stop playing dumb.

328
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,090
A pixie indeed.

329
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,450
The palace rules are ironclad,

330
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,250
unchallenged for centuries.

331
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,130
Yet you've been causing trouble.

332
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:14,650
Shaoyao,

333
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,290
you couldn't even control a little pixie.

334
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,370
You deserve punishment with her!

335
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,730
It has nothing to do with her.

336
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,610
I wandered off myself.

337
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,330
It's not her fault.

338
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,610
You have no right to talk here!

339
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,210
Shaoyao,

340
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,290
with the Floralia approaching,

341
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,170
how could you be so negligent?

342
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,530
You'll both receive lashings!

343
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,690
I deserve to be punished.

344
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,410
Go!

345
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,170
Hongning!

346
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,130
What are you doing?

347
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,610
Stop it, Hongning.

348
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,130
How impudent!

349
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,610
Daring to defy palace rules!

350
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,050
I made a mistake, but you hit her.

351
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,170
You're

352
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,690
against my own rules.

353
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,610
So can I punish you, right?

354
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,170
You...

355
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:57,850
Outrageous!

356
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:58,890
Guards!

357
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,570
Confine her to the Phantom Reflector!

358
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,810
[What's all the noise?]

359
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,170
Official Chrysanthemum.

360
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,130
Sir.

361
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,890
You've come at the right time.

362
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,290
This Mt. Baizhou pixie

363
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,310
is talking back to us.

364
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,050
I'm gonna put her in the Phantom Reflector.

365
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,050
Envoy Apricot.

366
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,570
Shaoyao does have responsibility that

367
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,690
this camellia pixie got lost.

368
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,410
But flagellation seems too much

369
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,490
for the punishment.

370
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,410
Sir,

371
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,410
Sir Jinxiu authorized me

372
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,250
to manage all juniors in the Palace.

373
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,730
So, it seems that

374
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,130
I'm also involved.

375
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,850
I failed to keep an eye on them.

376
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:47,970
How about this?

377
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,130
I'll share the punishment.

378
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:50,730
I...

379
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,130
I don't dare.

380
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,410
Well then...

381
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,450
since you've

382
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,730
punished her already,

383
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,370
why don't you let me handle the rest?

384
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:03,970
But...

385
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,050
The Floralia is imminent.

386
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,290
You have better things to do.

387
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,650
Don't you think so?

388
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,770
Please.

389
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,250
Does it still hurt?

390
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,450
No.

391
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,370
Were you nuts?

392
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,170
How could you do that to Envoy Apricot?

393
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,290
I...

394
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,490
It's my fault.

395
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,290
I must help you

396
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,570
when you were hurt.

397
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,770
How can you survive at Mt. Baizhou?

398
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,410
This is the way we do.

399
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,890
Thank you, sir.

400
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:51,890
Thank you.

401
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,290
Envoy Apricot

402
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,730
is arrogant and bossy

403
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,250
because of nepotism.

404
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,370
You're just cowardly subordinates.

405
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,930
Then, she enjoys bullying.

406
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,250
Thanks to

407
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,050
your recklessness.

408
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,010
You remind me of myself when I was young.

409
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,410
Is that...

410
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,170
a compliment?

411
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,090
Think whatever you want.

412
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,410
Frankly, why do you

413
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,410
like getting yourself into trouble?

414
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,130
97 punishments are waiting.

415
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,570
One more should be added.

416
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,690
Because of

417
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,490
insubordination.

418
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,130
I...

419
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,810
Sir.

420
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:31,730
Hongning is too weak

421
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,450
to stay in the Phantom Reflector.

422
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,010
Did anyone mention the Reflector?

423
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,810
After the punishment,

424
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,770
you'll have to clean up every corner

425
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,130
of the Floralia Palace.

426
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,290
Where's your gratitude?

427
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,410
Go on.

428
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,090
Thank you.

429
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,090
Alright.

430
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,610
Recording the history

431
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,850
of Floralia Palace

432
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,890
is the most boring.

433
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,170
You inspire me

434
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,890
a lot!

435
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:03,730
Alright.

436
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,410
Go get your punishment.

437
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,130
Sir.

438
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,570
I'm scared.

439
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,010
Too late.

440
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,010
The Punishment Altar

441
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,410
is made by millions of Celestial strings.

442
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,090
There's no escape.

443
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,090
I enjoy so much your weakness and

444
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,090
childish thought that

445
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,210
I could save you from this.

446
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:32,890
Sir.

447
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,970
Will I be an immortal

448
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,170
after these?

449
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,130
You see,

450
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,410
I took five thunders

451
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,010
to get my human form.

452
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,010
Last time I took three.

453
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,930
So, only 2 left before I can be

454
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,170
an immortal, right?

455
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,970
Are you in your dreams?

456
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,410
It's quite a

457
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,130
different story.

458
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,330
A big gap in strength.

459
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,010
Now, just look at the color.

460
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,650
Ascent to immortals

461
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:04,410
needs thousands of years of cultivation

462
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,010
and multiple critical challenges.

463
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,810
It's much more difficult

464
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:08,890
for a mere pixie like you.

465
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,050
So, when can I achieve that?

466
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,530
If you mean a junior one...

467
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,330
Don't try to stall!

468
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,970
You don't have to stand still.

469
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,050
Try to dodge them.

470
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,450
How?

471
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,210
Transform.

472
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,810
I don't know how!

473
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,570
And you think it's an honor?

474
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,810
Immortality? Do you want still?

475
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,090
I do!

476
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,930
How many now?

477
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:58,890
Well...

478
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,530
[Hongning.]

479
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:14,890
Hongning.

480
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,730
Shaoyao.

481
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,850
Did the thunders hurt you?

482
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,530
Shaoyao.

483
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,370
I made ointment.

484
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,210
Can you help me apply it?

485
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,250
Okay.

486
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,290
My! It must hurt you so much!

487
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,050
How could they've recovered already?

488
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,730
Recovered?

489
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,050
Maybe my ointment works well.

490
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,290
But I haven't even

491
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,570
applied it!

492
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,850
You're alright now?

493
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,810
Yes.

494
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,410
But just a minute ago,

495
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,530
I suffered a lot from

496
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,410
the thunders.

497
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,250
Hongning.

498
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,890
Your contradiction against Envoy Apricot

499
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,170
showed me you're a brave pixie.

500
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,410
Of course I am.

501
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,530
She bullied you!

502
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,850
Are you really from Mt. Baizhou?

503
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,210
It's fine.

504
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,610
Even so,

505
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,210
you're brave and righteous.

506
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,770
Working hard to cultivate,

507
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,170
you must ascend to immortality.

508
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,210
Actually, that's not my real purpose.

509
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,570
What I want

510
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,810
is to find my Floral Deity.

511
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,450
Then you should come to Celestial Floralia.

512
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,730
It's a once-in-500-year event.

513
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,050
Since you're here,

514
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,130
it would be a pity

515
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,490
if you miss it.

516
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,650
Can I meet the Deity

517
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,930
at the Celestial Floralia?

518
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,250
Of course!

519
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,610
Moreover, if you're selected to Floral List,

520
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,730
you can stay here to cultivate yourself.

521
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:03,890
By then, you can

522
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,810
have your own pavilion

523
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,970
after becoming a senior.

524
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,450
It's much better.

525
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,770
How can I be selected to that list?

526
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,050
The spots are all set.

527
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,370
You may ask the one

528
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,730
who brought you here.

529
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,810
I don't know who that person is,

530
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,490
but the fancy clothes may tell me.

531
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,130
Maybe beyond Envoy Plum and Apricot's

532
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,010
grade!

533
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,650
[Wake up!]

534
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,050
[They're]

535
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,930
in the highest rank.

536
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,890
Only the one at the level of

537
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,930
NCR Matriarch can compete them.

538
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,490
Really?

539
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,490
Yeah.

540
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,890
[Clean up carefully!]

541
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:48,810
[No slacking off!]

542
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,610
[You! Clean it up!]

543
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,290
Greetings.

544
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,570
What?

545
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,850
She's just doing cleaning?

546
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,050
I've seen it.

547
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,290
Absurd!

548
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,170
Floralia Palace shouldn't have

549
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,090
allowed a pixie to mess around!

550
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,690
I don't know why Sir Jinxiu

551
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,090
brought a pixie up.

552
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,530
Who knows?

553
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,930
But he couldn't bear

554
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,450
to see camellias in decline.

555
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,570
Perhaps he let her go because of this.

556
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,490
I see.

557
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,610
Noted with gratitude.

558
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,290
Sir Jinxiu must have known

559
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,610
the punishment.

560
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,210
It would overstep my bounds

561
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,410
if I punish her again.

562
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,610
Honestly,

563
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,650
I have an idea if you

564
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,530
want to teach her a lesson.

565
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,370
Shoot.

566
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,050
Last time, she pissed off Sir Jinxiu.

567
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,370
She's not allowed to go near him.

568
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,850
If she confronts him again...

569
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,170
Ziteng.

570
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,250
All your ideas

571
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,370
seem to be mischievous.

572
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,730
Not like that.

573
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,170
She's the reason you got chewed out.

574
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,330
It's just karma working.

575
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,490
That's very nice of you

576
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,170
that you call it mischievous.

577
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,170
Ziteng, what an articulate girl

578
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,490
you are!

579
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,570
Thank you.

580
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,090
Alright.

581
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,490
Don't just stand here.

582
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,930
Go and clean it up with them.

583
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,450
Go now.

584
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,490
Got it.

585
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,930
Clean them all up.

586
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,090
Not a dry leaf

587
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,730
or a weed is allowed left!

588
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:20,770
Listen.

589
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,530
I'm slightly senior to you,

590
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,250
mark my words.

591
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:25,930
Try to figure

592
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,650
everything out if you have

593
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,170
anything that confuses you.

594
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,090
Only by this can you ascend to immortality.

595
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,050
Work harder on it.

596
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,730
I've just understood it lately.

597
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,050
Keep going.

598
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,130
Greetings.

599
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,490
Sir Jinxiu has always preferred quiet.

600
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,890
He's also preferred clean.

601
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,850
That pixie seems like

602
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,610
a capable cleaner.

603
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,730
If she comes to do cleaning here,

604
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,090
Sir Jinxiu must be surprised.

605
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,650
[I haven't seen him these days.]

606
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,130
[I wonder what he's been doing.]

607
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,050
[Sprinkle]

608
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,290
[these petals!]

609
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:52,890
[Good.]

610
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,890
[Sir Jinxiu loves it.]

611
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:55,370
[Pay]

612
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,690
[attention to corners.]

613
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,890
Here! Yes!

614
00:30:59,050 --> 00:30:59,850
There, there!

615
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,490
Get them far and wide.

616
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,970
That's right!

617
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,450
Okay, that will be enough.

618
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,410
I'll tell Sir Jinxiu to come and bathe.

619
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,170
[This is...]

620
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,250
[the fragrance of flowers!]

621
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,610
[Wow, the celestial pool.]

622
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,130
[I haven't had a bath since I came here.]

623
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,490
[Alright, no one here.]

624
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,650
[Just enjoy it.]

625
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,770
Oh, hi!

626
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,010
Where is he?

627
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,210
Go!

628
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:17,730
Go away!

629
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,530
What kind of tree is this?

630
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,810
A tree of peony?

631
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,170
I've never seen

632
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,410
a golden peony before.

633
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,170
Why do you have so many scars?

634
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,090
Do you feel hurt?

635
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,210
I...

636
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,730
Get off of him!

637
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,090
[Let go now!]

638
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,610
[The mortal world was deprived]

639
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,290
[of its seasons]

640
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,570
[for being degenerated.]

641
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,210
[But the mortals are innocent.]

642
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:41,890
[They...]

643
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,250
[haven't seen a single flower for ten years.]

644
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,810
[They can't see the spring]

645
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,530
[through flowers.]

646
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:48,970
[If it goes on,]

647
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,450
[they'll lose hope]

648
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,410
[and become desperate.]

649
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,970
[This is the celestial punishment.]

650
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,250
[What?]

651
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,210
[It may be nothing to you]

652
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,450
[immortals,]

653
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,170
[but it can ruin a person's whole life]

654
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,530
[for a mortal.]

655
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,850
[It's not fair.]

656
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,090
[It's a petition from Jinxiu.]

657
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,850
[The mortal world was punished]

658
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,010
[with a ten-year winter.]

659
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,610
[No blossoms allowed.]

660
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,890
[Yet there are innocent people]

661
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,450
[being implicated.]

662
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,250
[His Majesty is always kind.]

663
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,210
[Please call off the punishment]

664
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,530
[Yours truly, Jinxiu.]

665
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,290
Your Majesty.

666
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,610
What are you looking at?

667
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,250
Jinxiu is again asking

668
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,330
for an end to the winter punishment.

669
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,490
He's too kind

670
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,930
as a Punisher.

671
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,730
Such a punishment

672
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,330
is to maintain celestial authority.

673
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,770
He's the Punisher.

674
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,530
Asking for mercy once a year

675
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,090
is part of fulfillment of duties.

676
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,090
Since you think it this way

677
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,730
and he's being consistent,

678
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,250
I'll end it.

679
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,290
Thank you, Your Majesty.

680
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,930
I've taught him to deny affection,

681
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,290
yet kindness is in his nature

682
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,490
which is hard to change.

683
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,170
His mercifulness

684
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,490
may bring him troubles.

685
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,010
You've always been lenient with him,

686
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,330
but hard on Kunlun.

687
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,370
Jinxiu is reserve and understanding,

688
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,370
but Kunlun is always a capricious boy.

689
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,010
Kunlun froze and ruined

690
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,210
celestial flora at Mt. Cangwu.

691
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,890
Jinxiu was forgiving enough to merely

692
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,410
put him in the Reflector.

693
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,730
I'm glad

694
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,410
that you can treat two princes

695
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,010
so fairly.

696
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:22,970
It's my duty.

697
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,410
Your Majesty.

698
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,210
Sir Taiyi is here.

699
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,410
Bring him up.

700
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,330
Yes, Sir.

701
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,930
I'll take my leave.

702
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,570
Greetings.

703
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,290
Your Majesty.

704
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,450
You've stayed here for a day and a night.

705
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,090
Any concerns?

706
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:00,650
Come here.

707
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,930
Have you ever seen clouds like these?

708
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,410
Are you worried

709
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,330
that they may

710
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,890
have an effect on the princes?

711
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,610
Since birth, there have been

712
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,050
bizarre phenomena.

713
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,890
Though they're not incompatible,

714
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,770
a sign of this may imply

715
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,490
a calamity for them.

716
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,850
Jinxiu and Kunlun

717
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,410
are senior immortals.

718
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,010
A calamity that bothers them

719
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,570
may be of great power.

720
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,170
As long as Jinxiu can get hard-boiled

721
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,690
and keep cultivation,

722
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:58,810
he will survive it.
