[EP08]

3
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,850
Well cared for?

4
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,090
My Empress,

5
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,930
thank you

6
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,450
for the birth of two children.

7
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,650
Two?

8
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,329
Yes.

9
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,770
Jinxiu

10
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,930
and Kunlun.

11
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:00,770
Stop!

12
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,650
Fairy?

13
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,450
Which fairy?

14
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,210
You are the exalted Celestial Empress.

15
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,130
Don't forget your station.

16
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,370
My station?

17
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,170
Had you remembered yours,

18
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,530
you wouldn't have sired children

19
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,810
with some unknown fairy!

20
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,210
As daughter of the Western Sea,

21
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,090
I'll never acknowledge it.

22
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,730
Stop!

23
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,130
When we wed,

24
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,210
we swore before the Ancestral Gods

25
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,210
to uphold Heaven's Will

26
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,810
and protect natural order.

27
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,050
Jinxiu

28
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,970
bears the Emperor Star's destiny.

29
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,490
Harming him

30
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,650
would defy Heaven's Will!

31
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,530
You really think

32
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,810
you outweigh the Emperor Star?

33
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,930
Defy Heaven's Will,

34
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,690
and I won't spare you.

35
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,050
Heaven's Will?

36
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,210
Sure.

37
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,130
You married me for that,

38
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,170
fathered children for that.

39
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,050
Everything you do now

40
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,330
is for that!

41
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,810
My love for you

42
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,690
means nothing compared to it.

43
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,370
Then why would I care?

44
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,010
Well, I'll sever

45
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,570
all mortal attachments,

46
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,050
devoting eternity to that!

47
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,010
How could I rest easy

48
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,970
if it's not well cared for?

49
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,050
Sir Jinxiu,

50
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,250
take good care.

51
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,650
Ningmeng.

52
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,490
Jiaobo.

53
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,450
Where are you?

54
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,410
Ningmeng.

55
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,010
Hongning!

56
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,090
Jiaobo, Ningmeng!

57
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,850
Hongning!

58
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,410
- Hongning!
- Hongning!

59
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,770
You're finally back!

60
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,010
Where have you been?

61
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,890
I searched everywhere.

62
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,530
Hongning, were you captured?

63
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,930
It's a long story.

64
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,330
I went to the Celestial Realm.

65
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,090
- The Celestial Realm?
- The Celestial Realm?

66
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,850
And got banished back.

67
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:50,810
What?

68
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,810
Come, I'll explain.

69
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,370
Let's go.

70
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,930
You are telling me

71
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,490
my leaves

72
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,050
are brewed into fine wine

73
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,770
in the Floralia Palace?

74
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,410
Floral Deity loved it.

75
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,170
That makes me shy.

76
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,050
How pathetic.

77
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,250
Hongning,

78
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,730
are there many

79
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,570
celestial fairies above?

80
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:21,970
Pretty?

81
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,610
Gorgeous!

82
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:24,850
Really?

83
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,450
But none match my beauty.

84
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:27,890
I believe so.

85
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:28,690
By the way,

86
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,450
you mentioned an ascended

87
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,450
white camellia immortal on Mt. Baizhou,

88
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,409
remember?

89
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,770
You mean Baicha? He just came back

90
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,409
Where is he? I'll go find him.

91
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,490
You'd better not.

92
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,250
Why?

93
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,690
It has nothing to do with him.

94
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,570
It's just that place has grown perilous.

95
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,010
Immortals and demons who ventured there

96
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,170
never returned.

97
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,850
That dangerous?

98
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:57,690
Then I must find him!

99
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,370
Come on.

100
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,850
Since Baicha ascended,

101
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,090
his cultivation

102
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,850
must be far beyond ours.

103
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,250
Maybe

104
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,250
instead of helping, you'd just

105
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,250
get in the way.

106
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,410
No,

107
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,410
I must find him.

108
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,490
Father,

109
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,090
the envoys from East Sea and NCR

110
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:38,930
have all departed.

111
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,570
They watch

112
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,290
our affairs far too closely.

113
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,330
This is your fault

114
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,290
giving them cause for gossip.

115
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,850
Don't let it happen again.

116
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,250
My apologies.

117
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,330
Report!

118
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,170
What is it?

119
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,450
Strange occurrences

120
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,610
have been frequent at Mt. Baizhou.

121
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,930
Many demons are missing.

122
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,970
Even fairies

123
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,490
who passed through the garden there

124
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,730
never returned.

125
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,770
Likely the white camellia clan

126
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,450
is causing trouble.

127
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,210
Petty demons

128
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,410
can't pose real threat.

129
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,330
Investigate further.

130
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,210
Yes, Sir!

131
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,010
Anyone here?

132
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,210
Don't tell me my fears came true.

133
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,130
Demon?

134
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,170
Demons don't torment their similar kind.

135
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,610
Baicha!

136
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,090
Hongning.

137
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,250
Baicha...

138
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,970
What are you doing here?

139
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,650
What happened?

140
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,850
Why do you look so battered?

141
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,410
Never mind me.

142
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,770
Why are you down here?

143
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,290
Did I put you in trouble?

144
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,770
No, no!

145
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:44,930
The Floral Deity

146
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,450
sent me to cultivate here.

147
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,170
You haven't told me

148
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,050
why you became like this.

149
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,650
Perhaps this world

150
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,410
has no place for me.

151
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,730
The sunlight and rain denied in heaven

152
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,450
remain out of reach here too.

153
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,610
What are you talking about?

154
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,930
Don't think that way.

155
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,530
You have me

156
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,250
and many friends.

157
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,410
Besides,

158
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,490
the Lantern Festival approaches.

159
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,130
We should be happy.

160
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,170
By the way,

161
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,210
have you heard any strange rumors?

162
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,010
This place has become dangerous.

163
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,450
Many demons and immortals are missing.

164
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,730
No, I haven't.

165
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:26,970
Really?

166
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,130
Hongning, I have to go now.

167
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,330
See you at the festival.

168
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:32,730
Then...

169
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,010
be careful!

170
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,250
She's my best friend.

171
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,330
You can't hurt her.

172
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,770
Hurt?

173
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,570
I merely want all female

174
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,410
to experience my suffering.

175
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,450
Shuixian!

176
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,530
Hongning.

177
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,650
Hongning.

178
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,250
Hongning.

179
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:22,730
Hongning.

180
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,370
Exercising again?

181
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,970
We've been waiting.

182
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,650
Don't tell me

183
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,810
you pulled an all-nighter?

184
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,410
I just woke two hours earlier.

185
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,610
Who knew you'd keep this up?

186
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,490
The laziest girl on Mt. Baizhou reformed.

187
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,890
I'm not lazy.

188
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,810
That one is,

189
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,850
still asleep.

190
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,730
But you...

191
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,690
Sorry,

192
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,050
I drank too much last night.

193
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,010
You know what?

194
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,650
The early worm gets eaten.

195
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,570
Avoid their vigor, strike when they're weary.

196
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,690
Avoid their vigor?

197
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,810
Still get eaten.

198
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,650
Anyway, I've decided

199
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,690
to cultivate hard,

200
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,770
no more slacking.

201
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,410
First time I've heard

202
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,850
of pixies cultivating through jogging.

203
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:14,770
Hongning.

204
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,210
What exactly did you do up there?

205
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,170
Did you go to the wrong place?

206
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,410
Anyway, I've made detailed plans.

207
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,570
Strengthen my body before cultivation.

208
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,970
Who knew a trip to Celestial Realm

209
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,130
could transform her completely?

210
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,650
It's all because

211
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,450
of the power given by the Floral Deity.

212
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,970
He'll grant me strength.

213
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,850
[I wonder]

214
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,050
[how her cultivation progresses?]

215
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,450
These books should suffice,

216
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,130
enough to study for days.

217
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,530
He promised to supervise me.

218
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,610
But where is he?

219
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,330
[Why do I keep worrying about her?]

220
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,330
[Let's see what the books say.]

221
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,570
Records of Immortal-Demon Romance.

222
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,490
Records of Immortal-Mortal Romance.

223
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,650
Official Chrysanthemum...

224
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:03,850
What nonsense

225
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,930
does he write all day?

226
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,210
[Chapter one,]

227
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,170
[since the Great Emperor's reign,]

228
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,090
[the hierarchy between immortals and others]

229
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,330
[grew more distinct.]

230
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,490
[Yet love governs all creation,]

231
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,970
[even immortals feel affection.]

232
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,730
[The anecdotes are countless.]

233
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,770
[Fellow immortals,]

234
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,330
[if you've reached this page,]

235
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,530
[you must]

236
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,890
[have romantic quandaries.]

237
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,210
[Should these signs appear,]

238
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,610
[you've likely]

239
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,050
[fallen in love.]

240
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,370
[First,]

241
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,250
[a day apart feels like years.]

242
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,490
[Second,]

243
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,530
[restless, on edge all the time.]

244
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,570
[Third,]

245
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,250
[unpredictable, prone to wild mood swings.]

246
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,370
[Fourth,]

247
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,130
[overthinking, irrational suspicions.]

248
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,650
[Fifth,]

249
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,850
[Blinded by love, unaware of your feelings.]

250
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,570
Not a single symptom matches. Good!

251
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,490
[Jinxiu.]

252
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,570
[Try this wine I brought you.]

253
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,370
[Jinxiu.]

254
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:43,850
What's wrong?

255
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,610
Why do you look so agitated?

256
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,730
Do I?

257
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,610
Your cup doesn't even have tea.

258
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,890
What are you drinking?

259
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,050
I just

260
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,130
couldn't find you anywhere,

261
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,490
figured you were upset,

262
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,450
so came to drink with you.

263
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,530
Celestial Realm Rule 82,

264
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,290
"No stealing."

265
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,810
Return this to Sir Taiyi.

266
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:24,890
Jinxiu...

267
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,330
My...

268
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,530
My eyes!

269
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:28,850
Jinxiu.

270
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,130
Where are you going? Jinxiu?

271
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,770
Sir Jinxiu.

272
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,770
[Sir Jinxiu.]

273
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,930
What are you doing?

274
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,930
[What are you doing?]

275
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,010
Do you miss me?

276
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,450
[Do you miss me?]

277
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,850
I miss you so much.

278
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,290
[I miss you so much.]

279
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,290
Focus on cultivation.

280
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,329
No distractions.

281
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,210
[Focus on cultivation. No distractions.]

282
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,770
[Focus on cultivation. No distractions.]

283
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,850
[My magic art can barely contain]

284
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,810
[this power within him anymore.]

285
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,330
[Must find a solution quickly.]

286
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,610
It's not for kids.

287
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,170
Here, fill the cup.

288
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,970
Hongning is here!

289
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,650
This is my homemade wine.

290
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,330
Very delicious! Try it!

291
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,250
Hi, everyone!

292
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,610
- Hongning!
- Hongning!

293
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,410
Over here!

294
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,170
Fill.

295
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,410
Hongning.

296
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,330
Remember me?

297
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,250
I'm Green Tea,

298
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,490
your distant cousin.

299
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,490
Green Tea?

300
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,010
C'mon, what distant cousin?

301
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,050
Impossible!

302
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:31,970
Same species?

303
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,650
Just trying to cozy up!

304
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,570
Let me tell you all a story!

305
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,170
See

306
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,250
that beautiful cloud eastward?

307
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,450
Though

308
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,770
you can't discern it,

309
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,930
that's Floralia Palace

310
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,890
up there.

311
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,370
At its gates

312
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,090
stands a dun-robed guard,

313
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,410
and he is

314
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,010
Official Chrysanthemum.

315
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,290
Don't underestimate him.

316
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,010
He records countless matters.

317
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,210
Nice! Go on!

318
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,730
And he writes, too!

319
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,610
He can write!

320
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,050
Hongning, tell us more!

321
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,170
More stories, please!

322
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,570
C'mon!

323
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,650
Baicha's been there, too.

324
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,210
Let's have him share his experience!

325
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,330
Baicha, come here!

326
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,010
Don't be shy. Tell us.

327
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,650
Baicha? No way.

328
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,850
Please tell us!

329
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:26,690
Tell us, please!

330
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:27,850
Go on, tell them.

331
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,490
I...

332
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,370
Hongning.

333
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,890
Are celestial fruits

334
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,210
all big and sweet?

335
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,770
Yes, they are!

336
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,490
Each one huge and sweet,

337
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,530
every variety tastes amazing.

338
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,490
Hongning.

339
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,010
Do celestial immortals only eat fruits?

340
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,370
No food like ours?

341
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,050
It's not that they don't

342
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,010
eat food...

343
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:50,530
Baicha...

344
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,930
Better to say the food there is bland.

345
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,690
The popular wine up there Hongning mentioned

346
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,650
is created by me.

347
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,170
Very tasty.

348
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,770
Do immortals eat children?

349
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,770
Just rumors.

350
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,810
Wanna try?

351
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,290
I made flower cakes there,

352
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,690
and I gave all to the Floral Deity.

353
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,650
Oh, yes,

354
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,290
there are so many fairies up there.

355
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,730
They are all beautiful!

356
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:25,650
Leaving.

357
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,250
See you.

358
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,850
- See you.
- See ya.

359
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:28,890
Bye.

360
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,650
Goodbye.

361
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,130
Let's go, kids.

362
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,570
How impressive!

363
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,570
Hongning.

364
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,770
Your stories really highlighted

365
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,770
our Lantern Festival!

366
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:42,970
All thanks to you!

367
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,290
Don't worry.

368
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,770
I'll come help every day

369
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,130
after cultivation.

370
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:48,810
Baicha.

371
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,250
Baicha.

372
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:52,690
Baicha,

373
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,090
they invited us

374
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:54,890
to tell stories

375
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,210
at the festival.

376
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,570
I'll pass.

377
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,170
I only wish

378
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,330
to spend the festival with you.

379
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:05,850
Sure.

380
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,690
Then it's a deal.

381
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:10,610
Hongning,

382
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,250
No slacking. Come help.

383
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,170
Coming.

384
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,450
I'll get to work now.

385
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,370
Okay.

386
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,970
Scrub this.

387
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:22,770
And here.

388
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:23,650
Alright.

389
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,170
Greeting, Sir Jinxiu.

390
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,010
What brings you here?

391
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,410
I accompanied my father here

392
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,690
for the Celestial Banquet.

393
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,610
I know

394
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,210
you're preparing the banquet,

395
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,490
so came

396
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,850
to offer my help.

397
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,210
You are our guest.

398
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,450
No need to trouble yourself.

399
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,650
It's my pleasure to help.

400
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,490
Sir Jinxiu,

401
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,250
may I ask you something?

402
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,130
Go ahead.

403
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,490
Rumors say you've shown

404
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,850
particular attention to a camellia pixie,

405
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,250
even repeatedly protecting her.

406
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:20,930
[Jinxiu.]

407
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,530
Why are you here again?

408
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,170
You come here every day.

409
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,810
So do you, Sir Kunlun.

410
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,410
Haven't you been recalled?

411
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,230
Why do you come by here every day?

412
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,910
It's my right to come see my brother.

413
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,710
But you?

414
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:35,730
I...

415
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:36,930
What brings you here?

416
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:38,770
Nothing.

417
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,530
Sir Jinxiu,

418
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,610
Sir Kunlun,

419
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,610
My Lady,

420
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,290
His Majesty summons you three.

421
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,130
- Greetings, Father, Mother.
- Greetings, Father, Mother.

422
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,850
Greetings, Your Majesties.

423
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,170
Girl,

424
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,890
you've come a long way.

425
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,810
We really appreciate it.

426
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,530
You're so kind.

427
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,290
Since you've trusted us with this task,

428
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,810
we'll definitely take care of it.

429
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,450
Jinxiu,

430
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,930
take good care of her.

431
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,170
Understood.

432
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,450
You're called here

433
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,770
for a joint plan

434
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,770
for the Celestial Banquet.

435
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,690
This grand event is

436
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,250
a celebration for all immortals to

437
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,690
display the splendor of the Celestial Realm.

438
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,090
Previous banquets were our responsibility.

439
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,730
Since we entrust it to you,

440
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,610
make sure to prepare thoroughly.

441
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,210
We obey your decree.

442
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,330
With your wisdom,

443
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,930
I'm confident in the outcome.

444
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,530
I'm flattered.

445
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,370
Father, Mother,

446
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,410
I have a request.

447
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,330
Speak.

448
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,250
I suggest that Kunlun and the Matriarch

449
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,050
collaborate to prepare.

450
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,690
Why?

451
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,810
I must fulfill my duties as the Punisher

452
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,770
and managed the affairs at Floralia Palace.

453
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,970
I can't fully dedicate myself

454
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,490
to the preparation.

455
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,650
Kunlun has proven responsible

456
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,250
overseeing the Wine Garden.

457
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,290
This task suits him well.

458
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,450
Responsible?

459
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,930
He'd probably set

460
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,370
the banquet on fire!

461
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,170
This task will

462
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,890
refine his character.

463
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,330
With the Matriarch's guidance,

464
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,010
success is guaranteed.

465
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,810
Let it be as you say.

466
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,410
Thank you.

467
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,010
[What's wrong with that?]

468
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,770
Being the Matriarch

469
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,730
doesn't make you right!

470
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,850
Shelve your outdated notions!

471
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,610
The Celestial Banquet is sacred.

472
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,930
Adding combat arenas?

473
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,930
What possessed you?

474
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,250
Even if I tolerated this absurdity,

475
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,530
His Majesty wouldn't approve!

476
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,690
Discussions mean

477
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,970
proposing various ideas!

478
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,610
Don't dismiss everything outright!

479
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,570
Discussions require meaningful ideas.

480
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,690
Not nonsense!

481
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,250
Kunlun,

482
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,890
do you truly understand what

483
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,450
the Celestial Banquet represents?

484
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,250
What does it represent?

485
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,290
Should we prepare it

486
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,690
exactly as I dictate?

487
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,530
"Yes, I'll do what you dictate."

488
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,530
Did you think I'd say that?

489
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,930
You tricked me!

490
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,490
Casting a charm spell on me?

491
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,090
You really underestimate me!

492
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:30,890
You!

493
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,450
The banquet is

494
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,330
your shared responsibility.

495
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,090
Persuade each other and

496
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,650
settle the plans yourselves.

497
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,130
I'll take my leave now.

498
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,330
Persuade?

499
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,130
Why bother?

500
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,290
Force works better!

501
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,290
Hongning,

502
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,450
look!

503
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,610
Hongning.

504
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,410
You cultivate all day,

505
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,130
yet still help with invitations.

506
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,490
I really appreciate it!

507
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,370
Don't mention it.

508
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,450
You organized previous

509
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,770
Lantern Festivals alone.

510
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,370
I should've helped sooner.

511
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,010
Pixies from all over

512
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,690
Mt. Baizhou heard about

513
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,770
your story and

514
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,210
planned to visit you!

515
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,690
You're the pride

516
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,770
of Mt. Baizhou!

517
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,530
We're all basking in your glory!

518
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,570
Really?

519
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,490
I wish the Floral Deity

520
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,450
could attend the festival.

521
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,090
How's that possible?

522
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,770
He's the Punisher

523
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,130
who hunts down demons!

524
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,050
Even if you're close to him,

525
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,690
he'd never come to Mt. Baizhou!

526
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,450
If he showed up here,

527
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,090
we'd all flee in terror!

528
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,290
Besides,

529
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,010
when we celebrate the festival,

530
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,570
the Celestial Realm

531
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,930
holds their own Celestial Banquet!

532
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,850
Celestial Banquet?

533
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,450
Banquet,

534
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,290
and festival.

535
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,770
No conflicts!

536
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:23,810
Hongning,

537
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,930
I'm off to deliver these invitations!

538
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,370
Deliver a letter to Sir Jinxiu?

539
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,250
He created you himself.

540
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,650
You must know his whereabouts.

541
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,210
But I'm a pixie now.

542
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,690
Trespass into the Celestial Realm…

543
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,850
You're not.

544
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,570
You don't even have a core.

545
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,690
Then what am I?

546
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,490
At most, you're a piece of paper

547
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,610
that can fly to the Celestial Realm.

548
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,370
Alright, I'll try.

549
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,930
This is the supreme art of wind control.

550
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,090
Tomorrow, not a ripple will

551
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,490
mar the water at the banquet.

552
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,450
Let's hope you don't blunder.

553
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,810
Let's check over there.

554
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,490
Just wait!

555
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,330
Sir.

556
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,570
Snowflake nectar?

557
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,050
Sir,

558
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,570
Matriarch just ordered us to

559
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,930
remind you that tomorrow's event

560
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,210
permits no errors.

561
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,610
You must stay sober.

562
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,490
She ordered you to monitor me?

563
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,850
All attendants received

564
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:33,930
her order.

565
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:30,850
Sir,

566
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,810
His Majesty commands us

567
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,530
to descend to Mt. Baizhou at once

568
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,330
to investigate the missing demons

569
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,930
before the banquet.

570
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,770
Any further orders?

571
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,970
I'll handle this personally.

572
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:40,770
Understood!

573
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,090
Excuse me,

574
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,890
have you seen Baicha?

575
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,930
The white camellia pixie?

576
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,770
[You've come at last!]

577
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,450
[camellia pixie... ]

578
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,370
[No,]

579
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,650
[soon you'll become Shuixian.]

580
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,330
Who are you? What do you want?

581
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:23,970
[This is an illusionary realm.]

582
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,010
[Oh no!]

583
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:25,770
[Hongning!]

584
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,210
Sir, it's been too long.

585
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,570
Shuixian,

586
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,490
you're demoted to pixie for breaking rules.

587
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,210
Yet you create illusions

588
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,730
trapping innocents in your past!

589
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,650
Release them now!

590
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,570
Those who enter my realm

591
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,210
must live out their fates

592
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,690
by my rules.

593
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,730
Save them yourself

594
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,290
within my illusionary realm!

595
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:05,890
[A millennium ago,]

596
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,370
[Envoy Narcissus of Floralia Palace]

597
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,610
[fell to the mortal realm]

598
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,570
[during an immortal tribulation.]

599
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,490
[She vanished without trace.]

600
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,610
[Where am I?]

601
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,290
Last one.

602
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,250
Uproot this, and we're finished!

603
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,490
[Don't uproot me! Please!]

604
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,130
Wait.

605
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,930
Leave this narcissus.

606
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,290
Young Master,

607
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,410
leaving it will

608
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,570
hinder the garden's replanting.

609
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,130
Delay the replanting.

610
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,690
You can enjoy your wine in the backyard.

611
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,050
Your pay remains unchanged.

612
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,370
Thank you so much!

613
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,570
We'll take our leave.

614
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,050
[That was close!]

615
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,210
[Who is this man?]

616
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,450
[Why save me?]

617
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,650
Such perfect blooms.

618
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,410
It'll be a shame to uproot you.

619
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,410
[He's actually handsome.]

620
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,330
Did you

621
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,290
sense my intentions?

622
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,370
Young Master!

623
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:50,570
Young Master,

624
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,570
the Chu family proposes marriage again.

625
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,250
Decline it.

626
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,370
But…

627
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,010
That's weird.

628
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,770
These flowers sway without wind.

629
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,650
I'll fetch temple monks to

630
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,010
look into this tomorrow.

631
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,370
Why fear?

632
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,290
A pixie guest might

633
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,690
liven things up.

634
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,850
What cursed realm

635
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,810
lacks even water?

636
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,290
Stop!

637
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,290
There you are.

638
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:46,889
You weren't sleeping.

639
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,130
You tricked me.

640
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,730
A little pixie after all, huh?

641
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,210
I'm not!

642
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,970
I'm Shuixian, Envoy Narcissus.

643
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,410
More like a trickster.

644
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,610
I didn't lie.

645
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,650
I stranded here after a failed tribulation.

646
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,530
Just need temporary shelter.

647
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:06,570
I trust you.

648
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,890
You trust so easily?

649
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,010
What if I'm truly some evil demon?

650
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,050
Wouldn't you fear me?

651
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,810
Immortals, demons...

652
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,010
what difference does it make to me?

653
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:18,810
Stay if you wish,

654
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,450
but agree to my terms,

655
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,330
Little Narcissus.

656
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,050
What terms?

657
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,610
Indenture contract?

658
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:34,970
Press your fingerprint here.

659
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,130
After that,

660
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,050
you can stay freely.

661
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,730
I'm only staying a few days!

662
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,130
Why shackle me with this?

663
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,810
You immortals live millennia.

664
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,370
I'll be dust in a century.

665
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,010
This scrap of paper costs you nothing

666
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,050
unless you refuse.

667
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,330
What happens then?

668
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,570
You will die.

669
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,410
When your revert to your true form,

670
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,730
I'll have the cook make you into a dish.

671
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,450
You can also flee.

672
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,170
Just so you know,

673
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,210
only my place

674
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,210
in the whole town

675
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,530
has water source for your cultivation.

676
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,570
Seek other towns?

677
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,250
You'll wither first

678
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,410
before you find water resources.

679
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:09,570
You…

680
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,330
Done.

681
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,370
I don't even know your name yet.

682
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,250
Duan Fei.

683
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,450
Duan Fei?

684
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,530
You've signed the contract.

685
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,050
From now on,

686
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,690
you'll serve me tea,

687
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,970
attend to my every need,

688
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,330
bloom daily for me,

689
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,690
and keep me company.

690
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,130
Your body and soul

691
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,370
belong to me.

692
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,370
So, you still plan to eat me?

693
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,170
That's wrong.

694
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,410
I want you to think of me every day.

695
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,010
Every day?

696
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,330
We immortals live for millennia.

697
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,170
What of it?

698
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,170
I'll only burden you for mere decades.

699
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,130
A fair trade.

700
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,090
You mean I must

701
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,050
remember you until

702
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,290
your mortal death?

703
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,690
Precisely.

704
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:06,930
Fine.

705
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:07,890
I'm going to sleep.

706
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,130
Hold on.

707
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,130
Lull me to sleep first.

708
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,410
How?

709
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,210
Sing a song.

710
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,570
I can't.

711
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,130
Share a drink, then.

712
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,650
I'm not allowed.

713
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,210
Tell a story, at least.

714
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,130
Just leave.

715
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,450
I'll tell a story.

716
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,050
Proceed.

717
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,850
I was once Envoy Narcissus

718
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,450
of Floralia Palace,

719
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,010
a place that

720
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,170
governs all blossoms' fates

721
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,210
with strict rules.

722
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,290
I never descended nor

723
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,250
met mortals before.

724
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,610
You're the first mortal I've met.

725
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,090
In Floralia Palace…

726
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,810
Jinxiu isn't here?

727
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,730
Then where did he go?

728
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,650
You've guarded

729
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,050
this gate for centuries

730
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,410
yet know nothing!

731
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,290
Absurd!

732
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,090
Open up.

733
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,210
Fine.

734
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,450
Jinxiu!

735
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,290
Jinxiu!

736
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,730
Consider yourself lucky!

737
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,690
[This is so boring!]

738
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,010
[No entertainment!]

739
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:47,650
Sir...

740
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,090
Greetings, Sir.

741
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,490
What brings you here?

742
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,210
State your purpose.

743
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,530
The NCR Matriarch requests audience

744
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,530
with Sir Jinxiu.

745
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,890
I'll decline her request.

746
00:39:58,970 --> 00:39:59,530
Wait!

747
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,570
Let her in.

748
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,050
Yes, Sir.

749
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,010
Don't mention my presence here.

750
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,090
Understood.

751
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,210
Greetings, Sir.

752
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,770
If no urgent matter,

753
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,570
best depart.

754
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,650
Sir,

755
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,890
are you unwell?

756
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,730
Emm...

757
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,330
Tea scalded my throat.

758
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:55,850
Nothing serious.

759
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,290
Last time you praised

760
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,490
our snowflake nectar.

761
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,450
I brought some

762
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,210
for you this time.

763
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,850
How devoted you are—

764
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,050
always bearing gifts for me.

765
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,450
This nectar soothes throats.

766
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,970
How about drinking some now?

767
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,890
Don't bother.

768
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,090
I brewed this personally.

769
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,490
If you refuse to drink,

770
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,050
I will stay here forever.

771
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,010
Then...

772
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:56,930
I'll drink.

773
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,450
You tricked me!

774
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:22,930
This cheap trick

775
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:23,850
reeks of desperation!

776
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,010
Your own tricks stink worse!

777
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,690
Neglecting the Celestial Banquet

778
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,490
to laze about!

779
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:31,930
Any problem?

780
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,370
The whole celestial realm knows

781
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,490
every palace of Jinxiu's

782
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,290
has a seat for me!

783
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,650
Resting at my place isn't lazing!

784
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,010
You however,

785
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,610
intruding on this place uninvited

786
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,410
like you're already

787
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,770
his consort!

788
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,050
None of your concern!

789
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:46,970
Mind your business!

790
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,410
Your "heroic" act of

791
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,050
saving a pixie is widely known.

792
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,690
I can't help feeling embarrassed for you!

793
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,450
So what?

794
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,210
I did save that pixie!

795
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,610
I should do that!

796
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,370
Besides,

797
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,490
you're not my consort...

798
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,850
Stop meddling!

799
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,210
Cease such speech against celestial rules!

800
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:11,570
[Sir, urgent news!]

801
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:14,090
[Sir Jinxiu is trapped in Mt. Baizhou!]

802
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,290
Jinxiu's trapped!

803
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,370
[Wait! Where are you going?]

804
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:22,930
Jinxiu!

805
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:24,690
[Stop!]

806
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,090
Luyao, this place is dangerous!

807
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:29,970
Return at once!

808
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,170
Duan Fei...

809
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,850
You're under narcissus' spell!

810
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,170
Why didn't you wait for me?

811
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,370
Why should I wait?

812
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,010
I'm here to save Jinxiu!

813
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,610
Don't fall under the spell!

814
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,850
You shouldn't forget me!

815
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,370
How could you?

816
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,170
[I've sealed your five senses.]

817
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,650
[The spell can't influence you now.]

818
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,050
[This place is strange.]

819
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,730
[I shall scout carefully.]
