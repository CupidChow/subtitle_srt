[EP19]

3
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,120
Greetings, Empress.

4
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,400
His Majesty is working on the Oceanic Codex.

5
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,800
One interruption

6
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,240
and all is lost.

7
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,560
You proceed

8
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,320
as the council planned.

9
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,480
Legend says the Demon King's power

10
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
can summon a Kylin,

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
blessing a realm

12
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,600
for ten‑thousand years.

13
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
The surge

14
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,960
in the NCR

15
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,560
indicates the same.

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,280
It's grave,

17
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
if the Emperor is not present...

18
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,560
I fought half my life in the Western Sea,

19
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,200
Sir Taiyi.

20
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,960
Do you doubt

21
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,800
I can handle this?

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,440
I wouldn't dare.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,960
Then let's begin.

24
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,600
Demons have always been our foe.

25
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,160
Ten thousand years ago, the Demon King

26
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,960
Fuzhu was hurled into Kylin Lair

27
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,480
and turned to ash.

28
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,080
If that power is back,

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,320
there are only two explanations.

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,040
Either he is alive,

31
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,040
or someone inherited the power.

32
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,320
Kylin skyfire is

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,800
the ancient beast's power.

34
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,680
Touch it,

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,040
and one will turn to ash.

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,320
No one survives.

37
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,760
I say

38
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,760
the King left an heir.

39
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,200
Arguing causes

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,600
is useless.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,840
We must

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,520
erase that power.

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Lead Western Sea troops

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,640
to Dragon's Abyss

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,360
and trace its source.

46
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,520
But

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,200
Dragon's Abyss is NCR territory.

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,040
Marching in

49
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,120
may be unwise.

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,040
NCR can't help itself.

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,120
This threatens all three realms.

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,560
If we don’t act,

53
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,680
who will?

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,040
Your Majesty is wise and valiant.

55
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,920
Dongxuan?

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,840
You?

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,600
Prepare to die!

58
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Don't hurt the Matriarch!

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,680
Matriarch?

60
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
She's only a fox demon.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,360
Add you

62
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,880
and I

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
purge two pests today.

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,080
If Samadhi Fire could stop me,

65
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,200
that stray vixen

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,560
wouldn't have fallen.

67
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,920
Where's Lujiu?

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,640
Where's Lujiu?

69
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,480
I've practiced Dao

70
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,400
a century, suffered,

71
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,440
slew hordes of demons.

72
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,440
I believe

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,800
justice means killing evil.

74
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Killing evil is right.

75
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,720
But where is evil?

76
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,000
Evil is demons.

77
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,880
Ha!

78
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,560
Then why am I fine?

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,080
Hongning says I'm a demon too.

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,240
Who am I, then?

81
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,640
What have I been killing?

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,640
Where is my path?

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,560
A demon, so what?

84
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,240
You have no ground

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,440
despising demons.

86
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,159
Listen up,

87
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,880
I was born a demon

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,560
but I walk a righteous path.

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,800
I shame neither Heaven nor Earth.

90
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,440
If you can't grasp that,

91
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,520
fade away.

92
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,560
Born a demon,

93
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,560
yet walk a righteous path?

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm an immortal, not a demon.

95
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,040
A demon?

96
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,160
I'm a demon?

97
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,240
Then who am I?

98
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,760
Who am I?

99
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,880
Fox!

100
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,280
Lujiu!

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,280
My god.

102
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,640
Lujiu!

103
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,280
Don't tell me he's been

104
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,200
inside her stomach this whole time.

105
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,480
Fox!

106
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,440
Lujiu!

107
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,120
Fox!

108
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,800
Hongning,

109
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,640
how are you?

110
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,800
Feeling dizzy?

111
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,960
Worried, are you?

112
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,600
You know I am.

113
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,840
Master,

114
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,159
will I always shield you?

115
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,760
Don't turn.

116
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,200
Listen.

117
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,960
I know,

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,680
gods must cut love.

119
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,320
I'm just a mortal

120
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,360
but I've

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,080
read storybooks.

122
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,800
And maybe..,

123
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,240
I've started to like you.

124
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,080
I once

125
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,840
meant to leave the mountain

126
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,080
and never

127
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
keep these feelings.

128
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,000
But just now...

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,080
I realized

130
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,360
I can't let go.

131
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,280
My parents said

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,240
a deity watched over me as a child.

133
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,520
I've always wanted to find him.

134
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,960
You won't admit it,

135
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,640
but I believe

136
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
it was you.

137
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm not saying this

138
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,760
to get an answer

139
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,840
nor to get

140
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,840
a promise from you.

141
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,480
It's just...

142
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,760
Dragon's Abyss

143
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,960
is deadly

144
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,160
and we may

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,360
not get out,

146
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,640
so I

147
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,040
had to speak.

148
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm done.

149
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
I swear

150
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,160
I'll keep you safe.

151
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,560
That's a promise.

152
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
Life after life,

153
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,240
never break that oath.

154
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,080
I bought this for you.

155
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,440
Master.

156
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,080
Hongning.

157
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,200
What happened?

158
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
The old hag

159
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,560
thrashed him.

160
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,440
We found him

161
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,200
like this.

162
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
I poured power into Lujiu,

163
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,320
yet it vanished.

164
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,400
His core is cracked.

165
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,480
I must treat him now.

166
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,120
Fox.

167
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,840
Lujiu.

168
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,160
This place is risky.

169
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,480
Go now.

170
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,680
My lord,

171
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,760
one question...

172
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,880
We'll talk about it later.

173
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,120
Master,

174
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,080
you both okay?

175
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,160
You know,

176
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,680
I can carry you both

177
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,600
back to Mt. Cangwu.

178
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,200
Let go.

179
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,240
Move!

180
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,080
Master,

181
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,320
I'll fetch some water.

182
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,880
Good.

183
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,920
Sir.

184
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,720
Matriarch.

185
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,080
Why is Hongning mortal?

186
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,280
She drank NCR Golden Lotus Dew.

187
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,120
Saved her soul

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,080
and allowed her cross the Bridge of Destiny.

189
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,760
She had a reincarnation writ?

190
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,800
You

191
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,680
walked her across.

192
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
That's why blazing fire tortures you.

193
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,680
You'd go

194
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,040
that far for her?

195
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
But have you thought,

196
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,960
she's a demon.

197
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,600
You're the future Emperor.

198
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,480
You two can never be together.

199
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,960
The wound's incurable.

200
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,680
Helping her

201
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,160
and easing her pain

202
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,000
is enough for me.

203
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,880
Easy for you to say.

204
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,120
A ten‑millennia

205
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,520
drop of Golden Lotus Dew,

206
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,000
and you

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
hand it out

208
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,760
to charm a girl.

209
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,080
Well,

210
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,600
I owe you

211
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,520
and the NCR.

212
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,480
One day

213
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,280
I'll repay.

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,080
Don't say that again.

215
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,440
Repay? With what?

216
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,080
You hibernate

217
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,280
on Mt. Cangwu.

218
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,360
But don't expect my thanks.

219
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,920
Hand Lujiu over.

220
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,120
He's royal blood,

221
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,760
an NCR prince.

222
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,120
The King himself

223
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,000
cast him

224
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,600
into Kylin Lair.

225
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,800
Taking him

226
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,680
back now

227
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,760
may harm him.

228
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,920
Yes.

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,280
We were parted as children.

230
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,200
I hunted his trail in secret.

231
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,880
I was

232
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,280
too timid,

233
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,760
too cowardly then.

234
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,880
I've paid that price.

235
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,800
Now

236
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,920
I'll bring him home.

237
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,320
The NCR owes him,

238
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,440
a debt he'll claim himself.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,680
What happened to you?

240
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,240
Hongning?

241
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,240
You're a white camellia pixie?

242
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
You still remember me?

243
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,640
I...

244
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,120
Are you all right?

245
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,280
I was born able to spot demons,

246
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,200
but do you know me?

247
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,720
Know you?

248
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm Baicha,

249
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,720
the one you saved.

250
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,560
Didn't expect

251
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,720
fate to let me see you again.

252
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,840
Fate plays cruel games.

253
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,240
No talking.

254
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,440
You're badly hurt.

255
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,960
I'll take you to Master.

256
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,320
Mas...

257
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,920
What is it?

258
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,880
Hongning,

259
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,360
seeing you

260
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,720
is enough.

261
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,280
You've lost most memories.

262
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
I know you mean well,

263
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,200
but your friends,

264
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,160
they may not welcome me.

265
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,600
It's okay. Don't worry.

266
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,680
Master isn't like that.

267
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,360
Come.

268
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,240
Master,

269
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,000
I met someone who claims

270
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,880
he knows me.

271
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,960
He's badly wounded.

272
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,080
Baicha?

273
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,560
You know him?

274
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,200
How did you get out of Kylin Lair?

275
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,640
Sir,

276
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,720
fancy meeting again.

277
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,800
I'd heard the Emperor Star descend

278
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,600
in mortal shells

279
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,680
and remember nothing,

280
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,040
yet you still recall me.

281
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
That's irrelevant.

282
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,200
Maybe.

283
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,600
But do you recall

284
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,080
why I was

285
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,840
thrown into that pit,

286
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,920
and what I suffered

287
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,320
to escape?

288
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,400
Hongning,

289
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,600
I should leave.

290
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,360
These cuts

291
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,520
are nothing.

292
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,440
Seeing you has already

293
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,200
untied the knot in my heart.

294
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,520
I could

295
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,400
die content.

296
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,839
Don't talk nonsense.

297
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,079
Master,

298
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:09,960
he...

299
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,960
I share the blame

300
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,599
for failing you before.

301
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,760
Come to Mt. Cangwu

302
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,280
and heal with us.

303
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,359
Thank you.

304
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,440
Since I saved you,

305
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,040
you owe me answers:

306
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,320
what's going on between you

307
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,240
and Lujiu,

308
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,280
and with Master?

309
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,760
And that shadow‑guy?

310
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,280
You barely have time to eat,

311
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,920
yet you know

312
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,840
half the men in the realm.

313
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,640
None of your business.

314
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,320
I just want to know

315
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:51,840
who...

316
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,000
who I rescued.

317
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,960
When you need to know, you will.

318
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,560
Explaining now

319
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,800
would only confuse you.

320
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,800
I'd love a sip of your blood.

321
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,520
Bet it's ice‑cold.

322
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,800
Not as cold as your true form.

323
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
Good heavens.

324
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,600
Why are you only just getting here?

325
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,600
Only?

326
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Listen, Sir,

327
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,120
the Emperor suddenly

328
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,880
ordered every heavenly guard

329
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,240
to lock down the realm.

330
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,040
I had no choice.

331
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,120
What do you mean, only?

332
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,520
By the way,

333
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,360
what really happened

334
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
at Dragon's Abyss?

335
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,400
Forget that for now.

336
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,360
Cover for me.

337
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,160
I'm heading to Heaven.

338
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,000
Hold on!

339
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,960
No, please.

340
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,800
Are we really

341
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
going to dance

342
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,120
on the edge of a

343
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,160
death sentence?

344
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Please, no.

345
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,320
Don't do that.

346
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,720
I see no option

347
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,080
but returning to Heaven.

348
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,760
You just...

349
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,640
look after yourself.

350
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,560
I can't protect you too.

351
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,040
No, no, please don't!

352
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,680
Look after myself?

353
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,560
I'm a desk‑flower,

354
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,440
not a sword‑swinger!

355
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,840
I can't do that!

356
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,440
I'm terrified of this

357
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,840
lick‑the‑blade life.

358
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
I'm scared!

359
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,760
Let go.

360
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,720
I can't spare you.

361
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,400
I won't.

362
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,200
I'll count to three.

363
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,920
Let go of me.

364
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,080
Three... Two... One.

365
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,600
-Hands off!
-No!

366
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,160
Master?

367
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,640
Master?

368
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,240
Go!

369
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,760
Go!

370
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,280
Come in.

371
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,080
If you'd stayed in seclusion any longer

372
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
I'd have died of worry.

373
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,800
Three days only.

374
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Drink your medicine.

375
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,160
Let me.

376
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,640
[Could that]

377
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,720
[red camellia]

378
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,800
[be the one Master once loved?]

379
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,960
What are you thinking?

380
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,080
Nothing.

381
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,960
It's just,

382
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,880
if you dislike

383
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
me feeding you,

384
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,280
next time I'll...

385
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,720
It's not that.

386
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,520
Just...

387
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,720
it's a new experience.

388
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,800
It never

389
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,080
happened before.

390
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,480
Really?

391
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
Not even in Heaven?

392
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,800
How are Bailing and Lujiu?

393
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,600
Healing fast.

394
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,840
Bouncing around already.

395
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,720
Good.

396
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,360
That's good.

397
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,120
[Not a word about that red camellia.]

398
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,320
Master,

399
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,320
nothing else you'd like to ask?

400
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,440
Then...

401
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,320
rest well.

402
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,440
I didn't see anything!

403
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,040
Nothing at all!

404
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,160
You don't have

405
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,440
anything to say to me?

406
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,680
Why are you following me?

407
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,440
I...

408
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,440
I'm leaving soon.

409
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,960
I feel familiar with you.

410
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,440
I'd like you to escort me.

411
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
We barely know each other.

412
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,720
Why should I?

413
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,720
Bailing,

414
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,080
just in time.

415
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,000
Take care of

416
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,400
your guest.

417
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,480
Greetings, Your Grace.

418
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,680
Rise.

419
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,320
Official Chrysanthemum

420
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,160
descended five times illegally

421
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,720
during the Emperor Stars' trial.

422
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,200
No records in Archives.

423
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,000
For what?

424
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,040
Sir Jinxiu encountered

425
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,360
a mortal girl during his trial.

426
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
He's been consulting him

427
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,640
about...

428
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,520
About what?

429
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,240
About...

430
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,760
Romantic affairs.

431
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,720
As expected.

432
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,280
[Should we intervene?]

433
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,480
[In case she hinders his trial.]

434
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,520
No.

435
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,040
Keep watching.

436
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,840
Understood.

437
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,960
Your Grace.

438
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,480
Well?

439
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,000
The Demon King's trace

440
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,160
was found at Dragon Pool.

441
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,000
[But now]

442
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,120
[his energy]

443
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,000
[has appeared elsewhere.]

444
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Where is he now?

445
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,000
Where the Emperor Star resides—

446
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,040
Cangwu Academy.

447
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,200
Greetings, Sage.

448
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,080
I've broken celestial laws,

449
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,280
but I have no choice.

450
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,320
I come to seek your guidance.

451
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,560
Is Hongning's

452
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,560
power truly from

453
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,080
the Demon King?

454
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,280
Any way to suppress it

455
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,600
without harming her?

456
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,240
Thank you.

457
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,120
In the battle at Dragon's Abyss,

458
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Bailing and Hongning

459
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,640
broke rules.

460
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,880
They deserve punishment.

461
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
But they acted to save lives

462
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,960
and

463
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,920
eliminated evil.

464
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
They upheld Cangwu's

465
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,360
duty and honor.

466
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,600
I'll spare you this time.

467
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,240
Bailing have planted enough trees

468
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,920
to atone for past sins.

469
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,480
From today,

470
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
your immortal root is planted.

471
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,640
You may cultivate junior celestial arts.

472
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,000
Thank you, Master.

473
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
No more tree-planting!

474
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,160
Bailing,

475
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,360
you discipline yourself

476
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,920
and guide Cangwu's disciples

477
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
toward

478
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,360
ascension.

479
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,240
For what you did in the battle,

480
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,560
I witnessed

481
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,800
your sense of duty.

482
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,600
I am proud.

483
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,880
Master...

484
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,480
You're

485
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,640
embarrassing me.

486
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,240
Tiannanxing,

487
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,720
your cultivation progresses well.

488
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,720
From today,

489
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,320
you may practice advanced arts.

490
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,040
Yes, Master.

491
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,280
Baibuqu,

492
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
your wisdom

493
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
is impressive.

494
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,800
You're

495
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,480
promoted to full disciple.

496
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,920
Thank you, Master.

497
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,400
Master.

498
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,240
I have a request.

499
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,480
Yes?

500
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,840
I excel only

501
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,680
in theory, but lack

502
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,000
practical skills.

503
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,160
Let me

504
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,200
join senior brothers

505
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,280
in demon-hunting.

506
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,080
That requires basic skills.

507
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,600
Without mastery,

508
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,000
you can't protect yourself.

509
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,280
How about this.

510
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,360
From today,

511
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,800
you guard the dungeons.

512
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,920
Study the demons there.

513
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,280
This will prepare you

514
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,480
for future

515
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,240
missions.

516
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,720
Thank you, Master!

517
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,480
I won't

518
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,720
disappoint you!

519
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,560
Why is he thrilled about

520
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,640
this tedious job?

521
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,640
When you first

522
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,600
got the duty,

523
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,160
you were celebrating with wine.

524
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:07,920
Did I?

525
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,240
Luyao has stayed here for a while.

526
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,680
She'll depart soon.

527
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,320
Lujiu.

528
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,960
In the battle,

529
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,400
she saved your life.

530
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,120
you escort her safely

531
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,480
down the mountain.

532
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,080
Master,

533
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,760
I refuse.

534
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,000
Thank you, Sir.

535
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,800
I didn't say yes!

536
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,640
You'd defy

537
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,360
your Master's order?

538
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,120
I...

539
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,280
Fine.

540
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,960
Why me?

541
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,680
Get this straight.

542
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,680
I'm human,

543
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,080
you're a pixie.

544
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,840
I'm better.

545
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,680
So he would choose me.

546
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,760
You hear me, huh?

547
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
What are you muttering?

548
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm...

549
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,480
Admiring the flowers.

550
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,640
Your red camellia

551
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,320
looks rather plain.

552
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,000
Since Dragon's Abyss,

553
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,480
I've yet to ask

554
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,240
if you wish to stay at Cangwu?

555
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,560
If not,

556
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,760
I won't force you.

557
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,640
But

558
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,040
I can't bear

559
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,200
to see you risk

560
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,560
your life again.

561
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,240
You want me to stay

562
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,000
just to keep me safe?

563
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,440
Didn't you say

564
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,680
to follow my true heart?

565
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,040
My heart wants

566
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
you by my side,

567
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,880
always.

568
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,320
I specially

569
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,560
sought this for you.

570
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
Aids cultivation,

571
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,840
ensures safety.

572
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,360
Cangwu's creed:

573
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,160
Always help others.

574
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,440
You help others

575
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,280
while I help you.

576
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,440
So

577
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,240
this is our love token?

578
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,280
Why are you here?

579
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,040
See how you're

580
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,040
drowning your sorrows in wine.

581
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,160
Who said I'm sorrowful?

582
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,640
It's all in your head.

583
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,400
I'm leaving.

584
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,240
With Lujiu.

585
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,720
There's more to it.

586
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
My noble nine-tailed princess.

587
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,400
Why explain

588
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,480
your departure to me?

589
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,560
Pointless.

590
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,800
I mourn my years as your slave.

591
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,560
After all...

592
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,680
What pleases nine-tails?

593
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,960
Only three-tails would know.

594
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,120
My blood-spilled efforts

595
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,960
mean nothing.

596
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,720
You'll understand

597
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,840
when memories return.

598
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,680
Boring.

599
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,080
They ruined my cultivation focus.

600
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,080
Why must Master and Hongning

601
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,400
flaunt their romance?

602
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,120
Their love tsunami

603
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,640
drowns us minnows

604
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,960
on the shore!

605
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,600
Pathetic.

606
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,280
But he's our Master.

607
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,360
Can't complain.

608
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,840
But you can complain Hongning?

609
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,680
Not really.

610
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,760
Women

611
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
are cultivation's bane.

612
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,280
Stay away from them.

613
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,679
Senior,

614
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,880
have you heard of

615
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,400
a cultivation method called

616
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,280
Dual Practice?

617
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,560
I know it inside out.

618
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,040
Boring.

619
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,400
Impossible.

620
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,480
As a constable,

621
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,719
I met splendid women.

622
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,960
Graceful,

623
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,320
intelligent...

624
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,960
But I was

625
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,920
only focused on cultivation.

626
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,159
When

627
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
I descend,

628
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,120
every maiden shall fall for me!

629
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,199
But it's

630
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,440
my heart's fault.

631
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,199
It's not built for monogamy.

632
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,120
You know,

633
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,880
my heart belongs to

634
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080
every woman out there,

635
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,200
can't be claimed by just one.

636
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,040
Senior,

637
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,600
you've only met one girl,

638
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,840
yet your imagination runs wild.

639
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,520
Impressive!

640
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,560
Junior!

641
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,720
Mourning

642
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,520
Luyao's departure

643
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,280
with wine?

644
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,440
Yeah.

645
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,640
Seems

646
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
you've grown attached

647
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,720
to your temple maiden!

648
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,520
Drink up!

649
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,720
Right.

650
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,640
Alright.

651
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,680
[Bottoms up!]

652
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,560
[Let's toast!]

653
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,200
Bye.

654
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,280
Goodbye.

655
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,120
Who's there?

656
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,360
Lujiu?

657
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,520
What's wrong?

658
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,560
Are you the Matriarch?

659
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,720
I am.

660
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,920
They say

661
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
praying to you

662
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,680
grants wishes.

663
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,200
[Madam.]

664
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,240
[Can you make me]

665
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,680
[grow nine tails?]

666
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,320
When you're older,

667
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,000
you'll have nine tails.

668
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,240
Really?

669
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,560
She's lying.

670
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,360
You'll never have nine tails.

671
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,320
She's lying.

672
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,320
She's lying.

673
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
She's lying.

674
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,040
She's lying.

675
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,320
You'll never have nine tails.

676
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,280
She's lying.

677
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,720
She's lying.

678
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,200
She's lying.

679
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:20,720
Lujiu.

680
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,680
She's lying.

681
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,840
-Lujiu.
-She's lying.

682
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,320
-Lujiu.
-She...

683
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,000
Having nightmares?

684
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,280
Where are we?

685
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,960
Outskirts of Ganzhou.

686
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,720
Ganzhou?

687
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,280
I lost track.

688
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,000
Right, weren't you

689
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,480
going to Xuyun Temple?

690
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,000
Why this detour?

691
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,960
I...

692
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,640
need to handle

693
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,600
something else first.

694
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,640
Make it quick.

695
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,760
I need to return

696
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,360
to Cangwu after this.

697
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,640
You love that place?

698
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,600
Of course.

699
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,560
My master,

700
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,600
those troublemaker juniors,

701
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,680
they're waiting.

702
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,560
What if one day

703
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,480
you had to leave that place?

704
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,640
That won't happen.

705
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,120
Even if Master

706
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,280
banishes me,

707
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,680
I won't leave.

708
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,640
What's wrong?

709
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:47,720
Hungry?

710
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,680
No.

711
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,240
Then

712
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,240
hurting?

713
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,280
Your wound's bleeding.

714
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,200
Didn't you notice?

715
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,600
I'll get medicine.

716
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,440
Wait here.

717
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,640
He grew into such a fine man.

718
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,720
Wanna ask why I haven't

719
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,360
told him

720
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
who I really am?

721
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,600
I don't know.

722
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,840
But I think

723
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,320
he must hate me and Father deeply.

724
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,640
If he knew

725
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
my true identity,

726
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,960
would he still treat me kindly?

727
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,120
Baicha!

728
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,440
You're up?

729
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,000
I woke yesterday.

730
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Didn't want to disturb you

731
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,040
while you were happy.

732
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,360
Be my guest.

733
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,080
What is it?

734
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,520
Hongning.

735
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,600
Men and women

736
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,560
should keep distance.

737
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,560
You said

738
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,200
we were friends in our past life.

739
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,080
No need for so many formalities.

740
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,600
We were very close then.

741
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,960
Every time I was bullied,

742
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,480
you protected me.

743
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,720
Always looked out for me.

744
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,080
But then everything

745
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,800
changed.

746
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,720
Changed?

747
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,640
Why?

748
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,880
Unpleasant matters...

749
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,400
[Hongning.]

750
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,880
Master.

751
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,120
Baicha's awake.

752
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,160
Check his injuries.

753
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,880
Wenxin's brewed herbs.

754
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,000
Fetch them.

755
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,080
I'll assess him.

756
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,440
Can't I stay here?

757
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,040
Don't be absurd.

758
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,800
A young lady shouldn't.

759
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,320
Fine.

760
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,200
Sir.

761
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,920
What a perfect timing.

762
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,040
Hongning's human now.

763
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,640
Innocent and pure.

764
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,040
I won't let her be burdened

765
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,520
by past lives.

766
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,640
Won't

767
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,720
or dare not?

768
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,920
How selfish of you.

769
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,320
You erase our bonds

770
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,440
and joy

771
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,240
to hide the fact

772
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,360
that you

773
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,240
wronged her.

774
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,080
Mortal emotions,

775
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,360
love and loss

776
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,680
in past lives

777
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,840
are illusions.

778
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,200
But you remember her.

779
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,000
And I remember her.

780
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,840
You cling to

781
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,960
the memories.

782
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,160
Yet she has

783
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,760
her life decided?

784
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,240
Sir,

785
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,240
have you asked

786
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,440
if she wants this?

787
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,440
Remember.

788
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,480
Every pain she bears

789
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,720
is your making.

790
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,400
She'll never ascend.

791
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,160
Why chain

792
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,760
her here?

793
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,920
Enough!

794
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,040
When you recover,

795
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,040
I'll return you to Mt. Baizhou.

796
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,560
Savor

797
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,120
this time.

798
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,280
Never.

799
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,520
Hongning.

800
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,320
I'll free you from his lies

801
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,120
and suffering.
