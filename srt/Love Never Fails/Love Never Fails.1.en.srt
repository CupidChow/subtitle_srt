00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[Love Never Fails]
[EP01]

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,000
The world has Immortals, Demons, and Humans.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,880
Among the Immortals, there are three courts:

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,920
Midheavens, Western Sea, and Northern Skies.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The Midheavens rule

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,280
while the other two follow,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,560
hoping for a leg-up.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,680
[The Celestial Monarch has arrived!]

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,280
[In Celestial Year 83,000, Second Cycle,]

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,640
[Emperor Yaotian took the throne.]

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,320
[That same year, Empress Yihe bore twins,]

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,160
[elder Jinxiu and younger Kunlun.]

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,160
[The court cheered,]

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,880
[certain the realm]

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,120
[had won itself millennia]

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,520
[of peace.]

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,200
Blessings on Your Majesty!

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,240
Blessings on the Empress!

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,120
[Tradition says]

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,520
[whichever prince's natal star lights up]

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,440
[first becomes the Heavenly-Emperor star,]

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,400
[the next ruler.]

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,280
[Yet tonight]

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,720
[both stars blazed at once.]

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,680
[That's unheard-of.]

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,600
Great fortune or peril may lie ahead.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,680
[Still,]

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,560
[His Majesty has a plan.]

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,280
[Jinxiu has been]

31
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,800
[groomed as heir]

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,520
[from the cradle]

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,960
[to obey heaven's laws and shun love.]

34
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,640
[His one softness?]

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,160
[A little red camellia]

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,039
[that's grown beside him all these years.]

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,880
When will you bloom?

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,920
You're a camellia; I'm a peony.

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,120
We share the same root.

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
From now on,

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,360
I'll look after you.

42
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,520
[And so,]

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,760
[our story begins with this red camellia.]

44
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,880
Kunlun Deity!

45
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,800
Listen to me!

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,680
You can't do that!

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,760
Please,

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,560
The Floral Deity

49
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,200
is in closed meditation right now.

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,960
I'm not lying.

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,200
Really.

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,560
How about...

53
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,840
How about...

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,600
Kunlun Deity!

55
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,800
Maybe

56
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,840
return to your own training?

57
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,240
My brother just became Floral Deity.

58
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm here to visit.

59
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,200
Why shove me away?

60
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,080
No,

61
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,520
I didn't mean that...

62
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,120
Pear blossom, bloom.

63
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,360
Chrysanthemum...

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,480
Kunlun Deity, stop!

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,720
You...

66
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,000
You can't do that.

67
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,080
Please.

68
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,440
Only the Floral Deity

69
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,600
may wield that Scepter.

70
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
It controls

71
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,560
bloom timing in the mortal world.

72
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,320
If abused,

73
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,960
things could go haywire.

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,080
Please,

75
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,520
hand it over!

76
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,440
Officer Chrysanthemum,

77
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,120
even my brother doesn't order me around.

78
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Why should you?

79
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Besides,

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,960
what harm is a little blossom magic?

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,840
Don't hang

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,280
with my brother too long.

83
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,960
You'll end up as dull as he is.

84
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,360
Camellia, bloom!

85
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,320
Still silent?

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,520
A tiny red camellia

87
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,480
dares ignore the Blossom Scepter?

88
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,320
Fine, let's freeze you

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,560
as a lesson!

90
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,120
Brother!

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,840
Brother!

92
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,600
I was wrong!

93
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,800
Put me down!

94
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,720
I...

95
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,640
I...

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,920
Sir,

97
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,000
Midheaven will question

98
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,880
today's Blossom Scepter mess.

99
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,960
Please,

100
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,080
don't shield him again.

101
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,240
It's fine.

102
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,360
He's always playful.

103
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,360
Your lenience spoils him.

104
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,480
Sir,

105
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,240
look.

106
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,840
That camellia only moves for you.

107
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,600
Kunlun waved

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,600
the Scepter

109
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,680
and

110
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,400
every bloom opened

111
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,200
except her.

112
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,400
Little Camellia,

113
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,440
the Scepter rules every plant.

114
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,640
To see it is to see the Floral Deity.

115
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,960
Did you ignore it

116
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,400
for me?

117
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,400
[Sir Jinxiu,]

118
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,440
[your abuse of the Scepter]

119
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,320
[threw earthly flowers into chaos.]

120
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,000
[the Celestial Monarch summons you.]

121
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,800
Kunlun misused the Scepter first,

122
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,000
and you let it happen.

123
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,159
Accept punishment together.

124
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,320
Yes.

125
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,960
The camellia defied Scepter.

126
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,720
She must be punished.

127
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,640
Father,

128
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,400
she resisted

129
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,080
only because

130
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,840
she knew

131
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,880
I wasn't holding it.

132
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,960
So

133
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,120
this is the bloom

134
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,360
you've always favored?

135
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,960
Yes.

136
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,160
She grew up

137
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,640
with me.

138
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,520
Somehow,

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,040
every time I see her,

140
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,600
I feel a strange warmth.

141
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
I warned you.

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
Cut all ties

143
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,840
or you can't judge fairly.

144
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,640
With attachments,

145
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,760
you can't become

146
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,680
a true enforcer of divine punishment.

147
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,200
I thought

148
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,880
you'd restrain yourself,

149
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
but instead,

150
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,160
you grew worse,

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,880
even

152
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,720
favoring her openly.

153
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
Bending the rules for her.

154
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,360
Father,

155
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,000
I had no wish to bend the rules.

156
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,799
This was my fault alone.

157
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,840
Punish me, not her.

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Then watch

159
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,960
how your pity

160
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,240
destroys her.

161
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,200
Father!

162
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,400
Issue the decree.

163
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,160
Yes.

164
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,000
The camellia defied Heaven's order.

165
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Cut her immortal bond

166
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,160
and erase her spirit.

167
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,240
Yes.

168
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,360
Remember:

169
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,400
gods stand above demons,

170
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
and the cosmos runs on law.

171
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,440
If anything breaks that law,

172
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,800
even the blessed

173
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,520
must be destroyed.

174
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,680
Only thus

175
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,800
can we

176
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,680
stand high

177
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,960
and uphold order

178
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,920
across the realms.

179
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
[You did nothing wrong,]

180
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,240
[yet lost divinity because of me.]

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
[That's so unfair.]

182
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,720
Your life

183
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
was woven from camellia petals.

184
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,560
From now on,

185
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,120
be called Hongning.

186
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,760
Heaven is no place for you.

187
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,960
Go below,

188
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,640
live happy

189
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,440
and free.

190
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
May fate

191
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,280
let us meet again.

192
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,360
Take care of yourself.

193
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,280
Okay, sure.

194
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,360
Who are you?

195
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,400
Where'd you come from?

196
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,320
From the sky?

197
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,640
The sky?

198
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,800
[Five hundred years passed.]

199
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,160
[Envy and deceit stained mankind,]

200
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,000
[winters dragged on,]

201
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,120
[and no flower dared bloom.]

202
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,000
[Spring vanished from the world.]

203
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
No pixies

204
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,080
escapes Heavenly Tribulation;

205
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,960
the bolt always strikes.

206
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,880
Hongning,

207
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,120
your first thunder is coming.

208
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,560
Hide well!

209
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,920
Look out! Heaven's wrath!

210
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,880
Hongning!

211
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,000
How much longer?

212
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,200
Three bolts left.

213
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,280
Hongning!

214
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,040
Yes! Yes!

215
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,360
It worked!

216
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,280
Fantastic!

217
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,080
Yes!

218
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,600
That's great!

219
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,600
What a sweet scent.

220
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,640
Wonderful, truly wonderful.

221
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,080
She's turned into a person!

222
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,800
All right.

223
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,200
Move along, everyone.

224
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,080
Off you go.

225
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,040
Nothing to see here.

226
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,200
Hongning, five hundred years

227
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,120
and you finally awakened.

228
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,600
Mt. Baizhou's lightning was brutal.

229
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Don't you know?

230
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,560
Mt. Baizhou

231
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,440
crawls with demons;

232
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,000
tribulations always hit harder.

233
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,800
At least

234
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,080
I have a human form now.

235
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,560
Thank you for guiding me through.

236
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,600
Over there.

237
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,440
No thanks needed.

238
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,520
If the bolts

239
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,400
were that fierce just for a body,

240
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,160
then when I try to ascend...

241
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,960
Wait a second.

242
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,400
Ascend?

243
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
Still dreaming of immortality?

244
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,920
That thunder scrambled your brains.

245
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,640
It did not.

246
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,760
No one from here

247
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,520
has ever become immortal.

248
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,160
I've never

249
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,720
even seen a junior immortal here.

250
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,600
Remember the

251
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,600
white-tea pixie

252
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,880
on the next peak?

253
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,840
At that time,

254
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,240
he trained like mad,

255
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,480
looked down on us all.

256
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,320
And yet,

257
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,320
after he went up,

258
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,560
he never came back.

259
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Total swindle.

260
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,080
Well,

261
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,680
you all know

262
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,360
why I cultivate.

263
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,960
One day I'll reach

264
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,520
the Heaven

265
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,200
and repay the deity who saved me.

266
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,680
Repay.

267
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,600
Repay!

268
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,560
Repay, repay...

269
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,000
You don't understand.

270
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,480
Who told her the crane-spirit-repays tale

271
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,720
right after she grew legs?

272
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,120
I told her that one,

273
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,640
and the bear repays,

274
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,720
the monkey repays,

275
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,120
the white-rabbit repays.

276
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,920
Right, Hongning?

277
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,640
Exactly.

278
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
So it isn't just cranes.

279
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,120
Hongning.

280
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
There are dozens of floral deities.

281
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,920
How will you pick the right one?

282
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,920
I just know.

283
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
When I

284
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,480
was the tiniest bud,

285
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,319
I peeked through a crack

286
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,319
and saw a blossom-mark on her brow.

287
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,760
I'll never forget it.

288
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,520
Fine,

289
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,480
we'll argue

290
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,800
about gratitude later.

291
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,440
But first,

292
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,440
how dare you

293
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,400
bloom down by the village

294
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,560
two days ago?

295
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,720
Don't you know?

296
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,119
Flowers are banned in the mortal world.

297
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,760
Mom,

298
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm so cold.

299
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,880
Hold on a little longer.

300
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,560
When spring comes,

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,160
everything will be fine.

302
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,480
Mom,

303
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,240
will I ever see spring?

304
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
It's my fault.

305
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,080
I shouldn't have gave birth to you.

306
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,280
Mom, look!

307
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,920
a flower!

308
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,880
A flower.

309
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,040
It's blooming!

310
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,200
Spring is coming!

311
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,320
Why can't it bloom?

312
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,040
Isn't blooming a flower's duty?

313
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,600
Duty means nothing.

314
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,000
Ten years of winter is punishment.

315
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,400
But that poor mother and child...

316
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
The blossom's out already.

317
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,320
Too late to stop me.

318
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,320
Move aside.

319
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:19,920
Hongning!

320
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,800
Hongning! Hongning!

321
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,720
Who knows if they'll chase it up.

322
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,680
But demons cause trouble

323
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,520
here every other day.

324
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,360
They can't keep up.

325
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,280
Still, Hongning

326
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
hide here

327
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,120
till things calm down.

328
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,640
Will hiding really help?

329
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,960
Relax. Don't worry.

330
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,160
Even if Yao...

331
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,640
even he himself shows up,

332
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,280
he won't get past the two of us.

333
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,440
Fine.

334
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,120
Do whatever you like.

335
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,560
We'll stand guard.

336
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,880
Right,

337
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,640
fresh mint leaves.

338
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,320
Just picked.

339
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,160
Also,

340
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,440
this is embarrassing...

341
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,200
When I get my true form,

342
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,160
I'll gift you a merfolk pearl.

343
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,880
Thanks.

344
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,400
Right. Where's yours?

345
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,280
I'm not fully ripened yet.

346
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,600
Once I am, I'll make it up to you.

347
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,720
Promise?

348
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,160
Promise, I promise.

349
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Bold deer demon!

350
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,680
You were Floral Deity's mount,

351
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,360
and cast down due to your disobedience.

352
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,640
Instead of repenting,

353
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,920
you've kept killing our troops.

354
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,680
Your penalization falls today.

355
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,880
I'd heard you were training

356
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,480
in the Ocean-Linking Arts.

357
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,760
Your power is proven.

358
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,240
This beast is bound.

359
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,640
Is it still able

360
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,320
to hurt anyone?

361
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,960
No.

362
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,880
Once it's sealed in Kylin Lair,

363
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,960
it will turn to dust.

364
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,360
Understood.

365
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,440
I'll report

366
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,040
to Immortal Taiyi.

367
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,760
[Sir,]

368
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,640
[near Mt. Baizhou we found]

369
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,200
[the camellia pixie]

370
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,960
[that bloomed without permission.]

371
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,400
They say

372
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,840
only the strong face trials, and only

373
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,440
after trials can they reach Heaven.

374
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,320
I can't even get past

375
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,280
the thunder that grants a human form.

376
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,520
How will I ever ascend?

377
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,560
Never mind.

378
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,680
Forget it.

379
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
Camellia pixie,

380
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,760
show yourself!

381
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,280
Are you looking for me?

382
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,760
You bloomed

383
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,960
without the floral signal.

384
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,280
By Heaven's code

385
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,280
you owe a hundred

386
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,680
lightning strikes.

387
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,280
You're here to arrest me?

388
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,400
Spare yourself.

389
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,840
As member of the Flora Clan,

390
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,520
you should know that

391
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,560
flowers may open

392
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,080
only when the signal arrives.

393
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,720
You broke the rule.

394
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,640
Punishment follows.

395
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,600
But...

396
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,400
But there's been

397
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,360
no signal for ten years!

398
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,320
This land was cursed with ten winters

399
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,960
for mankind's deceit.

400
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,360
Without spring, no signal comes.

401
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,960
The people are innocent.

402
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,440
They...

403
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,920
haven't seen a blossom in ten years.

404
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,520
Without flowers,

405
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,160
there's no spring.

406
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,640
Without spring,

407
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,080
they'll lose hope.

408
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,040
And fall into despair.

409
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,520
That itself is Heaven's judgment.

410
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,680
Judgment?

411
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,800
For gods

412
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,120
it's brief;

413
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,920
for mortals

414
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,360
it lasts a lifetime.

415
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,600
That isn't fair.

416
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,360
Fairness means

417
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,600
clear division of reward and punishment.

418
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,080
If you make mistakes,

419
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,040
you must face punishment.

420
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,760
You should face the lightning.

421
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,240
Yet you cling to foolish dreams

422
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,760
and lack true cultivation.

423
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,840
You might stray from the proper path.

424
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,840
Today, I shall extract your core,

425
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,320
so you won't break the rules again.

426
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,560
Father!

427
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,360
I'll make you witness

428
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,880
how your misplaced kindness

429
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,720
destroys those you pity.

430
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,600
[Today, I grant you my finger bone.]

431
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,880
[You shall be named Hongning now.]

432
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,920
[The Celestial Realm isn't your place.]

433
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,360
[Focus on cultivating in the mortal realm.]

434
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,840
Hongning?

435
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,520
You… You know me?

436
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,080
Eh?

437
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,040
Why can't I feel your name?

438
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,560
You were meant to cherish your life.

439
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,800
After 500 years of cultivation,

440
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,440
you achieved human form!

441
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,400
Why waste it?

442
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,360
I'm… I'm sorry!

443
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,600
It's my fault.

444
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,720
I shouldn't have done this!

445
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,840
Please don't kill me!

446
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,520
I haven't ascended yet.

447
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
[Because of me, she drifted into]

448
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,640
[this den of pixies.]

449
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,760
[If I grant her another chance… ]

450
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,520
You want to ascend?

451
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,480
I cultivated for 500 years

452
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,000
just to ascend.

453
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,680
Though born on Mt. Baizhou,

454
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
you set your heart on ascension.

455
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,160
That's impressive.

456
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,960
Can you promise me that

457
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,120
you won't leave

458
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,720
the Floral Realm after ascension?

459
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,840
Totally! I'm in!

460
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,040
I'll do whatever you say!

461
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,480
I'll follow any order!

462
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,680
Alright then.

463
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,720
I'll take you over there to endure

464
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,360
the remaining thunder punishments.

465
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,720
Really?

466
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,760
Why are you so happy?

467
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,280
If I'd known earlier, I'd…

468
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,560
Never mind!

469
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Thank you for punishing me.

470
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,960
Absurd.

471
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,760
Let's go now!

472
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,360
Ah! Wait for a moment!

473
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,080
I have two friends—

474
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,400
Ningmeng and Jiaobo.

475
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,760
I need to say goodbye

476
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,200
and have a meal with them!

477
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,680
Uh...

478
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,600
What the...?

479
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,040
What's going on?

480
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,600
[Which label does Datura take?]

481
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,120
Lotus, here's your invitation.

482
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,840
Thank you.

483
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,960
To Flora Pavilion. Proceed.

484
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,320
Thank you.

485
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,360
You, Shizu,

486
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,920
to Flora Pavilion as well.

487
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,480
Thank you.

488
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,080
Any others?

489
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,320
No one left?

490
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,280
No one.

491
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,400
In the 94,000th Celestial Year,

492
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,160
the Mt. Baizhou camellia pixie

493
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,120
bloomed against the Floral Oath—

494
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,280
definitely need to note that down.

495
00:27:59,480 --> 00:27:59,840
Official!

496
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
Don't pull me—I'm still writing!

497
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,520
C'mon, Official!

498
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,280
Stop pulling me!

499
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,920
I told you I'm not done!

500
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,760
I've got so much to write!

501
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,760
How can I ever finish?

502
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,320
But hey, look over here!

503
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,320
Cut it out! Quit bothering me!

504
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,840
Greetings, Sir.

505
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Sir,

506
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,320
why are you back so soon?

507
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,960
Here is the Celestial Realm?

508
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,160
You all are floral immortals?

509
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,800
Sir,

510
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,800
who is this junior immortal?

511
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,840
A camellia pixie here for punishment

512
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,920
of 97 heavenly thunder strikes.

513
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,040
Wait!

514
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,160
Uh...

515
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,560
Sir,

516
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,480
she's just a camellia…

517
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,080
Pixie.

518
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,680
A camellia pixie.

519
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,640
You're a pixie?

520
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,560
Yep!

521
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,240
Why do you sound so proud about it?

522
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,960
I…

523
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,120
Well... Sir,

524
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,840
a word in private.

525
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,800
Just a word.

526
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,120
Sir.

527
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,160
Sir,

528
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,880
how could you bring a pixie here?

529
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,680
This is forbidden.

530
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,760
She bloomed against Floral Oath.

531
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,280
She's here for punishment.

532
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,400
This camellia pixie has crazy power

533
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,960
and a really hateful countenance!

534
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,960
Look at her!

535
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,880
She's so unpleasant!

536
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,960
Hateful countenance?

537
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,280
Exactly.

538
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,320
Crazy power?

539
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,000
Let her remain here for now.

540
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,760
This is totally unacceptable!

541
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,840
We have no precedent for this!

542
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,920
No, no way!

543
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,880
Absolutely not!

544
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,120
Is there anything

545
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,400
as exceptional as you

546
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,000
can't handle?

547
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,360
Sir,

548
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,480
leave it to me.

549
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,120
As you said—

550
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,000
I really am that exceptional!

551
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,160
He's gone?

552
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,400
Gone.

553
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
You're not just any pixie—

554
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,840
you're from Mt. Baizhou,

555
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,440
right?

556
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,720
Are we Mt. Baizhou pixies that famous?

557
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,480
Of course! Everyone knows.

558
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,400
You reek of pixies!

559
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,960
Let me think.

560
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,720
Here's the deal:

561
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,560
you've got three options.

562
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,880
First, take all strikes at once.

563
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,520
Second, three strikes

564
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,560
per month.

565
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,840
Third, one strike daily

566
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,080
for a full season.

567
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,960
Pick one.

568
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,800
Three strikes a day?

569
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,240
It's settled.

570
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,040
Or maybe one strike every three...

571
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,960
No bargaining!

572
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,480
First, go to Floralia Palace.

573
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,160
Then

574
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,600
I'll take you to receive punishment.

575
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,400
-Got it.
-Go to Flora Pavilion...

576
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,080
Come back!

577
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,200
Come back.

578
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
Do you even know where to go?

579
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,440
With no rank and title,

580
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,520
you can only go to Flora Pavilion.

581
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,840
Come back!

582
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,000
Do you know where it is?

583
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,440
This way! This way!

584
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,280
You're so reckless.

585
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
This way! This way!

586
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,880
You!

587
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,840
We're doomed.

588
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,200
Our easy days are over.

589
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,240
Take this sacred artifact to

590
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,600
nourish the flowers of Floralia Palace.

591
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:19,920
Understood.

592
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,040
Why was Lvluo confined

593
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,600
within the Phantom Reflector?

594
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,800
Sir,

595
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,040
the artifact got wet while it was with Lvluo.

596
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,560
Envoy Apricot punished Lvluo

597
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,120
by putting her in the Reflector.

598
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,000
By Floralia Palace's rules,

599
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,920
who is the Reflector meant to detain?

600
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,360
The Reflector has no sunlight or rain—

601
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,920
it detains senior immortals who err.

602
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,880
If junior immortals go in,

603
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,640
they'll lose their quintessence.

604
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,320
After Lvluo recovers,

605
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,160
have her work in Flora Grove for three days.

606
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,920
You failed to stop Envoy Apricot.

607
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,440
Copy the floral rules thrice

608
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,880
as punishment.

609
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,680
Envoy Apricot knowingly broke the rules.

610
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,480
She must transfer a century

611
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,920
of cultivation to heal Lvluo.

612
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,680
Remind her

613
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,680
she's running out of chances.

614
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,160
Understood.

615
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Anything else?

616
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,560
Sir,

617
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,240
the NCR Matriarch

618
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,120
has been waiting for a while.

619
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,320
Turn her away.

620
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,120
She came a long way to visit you.

621
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,320
I said

622
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,560
turn her away.

623
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,400
Understood.

624
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,520
Is my posture perfect?

625
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,360
It feels like forever since Sir Jinxiu

626
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,440
came by the NCR.

627
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,320
Chances to see him grow rare.

628
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,320
Do you think he'd be happy

629
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,200
to see me?

630
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,000
I think so, too.

631
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,800
Oh no!

632
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,000
What if that Scourge Jester is around?

633
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,640
I can't stand him.

634
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,800
He vexes me.

635
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,160
Who else?

636
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,240
Kunlun Deity.

637
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,360
Envoy Plum,

638
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,440
did you inform Sir Jinxiu?

639
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,080
Matriarch,

640
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,480
Sir Jinxiu is deeply honored

641
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,639
by your visit.

642
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,480
But he's prepping for ascension

643
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,040
and is secluded in meditation

644
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,840
to decipher the Oceanic Codex.

645
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,639
We dare not disrupt his spiritual focus.

646
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,639
Are you implying

647
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,040
that seeing me would

648
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,480
compromise his composure?

649
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,280
I dare not presume.

650
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,120
That must be it!

651
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,400
Qijing.

652
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,040
Please pass this Mind-Clouding Scroll

653
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,159
to the Celestial Monarch for me.

654
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,040
He's been such a great help

655
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,480
during my duties in the NCR.

656
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,760
Consider this scroll as

657
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,360
a token of my sincere gratitude.

658
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,000
I dare not accept it for him.

659
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,239
You may present it yourself

660
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,800
when the time comes.

661
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,600
Fine.

662
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
I'll take my leave then.

663
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,320
I'll visit him again

664
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,679
during the Celestial Floralia.

665
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,960
Envoy Plum,

666
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,040
the new clan members have arrived.

667
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,400
Let's go.

668
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,520
Fellow floral immortals,

669
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,920
the Celestial Floralia is about to begin.

670
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,160
Come join us

671
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,640
at Floralia Palace.

672
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,440
Floral Deity

673
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,240
has arranged

674
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,280
accommodations for each clan.

675
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,280
As you know,

676
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,680
the Floralia is our grandest event

677
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,880
and grants Flora Clan members

678
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,360
opportunities for immortal ascension.

679
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,040
During the Floralia,

680
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,320
you must present your floral offerings

681
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,200
for evaluation by Floral Deity.

682
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,840
Those with splendid blooms

683
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,480
will be recorded in the Floral List

684
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,480
and remain for cultivation.

685
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,680
Remember,

686
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,920
Floralia Palace is a sacred place.

687
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,040
All must strictly

688
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,680
observe celestial etiquette.

689
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,760
Understood.

690
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,080
Will I really get to see Floral Deity?

691
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,040
Who are you?

692
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,520
How dare you make such commotion!

693
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
I'm Hongning.

694
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,920
I'm not a junior immortal.

695
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,200
I'm a camellia pixie!

696
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
She's a pixie?

697
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,840
Camellia pixie!

698
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,600
Where did you come from?

699
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,560
Mt. Baizhou!

700
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,720
Mt. Baizhou?

701
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,000
She came from Mt. Baizhou?

702
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,360
How did she get here?

703
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,480
The one who bloomed against Floral Oath?

704
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,240
How is she still alive?

705
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,120
Exactly.

706
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,320
This…

707
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,280
Envoy Apricot,

708
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,680
Official Chrysanthemum informed us

709
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,960
she was brought here by Floral Deity

710
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,560
for punishment.

711
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,000
Why punish her in the Celestial Realm?

712
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,520
It's said to be a severe penalty.

713
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,880
No wonder she's so unruly!

714
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,520
Take her to the Phantom Reflector!

715
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,160
Official Chrysanthemum said

716
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,200
she should enter the palace,

717
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,320
as it's Floral Deity's direct order.

718
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,920
This is outrageous!

719
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,880
Enough.

720
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,760
Since it's Floral Deity's order,

721
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,240
treat her as a new clan member.

722
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,560
Camellia Pixie.

723
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:10,840
Here!

724
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,280
I don't care why you're here.

725
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,720
At Floralia Palace,

726
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,200
you follow our rules.

727
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,160
The rules are strict,

728
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,040
so be sure

729
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,680
not to step out of line.

730
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,480
Understood.

731
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,640
Your outfit is improper.

732
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,160
You shouldn't dress like this here.

733
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,720
Exactly!

734
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,960
Shaoyao,

735
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,640
Take her down to freshen up

736
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,320
and swap outfits.

737
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,600
Don't let her sully Floralia Palace!

738
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,800
Yes.

739
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,120
That place is so beautiful!

740
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,320
Are you really a pixie?

741
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,960
Yep!

742
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,640
Shaoyao.

743
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,920
In all my years,

744
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,600
I've never seen a pixie here.

745
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,960
You dared bloom against Floral Oath.

746
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,760
I thought you had some dark magic!

747
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,880
All I can do is bloom.

748
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,320
I have no other magic.

749
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,280
Shaoyao,

750
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,320
how come

751
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,520
the peach blossoms and osmanthus here

752
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
bloom at the same time?

753
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,160
This is the Celestial Realm!

754
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,680
Mortal flowers follow seasonal cycles.

755
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,640
Floralia Palace isn't like the mortal world.

756
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,200
Its seasons and weather

757
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,240
depend on the Floral Deity's mood.

758
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,600
It can stay eternally spring

759
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,840
or suddenly turn to winter!

760
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,280
Immortals really do whatever they want.

761
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,120
But it's strange.

762
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,880
Today's blooms

763
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,960
suddenly multiplied

764
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
like spring arrived!

765
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,240
But

766
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,680
seasonal commands

767
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,640
have always been predictable.

768
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,800
Maybe Floral Deity is

769
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,640
in a good mood today!

770
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,160
Floralia Palace is stunning!

771
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,480
I've never seen so many

772
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,920
beautiful immortals and

773
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,560
such tall buildings!

774
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,160
Lower your voice!

775
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,520
The mortal realm is nothing

776
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,120
compared to our Celestial Realm!

777
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,440
The mortal world is better.

778
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,680
It has good friends

779
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,880
and delicious food.

780
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,760
Food?

781
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,800
Too much food can

782
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,200
hinder your path to immortality!

783
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,480
And the mortal world is full of pixies

784
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,480
fighting over cores every day.

785
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,160
Just thinking about it scares me.

786
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,960
Mt. Baizhou is a den of evil.

787
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,480
You truly came from there?

788
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,400
I did come from there.

789
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,320
Mt. Baizhou is wonderful.

790
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
My pixies friends

791
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,160
are all good pixies!

792
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,960
Where does Floral Deity live?

793
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,040
Quit your wild fantasies.

794
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,080
Floral Deity

795
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,800
is not someone you can just meet!

796
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,760
Doesn't she live with us?

797
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,760
Of course not!

798
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,240
Floral Deity has his own residence.

799
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,640
Those flower pavilions

800
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,120
we passed earlier

801
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,920
are reserved for high-ranking clans.

802
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,600
Sit.

803
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,120
Common wildflowers

804
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
dwell in Flora Pavilion.

805
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,760
You'll stay there too.

806
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,760
I'm not some wildflower.

807
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,760
Alright, alright. Understood!

808
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,240
Look over there.

809
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,440
Those with ribbon collars

810
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
are senior immortals!

811
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,960
Don't offend them!

812
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,680
The rules here are strict.

813
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,760
Floral Deity

814
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
shows no mercy—

815
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,000
if he catches you breaking them,

816
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,440
he'll extract your core,

817
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,680
strip your immortal register,

818
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,160
dissolve your marrow,

819
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,320
and toss you into the Kylin Lair!

820
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,720
Floral Deity is that harsh?

821
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,160
Obviously!

822
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,760
Everyone here knows.

823
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,520
I didn't expect that

824
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,200
you could survive after

825
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,840
defying the Floral Oath.

826
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,320
Why must flowers bloom only by the Oath?

827
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
It's…

828
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,800
It's the rule!

829
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,600
Shouldn't flowers

830
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,560
decide their own blooming?

831
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,120
Like humans choose

832
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,720
their own actions.

833
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,680
Where did you learn such heresy?

834
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,160
Baihe!

835
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,400
Wait here!

836
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,800
I'll ask Baihe about the inner banquet.

837
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,840
Stay put!

838
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
Don't wander off!

839
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,880
Look, it's so beautiful!

840
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,040
Excuse me, where the Flora Pavilion is?

841
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,920
Over there.

842
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,840
[Let's go.]

843
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,080
Why did you climb up there?

844
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,920
Be careful. Get down.

845
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,000
It's you?
