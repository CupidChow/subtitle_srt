[Love Never Fails]
[EP12]

3
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,910
Sir.

4
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,900
Though you

5
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,210
reshaped her.

6
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,810
What's the point?

7
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,570
I thought...

8
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,850
I'd lost you forever.

9
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,730
Her core's too weak.

10
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,210
Though she took human form,

11
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,650
she has no memories or self.

12
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,450
Give me her Rebirth Token.

13
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,050
I'll escort her.

14
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,370
Sir.

15
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,530
Your trial approaches.

16
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,170
Bridge of Destiny

17
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,570
teems with demons and mortals.

18
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,650
In your weakened state,

19
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,770
any mishap could be fatal.

20
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,130
Don't worry.

21
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,890
Just let me.

22
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,130
Alright.

23
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,730
Please be careful.

24
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,730
Hongning.

25
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,170
Let's go.

26
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,090
Fear not.

27
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,290
I will protect you.

28
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,090
Sir.

29
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,930
Though you hold the token,

30
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,970
her life book records

31
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,170
no future.

32
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,690
Do not defy destiny.

33
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,970
This is her only chance.

34
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:52,930
Move aside.

35
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,530
Sir, you must not!

36
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,690
Enough.

37
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,370
Move.

38
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,970
Blazing fire shows no mercy.

39
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,690
Forcing your way through

40
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,090
will consume you.

41
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,850
I said, move.

42
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:52,930
Hongning.

43
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,370
Don't fear.

44
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,010
I'll shield you.

45
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,010
[No...]

46
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,409
[I'll never make it like this.]

47
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,370
Hongning.

48
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,130
I can't hold much longer.

49
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,570
Listen to me.

50
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,930
If I can't keep going...

51
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,970
You must run.

52
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,450
Don't look back.

53
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,610
Hongning.

54
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,250
Run.

55
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,410
Run!

56
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,770
Run.

57
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,210
Run.

58
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,970
Hongning.

59
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,610
It's the dew.

60
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,410
Sir, don't.

61
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,130
Hongning.

62
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,330
Go.

63
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:22,770
Be brave.

64
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,490
I'll find you soon.

65
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,730
Promise me.

66
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,130
I promise.

67
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,170
When will I see her again?

68
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,490
When fate aligns, you shall.

69
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,690
Qijing...

70
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,610
We can never go back, right?

71
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,730
Jilted...

72
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,690
And reduced to desperate flight...

73
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,690
I must be the most pathetic

74
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,610
princess in NCR.

75
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:41,890
Well?

76
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,330
General.

77
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,370
Only external injuries.

78
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,170
With care, His Majesty will wake soon.

79
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,690
Then keep him

80
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,490
in healing sleep indefinitely.

81
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,810
As you command.

82
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,290
Stand guard!

83
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,130
No entry or exit.

84
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:56,970
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

85
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,330
And the Matriarch?

86
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,570
Still at large.

87
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,890
Deploy more troops.

88
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,450
Fail to retrieve her,

89
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,010
and you'll share her fate.

90
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,330
- Copy that!
- Copy that!

91
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,690
The Emperor Star decrees.

92
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,890
Both shall descend for trials.

93
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,330
Successful completion

94
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,210
grants succession rights.

95
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,730
Shouldn't Jinxiu

96
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,730
face this trial alone?

97
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,570
Why drag me along?

98
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,050
Your Emperor Star shines bright.

99
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,530
You must go.

100
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,770
As the decree,

101
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,610
guide others and purify yourself.

102
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,450
No return

103
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,130
until you make it.

104
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,290
And if we fail?

105
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,850
Repeat lifecycles until completed.

106
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,570
Wait.

107
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,450
No memories each rebirth.

108
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,530
Must I go?

109
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,450
Ask again if you dare.

110
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,290
I dare not.

111
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,330
Jinxiu.

112
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,570
You've committed a grave mistake,

113
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,250
and should be confined for penitence.

114
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,010
Only the Star's guidance

115
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,650
allows your descent.

116
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,530
I understand, Father.

117
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,850
I will not fail.

118
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,290
Your Grace.

119
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,370
There's never been

120
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,250
two deities descending for trials.

121
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,770
What's Heaven's Will playing at?

122
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,130
In the eyes of Heaven, all are pawns.

123
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,770
All we can do

124
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,530
is obey.

125
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,130
What if they fail?

126
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,410
Divine power stripped,

127
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,530
then catastrophic failure

128
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,490
brings death.

129
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,130
Death?

130
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,850
How can you be so cold?

131
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,370
It is the natural law.

132
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,770
They must trial to reign.

133
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,930
Such is the law.

134
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,090
No exceptions.

135
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,970
Foolish to expect humanity from you.

136
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,370
Hear this,

137
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,250
their trial has begun.

138
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,690
No deity may intervene.

139
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,770
In that case,

140
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,170
may you

141
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,610
get what you wish.

142
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:46,930
Mother.

143
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,250
Father.

144
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,210
About the camellia,

145
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,570
made your choice?

146
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,530
Have you thought

147
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,570
if you hadn't

148
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,650
secretly brought her up here,

149
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,010
she could have lived freely

150
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,730
in the mortal realm.

151
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,890
Ascended naturally in centuries,

152
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,090
gained celestial protection,

153
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,610
achieved immortality.

154
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,850
At your age, I too

155
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,810
clung to fleeting

156
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,570
emotions.

157
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,370
[Must you ruin yourself]

158
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,090
[for base desires?]

159
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,930
[No remorse at all?]

160
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,850
[I regret only being a deity]

161
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,930
[chained by celestial laws.]

162
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,610
[Why persist in folly?]

163
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,890
[Know you the consequences?]

164
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,970
[I made an eternal vow,]

165
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,810
[and shall honor it.]

166
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,730
[Let all punishment]

167
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,650
[fall on me alone.]

168
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,730
This love you cling to,

169
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,730
the desires,

170
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,290
all they bring

171
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,849
is harm to yourself

172
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,170
and others.

173
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,890
Think about Kunlun.

174
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,410
You've

175
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,490
doted him since childhood.

176
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,089
Yet it's this indulgence

177
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,610
that's gotten him punished repeatedly.

178
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,050
You love Hongning,

179
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,010
yet she suffered

180
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,250
soul dispersion.

181
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,170
Your fleeting pleasures

182
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,130
breed eternal

183
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,770
damnation for others.

184
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,290
Think twice.

185
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,330
Your tribulation

186
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,210
is Emperor Star's decree.

187
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,970
Whoever succeeds

188
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,050
inherits the Celestial Throne.

189
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,770
I have no interest in

190
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,570
being Emperor at all.

191
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,370
And I'm not cut out for it.

192
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,810
Nonsense!

193
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,130
Heaven marked you as Emperor Star

194
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,730
for a reason.

195
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,730
Why don't you understand?

196
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,250
I choose not to.

197
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,130
Look at Jinxiu,

198
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,530
lost all freedom.

199
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,330
That'd suffocate me!

200
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,850
Willful ignorance!

201
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,570
Fine!

202
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,370
Okay.

203
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,010
Mother.

204
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,770
I'm on my way

205
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,290
for the trial now.

206
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,450
Farewell.

207
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,690
[Finally here.]

208
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,370
[But I can't enter.]

209
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,330
[What now?]

210
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:18,730
[It's him!]

211
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:19,770
[I need to get in.]

212
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,290
- Sir.
- Sir.

213
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,330
Whose celestial pet is this?

214
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,490
[Perfect timing.]

215
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,250
I'll take you in.

216
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,770
[It worked!]

217
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,210
Sage.

218
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,410
I'll descend for trials tomorrow.

219
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,530
Is there any way

220
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,890
to keep my memories?

221
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,210
Hongning loves me deeply.

222
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,250
Yet because of me,

223
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,370
she suffered the blazing fire.

224
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,770
I'll bear any punishment,

225
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,410
if only she

226
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,570
may live in peace.

227
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,170
Thank you.

228
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,530
Your Grace.

229
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,730
My boys are descending for trials.

230
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,130
I wanna pray to the celestial ancestors

231
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,170
for their safety.

232
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,890
You're benevolent, Your Grace.

233
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,650
Please enter.

234
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,530
I, Yihe, tampered with

235
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,210
the Celestial Records out of necessity.

236
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,650
Please forgive me.

237
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,290
Let Heaven's wrath

238
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,810
fall solely on me.

239
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,010
[She altered the Records.]

240
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:16,970
[Let me check.]

241
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,970
[It restored.]

242
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,450
Rise.

243
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,530
I'll watch over you

244
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,850
from above.

245
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,930
Stay safe.

246
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,210
Brother.

247
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,770
This is a tribulation!

248
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,050
What if I'm bullied

249
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,410
in the mortal realm?

250
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,690
Who would dare?

251
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,210
Time waits for no one.

252
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,290
Go.

253
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:14,810
Brother.

254
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,330
I know you resent

255
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,570
sharing this trial.

256
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:18,650
So I've

257
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,770
made preparations.

258
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,410
Look.

259
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,090
I made a mark here.

260
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,690
I'll go north.

261
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,650
Remember this.

262
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,450
Come find me.

263
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,730
Your Majesties.

264
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,730
Sir Jinxiu and Kunlun

265
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,730
have begun their trials.

266
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,490
Everything good?

267
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,970
Sir Jinxiu reincarnated at Mt. Cangwu

268
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,170
as a junior immortal

269
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,330
guarding Cangwu Academy.

270
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,930
As he desired.

271
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,530
With demons plaguing there,

272
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,650
he'll earn merits.

273
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,730
Well enough.

274
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,610
And Kunlun?

275
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,970
Also in Cangwu,

276
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,650
as…

277
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,210
As what?

278
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,850
An ice pixie.

279
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,570
Impossible!

280
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,330
Kunlun's a senior deity.

281
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,490
How could he become a pixie?

282
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,890
Yihe.

283
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,330
Whether as human, immortal, or pixie,

284
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,090
the essence of trial remains unchanged.

285
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,530
Yes, that's right.

286
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:41,970
Historical records show

287
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,330
deities pixie-reborn before.

288
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,370
No need for concern.

289
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,170
Indeed.

290
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,170
The trial has begun.

291
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,290
No interference.

292
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,170
Or else

293
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,650
Heaven's wrath will strike.

294
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,810
[Is this Heaven's]

295
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,090
[punishment for me?]

296
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,450
[Mt. Cangwu borders]

297
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,090
[between NCR and Celestial Realm,]

298
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,490
[where immortals, pixies,]

299
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,330
[and mortals mingle.]

300
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,210
[NCR weakens,]

301
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,810
[Cangwu descends into chaos,]

302
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,330
[people suffer.]

303
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,170
[Yet the savior Cangwu emerges,]

304
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,810
[protecting the region for centuries.]

305
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,970
Honey!

306
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,650
Gentlemen, have mercy!

307
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,970
Spare my wife.

308
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,050
She's with child!

309
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:57,690
Right.

310
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,570
Here's money.

311
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,450
Take it all, please!

312
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,090
We'll take the money...

313
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:01,730
Please!

314
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,370
And the woman.

315
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,050
Please don't!

316
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,370
Honey.

317
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:21,970
Honey.

318
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:23,650
You alright?

319
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,250
Thank you!

320
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,410
Appreciate it!

321
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,090
We'll repay this kindness!

322
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,170
No need.

323
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,090
She's everything.

324
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,770
I must guard her.

325
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,410
Keep this hairpin

326
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,210
for the child.

327
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,170
Sir.

328
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,730
The child has no name.

329
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:03,890
Could you

330
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,570
give her a name?

331
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,370
Hongning.

332
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,450
Hongning.

333
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,850
To ensure her safety,

334
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,850
keep her from Cangwu.

335
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,650
[May this life]

336
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,890
[free you from past karma.]

337
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,370
[Live without sorrow.]

338
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,210
Hongning.

339
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,130
[Hongning.]

340
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,210
[Hongning.]

341
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,010
Fun, isn't it?

342
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,570
Oh, flying!

343
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,410
Hurry, climb up!

344
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,730
Give me your hand.

345
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:18,850
Come on.

346
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:20,850
Higher!

347
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:22,930
Careful!

348
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,810
Help!

349
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,730
Help!

350
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:12,650
Master.

351
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,450
You went to NCR again.

352
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,290
Merely

353
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,770
hunting some demons.

354
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,010
Since swearing allegiance,

355
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,490
consider this your rebirth.

356
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,010
Forget those

357
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,490
painful memories in NCR.

358
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,890
Some wounds

359
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,770
don't fade easily.

360
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,010
You still care for her, right?

361
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,650
I don't understand.

362
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,250
If you do,

363
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,450
why not visit her?

364
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,130
Cangwu

365
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,890
borders NCR and Celestial Realm.

366
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,450
For years,

367
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,970
demons have coveted this territory.

368
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,370
Raising her here

369
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,970
would endanger her.

370
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,210
Last life,

371
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,810
she died because of me.

372
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,090
Better stay apart.

373
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:13,890
[Master,]

374
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,050
[An ice pixie invaded the academy!]

375
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,330
On my way.

376
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,850
Can't even handle a minor pixie?

377
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,490
Let me go!

378
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:54,690
Master.

379
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,490
What...

380
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,210
[That's all you've got?]

381
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,570
[ You can't stop me!]

382
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,050
[Useless fools.]

383
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,050
Huh, Mt. Cangwu?

384
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,690
Not as impressive as I expected.

385
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,370
A mere illusion

386
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,290
costs you so much effort.

387
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,490
How dare you

388
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,930
insult the Academy?

389
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,810
I'll teach you a lesson.

390
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:30,650
Lujiu.

391
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,010
Stay calm.

392
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,890
I'll be your opponent.

393
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,450
Interesting.

394
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,610
You!

395
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,210
I heard all pixies here fear you.

396
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,970
Let's see how strong

397
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,290
you really are.

398
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,370
Can you survive three moves?

399
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,170
Deal.

400
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,530
It's over.

401
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,610
What sorcery is this?

402
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,490
Cheater!

403
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,770
Fight fair!

404
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,490
Stop using dark magic!

405
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:39,970
You're an ice pixie.

406
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,970
I just need to infuse

407
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,330
the power of fire,

408
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,330
and your magic will be useless.

409
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:55,930
[Look.]

410
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,610
[I made a mark here.]

411
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,290
[I'll go north.]

412
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,210
[Remember this.]

413
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,090
[Come find me.]

414
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:05,810
Master.

415
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,370
I'll throw him in the dungeon!

416
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,969
What are you doing?

417
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:12,969
Kunlun?

418
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,969
Why are you an ice pixie?

419
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,530
Kunlun...

420
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,650
What a question...

421
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,090
Born from ice, of course

422
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,250
I'm an ice pixie.

423
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,690
So what?

424
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,969
Just lock me up.

425
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:23,610
You...

426
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,170
Master.

427
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,250
He causes endless

428
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,090
trouble.

429
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,370
Let me extract his core!

430
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,570
Master, he's still young.

431
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:31,770
The dungeon's

432
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:32,690
too harsh.

433
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,530
Just let him go

434
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,610
and leave him be.

435
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,449
You're gonna let me go?

436
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,530
Considering your age,

437
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,530
we'll spare you this time.

438
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,370
Go.

439
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,250
Don't wanna stay in this dump anyway.

440
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,010
Wait.

441
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,050
Wanna learn magic from me?

442
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,090
Master!

443
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,130
You'd really teach me?

444
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,290
Yeah.

445
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,410
But...

446
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,130
Three conditions.

447
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,650
First, no harming others.

448
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,330
Second, follow the rules here.

449
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,290
Cultivate like other

450
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,330
disciples.

451
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,890
Easy enough.

452
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,090
Third.

453
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,130
Plant trees on the back mountain.

454
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,410
Plant trees?

455
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:23,570
Why?

456
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,490
Yes or no?

457
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,090
Fine, whatever.

458
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,370
But

459
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,490
I have three terms too.

460
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,410
Master accepted you

461
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,250
yet you show no gratitude

462
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,450
and dare make demands?

463
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,130
Go on.

464
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,170
First,

465
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,650
no chores like

466
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,330
fetching firewood or water.

467
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:42,610
Second,

468
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,650
no scolding or hitting.

469
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,010
Third,

470
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,890
I've offended many humans and pixies.

471
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,970
If they seek revenge,

472
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:51,930
you handle it.

473
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:54,850
Deal.

474
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,010
Fine.

475
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,090
Now show me my quarters.

476
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,490
[Reincarnated, yet still]

477
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,690
[the same temper.]

478
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,130
Master.

479
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,170
This pixie's powerful

480
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,330
and hot-tempered.

481
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,450
Keeping him here

482
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,010
could be a disaster.

483
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,250
Leaving him elsewhere

484
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,810
would be worse.

485
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:49,770
I've long heard

486
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,690
Sir Kunlun is domineering.

487
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,690
If he knew he was reborn as a pixie,

488
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,970
he'd raze Mt. Cangwu.

489
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,370
This barren forest

490
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,210
is his karmic debt.

491
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:01,850
Let him

492
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,930
redeem it here.

493
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,490
You're so nice to your brother.

494
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,410
Master.

495
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:11,890
There's something

496
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,050
I've kept hidden.

497
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,490
Don't know how to put it.

498
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,410
What is it?

499
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,290
Do you know

500
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,410
you almost became a pixie?

501
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,050
Yihe did it.

502
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,690
I saw her alter the

503
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:29,930
celestial records.

504
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,930
She swapped your fates.

505
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,570
How did you enter?

506
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,130
I...

507
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,290
Er...

508
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,210
I was looking for you...

509
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:43,930
The guards

510
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,970
can't resist my mind-control.

511
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,090
Entering was easy.

512
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,530
Lujiu!

513
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,370
I took you in because

514
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,690
you were homeless.

515
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,210
Yet you

516
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,450
invade the sanctum

517
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,930
so recklessly.

518
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,370
Master.

519
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,890
I didn't do

520
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,410
anything bad there.

521
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,250
I just wanted to find you.

522
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:07,850
My mother

523
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,890
seems strict with Kunlun,

524
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,290
but she cares for him deeply.

525
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,210
I suppose she

526
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,610
treats me the same way.

527
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,810
I've never known

528
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,530
parental love,

529
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,530
so I can't understand.

530
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,410
Bailing's naughty.

531
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,370
And some disciples dislike him.

532
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,130
I'm entering seclusion tomorrow.

533
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,490
You...

534
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,410
Cangwu embraces

535
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,410
and guides all beings.

536
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,850
If he seeks goodness,

537
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,010
we should accept him.

538
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,810
Master, all these years,

539
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,370
you've protected the people

540
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,570
and guide the pixies.

541
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:06,890
I remember

542
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:07,770
your teachings.

543
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,210
I'll tell other disciples

544
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,530
to guide him

545
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,690
to the righteous path.

546
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:15,890
And...

547
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:16,570
And

548
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,530
I'll protect Hongning

549
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,850
and Wang Village.

550
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,810
Rest assured.

551
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:28,730
Bailing.

552
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,210
Keep working.

553
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,050
Yeah, yeah.

554
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:32,930
Go on, go.

555
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,050
[Sir.]

556
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,770
[Sir.]

557
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,730
[Can I be your consort?]

558
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,930
[Sir.]

559
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,930
[Truth is, I hate cultivation.]

560
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,610
[Hongning.]

561
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,730
[Another nightmare?]

562
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,410
Mom.

563
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,490
You're drenched in sweat.

564
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,530
Same dream?

565
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:41,610
But...

566
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,890
I still don't know who he is.

567
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,130
It's just a dream.

568
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,930
Don't be afraid.

569
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,370
I'm with you.

570
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:54,890
Look at you,

571
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,690
freezing cold.

572
00:40:58,930 --> 00:40:59,490
Mom.

573
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,850
Why do I keep dreaming of him?

574
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,690
Who is he?

575
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:07,930
Don't dwell on it.

576
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,210
Just a dream.

577
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,530
[No!]

578
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,450
Pathetic minor pixie

579
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,610
daring to defy fate?

580
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,050
Who are you?

581
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,090
After living

582
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,410
as human this long,

583
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,010
you actually think you're one of them?

584
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,090
What do you want?

585
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,410
I know

586
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,770
you fell for

587
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,490
a camellia.

588
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,450
You know her?

589
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,690
How is she?

590
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:28,930
She

591
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,690
ascended.

592
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,250
She survived.

593
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,730
She survived.

594
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,650
Pixies have had no peace for millennia.

595
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,490
Trapped in this Kylin Lair,

596
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,730
you've

597
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,810
suffered much.

598
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,410
We're both pixies.

599
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,610
Kin.

600
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:20,130
They

601
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,770
are our enemies.

602
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:26,130
No!

603
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,410
I'm nothing like you!

604
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,410
Do you know,

605
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,930
banished from immortal realms,

606
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,930
fallen into Demotion Pool,

607
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:43,050
you'll never ascend.

608
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,170
I know.

609
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,850
Yet your camellia

610
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,730
is in Celestial Realm,

611
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,250
mingles with deities,

612
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,530
even loves one.

613
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,450
Soon she'll

614
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,330
stand against you.

615
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,490
Abandon you...

616
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,010
Betray you...

617
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,170
Even

618
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,250
worse.

619
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:25,930
Impossible.

620
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,650
She'd never betray me!

621
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,490
Pixies are pixies.

622
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,530
We can never ascend.

623
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,210
It's all a lie.

624
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:51,970
Fool.

625
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,490
I won't kill you.

626
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,530
If one day

627
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,290
she betrays you,

628
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:05,530
you'll know the pain.

629
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,890
That day will never come!

630
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:11,810
Wait and see.

631
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,370
Hongning...

632
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,610
Hongning...

633
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,050
[She'd never betray me!]

634
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:28,770
Never!
