[Love Never Fails]
[EP17]

3
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,600
How did you get in here?

4
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,280
Bailing gave me his token.

5
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,920
I was just curious to have a look around.

6
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,360
Technically,

7
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,000
someone of your level isn't allowed here.

8
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,360
But well,

9
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,480
you're gifted

10
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,240
and should be alright.

11
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,800
Follow me.

12
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,240
Hey, easy!

13
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,560
Whoa, whoa, hold on!

14
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,840
What's wrong?

15
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,560
This...

16
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,520
isn't this a pill-making furnace?

17
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,000
Easy there, alright?

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,880
Oh no, this isn't for making pills.

19
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,160
It's for refining practitioners.

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,560
It's called mist cultivation.

21
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,320
You expose yourself to herbal vapors

22
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
to boost your powers.

23
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,520
But here's the catch:

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,120
these herbs are poisonous.

25
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,200
Beginners like you might not be able

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,079
to resist the toxins.

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,760
That's why

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,480
we only give access tokens

29
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,720
to disciples who have

30
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,640
proven themselves capable.

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,520
[Hey,]

32
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,320
[what's with you?]

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,560
[Alright, I'll be gentle.]

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,480
Ningmeng?

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,440
Ningmeng!

36
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,800
Ningmeng!

37
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,880
Hongning!

38
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,240
Hongning,

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
What a surprise to see you here!

40
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,360
Here, try this tea first.

41
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,680
This tea is absolutely delightful.

42
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,000
Come on, take a sip.

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,760
Why are you just staring? Just try it.

44
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,400
Hongning...

45
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,000
By the way,

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,079
what brings you here?

47
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,440
And why are you dressed like this?

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,040
You really don't know why I'm like this?

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,920
I've been worried sick about you!

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,520
Did they hurt you?

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,800
Are you injured?

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,760
Look how thin you've become!

53
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,880
I was terrified they'd thrown you

54
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,360
into those furnaces

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,320
to make pills!

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,960
Look, I'm perfectly fine!

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,320
Oh, yeah,

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,520
girls aren't allowed in Cangwu Academy.

59
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,560
Don't get yourself caught!

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,240
Why don't you shout a little louder?

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,600
Be careful not to get caught...

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,640
You know, Hongning,

63
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,520
it means a lot that you

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
came all this way to rescue me.

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,480
So about that massage session I saw...

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
When Mr. Frostbite

67
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,320
first dragged me here,

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,200
I thought I was going to

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,440
end up in those furnaces.

70
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,800
but...

71
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,959
Greetings, sir.

72
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,640
You can kill me, but don't humiliate me!

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,040
I won't let you disgrace me!

74
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,040
What's going on here?

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,440
I'm just a harmless little demon

76
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
who dreams of becoming an immortal.

77
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
I've never harmed a soul,

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,360
yet he kidnapped me for no reason!

79
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
No reason?

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,200
Who knocked me out with lemon juice?

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,480
It takes two to tango!

82
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,680
Why would I attack you

83
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,000
if you hadn't started it first?

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,880
Enough.

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,440
Settle your personal grudges

86
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,480
in private.

87
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,920
Now, you mentioned

88
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,240
wanting to pursue immortality.

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,280
Did you mean it?

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,720
So what?

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,240
You've got a problem?

92
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:56,760
What are you doing?

93
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Are you going to silence me?

94
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,159
Someone help me!

95
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
He said I have potential,

96
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,200
but my high toxicity levels made me

97
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,400
unsuitable for regular training.

98
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,680
Instead, I can handle the mist cultivation.

99
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,720
So I ended up

100
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,360
giving others some massages

101
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,200
while pursuing immortality together!

102
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,360
Pursuing immortality?

103
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,000
Right!

104
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,040
I've been trying to get word to you,

105
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,480
but couldn't find an opportunity.

106
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,680
But hey, you showed up on your own!

107
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,120
I was worried sick about you!

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,120
I was so afraid you were in danger.

109
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
I looked everywhere for you.

110
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,400
I even imagined

111
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,720
they might have thrown you

112
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,760
into the dungeon!

113
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,159
Truth is,

114
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,960
I was absolutely terrified at first.

115
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,480
Remember?

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,240
We both knew Cangwu Academy

117
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,440
was famous for hunting down demons.

118
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,360
But listen to this:

119
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
after I got here,

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,960
I found that the demons

121
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,560
they keep in the dungeons are the evil ones,

122
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,120
you know, those who murder,

123
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,360
plunder, and steal people's cores.

124
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,080
For ordinary ones like me,

125
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,800
it's all voluntary.

126
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,000
If you're willing to cultivate,

127
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,200
they let you stay and practice.

128
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,000
And if you're not interested?

129
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,960
Master gives you some friendly advice,

130
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,320
and you're free to go.

131
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,840
He sounds more understanding

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,360
than I thought.

133
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,680
He's not bad.

134
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,520
I used to think

135
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,280
he was awful,

136
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,640
but now I see he's actually...

137
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,480
pretty decent.

138
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,600
A nice guy.

139
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,040
You knew him before?

140
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,560
Well, I'm a demon.

141
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,240
Of course I know more than you do!

142
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,600
Ningmeng,

143
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,040
you're not as sour as you used to be!

144
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,159
After all this steaming

145
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,320
day in and day out,

146
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,200
I've lost my lemony powers!

147
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,960
Hey Hongning,

148
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,840
why don't you join us in cultivation?

149
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,120
No thanks! Cultivation isn't my thing.

150
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,760
Besides, I'm a woman.

151
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,760
I'd be dead meat

152
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,720
if they found out.

153
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,960
Hongning! Bath time!

154
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,080
Come on!

155
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,240
Hurry up.

156
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,040
Scrub my back!

157
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,080
Bath time...

158
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,840
[Now that I've found Ningmeng,]

159
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,120
[I should leave right away.]

160
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,840
[But I'm really curious.]

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,640
[Could the one in my dreams]

162
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,320
[really be master?]

163
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,400
Bailing,

164
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,640
has master always been so distant?

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,600
Is it because of the wounds on his back?

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,880
Those wounds...why are they so terrible?

167
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
How did you find out about his wounds?

168
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
You don't know either?

169
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,720
Is it some kind of secret?

170
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,880
Oh, by the way,

171
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
could you help me

172
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,320
get some herbs?

173
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,360
Herbs?

174
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,920
What do you need herbs for?

175
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,200
Who are these herbs for? Let me see.

176
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,320
Mind your own business.

177
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,240
Master's back injuries

178
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,880
seem so familiar,

179
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,520
yet I can't quite place them.

180
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,440
Where could I have seen them?

181
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,640
Your herbs.

182
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,440
Thanks!

183
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,880
This is for you.

184
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,720
What's wrong with you?

185
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,320
I...

186
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,520
That woman from Xuyun Temple

187
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,600
saw his injured hand

188
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,720
and asked me to bring him herbs.

189
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,039
I'm leaving.

190
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,560
He's also...

191
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,040
Thanks!

192
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,080
Why would she send me herbs?

193
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,160
Probably because you're both foxes.

194
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
She's a fox too?

195
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,440
I didn't say anything!

196
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,480
Why would she buy me herbs?

197
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,280
Hongning,

198
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,200
what brings you here?

199
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,920
Um...

200
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,640
Here to see master?

201
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,560
Don't mind me,

202
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,160
go ahead, go on...

203
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,120
If you're already here,

204
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
why not step inside?

205
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,760
Master,

206
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,040
they said you were resting,

207
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,000
so I hate to disturb you.

208
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,840
What brings you?

209
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,080
What's this...?

210
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,960
I heard about your burns.

211
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,640
These are herbs

212
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,000
I specifically asked Bailing to prepare.

213
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,320
It's my family's secret formula,

214
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,920
never fails to work.

215
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,160
I plan to make them into medicine.

216
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,320
It's our family's secret remedy.

217
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,120
They're known to heal burns.

218
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,360
Those injuries of yours are burns.

219
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,440
Don't trouble yourself with this again.

220
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,960
These

221
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,560
won't work on my injuries.

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,520
Master,

223
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,320
we have an emergency!

224
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,320
What is it?

225
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,080
Someone's causing trouble at Cangwu!

226
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,280
Release Hongning!

227
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,040
Turn her over!

228
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,840
We understand your demands...

229
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,000
Please,

230
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,160
everyone calm down.

231
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,960
Let's handle this peacefully.

232
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,920
Everyone, please remain calm.

233
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,160
Have patience,

234
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,120
everything will be fine.

235
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,000
Give us Hongning!

236
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,080
Please, everyone stay calm!

237
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Please settle down.

238
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,240
Bring out Hongning!

239
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,720
We want Hongning back!

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,600
Greetings, master!

241
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,280
Give us Hongning!

242
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,320
Hey, say something...

243
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,240
It's you...

244
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,840
Who...who's this?

245
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
I don't care who you are!

246
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,480
Return my daughter immediately!

247
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:04,840
Stop!

248
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,520
Or

249
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,720
I'll have them tear your academy apart!

250
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,560
Quiet!

251
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,360
Everyone, be quiet!

252
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,080
Hand over Hongning!

253
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,320
Give her back!

254
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,920
Silence.

255
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,840
He...

256
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,280
this is the savior

257
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,800
who once helped us!

258
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,720
Savior...

259
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,400
Hongning is pursuing cultivation here.

260
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,080
Please follow me.

261
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,200
Alright.

262
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,760
Take it.

263
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,640
Hey...

264
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,760
What's going on here?

265
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,040
Here's tea

266
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
from the sacred woods

267
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,760
behind the mountain.

268
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,880
Please, enjoy.

269
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
It's fine, fine, really fine.

270
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,200
I'm alright.

271
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,880
What are you doing?

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,680
Clean that up!

273
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,600
Sit down!

274
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,400
Please excuse our clumsiness, master.

275
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,720
I wasn't aware Hongning

276
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,760
left home without your permission.

277
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,280
I apologize for causing you worry.

278
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,360
No, no, it's quite alright.

279
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,920
Hongning!

280
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,760
Hongning!

281
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,080
-You've been gone so long.
-Mom, dad!

282
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,000
I've been worried sick!

283
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,640
Yeah!

284
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,000
Dad, mom,

285
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
your son is doing great,

286
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,480
really great!

287
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,120
Son?

288
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,840
Son?

289
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,360
What are you talking about?

290
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,360
Me, I...

291
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,960
am your son, son!

292
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,000
What's wrong with your voice?

293
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,240
And why are you dressed like this?

294
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,080
Mom,

295
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,000
you must be confused

296
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,240
from missing me so much.

297
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,600
I know it's my fault.

298
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,840
I left

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,720
for so long

300
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
without even

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,960
saying a word.

302
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,040
But you see,

303
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,640
as a man,

304
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,080
I need to achieve something

305
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,600
before I can support a family.

306
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,520
Right, dad?

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,760
My girl, what are you saying?

308
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,640
Maybe he doesn't get it,

309
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,280
but mom,

310
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,720
it's good you had a son.

311
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,640
If I'd been born

312
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,960
a daughter,

313
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,880
I couldn't remain here

314
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,520
at Mt. Cangwu.

315
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,640
I wouldn't be allowed

316
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,960
to be a disciple in here.

317
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,480
How could I continue my cultivation then?

318
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,320
So if you were a daughter,

319
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,480
you couldn't stay here,

320
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,040
is that it?

321
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,120
Exactly!

322
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,840
What are you two going on about?

323
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
I'm completely lost.

324
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,920
Just keep your mouth shut.

325
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,400
Son,

326
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,840
you stay here and take care of yourself.

327
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,240
What are you two really talking about?

328
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,120
You wouldn't understand.

329
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,120
Master,

330
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,280
please excuse my parents.

331
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,520
They're just...

332
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,760
ordinary folks.

333
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,360
I don't mind,

334
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,400
just as Hongning's true gender

335
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,400
doesn't bother me either.

336
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,640
This way, please come in.

337
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,480
Such an impressive

338
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,000
guest chamber!

339
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,880
Careful, watch your step.

340
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Husband, are you alright?

341
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,000
That doorstep's as high as

342
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,080
my bed!

343
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,880
Master,

344
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,440
when did you see through my disguise?

345
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,440
From the moment you arrived.

346
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,240
Then why did you choose to remain silent?

347
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,120
Halt.

348
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,120
Greetings, Bailing.

349
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,120
Leave it to me.

350
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,880
You may excuse yourself.

351
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,800
Yes.

352
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,480
Go ahead, eat.

353
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,120
How did it go?

354
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,840
Delivered.

355
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,960
Don't worry about it.

356
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,040
Well, well...

357
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,440
You're quite connected, aren't you?

358
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,720
You know both master and fox.

359
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,120
Should've graced us with your presence sooner.

360
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,680
This guest room could've been yours all along.

361
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,560
Drop that sarcastic tone.

362
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,680
Me? Sarcastic?

363
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,360
With all your connections,

364
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,840
I'm just worried Fox

365
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,840
might come after me again.

366
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,560
Can we have one normal conversation?

367
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,800
And to think I believed

368
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,200
you were a helpless little girl

369
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,560
without any connections.

370
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,920
How naive of me.

371
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,720
Oh, Bailing...

372
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,120
You haven't changed one bit.

373
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,960
How interesting that

374
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,000
you speak as if you know me from before.

375
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,760
I don't know what's gotten into you,

376
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,520
but if you can't have a normal conversation,

377
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,520
then leave.

378
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,880
Fine,

379
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,920
whatever.

380
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,880
I was such a fool, rescuing you,

381
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,520
bringing you here,

382
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,640
feeding you, gathering funds for you,

383
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,840
constantly worried about your safety.

384
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:01,960
But now that

385
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,480
you've found your old acquaintances,

386
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,600
I'm no longer needed,

387
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,400
am I?

388
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,240
I'll show myself out.

389
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,200
Hongning,

390
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,840
why the long face?

391
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,040
Got a lecture from master?

392
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,120
Come on,

393
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,000
you can't be that sensitive.

394
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,720
I made a mistake.

395
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
Broke the rules.

396
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,640
Oh...

397
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
So what?

398
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,200
Listen here, rookie,

399
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,680
out of Cangwu Academy's 1008 rules,

400
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,040
I've broken at least 500 of them.

401
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,640
Yet here I am, alive and kicking!

402
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,880
But I broke Cangwu's

403
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,240
most important rule.

404
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,920
What, did you kill someone?

405
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,200
No, no, absolutely not!

406
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,400
Steal something?

407
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,359
Only your token...

408
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,520
You little...

409
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,160
Oh, this token...

410
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,319
It's nothing important, right?

411
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,560
Don't worry.

412
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,319
When I was little,

413
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,640
I stole master's money, artifacts,

414
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,360
swords, you name it.

415
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,840
Look at me now, perfectly fine!

416
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,360
Actually,

417
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,800
I...

418
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,760
What's going on here?

419
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,960
Wang Hongning,

420
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,200
you've deceived us by

421
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,160
entering Cangwu Academy disguised as a man.

422
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
Come to the main hall for judgment.

423
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,960
You've got to be kidding...

424
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,720
You're a GIRL?

425
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,160
Hongning,

426
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,760
do you admit your wrongdoing?

427
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
I do.

428
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,000
I am, in fact, female.

429
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,760
A female?

430
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,640
Oh heavens!

431
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,880
This will shake Cangwu to its core!

432
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,880
Our academy has maintained

433
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,040
a male-only tradition for a millennium.

434
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,800
What was your true purpose

435
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,240
in coming here?

436
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,600
Actually, I just...

437
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,520
It was all because of me.

438
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,680
And what do you have to do with this?

439
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,200
Hongning is actually my friend.

440
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,160
She misunderstood.

441
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,920
She thought Bailing would harm me.

442
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,360
So she disguised herself as a man

443
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,000
and entered Cangwu to save me.

444
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,160
If anyone's to blame,

445
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,040
it's Bailing.

446
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,800
Well...

447
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,680
I suppose I am partly responsible...

448
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,440
Taste this!

449
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,600
Wait, no! This isn't entirely my fault!

450
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
You two conspired together.

451
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,160
Not only did you steal my belongings,

452
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,920
but you also sprayed me with

453
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,120
that lemon juice of yours!

454
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,160
I had every right to act!

455
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,960
My fellow disciples.

456
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,800
And honestly,

457
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,320
what's so

458
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,560
frightening about Cangwu anyway?

459
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,800
This all goes back to...

460
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,880
Lujiu!

461
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,960
You see,

462
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,520
he's been looming over

463
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,560
our village like

464
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,560
some fierce guardian.

465
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,360
He's so intimidating

466
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,880
that our villagers break into cold sweats

467
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,800
just hearing about Cangwu.

468
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,160
Well, well, Lujiu,

469
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,240
looks like this is all on you!

470
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,160
How did I end up being the bad guy?

471
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,760
Master,

472
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
it's all my fault!

473
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,760
I'm utterly useless!

474
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,080
Everything is my fault!

475
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,600
Alright, alright, get up.

476
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,640
Hongning,

477
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
while we understand your desire

478
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,560
to help your friend,

479
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
you've still broken Cangwu's sacred law.

480
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,760
According to our rules,

481
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
you must leave.

482
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:16,880
Hold on!

483
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,480
She's a girl, so what?

484
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,160
Seriously, what's wrong with it?

485
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,080
Thank you master,

486
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,120
and Wenxin,

487
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,720
and

488
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,920
all my fellow disciples.

489
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,880
Who says we don't accept female disciples?

490
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,000
Step forward and fight me!

491
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,000
Enough.

492
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,760
Since you all

493
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,280
have strong opinions about this matter,

494
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,280
why don't we try

495
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,560
a different approach today?

496
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,480
Master.

497
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
As everyone knows,

498
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,400
Cangwu has followed ancestral teachings,

499
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,560
accepting only male disciples for millennia,

500
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,720
never female ones.

501
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,560
But times have changed,

502
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,560
and this rule

503
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,040
has caused many issues.

504
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,280
So today,

505
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,560
we will discuss this precept

506
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
and hold a vote,

507
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,760
decided by the majority

508
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,080
on whether to keep this ancestral rule.

509
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,840
Each of your votes

510
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,720
will shape Cangwu's future path.

511
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,200
Moreover,

512
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,840
it will redefine

513
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,040
our bonds of fellowship.

514
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,240
Now, let the affirmative side speak first.

515
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,800
I'll go first.

516
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,640
I

517
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,240
still for accepting only men.

518
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,520
The reason is simple,

519
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,040
this rule

520
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,080
was set by our ancestors.

521
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,280
Without rules, there's no order.

522
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,280
If we break this rule,

523
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,200
what rule can't be

524
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,360
broken next?

525
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,160
Right?

526
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,120
I,

527
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,520
Bailing,

528
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,200
am the biggest

529
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,920
rule breaker in Cangwu.

530
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,680
If we always followed tradition,

531
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,880
I would've been expelled long ago.

532
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:38,960
Then

533
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,280
the world would lose

534
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,920
an outstanding demon hunter,

535
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,960
instead,

536
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,160
there'd be one more

537
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,440
calamitous fiend.

538
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,560
That this didn't happen

539
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,640
is entirely

540
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,800
thanks to

541
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,520
all fellow brothers' tolerance.

542
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
This proves rules are rigid,

543
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
but people are flexible.

544
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,400
I hope you'll all

545
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,960
cast your precious votes for me.

546
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,920
Otherwise,

547
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,480
I can't guarantee

548
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,840
what deranged things

549
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,920
I might do.

550
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,840
Bailing.

551
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,600
Sorry.

552
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,640
Go for it.

553
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Rules are rules.

554
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,520
They can't be broken.

555
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,880
That's it?

556
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,920
That's it.

557
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,880
What?

558
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,600
Did I say something wrong?

559
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,320
No, you didn't.

560
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,080
Well said.

561
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,920
Just a bit

562
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,880
repetitive.

563
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,520
I was emphasizing.

564
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,880
Hongning,

565
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
you'll speak last.

566
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,160
These are records Baibuqu just gave me,

567
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,600
all factual accounts.

568
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,400
I have three points.

569
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,120
First,

570
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,080
based on the records,

571
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,680
men and women cultivating together

572
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,680
has always been reasonable and normal.

573
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,400
Men practice the Yang Path,

574
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,920
while women practice the Yin path.

575
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,480
Many sects

576
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,080
accept both

577
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,680
men and women disciples.

578
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Second,

579
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,600
Baibuqu's research shows

580
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,360
in fact

581
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,560
Cangwu originally excluded women

582
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,680
due to a misunderstanding.

583
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,200
Five centuries ago,

584
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,920
Cangwu Academy and Xuyun Temple

585
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,160
were one sect.

586
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,920
But because

587
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,720
male and female disciples couldn't live together,

588
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,520
they split into two.

589
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,880
And third,

590
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,440
I believe a renowned

591
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,280
academy like Cangwu

592
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,440
should transcend gender,

593
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,760
offering every cultivator

594
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,320
a chance to do good deeds.

595
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,680
That's right!

596
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,440
Well said.

597
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,440
Good point.

598
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,480
Exactly!

599
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,080
Alright,

600
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,320
everyone,

601
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,320
anything else to add?

602
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,480
Tiannanxing,

603
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,440
Lujiu,

604
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,840
do you two

605
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,120
still insist

606
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,840
Hongning cannot stay on the mountain?

607
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,640
She...

608
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,520
Even though she's a woman,

609
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,040
it doesn't really

610
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,560
affect us.

611
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,040
That's right.

612
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,680
She's quite considerate.

613
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,040
I think having a junior sister

614
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,920
is quite nice.

615
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,240
Wenxin,

616
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,320
as team leader,

617
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,400
what is your opinion

618
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,200
Master,

619
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,480
I recall

620
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,360
that since Cangwu Academy's founding,

621
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
there has always been one rule,

622
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
Cangwu does not accept female disciples.

623
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,720
Xuyun Temple next door does not accept male ones.

624
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,080
Yet I never knew Cangwu and Xuyun

625
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,720
shared such deep roots.

626
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,120
I've been too rigid.

627
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,320
Cultivation

628
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,480
does not distinguish between immortal, demon, or human,

629
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,160
much less between man or woman, young or old.

630
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
So why should Cangwu

631
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,160
have rules dividing genders?

632
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,320
Cangwu's foundation

633
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,840
is cultivation,

634
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
not rule-making.

635
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,720
Moreover,

636
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,640
Cangwu's rules

637
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,360
needed adjustment.

638
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,400
Hongning's situation

639
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,400
became the catalyst

640
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,000
for this discussion.

641
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,240
The outcome

642
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
was reached collectively.

643
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,880
I believe

644
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,160
everyone has been fully convinced.

645
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,360
In truth, this is my fault.

646
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,720
I've known

647
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,920
Hongning's true identity all along

648
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
that she's a woman.

649
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,560
I intended to send her away.

650
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,360
But due to demon disturbances,

651
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,320
she stayed temporarily.

652
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,680
Later,

653
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,520
when she found the sacred artifact,

654
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,120
I took her as my disciple.

655
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,640
Thus,

656
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,280
I should also be punished.

657
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,680
Master, your actions were understandable.

658
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,200
Yes,

659
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,240
understandable.

660
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,480
If Hongning came here searching for someone,

661
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,960
why isn't that understandable?

662
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,040
Master,

663
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,160
if in the future

664
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,480
we encounter unreasonable rules,

665
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,760
can we also propose changes?

666
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,040
Naturally.

667
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,400
Therefore, today,

668
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,320
I declare

669
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,400
Cangwu's rule against female disciples

670
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,640
is abolished.

671
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,320
Good! Good!

672
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,640
Good!

673
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,440
If the Punishers

674
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,200
question this in the future,

675
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,600
I'll bear the consequences.

676
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,560
Thank you, Master!

677
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,560
Wang Hongning,

678
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,720
you're too reckless!

679
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,440
You've been away from home so long,

680
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,000
do you know how worried your father is?

681
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,040
Mother,

682
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,440
I'm sorry.

683
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
I didn't explain properly

684
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,440
before running off alone.

685
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,080
This isn't about explanations!

686
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,040
With all the demons on Mt. Cangwu,

687
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,600
how could you just come here alone?

688
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,960
What were you thinking?

689
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Even if you wanted to save someone,

690
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,240
you

691
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
should've planned carefully!

692
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,520
Alright, enough.

693
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,760
Don't be too hard on her.

694
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,560
She was trying to save a friend.

695
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,440
That's understandable.

696
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,960
Besides,

697
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,920
Cangwu doesn't seem

698
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,360
so scary after all, right?

699
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,080
Yes,

700
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,720
Hongning,

701
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,200
your mother is right.

702
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,880
Whether it's dangerous or not,

703
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,480
you can't just leave without a word.

704
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,880
That's right.

705
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,680
Mother, I'm sorry.

706
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,840
I shouldn't have...

707
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,080
really shouldn't have done that.

708
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,360
-I was wrong.
-Hongning's apologized.

709
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
So you know you were wrong.

710
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,760
Come here.

711
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,280
So you're staying?

712
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,200
You never liked cultivation

713
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,360
Is there something you're not telling us?

714
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,160
No, mother.

715
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,160
Don't worry.

716
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,720
It's just

717
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,640
I still have some unfinished business.

718
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,560
Once it's done,

719
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,120
I'll come home right away. Okay?

720
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,440
I'll have your back.

721
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,640
Mother,

722
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
don't worry.

723
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,080
Hongning is here.

724
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,680
Hongning's here.

725
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,920
Hongning. Hongning. Hongning.

726
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,720
Hongning.

727
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,120
Here, let me.

728
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,720
Now,

729
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,160
have some tea to soothe your throat.

730
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,080
Hongning.

731
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,720
For me?

732
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,800
Yes, for you.

733
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,440
Thank you.

734
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,720
Baibuqu,

735
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,400
something happened.

736
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,960
Why is everyone being so nice to me?

737
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,760
Don't get so close to me.

738
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,720
The senior brothers talked to me yesterday.

739
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,520
Baibuqu,

740
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,600
how many times must I tell you?

741
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,560
The training hall is for quiet study.

742
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,800
Go and accept your punishment.

743
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,800
Yes.

744
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,520
Wait!

745
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,720
I went to talk to him.

746
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,280
I should be punished, too.

747
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,840
No, no, no!

748
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,800
No need!

749
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,320
You are a girl.

750
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,280
How can you be punished?

751
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,800
Here.

752
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,680
A lady should sit properly.

753
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,240
Please, have a seat.

754
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,520
Hongning's here.

755
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,440
Hongning is here.

756
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,600
Hongning. Hongning.

757
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,960
Hongning. Hongning.

758
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,080
I'm sorry about

759
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,040
how I treated you before.

760
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,040
Hongning,

761
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,080
we were wrong.

762
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:32,960
Hongning,

763
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,240
if you ever have laundry,

764
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,080
we'll wash it for you.

765
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,440
That's right.

766
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,120
Why the sudden politeness?

767
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,760
Let me ask you,

768
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
does Master go down the mountain often?

769
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,480
You know, to help people?

770
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,480
Of course!

771
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,080
When I first joined Cangwu,

772
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,080
I followed him to subdue demons

773
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,600
and guard Cangwu.

774
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Has he ever been to Wang Village?

775
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,360
Naturally.

776
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,200
No matter how far he travels,

777
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,800
Master always stops by Wang Village.

778
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,720
What does he do there?

779
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,720
He never stays long,

780
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
just watches from a distance,

781
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,120
then leaves.

782
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,280
Leave?

783
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,480
Hongning,

784
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,000
Master wants to see you.

785
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,320
Me?

786
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,600
Master.

787
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,960
You asked for me?

788
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,640
These are your cultivation robes.

789
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,720
No need to disguise yourself as a man anymore.

790
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,360
You may cultivate at Cangwu

791
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,640
as who you are.

792
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,800
Thank you, Master.

793
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,920
What's wrong?

794
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,080
Actually, I'm not interested in cultivation.

795
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,960
I chose to stay

796
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,480
for a reason.

797
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,160
You still

798
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,600
don't like cultivation?

799
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,120
Cultivation is too lonely.

800
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,160
I prefer staying in the mortal world

801
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,720
where's lively,

802
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,440
full of love and compassion,

803
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,640
and has so many interesting things.

804
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,040
What does love matter?

805
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,240
Mortals grow old, get sick, and die.

806
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
They'll soon forget

807
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,880
all emotions.

808
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,880
Isn't that just as unfeeling?

809
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,080
Forgetting doesn't mean it never happened.

810
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,600
As long as it happened,

811
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,080
it can't be called unfeeling.

812
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Actually, immortals

813
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
aren't as unfeeling as you think.

814
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,520
Master,

815
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,440
why do you want me to cultivate?

816
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,160
Because you possess strong immortal affinity.

817
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,800
Just because of that?

818
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,040
The path of immortality is eternal.

819
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,320
What if I only want to live in the moment?

820
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,400
Master,

821
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,920
actually,

822
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,920
I've always wanted to ask you something.

823
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,440
Go ahead.

824
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,600
Did you know me in my past life?

825
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
When I was little,

826
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,800
I kept getting into danger.

827
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,800
But someone was always there protecting me.

828
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,080
Was that person you?

829
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:15,719
No.

830
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,719
I think it was you.

831
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,120
When I was little, I often had a dream.

832
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,199
Though I couldn't

833
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,840
see his face clearly in my dream,

834
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,600
he stood among blooming flowers,

835
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,880
looking so beautiful,

836
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,320
just like

837
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,639
how I feel when I see you, Master.

838
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,239
I'm not as good as you think.

839
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,800
Though we haven't known each other long,

840
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,000
ever since

841
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,400
the first time I saw you,

842
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,200
I've somehow felt

843
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,920
an inexplicable closeness.

844
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,720
Sometimes

845
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,520
it's joyful,

846
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,080
other times,

847
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,520
my heart suddenly aches.

848
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,760
I don't know

849
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,560
it's because we knew each other in the past life,

850
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,880
or because

851
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,920
you've visited my dreams.

852
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,160
It's just a dream.

853
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,800
Why dwell on it?

854
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,600
Even if it's a dream, it felt real.

855
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,800
No matter how real,

856
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,680
it's still just a dream.

857
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,520
Even if it's just a dream,

858
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,000
I still want to believe it.

859
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,160
I'm afraid one day

860
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,440
I'll lose that person from my dreams.

861
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,480
I'm afraid one day

862
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,920
I won't see him again.

863
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,080
Why?

864
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,080
Why do you keep

865
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,200
asking about some dream?

866
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,480
Whether it was me or not,

867
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,920
does that matter?

868
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,080
Would you marry him to repay the favor?

869
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,360
I don't mean it like that.

870
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,600
I just thought

871
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,320
if I ever

872
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,840
meet him,

873
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,120
I want to thank him in person.

874
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,880
What's wrong, Bailing?

875
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,680
Senior Brother Fox still hasn't returned.

876
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,040
He's been troubled ever since he failed

877
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,000
to protect you at Wang Village.

878
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,320
He said he went to find medicine for Master,

879
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,200
and never came back.

880
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,240
What's this?

881
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,600
Fox blood.

882
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,000
Senior Brother Fox is in trouble.

883
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,320
There's more over there.

884
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,040
Let's go.

885
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,240
The blood trail ends here.

886
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
He must be up ahead.

887
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,840
Let's turn back.

888
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,800
It's getting late, and your cultivation is weak.

889
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,720
We should return to the academy first,

890
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,280
otherwise, Master will worry again.

891
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,480
I'm not going back.

892
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,480
Master is so cold.

893
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,640
He wouldn't worry about me.

894
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,080
And with all this blood on the path,

895
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,560
I can't rest easy.

896
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,520
Had a fight?

897
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,680
No.

898
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,440
Then

899
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:05,960
how do you know

900
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,480
who Master is worried about?

901
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,120
Are you coming or not?

902
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,240
If not, I'm going alone.

903
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,160
Wait.

904
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,320
What's this?

905
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,000
It's too foggy.

906
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,760
I'm afraid we'll get lost.

907
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,760
Let's leave markers first.

908
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,440
Well?

909
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,400
I'm pretty clever, aren't I?

910
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,520
Not bad.

911
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,520
Bailing, do the markers even work?

912
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,080
Why is the fog getting thicker?

913
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,800
Don't underestimate me.

914
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,240
Senior Brother Fox must be nearby.

915
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Help!

916
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,920
Help!

917
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,760
Little demon.

918
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,200
Rabbit demon.

919
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,880
Help.

920
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,040
Demon!

921
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,720
Demon!

922
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,640
Little demon...

923
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,080
what kind of demon

924
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,080
makes other demons afraid?

925
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,040
This place reeks of death.

926
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,360
There must be a powerful demon here.

927
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,280
Young disciple,

928
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
you can tell this was a rabbit demon?

929
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,240
Who are you?

930
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,560
I'm from the North Sea.

931
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,480
I'm Taoist Dongxuan.

932
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,720
Taoist Dongxuan?

933
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,840
The so-called "North Sea Immortal"?

934
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,800
What brings you here?

935
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,800
I was on my way to visit Xuyun Temple.

936
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,520
Judging by your attire,

937
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,240
you must be from Cangwu Mountain?

938
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,080
I'm Bailing of Cangwu Academy.

939
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,720
This is my junior sister, Hongning.

940
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,440
I'd heard recently

941
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,760
that Cangwu Academy

942
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,960
took in its very first female disciple.

943
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,640
So it's you.

944
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,640
Greetings, Elder.

945
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,040
Before it died, this rabbit demon

946
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,480
hadn't revealed its true form.

947
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,640
How did you recognize it?

948
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,520
I've been able to recognize demons since I was little.

949
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
How unusual.

950
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,280
This place is thick with demonic energy, far too dangerous.

951
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,840
Why did you two come here?

952
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,520
One of our senior brothers is missing.

953
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,720
We followed his blood trail here.

954
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,120
Have you noticed

955
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,240
anything unusual here?

956
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,280
When I arrived,

957
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,360
this rabbit demon was fleeing in panic.

958
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,080
Then I ran into you.

959
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,040
Since this place is so dangerous,

960
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,240
I'll accompany you further.

961
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,160
Great!

962
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,760
Then let's find Lujiu together.

963
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
But night is falling,

964
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,280
and the demonic energy grows stronger.

965
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,600
I saw a humble cottage in the village.

966
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,240
Why don't we rest there tonight

967
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,080
and set out again at dawn?

968
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,760
Sure!

969
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,040
No.

970
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,240
But Lujiu...

971
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,520
But what?

972
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,040
Once it's dark,

973
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,200
if we charge in recklessly,

974
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,680
we'll all become prey for demons.

975
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,000
Later, I'll send a message to Master.

976
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,760
Once he arrives,

977
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,920
we'll search together.

978
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,720
Thank you.
