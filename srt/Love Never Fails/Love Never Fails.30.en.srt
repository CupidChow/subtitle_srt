3
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,300
Hongning?

4
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,100
You're finally back!

5
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,660
All these years,

6
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,100
you must...

7
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,180
must've suffered out there.

8
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,140
You've lost weight.

9
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:03,820
Look at you...

10
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,980
I'm Muxian,

11
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,260
not Hongning.

12
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,740
You... you aren't Hongning?

13
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,100
I'm a demon hunter from Qingyue,

14
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,740
Muxian.

15
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,300
Oh... okay then.

16
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,020
Alright.

17
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,260
Come in.

18
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,100
How could she not be?

19
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,140
Sir,

20
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,500
the Celestial Commander

21
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,380
is in trouble, isn't he?

22
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:29,780
I don't know.

23
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,820
How could you?

24
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,340
Not just me.

25
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,100
No one

26
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,620
in Central Realm knows.

27
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,860
The Emperor Star undergoes tribulation,

28
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,620
which is life-threating.

29
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,100
And Kunlun hasn't woken

30
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,180
since returning.

31
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,420
Probably injured his true form

32
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,980
and damaged vitality during the tribulation.

33
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,700
He injured his true form? That serious?

34
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:54,900
C'mon,

35
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,300
don't overthink it.

36
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:00,980
Look.

37
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,980
Remember that place?

38
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,660
Though millennia have passed,

39
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,100
I still remember it vividly.

40
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,820
I used to sit there

41
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,260
teaching you.

42
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,980
These flowers...

43
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,340
The fairies know Floral Deity is missing,

44
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,500
they all tied blessing knots for him.

45
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,380
A whole tree of

46
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,300
blossom knots.

47
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,860
But the flowers in Flora Grove

48
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,020
all look withered.

49
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,700
The blossoms lost the Deity's protection.

50
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,740
Naturally they've lost their former glory.

51
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,420
Impossible.

52
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,579
The Life and Death Register shows no trace,

53
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,300
and the Star Pavilion's divinations

54
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,060
are unpredictable.

55
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,220
We've searched

56
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,579
everywhere in heaven,

57
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,820
but no sign of him.

58
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,620
I fear Floral Deity

59
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,900
is in grave danger.

60
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,780
Say,

61
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,940
since he hasn't returned,

62
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,780
is it because I damaged

63
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,220
his divine root?

64
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,380
Don't think that way.

65
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,500
The things happened to him in Wuzhang

66
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,500
were all predestined tribulations.

67
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,779
If you hadn't done those,

68
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,940
how could you have saved

69
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,740
Wuzhang's people?

70
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,860
How could you have gained merit

71
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,500
and then lit

72
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,940
the Emperor Star?

73
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,020
The Star

74
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,540
hasn't fallen yet.

75
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,740
Perhaps

76
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,740
Floral Deity

77
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,220
still has unfinished tribulations.

78
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,460
Don't cry.

79
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,420
Let's go.

80
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,060
Greetings.

81
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,500
Envoy Ziteng.

82
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,340
She currently

83
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,820
acts as interim administrator of Floralia Palace.

84
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,100
This must be

85
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,020
Muxian, the newly appointed Flower Envoy

86
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,220
of the Withered Garden.

87
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,300
I am.

88
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,500
Years ago there was a camellia pixie here

89
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,940
who somewhat

90
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,940
resembled you.

91
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,340
Really?

92
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,140
What a coincidence.

93
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,980
But that camellia was wild,

94
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,260
crude, and unruly,

95
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,860
quite ill-mannered.

96
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,740
Surely you're not

97
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,300
like that?

98
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,420
No worries.

99
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,380
Now that I've come here,

100
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,420
I will certainly follow the rules.

101
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,260
As long as you understand.

102
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,460
Now, off you go.

103
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,020
Let's go.

104
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,740
Just ignore her.

105
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,860
The resemblance is striking,

106
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,740
but she's such a pushover.

107
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,980
Envoy Ziteng

108
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,300
has gone too far.

109
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,700
Just establishing rules,

110
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,260
no need to take it personally.

111
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,900
Without a master, the Floralia Palace

112
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,100
has become like this.

113
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,980
Look,

114
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,140
it's clearly not as good as before.

115
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,300
Are you Muxian?

116
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,420
Yes.

117
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,060
As Envoy Ziteng instructed,

118
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,140
these withered flowers

119
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,860
must bloom again before the Floralia.

120
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,260
Please take care of them.

121
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,060
Wait.

122
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,020
So many withered flowers here.

123
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,060
You should know

124
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,380
Muxian just received her Sacred Mark.

125
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,620
Her magic power is still weak.

126
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,140
Reviving so many withered flowers

127
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,260
requires massive spiritual energy.

128
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,580
How can she cultivate herself

129
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,380
if she expends

130
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,500
all her energy here?

131
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,620
Tell me, how?

132
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,900
Envoy Ziteng said

133
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,780
tending the Withered Garden

134
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,820
is a tough job per se.

135
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,180
If Muxian can't handle it,

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,980
she may go to the Empress and resign.

137
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,420
There are other idle posts available.

138
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,900
Fine.

139
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,620
I'll go talk to Ziteng.

140
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,500
Let's see if she can revive

141
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,020
these flowers before the Floralia.

142
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,780
Envoy Ziteng has high expectations of me.

143
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,100
I'll do my utmost

144
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,100
to make these flowers bloom again.

145
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,380
Appreciate it.

146
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,900
Pah!

147
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,140
Just because Floral Deity is absent.

148
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,660
Envoy Ziteng

149
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,060
is close to the Empress.

150
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
So they dare come here

151
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,500
and boss us around.

152
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,340
I'm new here.

153
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,660
I should work more and harder.

154
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,060
But it's not about workload,

155
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,580
she...

156
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,300
she's obviously giving you a hard time.

157
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,780
If Floral Deity were here,

158
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,020
he'd never let you suffer.

159
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,900
I'm back.

160
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,300
Kunlun,

161
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,660
I knew

162
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,180
you'd return safely.

163
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,340
I was too childish before.

164
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,580
Sorry I had you worried.

165
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,260
Good that you know.

166
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,980
I have something to tell you.

167
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,300
Since when

168
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,540
have you become so coy?

169
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,020
After experiencing Wuzhang

170
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,060
and facing death,

171
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,620
I finally understood

172
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,860
what I truly want.

173
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,620
I used to be so conflicted,

174
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,780
clearly loving and caring for you,

175
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,140
yet afraid to admit it.

176
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,300
I...

177
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,220
Please let me finish.

178
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,700
Luyao,

179
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,020
when you were to marry my brother,

180
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,300
I always teased

181
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,500
and provoked you,

182
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,140
then regretted it afterwards.

183
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,860
I even wondered

184
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,020
if something was wrong with me.

185
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,300
I didn't know why I acted like that.

186
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,780
Only later did I realize

187
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,100
I didn't want you to marry him.

188
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,260
I wanted your eyes on me,

189
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,500
your heart mine only,

190
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,660
seeing no one else.

191
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,500
But I didn't know what to do.

192
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,780
So I used that silly method

193
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,020
to capture

194
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,420
just a bit of your attention.

195
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,100
Luyao,

196
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,660
after this lifetime

197
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,260
I've finally seen it clearly.

198
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,820
I like you,

199
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,500
and adore you.

200
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,420
I want to be with you.

201
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,620
Kunlun,

202
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,420
you've returned to the Central Realm

203
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,220
and resumed your status as a senior immortal.

204
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,860
No matter who I am,

205
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,020
either ice pixie Bailing,

206
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
the minister's son,

207
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,060
or the former Kunlun,

208
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,700
my love for you

209
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,060
has never changed.

210
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,180
Do you know what kind of person I am?

211
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,140
The NCR was precarious,

212
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,820
that's why I needed to marry your brother

213
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,140
to restore it.

214
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,380
You had no memories in Cangwu.

215
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,580
I saw you as a jinx then.

216
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,340
Pressed by Sky Fox's pursuit,

217
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,020
I had to stay by your side.

218
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,140
In Wuzhang,

219
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,580
I intended

220
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,340
to use you, Yihe's favored son,

221
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,820
to secure West Sea's support.

222
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,620
So I approached

223
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,780
and helped you.

224
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,180
See?

225
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,260
You love me deeply,

226
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,380
while I harbor ulterior motives.

227
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,260
So what?

228
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,100
You found me annoying, but still used me.

229
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,140
But beyond that,

230
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,140
did you never feel

231
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,180
anything for me?

232
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,260
So what

233
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,300
if I did?

234
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,980
I've got what I wanted now.

235
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,780
Such useless romantic feelings

236
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
are just

237
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,020
obstacles to me.

238
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,260
Fine.

239
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,580
It was just my wishful thinking.

240
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,500
Sorry to bother you.

241
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,300
Farewell.

242
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,540
I can't use you anymore,

243
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,860
Kunlun.

244
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,140
Rise.

245
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,180
I failed to help Kunlun

246
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,140
light the Emperor Star.

247
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,020
I disappointed your trust.

248
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,460
I came to accept punishment.

249
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,340
Never mind.

250
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,260
Since Jinxiu hasn't appeared,

251
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,820
Kunlun still has hope.

252
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,220
Sir Jinxiu is truly missing?

253
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,180
We've searched the entire Central Realm,

254
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,940
no sign of him.

255
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,180
Luyao,

256
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,260
you risked your life

257
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,260
for Kunlun in Wuzhang.

258
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,140
I saw everything.

259
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,100
And now,

260
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,300
he still needs your help.

261
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,660
Rest assured.

262
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,140
Our agreed terms

263
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,460
remain unchanged.

264
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,740
Once accomplished,

265
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,020
I'll mobilize West Sea's forces

266
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,980
to help you reclaim the NCR.

267
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,820
Your Highness,

268
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,100
I've decided

269
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,020
to return alone.

270
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,620
The Sky Fox succession nears.

271
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,620
Alone and helpless,

272
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,980
you are literally looking for death.

273
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,340
Watching Kunlun

274
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,780
through two lifetimes of trials

275
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,140
moved me deeply.

276
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,580
Now he can take his responsibilities,

277
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,660
while I

278
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,620
can't even return home,

279
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,580
hiding and living

280
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,260
like a coward.

281
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,300
Moreover,

282
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,940
I don't want my relationship with him

283
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,260
bound by conditions,

284
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,180
nor to stand by his side

285
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
through such means.

286
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,980
Then think twice.

287
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,500
Once you are gone,

288
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,660
Sky Fox will become the King.

289
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,500
I'll have no grounds

290
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,820
to permit your entry here.

291
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,580
I've made my decision.

292
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,540
I'll reclaim the NCR,

293
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,260
then back here with dignity.

294
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,700
I'll take my leave.

295
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,980
[Your Highness, His Majesty requests you.]

296
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,460
Finally, it's here.

297
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,460
Greetings.

298
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,660
Yihe.

299
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,100
Kunlun has awakened,

300
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,980
though not at full strength yet.

301
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,380
When will you

302
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,500
go see him?

303
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,220
Good that he's awakened.

304
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,420
Although

305
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Jinxiu's Emperor Star shines now,

306
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,900
his whereabouts remain unknown.

307
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,940
This troubles me most.

308
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,860
I've wondered

309
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,020
if his tribulations continue,

310
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,180
if Muxian is the love trial

311
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,500
that he's undergoing.

312
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,860
You know me well indeed.

313
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,300
Then why grant

314
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,700
her immortality today?

315
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,660
If she has no true form

316
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,620
and is not that camellia pixie,

317
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,500
why bother?

318
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,740
Her identity

319
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,340
matters not.

320
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,780
Just another insignificant figure.

321
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,220
But

322
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,060
she saved Wuzhang's people.

323
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,860
Denying her immortality

324
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,140
would damage my standing.

325
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,260
However,

326
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,980
should she hinder Jinxiu's trial,

327
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,660
she becomes a threat.

328
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,900
You are wise indeed.

329
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,260
I understand.

330
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,020
Whether human or demon,

331
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
she's unworthy of our attention.

332
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,980
All are but pawns under Heaven's will.

333
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,980
Hope you can use West Sea's Eye

334
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,020
to seek throughout the Three Realms

335
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,980
to find Jinxiu.

336
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,740
His whereabouts are vital.

337
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,460
I'll spare no effort.

338
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,740
I know

339
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,540
the longer you seek,

340
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,260
the greater the energy consumed.

341
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,660
If not for this grave matter,

342
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,380
I wouldn't trouble you so.

343
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,940
This is my duty.

344
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,780
Jinxiu likely

345
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,100
is beyond the Three Realms.

346
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,740
Are you sure?

347
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,220
If you doubt me,

348
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,780
why ask?

349
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,180
Jinxiu.

350
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,380
Come out.

351
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,900
Stop playing hide and seek.

352
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,340
Kunlun, lower your voice.

353
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,340
What brings you here?

354
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,380
I've been drowsy

355
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,580
these past few days,

356
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,540
forgot to look for him.

357
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,980
I came straight here after I was awake.

358
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,460
Where is he?

359
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,980
Sir Jinxiu

360
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,100
is not here in Floralia Palace.

361
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,620
He's not?

362
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,260
- Jinxiu.
- Wait.

363
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,260
Wait.

364
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,860
- He's really not here.
- Jinxiu.

365
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,620
You here?

366
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,340
It's you.

367
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,660
Greetings, Kunlun.

368
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,940
You've become an immortal?

369
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,140
Congrats on your ascension.

370
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,420
Never thought we'd meet again

371
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,300
here in the Celestial Realm.

372
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,340
In Wuzhang,

373
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,940
you and Sir Jinxiu

374
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,180
saved the people. Thank you.

375
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,740
That was nothing.

376
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,620
Not worth mentioning.

377
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,700
Speaking of him,

378
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,540
since you are here,

379
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,100
he must be nearby.

380
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,220
I knew those folks

381
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,660
wouldn't tell the truth.

382
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,980
He is truly missing.

383
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,420
He's really gone?

384
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,580
Floral Deity still hasn't returned.

385
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,460
If not the Three Realms,

386
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,620
where else could he be?

387
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,300
Why hasn't Floral Deity returned?

388
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,100
Could he

389
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,580
have perished?

390
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,740
Perished?

391
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,420
[Jinxiu,]

392
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,820
[I followed your words and became immortal.]

393
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,740
[Then what?]

394
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,180
[Where are you?]

395
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,940
[Jinxiu,]

396
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,900
[where exactly are you?]

397
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,620
Jinxiu,

398
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,860
can you hear me?

399
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,900
Where are you?

400
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,740
You disappeared like that.

401
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,700
Because I didn't wait for you at the Bridge

402
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,220
or

403
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,940
you can't find your way home?

404
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,140
Jinxiu...

405
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,660
Jinxiu...

406
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,820
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,460
I should have waited at the Bridge.

408
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,780
Where are you?

409
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,020
Please come back.

410
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,620
[Jinxiu,]

411
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,900
[why can't I find you?]

412
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,740
[Jinxiu,]

413
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,180
[where are you right now?]

414
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,460
You wanna go to Mt. Baizhou to find Jinxiu?

415
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,540
I know you doubt

416
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,380
my dream,

417
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,940
but any hope

418
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,340
is worth trying.

419
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,860
I believe his soul

420
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,540
is trapped among

421
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,500
the flowers on Baizhou.

422
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,780
But I've led celestial troops

423
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,260
and searched all realms.

424
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,180
Even my mother's West Sea's Eye

425
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,100
that observes the Three Realms

426
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,140
couldn't see him.

427
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,180
Why are you certain he's at Baizhou?

428
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,420
It's a dream,

429
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,340
so I'm not certain.

430
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:52,820
Fine.

431
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,340
How are you planning to do it?

432
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,980
Examine every flower on the mountain.

433
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,980
Every flower?

434
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,820
He's the Floral Deity.

435
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,820
Plant spirits serve as his eyes and ears.

436
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,540
Perhaps he's hidden somewhere

437
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,820
beyond our sight.

438
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,140
A millennium ago,

439
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,020
I was trapped in the Floral Scroll,

440
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,340
had to count every petal

441
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,140
to escape.

442
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,540
The petals of the myriad flowers

443
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,100
are as numerous as the stars.

444
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,300
It took me a millennium to count only half.

445
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,780
Do you realize

446
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,020
how long it'd take

447
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,860
to search

448
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,220
every flower on Baizhou?

449
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,860
I know.

450
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,220
If you search that way,

451
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,540
it'll delay your cultivation for millennia.

452
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,420
And the Celestial Realm

453
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,700
won't permit such a long descent.

454
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,300
I've found a solution.

455
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,540
What's that?

456
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,180
I'll borrow a millennium

457
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,100
from the Time Immortal.

458
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,660
Borrow time?

459
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,540
That's forbidden magic.

460
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,340
Are you serious?

461
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,260
It'll cost you a thousand years of your lifespan.

462
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,100
You gotta think twice.

463
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,660
You know how important he is to me.

464
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,380
His divine root was damaged because of me.

465
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,540
So no matter what it takes,

466
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,180
a thousand years, ten thousand,

467
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,380
even death,

468
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,300
I must find him.

469
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,180
But to take such risks

470
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,700
based just on a dream?

471
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,860
Even so,

472
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,740
any hope

473
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,140
is worth trying.

474
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,060
Forgive me for trespassing here.

475
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,140
I have an urgent request.

476
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,180
Please appear, Time Immortal.

477
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,180
How can I help you?

478
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,700
Hongning?

479
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,580
When did you return?

480
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,780
I'm not Hongning.

481
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,260
But you clearly are.

482
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,740
You wanna use the forbidden magic

483
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,740
to borrow a thousand years from me?

484
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,860
Yes.

485
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,140
Why do you

486
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,020
have to do this?

487
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,300
Though I'm doing it

488
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,020
based on just a dream,

489
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,460
and it may seem absurd,

490
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,340
I'm determined to find him.

491
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,420
Please do me this favor.

492
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,780
Do you realize borrowing time

493
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,820
means sacrificing your lifespan?

494
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,900
You sure you won't regret?

495
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,140
If I don't find him,

496
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,580
I'll regret it forever.

497
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,540
Floral Deity

498
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,860
has always been kind to me.

499
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,500
You are doing this to save him.

500
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,580
I'll spare no effort

501
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,500
if I can help.

502
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,340
One incense stick equals 1,000 years.

503
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,580
When the incense burns out,

504
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,740
the bell will darken completely.

505
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,940
You must return

506
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,820
before then.

507
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,100
Hurry back.

508
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,300
What if she doesn't return

509
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,460
when the incense finishes?

510
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,300
Lost in the void,

511
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,180
trapped beyond the Three Realms.

512
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,140
[What reward do you desire?]

513
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,180
[Anything I want?]

514
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,260
[Name your wish.]

515
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,900
[If possible, I'll grant it.]

516
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,860
[Can I become your consort?]

517
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,180
[If I win,]

518
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,980
[will you marry me in Heaven?]

519
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,300
[Alright.]

520
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,380
[When you ascend as immortal,]

521
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,260
[When the flowers fall,]

522
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,140
[I will marry you.]

523
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,340
[Deal?]

524
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,020
[Yes.]

525
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,660
Judging by the incense,

526
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,580
she's been inside

527
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,380
for 700 years.

528
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
I don't understand.

529
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,420
One dream costs her a millennium.

530
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,580
So beyond my understanding.

531
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,340
Why?

532
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,220
What's hard to understand?

533
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,260
Mortals have a saying,

534
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,060
"Searching heaven and hell."

535
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,580
What mortals cannot do

536
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,420
we immortals can.

537
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,260
But logically,

538
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,780
mortals have never seen these things.

539
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,700
How could they imagine them?

540
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,260
Foolish.

541
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,340
Why rely on sight?

542
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,940
What makes us divine

543
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,660
is performing miracles.

544
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,100
These miracles

545
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,580
become mortal legends,

546
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,860
giving them hope.

547
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,540
[Still no clue...]

548
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,900
[Jinxiu,]

549
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,300
[where are you?]

550
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:18,900
Time is nearly up.

551
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,860
Muxian, come out!

552
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,500
Muxian,

553
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,300
return quickly!

554
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:25,980
Muxian...

555
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:26,620
Come out!

556
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,100
If you don't,

557
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,460
I'll also be punished!

558
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,659
I can't wait any longer.

559
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,420
[Jinxiu,]

560
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,699
[where are you?]

561
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,260
[Muxian, the millennium is up!]

562
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,100
[No time left!]

563
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,020
[You must come out!]

564
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,699
I feel I'm getting close.

565
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,860
[Come back!]

566
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,179
[Or you'll be trapped forever!]

567
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,460
Muxian, finally!

568
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,460
Muxian,

569
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
do you know how dangerous that was?

570
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,780
If I hadn't used magic

571
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,420
to pull you out in time,

572
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,580
you'd have perished inside.

573
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,660
I know,

574
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,900
- but I...
- Never mind.

575
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
You're anxious to find my brother.

576
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,380
So, any leads?

577
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,580
Don't take such risks again.

578
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Borrowing that time

579
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,620
cost you most of your energy.

580
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
If Jinxiu returns,

581
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,340
he wouldn't want to see you like this.

582
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,660
You are back, that's what matters.

583
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,940
Where are you going?

584
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,620
Sky Fox is about to ascend.

585
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,700
I must return.

586
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,300
He controls the entire NCR.

587
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,140
Do you think he'll let you live?

588
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,020
I'm the Matriarch there.

589
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,820
I have duties to fulfill.

590
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,020
Regardless of your duties,

591
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,220
you should plan carefully before return

592
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,300
instead of

593
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,860
going back alone like this.

594
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,860
You'll only get yourself

595
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,580
captured.

596
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,180
After all we've been through,

597
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,100
do you really

598
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,860
see me as some

599
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,460
reckless fool?

600
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,940
Anyway, I won't let you go back alone.

601
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,700
It's too dangerous.

602
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,020
Kunlun,

603
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,500
that's my home.

604
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,300
However outnumbered I am,

605
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,340
I must return.

606
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,220
My father is still his captive.

607
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,620
Then I'll go with you.

608
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,660
You are the Celestial Emperor's son.

609
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,300
Your presence would

610
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,860
draw more attention.

611
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,980
Besides,

612
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,780
with the ongoing tension

613
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,820
between the two realms,

614
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,740
helping me openly

615
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,900
would imply the Celestial Realm's stance.

616
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,340
I know you worry about me.

617
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,140
But

618
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,060
I'm the Princess of the Fox Clan,

619
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,740
from the Glacier Kingdom.

620
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,940
My family is there.

621
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,100
I must save them.

622
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,740
How can I help then?

623
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,540
Focus on your own duties.

624
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,900
You must prepare yourself.

625
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,020
If

626
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,020
Floral Deity never returns,

627
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,700
you

628
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,860
must step up and fight

629
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,460
for the Celestial Realm.

630
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,220
[Write your wish on it.]

631
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
[It's our custom.]

632
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,580
[Look]

633
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,740
[how he writes it.]

634
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,260
[Look.]

635
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:20,780
[Yes.]

636
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,780
The sky lantern...

637
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,580
Greetings, Lantern Immortal.

638
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,100
I'm flattered.

639
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,300
I'm also a minor immortal,

640
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,660
the lowest ever.

641
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,060
No formalities please.

642
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,660
Are these lanterns

643
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,140
disturbing Heaven's peace again?

644
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,660
I'll put them away.

645
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,260
No.

646
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,220
I'm here hoping

647
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,660
you can do me a favor.

648
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,140
Me?

649
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,500
What can I do?

650
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,780
Do you remember

651
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:09,980
years ago

652
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,500
Sir Jinxiu

653
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,740
lit a sky lantern at Baizhou?

654
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,220
I wish to know what it said.

655
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,460
It's...

656
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,260
It's not proper.

657
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,620
That's his secret.

658
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,980
Truth be told,

659
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,860
he's missing.

660
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,500
We'll seize any possible clue

661
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,700
to find his whereabouts.

662
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,660
It's Kunlun who sent me.

663
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,500
Just a sec.

664
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,140
How bold

665
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,340
this wish is.

666
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,100
Here you go.

667
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,100
"May we still be together"

668
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,980
"the same time next year."

669
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,980
At first I thought

670
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,260
it'd be easy.

671
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,820
As it turned out, Sir Jinxiu

672
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,500
fell for a little pixie.

673
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,020
By next year she's gone.

674
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,220
I searched everywhere for her.

675
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,220
The same time next year...

676
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,180
Muxian?

677
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,540
What brings you here again?

678
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,180
I need another favor from you.

679
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,260
Don't tell me you...

680
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,660
I wish to borrow time once more.

681
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,980
Just this last time.

682
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,260
Have you lost your mind?

683
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,780
You've already borrowed a millennium.

684
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,700
Borrowing more

685
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,900
could drain your energy entirely.

686
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,860
Only one day.

687
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,660
But a thousand years

688
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,380
yielded nothing.

689
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,140
What can

690
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,620
one day achieve?

691
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,740
Just one more day.

692
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,380
I know I can find him.

693
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,180
[Come take a look.]

694
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,420
[This suits you perfectly.]

695
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,580
[Looks lovely on you.]

696
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,580
[Come again.]

697
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,580
[Alright. Let's go.]

698
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,140
[Miss, take a look.]

699
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:07,940
Miss,

700
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,980
these are all newest arrivals,

701
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,620
all top quality.

702
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,340
Which one do you like?

703
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,420
Feel free to try them on.

704
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,580
You've got excellent taste.

705
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,540
This is our

706
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,620
latest design.

707
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,820
Fits you perfectly.

708
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,860
See how lovely this pink is.

709
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,700
See you, Miss.

710
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,860
Do come again.

711
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:35,980
Thanks.

712
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,460
[Come take a look.]

713
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,740
[Miss, check it out.]

714
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,700
[Newest masks.]

715
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,220
[Come take a look.]

716
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,900
[All styles available.]

717
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,260
[Take a look.]

718
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,220
[What's that?]

719
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,980
[I want to fly a sky lantern with you.]

720
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,140
[Come on.]

721
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,700
[Others cultivate]

722
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,260
[to seek immortality,]

723
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,260
[while you]

724
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,020
[only dream of marrying me.]

725
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,860
[That's all I want.]

726
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,700
[I'm here for you,]

727
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,860
[longing for your return.]

728
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,220
[I'm here for you,]

729
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,620
[longing for your return.]
