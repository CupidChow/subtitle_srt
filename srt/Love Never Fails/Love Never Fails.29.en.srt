1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,539
[Love Never Fails]
[EP29]

3
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,920
I'll be on my way.

4
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,680
Alright.

5
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,960
[This all began with me.]

6
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,960
[And I shall end it.]

7
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,200
[I can seek out more resources for you.]

8
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,160
[No need for that.]

9
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,760
[General,]

10
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,680
[Scouts reported!]

11
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,760
[Prince Xian and Kunlun have been spotted]

12
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,079
[in the bamboo grove on the outskirts.]

13
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,080
-General.
-General.

14
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
Funny how life works.

15
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,720
Always lived in the midst of excitement,

16
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
yet here I am,

17
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,640
facing my end in complete solitude.

18
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,960
No,

19
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,960
I can't go out like this.

20
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,880
I have to find a way out.

21
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,320
Perhaps being turned into a puppet

22
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,360
is why I can't feel any pain...

23
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,520
Why must everything be so hard for me!

24
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,240
Kunlun!

25
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,920
Master!

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,399
Let's go!

27
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,320
I see why Baicha went to such lengths,

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,720
feeding me with the force of resentment.

29
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,720
It was all about you.

30
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,520
That's right.

31
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,320
Well then,

32
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,720
if you can absorb my energy,

33
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,360
I can just as easily do the same to you.

34
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,320
Why are you here?

35
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,320
For the same reason as you.

36
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,440
You're prepared to sacrifice yourself.

37
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,880
If we prevail

38
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,720
and ascend, make me your wife.

39
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,520
It's a promise.

40
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
I heard Muxian and Jinxiu...

41
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,120
Perfect, I can get you out of here.

42
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,760
No!

43
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,240
I can't leave.

44
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,040
They need my help.

45
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,200
And how do you plan to do that?

46
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,720
Master,

47
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
I was just thinking about

48
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,080
facing death alone,

49
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
and then you showed up to save me.

50
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,760
You've always been there

51
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,600
at my darkest hours.

52
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,040
Now I must challenge the living puppet.

53
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,760
Since I'm one too,

54
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,680
it's fitting that we destroy each other.

55
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
Maybe this is destiny's design.

56
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,160
There's still hope that

57
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,880
my actions could save everyone.

58
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,200
If you must go, you're on your own.

59
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,280
Kunlun...

60
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,960
In this life,

61
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,760
I've gained everything I ever wanted.

62
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,680
And with this kiss,

63
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,680
my journey is truly complete.

64
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,800
How can a mere mortal

65
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,400
possess such immense power?

66
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,600
It's the force of resentment.

67
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,720
How to deal with it?

68
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,040
There's only one solution.

69
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,040
Lujiu!

70
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,480
Don't look at me, general!

71
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,760
Cut the nonsense.

72
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,320
Your appearance doesn't faze me.

73
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,880
Listen carefully.

74
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,640
There's no way to dispel this energy.

75
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,720
The only solution is for me to absorb it,

76
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,720
and then you must take my life.

77
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,960
It's the only way to save everyone.

78
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,600
That's not an option!

79
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,480
I won't allow you to hurt them...

80
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,200
There's no other way...

81
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,040
Not another word about this...

82
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,600
Muxian!

83
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,120
Such heroic nonsense!

84
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,160
Lujiu!

85
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,360
Kunlun!

86
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,320
Kunlun!

87
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,560
Kunlun...

88
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,520
Kunlun...

89
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,400
Kunlun.

90
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,160
Master...

91
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,920
I did it...

92
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,360
Kunlun...

93
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,080
Kunlun.

94
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,040
Kunlun?

95
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,200
Kunlun!

96
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,440
Kunlun...

97
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,240
[Do I know you somewhere?]

98
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,440
[If fate grants me another life,]

99
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,000
[I will hunt you down]

100
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,400
[and end you myself!]

101
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,880
[Hongning!]

102
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,320
So...

103
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,720
Our paths crossed in two lifetimes,

104
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,360
both ending in tragedy.

105
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,280
So it was...

106
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,040
it was all

107
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,640
my fault...

108
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,560
You have every right

109
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,960
to hate me.

110
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,880
I hate you could

111
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,680
forget me so completely in this life.

112
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,040
So...

113
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,280
you did have feelings for me.

114
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,720
Afterall...

115
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,440
I wasn't imagining it all along.

116
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,720
Take my life,

117
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,880
or this energy will only grow stronger.

118
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,120
Dying by your hand in this life...

119
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,920
It feels right.

120
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,760
I owe you this much.

121
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,200
You vowed

122
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,760
you'd find me again in this life,

123
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,600
and here you are.

124
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,640
You kept your promise.

125
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,920
I promised

126
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
I would end you myself.

127
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,120
Then do it.

128
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,960
Quick,

129
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,640
before it's too late.

130
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,640
Do it now!

131
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,280
Jinxiu!

132
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,360
I hate you...

133
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,600
Why did you

134
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,320
make those promises?

135
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,880
I hate you for killing my parents,

136
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,040
for aiding the Celestial Realm

137
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,520
to slaughter so many innocent people.

138
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,320
If that was how it would end,

139
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,840
you should have left me

140
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,640
to perish that day

141
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,960
on Mt. Baizhou...

142
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,480
The pain on the Bridge of Destiny

143
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,440
was unbearable.

144
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,600
This time,

145
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,800
it's your turn to carry me.

146
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,080
Promise me:

147
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,800
find me

148
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,360
in our next life,

149
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,640
won't you?

150
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,160
Jinxiu?

151
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,080
Jinxiu...

152
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,240
JINXIU!

153
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,560
YOUR DIVINE HIGHNESS!

154
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,200
YOUR DIVINE HIGHNESS!

155
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,320
Your Divine Highness...

156
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,480
Here you are again.

157
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,800
Here I am.

158
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,320
But where is he?

159
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,520
I do not know.

160
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,960
Then I will wait here until he comes.

161
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,960
Countless souls have sworn

162
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,160
to reunite in here,

163
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,680
yet how rare it is

164
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,000
for any to keep that promise...

165
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,600
All I ask is for your safe return,

166
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,800
and nothing else will matter.

167
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,640
Whatever difficulties lie ahead,

168
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,760
I will handle them all for you.

169
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,880
Report!

170
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,200
Your Divine Majesty!

171
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,360
we've searched everywhere

172
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,760
but still cannot locate the Emperor Star.

173
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,600
Issue my decree.

174
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,480
Even if we must search every realm,

175
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,920
find Sir Jinxiu!

176
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,880
Understood!

177
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,520
Excuse me,

178
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
are you from Wuzhang?

179
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,360
Yes,

180
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,200
my whole family

181
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,880
came from Wuzhang together.

182
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,760
Have you encountered General Jinxiu?

183
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,360
No.

184
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,880
Gratitude.

185
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,880
Pardon me,

186
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,640
did you come from Wuzhang?

187
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,240
I am.

188
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,280
Have you by chance seen General Jinxiu?

189
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,040
No.

190
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,360
Have you come across General Jinxiu?

191
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,760
No.

192
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,000
Excuse me,

193
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,800
did you see

194
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,680
General Jinxiu from Wuzhang?

195
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,560
No.

196
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,280
[The pain on the Bridge of Destiny was unbearable.]

197
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,600
[This time, it's your turn to carry me.]

198
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,800
[JINXIU!]

199
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,520
[YOUR DIVINE HIGHNESS! ]

200
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,360
[YOUR DIVINE HIGHNESS! ]

201
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,840
[Your Divine Highness...]

202
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,560
There might be a chance

203
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,760
if you cross this bridge.

204
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:47,960
However...

205
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,480
without a reincarnation token,

206
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,000
you must walk through

207
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,800
the blazing fire yourself.

208
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,320
Now I understand...

209
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,320
Those scars...

210
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,360
you got them while crossing the bridge.

211
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,080
In this world, there is immortality,

212
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,720
but no eternal love.

213
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,680
Still, if your heart is sincere,

214
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,720
beyond this gate of rebirth,

215
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,840
perhaps

216
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,200
the one you wait for also waits for you.

217
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,920
Whether we

218
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,520
become demons, mortals,

219
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,240
or immortals,

220
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,720
it matters not.

221
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,440
Three lifetimes of bonds,

222
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,000
yet even the deepest love

223
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,480
is as fleeting as a night-blooming cereus.

224
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,800
Only regret endures.

225
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,960
This is the ordeal you must face.

226
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,920
Conquer it, and it becomes your blessing.

227
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,880
[You'd go against the celestial orders]

228
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,240
[just for me?]

229
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,600
[Hongning...]

230
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
[The bride and groom bow to each other!]

231
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,360
[If we prevail]

232
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,320
[and ascend, make me your wife.]

233
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,760
[It's a promise.]

234
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,960
The blazing fire...

235
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,760
Jinxiu...

236
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,640
It hurts so much...

237
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,920
Muxian,

238
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,080
immortality was written in your fate.

239
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,040
Your selfless protection of Wuzhang

240
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,600
has earned heaven's grace.

241
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,200
By divine mandate,

242
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,440
ascend as a fairy of the Celestial Realm.

243
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,440
You've found her.

244
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,760
My eyes

245
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,240
have been in your sockets

246
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,040
for far too long.

247
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,000
It's time to return them to me.

248
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,640
These eyes are part of me now.

249
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,600
How can you claim they're yours?

250
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,920
Ungrateful wretch!

251
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,800
You made me who I am today.

252
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,840
Slaying my own kind,

253
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,400
feasting on human flesh,

254
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000
drinking fresh blood.

255
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,800
drinking fresh blood.

256
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,720
I shall take everything you have!

257
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,600
You?

258
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,880
My power originates from the dawn of time.

259
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,760
It's not for the likes of you.

260
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,720
You're merely a

261
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,000
petty demon from the White Camellia Clan.

262
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,600
Even with greater power,

263
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,320
you'd amount to nothing.

264
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,040
I was the one who

265
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,160
ended your twin brother.

266
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,560
Utter nonsense!

267
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,920
Unicorn Blade?

268
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,000
How are you able to wield it?

269
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,480
Master...

270
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,160
Master?

271
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,160
Master, is it really you?

272
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,480
Immortals and demons once lived in harmony...

273
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,480
until that war changed it all...

274
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,920
That Yaotian,

275
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,840
who built his fame on lies.

276
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,840
Master,

277
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,960
I will exact vengeance for you...

278
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,360
What harmony?

279
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,760
And what were Yaotian's lies?

280
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,920
Who are you?

281
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,040
You're not my master...

282
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,480
No, you're not...

283
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
You can't awaken the Unicorn Blade.

284
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,360
Together we rise,

285
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,000
together we fall...

286
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,040
Master,

287
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,840
my master!

288
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,320
Master has perished...

289
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,960
Yaotian!

290
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,880
I'll kill you!

291
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,320
I swear I'll kill you!

292
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,040
Green Serpent,

293
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,720
today,

294
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,120
here in the Kylin Lair,

295
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,520
I shall take your power

296
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,400
as my

297
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,360
token of appreciation.

298
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,120
My lady.

299
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,679
Had I not lived that life in Wuzhang,

300
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,480
I might have never discovered

301
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
that my heart's true desire

302
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,400
was simply to be

303
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,679
by your side.

304
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,560
My Lady,

305
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,600
Sir Kunlun has remained in deep slumber

306
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,040
since his return to the realm.

307
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,800
Lady Muxian, His Majesty requests your presence.

308
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
I, Muxian,

309
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,640
humbly pay my respects.

310
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,560
Mortal Muxian,

311
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,160
you have shown extraordinary virtue

312
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,600
in saving millions in Wuzhang.

313
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,160
You've earned the right to ascend

314
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
to immortality without facing trials.

315
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,960
Gratitude, Your Divine Majesty.

316
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,240
Bringing salvation to countless souls.

317
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,040
For a mortal like you to

318
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,840
possess such compassion

319
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,080
is truly remarkable.

320
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,160
Since childhood, I've honored the ways of heaven.

321
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,160
I merely did what was right.

322
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,760
Being granted passage to the realm

323
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,800
is already the

324
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,480
greatest blessing I could receive.

325
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,640
Though born mortal,

326
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,960
without spiritual root

327
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,680
and lacking in divine powers,

328
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,240
I hope that through cultivation in here,

329
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,400
you may develop your spiritual root.

330
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,960
I vow to prove worthy of this blessing.

331
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,080
One moment.

332
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,760
What concerns you, my empress?

333
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,360
You insolent little pixie!

334
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,960
How dare you spread such lies

335
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,360
in our sacred hall!

336
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,200
My Divine Majesty, look carefully,

337
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,000
isn't she Hongning,

338
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,400
the camellia pixie

339
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,880
who crashed Jinxiu's grand wedding?

340
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,160
I am but a mere mortal,

341
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,560
not the camellia pixie

342
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,760
you speak of.

343
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,200
Silence your lies!

344
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,280
Where is your true form?

345
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,280
In my mortal life, I've collected

346
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,480
cores from many evil demons.

347
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,880
I know both immortals

348
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,640
and demons possess true forms,

349
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,360
but I have none.

350
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,400
I truly am nothing more than a mortal.

351
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,600
It is as she says.

352
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,960
My Empress, look,

353
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,440
Muxian speaks the truth.

354
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,440
She is of mortal flesh,

355
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,960
with no ties to the camellia pixie.

356
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,760
All my life, I've honored the divine ways,

357
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,640
dreaming of joining

358
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,600
the celestial ranks.

359
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,880
Now that my wish has been fulfilled,

360
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,120
I humbly ask you

361
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,440
to see the truth.

362
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,040
[Is this not enough to earn immortality?]

363
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,480
[Has she not proven herself]

364
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,560
[through her deeds in Wuzhang?]

365
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,320
[How can she be denied ascension?]

366
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,200
Muxian,

367
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,560
the empress has misjudged you.

368
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,520
Now that your innocence is proven,

369
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,640
I grant you immortal status.

370
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,000
As a divine fairy,

371
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,720
you should be assigned a divine duty.

372
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,120
My empress, I entrust this task to you.

373
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,960
Muxian,

374
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,840
would you accept the role

375
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,760
of garden keeper for the Withered Garden

376
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,920
in the Floralia Palace?

377
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,000
Withered Garden?

378
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,480
Your Divine Majesty,

379
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,920
since Jinxiu vanished after his trial,

380
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,960
leaving his position vacant

381
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,920
for a while.

382
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,440
Without its primary deity,

383
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,360
the Floralia Palace

384
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,280
has fallen into decay.

385
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,240
Someone must tend to

386
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,280
these withering blossoms.

387
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,960
For a newly ascended immortal like her,

388
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,360
this role,

389
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,680
removed from court politics,

390
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,320
would be perfectly suitable.

391
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,400
To ascend to immortality is already

392
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,080
the greatest blessing I could hope for.

393
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,280
I would be honored to accept the role.

394
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,600
Very well.

395
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,680
From this day forth,

396
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,320
you shall serve as its keeper.

397
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,160
Cultivate your powers faithfully

398
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,160
and abide by our divine laws.

399
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,720
In the Celestial Realm,

400
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,200
those whose cultivation proves lacking

401
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,400
shall be cast into the Demotion Pool.
