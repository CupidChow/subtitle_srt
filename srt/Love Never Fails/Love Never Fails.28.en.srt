3
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,200
Live long, stay healthy.

4
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,420
Live long, stay healthy.

5
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,539
Live long, stay healthy.

6
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,100
Live long, stay healthy.

7
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,380
Live long, stay healthy.

8
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,700
Greetings, Prince Xian.

9
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,140
Haven't visited you for days.

10
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,780
I've come to pay my respects.

11
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,980
I heard you're injured, General.

12
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,660
Just a minor wound.

13
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,340
No need to worry.

14
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Yet I wonder

15
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,460
who could possibly harm you?

16
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,820
A nobody.

17
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,700
But this person

18
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,780
is strange.

19
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,340
What's strange about a nobody?

20
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,740
But you,

21
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,180
as Wuzhang's

22
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,420
Great General of the Ministry of Law,

23
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,300
your health matters most.

24
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,780
I wish to share your burden.

25
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,260
So these spirit affairs

26
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,780
are no longer your responsibility.

27
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,540
For the dead,

28
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,460
just burn them.

29
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,860
We can't.

30
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,540
The city's in chaos,

31
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,500
people live in constant fear.

32
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,660
It's not a permanent solution.

33
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,540
Why not?

34
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,820
Whether it's spirit attacks

35
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,060
or national chaos,

36
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,540
none of my concern,

37
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,260
nor yours.

38
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,180
Remember,

39
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,820
you're not alone anymore.

40
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,780
You have your uncle, aunt, brother,

41
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,060
and your beloved.

42
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,860
Jinxiu cannot comply.

43
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,420
How strange.

44
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,300
Prince Xian first took Wang Hu's body,

45
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
now forbids investigation.

46
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,900
What is he up to?

47
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,100
General, are you alright?

48
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,180
I'm fine.

49
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,420
He always distrusted me,

50
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,540
so he planted Wang Hu.

51
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,740
Judging from his words,

52
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,300
Wang Hu wasn't his only spy.

53
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,100
Wang Hu's fake death

54
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,260
was suspicious,

55
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,899
yet he rushed

56
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,260
to claim the body.

57
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,500
What should we do?

58
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,140
Keep investigating.

59
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,820
If we don't act,

60
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,420
more puppets like Wang Hu

61
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,260
will harm defenseless citizens.

62
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,380
Order the Ministry to increase patrols.

63
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,700
Understood.

64
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,380
Are you responsible

65
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,260
for this chaos?

66
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,660
You suspect me?

67
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,980
I hope you're not.

68
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,100
Prince Xian is.

69
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,460
The minister's suffering unjustness.

70
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,100
The spy faked death to escape.

71
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
Wuzhang is in chaos.

72
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,100
Prince Xian

73
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,740
is behind it all.

74
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,660
I even bribed his guards

75
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,380
to learn his concubine

76
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,820
was killed, too.

77
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,940
If it's my doing,

78
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,860
how could it implicate innocents

79
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,700
and those close to you?

80
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,820
Here I'm treating you like family.

81
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,540
You're there questioning my sincerity.

82
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,260
If you don't trust me,

83
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,820
why not just kill me?

84
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,420
Baicha,

85
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,500
I seek revenge,

86
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,940
but won't harm innocents.

87
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,940
I hope

88
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,820
you're not involved.

89
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,500
Auntie,

90
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,860
rest in peace.

91
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,660
- Run!
- Run!

92
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,020
Master!

93
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,500
Master, stay back!

94
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,060
Her blood

95
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,940
- got in my eyes.
- Kunlun.

96
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,220
I might be infected.

97
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,220
I don't want to endanger you.

98
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,420
Nonsense.

99
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,620
Master.

100
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,940
Didn't Prince Xian order you

101
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,460
to ignore the puppets?

102
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,100
Doesn't mean I have to listen.

103
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,460
I can't turn blind eyes

104
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,300
to this situation.

105
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,740
I can't do it.

106
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,340
He wants to maintain peace.

107
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,540
But there's no peace to maintain.

108
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,100
To him,

109
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,620
people are ants.

110
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,220
But with citizens

111
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,260
homeless

112
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,740
and struggling to survive,

113
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,700
what's the meaning of the nation or the king?

114
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,420
You speak for the people.

115
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,220
Aren't you afraid he'll take everything from you?

116
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,020
I don't get it.

117
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Why can't you understand me?

118
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,860
I may not be perfect,

119
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,140
but I know

120
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,180
right from wrong.

121
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,660
I won't trade countless lives

122
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,380
for temporary peace.

123
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,620
I just won't.

124
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,700
I'd rather die fighting evil

125
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,060
than live in cowardice.

126
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,100
You'll truly stand

127
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,140
with the people

128
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,580
against the evil?

129
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,500
Sure.

130
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,740
If puppets overrun

131
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,220
the city one day,

132
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,500
I'll be the last one

133
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,660
fighting to the death.

134
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,100
I already told you,

135
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,660
if you want immortality,

136
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,780
just keep absorbing resentment.

137
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,860
Don't complicate things.

138
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,820
You dare to stop me at this point?

139
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,660
You really think

140
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,820
you can stop me now?

141
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,020
[Young Master, how are you?]

142
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,740
Don't come in.

143
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,620
[Alright,]

144
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,980
[I won't.]

145
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,700
How's the Matriarch?

146
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,380
[I saw her leave the mansion.]

147
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,180
[With the chaos in the mansion,]

148
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
[I'm afraid she won't return.]

149
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,300
Good.

150
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,420
Fine.

151
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,740
Fine.

152
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,100
I've spent my life chasing the Matriarch.

153
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,260
But why

154
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,460
did she abandon me too?

155
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,580
[They all need you.]

156
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,980
[Stop running away.]

157
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,900
[Take responsibility.]

158
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,460
[Even if it's for me.]

159
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,900
I just went out to investigate,

160
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,700
and you're acting like this.

161
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,820
Master,

162
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,020
is it you walking around there?

163
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,140
Am I dying?

164
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,060
Don't talk nonsense.

165
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,860
Just cover your eyes, you'll be fine.

166
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,580
Master.

167
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,340
Master.

168
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,700
You're back!

169
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,420
I thought you abandoned me.

170
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,020
Am I

171
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,740
that cowardly in your eyes?

172
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,780
No,

173
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,660
not at all.

174
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,940
What's going on?

175
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,580
How did this happen?

176
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,140
He examined his auntie's corpse,

177
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,860
was attacked by her.

178
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,460
Her blood

179
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,820
splashed into his eyes.

180
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,620
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

181
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,820
You're busy with important matters.

182
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,860
I thought I could

183
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,700
solve it myself.

184
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,380
I used talismans

185
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,260
to control it right after he's injured.

186
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,700
But the effects last shorter and shorter.

187
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,020
Now we must find the source

188
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,380
to cure him completely.

189
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,260
Many puppets have appeared in the city.

190
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,980
The first-found Wang Hu

191
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,860
was sent to Prince Xian's mansion.

192
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,100
I saw

193
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,220
a concubine there

194
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,220
who's also a puppet.

195
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,380
He ordered me

196
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,020
to stop investigating.

197
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,540
The source seems

198
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,820
to be at his mansion.

199
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,420
I'll go get him.

200
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,900
Master, calm down.

201
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,060
Kunlun,

202
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,700
with your condition,

203
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,900
who knows how long you can last?

204
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,740
We'll investigate tonight

205
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,180
and must find the source.

206
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,180
No time to waste.

207
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,700
I'll go with you.

208
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,620
Okay.

209
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,100
I'll go, too.

210
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:15,980
Nonsense.

211
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,740
Look at your condition.

212
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,980
Wait here for us.

213
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,180
Master!

214
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,860
If we leave him here alone,

215
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,700
who knows what might happen?

216
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,540
Better take him along.

217
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,020
Are you sure?

218
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,500
You're not helping him.

219
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,620
You'll make it worse.

220
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,340
Muxian,

221
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,100
how could my Master harm me?

222
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,220
I can go with...

223
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,940
You should stay.

224
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,380
Master.

225
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:40,940
Kunlun,

226
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,180
stay.

227
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,740
Wait for us.

228
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,700
Master.

229
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,380
Take care of yourself.

230
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,140
The mansion is vast with many residences.

231
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,940
We'll split up and adapt as needed.

232
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,140
Be careful.

233
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,460
I didn't expect you to come.

234
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,140
This has nothing to do with you.

235
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,660
It doesn't.

236
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
I'm doing this for the people.

237
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,860
I may have wrongly accused you.

238
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,540
And for Kunlun.

239
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,820
[It's him.]

240
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,140
Lujiu.

241
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,740
Why are you here?

242
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,700
Protect...

243
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,140
What?

244
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,700
Protect Jinxiu.

245
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,620
Protect

246
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,180
Jinxiu.

247
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,780
You're infected too.

248
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,380
Muxian,

249
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,619
you should leave.

250
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,220
I can't control it.

251
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,500
I might hurt you.

252
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,380
You don't know how much I wanna kill you.

253
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,900
If not for you,

254
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,339
they wouldn't have died!

255
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,380
Muxian.

256
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,020
Your Highness,

257
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,820
forgive me for visiting you

258
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,740
this late.

259
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:28,820
Muxian,

260
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,660
do you realize what you're doing?

261
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,340
Of course I do.

262
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,020
Why attack Lujiu?

263
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,980
Why attack him?

264
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,420
Don't you know?

265
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,540
I certainly do.

266
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,140
After all, your name is

267
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,940
Hongning.

268
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,300
So you remember.

269
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,180
Don't you remember too,

270
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,700
Luyao?

271
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,540
I spared you thinking

272
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,900
you'd behave.

273
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,380
But if you harm Lujiu,

274
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,980
I won't let you off.

275
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,660
You're angry I hurt your brother.

276
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,780
You know what he did at Cangwu.

277
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,100
He didn't mean to.

278
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,780
Didn't mean to?

279
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,900
A life for a life, that's the rule.

280
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,060
Why do immortals like you

281
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,260
get to break it?

282
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,380
I won't argue this today.

283
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,020
But Lujiu will

284
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,380
pay his debt.

285
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,780
Since we're here for Kunlun,

286
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,340
don't waste time.

287
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,860
Why are you approaching them

288
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,780
in this life?

289
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,860
If I tell you it's for Jinxiu,

290
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,180
will you believe it?

291
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:29,900
Jinxiu...

292
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,060
Protect Jinxiu...

293
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,340
Lujiu, are you alright?

294
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,180
Who are you?

295
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,460
Who are you?

296
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,780
Who I am doesn't matter.

297
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,220
What matters is

298
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,260
you finally showed up.

299
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,780
What do you mean?

300
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,380
You are working together?

301
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,980
I never thought the exalted Floral Deity

302
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,100
would be this pathetic,

303
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,860
can't even withstand a single strike.

304
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,380
I don't understand.

305
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,220
Don't you remember?

306
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,700
You used to

307
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,540
tower above us all,

308
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,780
crushing us

309
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,420
like ants.

310
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,820
Never thought you'd become

311
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,580
a mere mortal

312
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,220
living like an ant

313
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,300
yourself, did you?

314
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,820
You're mistaken.

315
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,260
I'm not some Floral Deity.

316
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,100
I'd always recognize you.

317
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,380
You betrayed your love,

318
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,740
let her be ground to dust.

319
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,940
You set the flames, slaughtered her kin!

320
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,780
I've done none

321
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,500
of what you accuse.

322
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,540
If not for her,

323
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,180
I'd have crushed you already.

324
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,900
I don't know who you are,

325
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,180
but you conspired with Prince Xian,

326
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,460
harming innocents.

327
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,460
I'd rather die

328
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
than let you escape.

329
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,660
The illness is suppressing his demonic power.

330
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
He'll lose control soon.

331
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,540
Lujiu, don't be afraid.

332
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,060
I'll take you home now.

333
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,500
I have no home! No home!

334
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,180
Kunlun, why are you here?

335
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,820
How could I just wait at home

336
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,900
while you risk your lives for me?

337
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,700
I'm already half a puppet anyway.

338
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,820
Might as well fight with you!

339
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,500
A few more

340
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,060
won't make a difference.

341
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,220
Luyao, Muxian.

342
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,780
Prince Xian is likely under his control.

343
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,460
Be careful.

344
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,820
It's really you.

345
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
So what?

346
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,340
What can you possibly do?

347
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:27,820
I'll go after him.

348
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,500
Muxian!

349
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,300
Don't.

350
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,620
She's up to no good.

351
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,820
Muxian is helping us.

352
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,100
Why would you say that?

353
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,260
These talismans won't last much longer.

354
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,340
Don't act recklessly.

355
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,740
What?

356
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,740
You are pointing your sword at me?

357
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,740
You never told me

358
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,660
you're involved with Prince Xian.

359
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,140
Whether I'm involved

360
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,180
or not doesn't matter.

361
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,860
You'd better tell me the truth.

362
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,900
What are you hiding from me?

363
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,180
I'm helping you.

364
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,940
What?

365
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,140
Why are you really here?

366
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,900
Do you know Wuzhang's chaos

367
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,900
and people's suffering

368
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,660
all tie back to Prince Xian?

369
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,220
Of course I know.

370
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,220
It's your doing?

371
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,180
He has something you need.

372
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,260
But don't worry.

373
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,820
I won't let him harm you.

374
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,860
What does he have?

375
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,940
That's not your concern.

376
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,140
You let me go earlier.

377
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,620
Why not now?

378
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,260
I don't know what you're doing,

379
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,740
or what you plan to do.

380
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,260
But, Baicha,

381
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,980
if you're using innocent lives

382
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
as the price to help me,

383
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,340
then I don't want it.

384
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,940
Enough.

385
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,460
It's too late now.

386
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,580
There's no turning back.

387
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,220
I'll handle this myself.

388
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,540
Brother, are you okay?

389
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,580
I'm fine.

390
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,220
Why is he completely unresponsive?

391
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,380
That person must have used

392
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,860
puppetry arts to control him.

393
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,020
His name is Baicha.

394
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,140
Baicha?

395
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,260
You know him?

396
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,500
Let's just say he's no good.

397
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,900
The key to this mystery

398
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,180
lies with that man

399
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,980
and him.

400
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,620
Let's take him back first.

401
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,780
Kunlun!

402
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,580
Let him go!

403
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,300
Kunlun!

404
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:45,980
Let's go.

405
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,020
Stop the flames!

406
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,460
[Baicha.]

407
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,860
[Baicha, answer me.]

408
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,620
[Baicha.]

409
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,260
[Why won't you respond?]

410
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,860
Where's Lujiu?

411
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,940
No word yet.

412
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,940
I can't wait any longer.

413
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,820
I need to save Kunlun now

414
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,780
and find Lujiu.

415
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,540
You can't do it alone.

416
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,620
I've used Life Smoke

417
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,140
to track their auras.

418
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,220
Kunlun and Lujiu

419
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,460
are safe for now.

420
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,300
But without us,

421
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,220
no one can suppress Kunlun's condition.

422
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,660
He doesn't have much time.

423
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,860
Prince Xian left the mansion

424
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,300
and is nowhere to be found.

425
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,540
Our only choice now

426
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,500
is to find him

427
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,540
by all means first.

428
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,700
This battle is inevitable.

429
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
You can't kill him alone.

430
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,300
None of you can.

431
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,100
I know. At worst,

432
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,260
I'll die trying.

433
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,340
Muxian.

434
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,300
Muxian.

435
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,860
This is a dead end.

436
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,740
I know

437
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,380
as a mere mortal,

438
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,020
my effort may be useless.

439
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,100
But if I don't go,

440
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,980
my promise

441
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,660
to make you breakfast every morning,

442
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,380
I'm afraid

443
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,100
I'll have to break it.

444
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,380
It's not the time to talk about that.

445
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,580
Fine.

446
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
Let's talk of something else.

447
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,620
That Floral Deity you mentioned,

448
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,380
was that me?

449
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,140
The me from the past life?

450
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,500
Who told you that?

451
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,780
I once thought

452
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,740
that so-called Floral Deity

453
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,420
had

454
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,460
terrible judgment.

455
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,140
How could he treat you poorly?

456
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,580
How could he betray you?

457
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,940
Only later did I realize

458
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,420
that shortsighted,

459
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,700
faithless man

460
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,780
was actually me

461
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,980
What's the point

462
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,380
of saying this now?

463
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,580
There's a point.

464
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,100
At least it matters

465
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,940
to me.

466
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,620
What he owes me

467
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,460
can never be repaid.

468
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,820
In my heart lies deep hatred

469
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,380
that tears me apart night and day.

470
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,900
He's so despicable.

471
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,820
Though I don't remember,

472
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,460
I can feel

473
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,380
he made you heartbroken.

474
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,660
Know what? Every time I see you,

475
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,940
I think of him.

476
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,740
You look like him,

477
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,540
yet you aren't him.

478
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,300
My hatred...

479
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,180
feels hollow,

480
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,300
without an object.

481
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,500
No matter how you hate me

482
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,620
or what you wish to do to me,

483
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
I'll bear it without complaint.

484
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,380
I never considered it before,

485
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,580
but now I see

486
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,060
Heaven's justice is indeed fair.

487
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,820
I must've done

488
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,060
too many evils in my past life.

489
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,460
That in this life I'm destined

490
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,580
never to obtain what I want.

491
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,860
Heaven's justice

492
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,020
was never fair.

493
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,380
It doesn't matter.

494
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,780
Even so,

495
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,580
I still promise you

496
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,100
all my past wrongs

497
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,180
will be repaid.

498
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,100
You shall obtain

499
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
what you desire.

500
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,620
I only wish that from now on,

501
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,100
you'll no longer be shackled by hatred,

502
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,460
that you may truly find

503
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,860
peace

504
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,420
and happiness.

505
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:18,980
Your Highness!

506
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,380
Stop!

507
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,420
Your Highness...

508
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,380
Please spare me!

509
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,140
I've always been

510
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,140
your loyal follower!

511
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,860
Your Highness.

512
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,100
Listen,

513
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,220
killing them proves nothing!

514
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,580
I used to think

515
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,660
you're just stupid!

516
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,180
But now,

517
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,140
I have to say that

518
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,940
you're even insane!

519
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,780
Look at you,

520
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,980
the mighty Prince Xian in Wuzhang,

521
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,260
reduced to this non-human,

522
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,180
non-ghost thing,

523
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,180
even became a lackey for demon!

524
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,900
You aren't worthy

525
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,420
of being a ruler at all!

526
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,460
Know why I haven't killed you?

527
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,780
Keeping you alive,

528
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,620
they'll come one by one

529
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,700
right into my trap.

530
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,940
Then

531
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,420
you'll watch

532
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,260
as they die

533
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,900
before your eyes.

534
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,220
You old monster!

535
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,380
You are doomed!

536
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,500
Luyao, don't worry.

537
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,220
I've sent men

538
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,380
searching for Prince Xian and Kunlun.

539
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,020
I'll set out at the first lead.

540
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,020
What's your plan?

541
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,540
Anyway, a fight is inevitable.

542
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,620
He's no longer

543
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,100
Wuzhang's ruler,

544
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,460
just a demon

545
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,220
devouring lives.

546
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,780
You'd face such a demon alone?

547
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,500
I hardly recognize you anymore.

548
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,300
So everyone around me

549
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,700
knows their past lives.

550
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,180
Except me, completely unaware.

551
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,260
You said the last time you saw Lujiu

552
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,260
was at the mansion.

553
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,340
Any news of him since?

554
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,500
At this point,

555
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,500
perhaps it's better he left.

556
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,140
What kind of person

557
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,020
is Lujiu in this life?

558
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,940
Innocent, carefree,

559
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,860
and pure-hearted.

560
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,020
Saved me many times.

561
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,860
Does he

562
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,780
have any family?

563
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,420
He told me

564
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,220
he's always been alone,

565
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,020
raised by the nature.

566
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,820
But I've always seen him

567
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,580
as my younger brother.

568
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,540
Luyao,

569
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,620
I no longer wish to dwell

570
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,660
on our past lives.

571
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,300
Nor unravel your history

572
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,940
with Kunlun and Lujiu.

573
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,620
Let us part here.

574
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:06,900
Take care.

575
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,420
You, too.

576
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,060
Little demon,

577
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,500
kneel before your king!

578
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,100
A mere puppet,

579
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,980
how dare you act so arrogant?

580
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,300
Insignificant pest.

581
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
Have you forgotten?

582
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,540
If I hadn't found you,

583
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,620
you'd have become

584
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,340
rotten flesh corroded by resentment.

585
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,219
No different from those

586
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,380
walking corpses outside.

587
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,340
Now surrender your resentment

588
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,940
for my use.

589
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,500
The resentment is mine!

590
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,260
[It was your doing?]

591
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,500
[He has something you need.]

592
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,659
[But don't worry,]

593
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,220
[I won't let him harm you.]

594
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,260
[What does he have?]

595
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,580
[That's not your concern.]

596
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,500
[You let me go earlier.]

597
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,820
[Why not now?]

598
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,980
Finally decided to show yourself?

599
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,180
What's your relationship with Prince Xian?

600
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,220
I came to help you.

601
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,660
By sacrificing innocent lives?

602
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,260
I can't accept that.

603
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,900
You think I wanted this?

604
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,300
Hongning,

605
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,020
have you forgotten

606
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,580
how you obtained this body?

607
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,740
Shattered and remolded.

608
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,260
If simply breaking and reforming

609
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,420
were enough,

610
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,380
many demons could endure

611
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,180
the pain.

612
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,940
But why has no one succeeded like you?

613
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,860
What else are you hiding?

614
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,780
This body wasn't just

615
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,380
your shattered camellia reformed.

616
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,780
Moreover,

617
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,140
you're born from resentment.

618
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,340
[In Cangwu,]

619
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,060
[your hatred condensed into resentment.]

620
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,740
[That resentment merged]

621
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,620
[with your]

622
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,660
[shattered form,]

623
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,740
[creating the Muxian of today.]

624
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,380
[What sustains this body]

625
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,540
[is your hatred.]

626
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,340
[Without hatred and resentment,]

627
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,300
[this body would cease to exist.]

628
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,700
After crafting your form,

629
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,060
I arrived in Wuzhang,

630
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,380
found Prince Xian gathered resentment.

631
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,700
I thought

632
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,260
it'd be perfect soil

633
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,060
to nurture resentment for you.

634
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,140
So I stayed by his side,

635
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,700
used him.

636
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,340
I never thought

637
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,140
everything would spiral out of control.

638
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,140
Hongning,

639
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,340
I didn't mean to deceive you.

640
00:36:59,220 --> 00:36:59,900
If someone must bear

641
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,180
the sin of harming innocents,

642
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,940
I could do it alone.

643
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,940
I'm not worth your sacrifice.

644
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,060
You are!

645
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,620
I know you seek strength

646
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,500
and vengeance.

647
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,220
Whatever you desire,

648
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,380
I'll help you achieve it!

649
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,620
That's my promise.

650
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,660
Yet you kept lying to me!

651
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,780
Because I wanted to protect you!

652
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,580
I know your temperament.

653
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,420
Had I told you then,

654
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,460
you'd never have accepted.

655
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,020
How do you know I'll accept now?

656
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,540
My very existence

657
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,220
is built on resentment.

658
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,140
You and Prince Xian are the same,

659
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,540
both fed on resentment.

660
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,260
But you can replace him.

661
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,620
His power grows daily,

662
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,020
yet he has a weakness.

663
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,500
Only you

664
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,820
possess a demon king's strength,

665
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,700
can absorb his resentment,

666
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,180
so as to gain

667
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,460
true power.

668
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,460
How am I different from him then?

669
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,420
Completely different!

670
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,420
He sacrifices innocents

671
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,300
for immortality.

672
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,980
But you would never harm them.

673
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,380
You have greater purposes.

674
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,700
Hongning,

675
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,060
if you can claim his power,

676
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,340
you can openly face Yaotian

677
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,020
and take revenge on that hypocrite,

678
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,180
no need of Jinxiu anymore.

679
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,660
Are you in love with him again?

680
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,660
No.

681
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,340
Fine.

682
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,460
If you believe this disaster

683
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,500
is my doing,

684
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,100
I'll go end him now.

685
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,980
Wait!
