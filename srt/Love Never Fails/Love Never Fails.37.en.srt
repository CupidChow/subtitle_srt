3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,760
Your Divine Highness,

4
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,960
are you alright?

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm fine.

6
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,160
She still refuses to leave.

7
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,520
Would you like me

8
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,160
to drive her away?

9
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,320
Leave her be.

10
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Everyone in all realms

11
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,600
wants her dead.

12
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,400
Are you not worried?

13
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,880
Today,

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
had the troops not lost their way in the

15
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,520
twisted passages of Dragon's Tomb,

16
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,880
her fate would

17
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,360
have been sealed.

18
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,000
She's come a long way from

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
being that camellia pixie.

20
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Her powers as the Demon Queen have awakened.

21
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,560
She no longer needs anyone's protection.

22
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,240
Perhaps she'll be

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,120
better off without me.

24
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,120
You still

25
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
harbor feelings for her.

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,840
What difference does it make?

27
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,440
Our paths

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
must part here.

29
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,640
Your Divine Highness,

30
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,720
this place is no longer secure.

31
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,000
What's your next move?

32
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,000
Baiyu and Mokui have exhausted

33
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,120
their powers to save me.

34
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,240
It's time

35
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
we part ways.

36
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,080
Your Divine Highness,

37
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,960
please don't send me away.

38
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
This isn't banishment.

39
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,880
I want you to

40
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,959
experience life's fullness for yourself.

41
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,720
When I saved you,

42
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,680
I never expected anything in return.

43
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,159
Your loyalty

44
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,440
has gone far beyond

45
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,600
any favor I showed you.

46
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,120
But I've never

47
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,920
seen it as a burden.

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,240
Lujiu,

49
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,320
you've followed me through countless lives,

50
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,320
living solely for my sake.

51
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
What's wrong with

52
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,360
dedicating my life to you?

53
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,960
That's because you've never known

54
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,200
what it feels to live for yourself.

55
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
I've walked a path

56
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,200
of many mistakes.

57
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
It took lifetimes of pain

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
to learn this simple truth.

59
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,560
I will seek

60
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,400
my own path,

61
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,360
but until then,

62
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,120
I will not leave your side.

63
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,320
Remember these words.

64
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,560
Seek out

65
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,960
your own destiny.

66
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,640
Greetings, Sir Kunlun.

67
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,880
Where is mother?

68
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,960
She is in conference with the officials.

69
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,720
She just left.

70
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,680
I'll inform her of your arrival.

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,680
Don't bother.

72
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm here to see father.

73
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,240
You may all leave.

74
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:40,920
Yes.

75
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,680
Yes.

76
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,520
Come on, old man,

77
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
wake up.

78
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,400
Mother's so angry with Jinxiu

79
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,040
that she banished him to the mortal realm.

80
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,920
I knew

81
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,360
you've always favored him.

82
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,400
The throne was

83
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,960
meant to be his.

84
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,320
That's why I played along since childhood,

85
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,600
acting as the troublemaker.

86
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,280
I thought it would

87
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,880
keep our family in harmony.

88
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,800
Who could have guessed

89
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,360
things would turn out like this?

90
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,320
With Jinxiu in the mortal realm,

91
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
mother expects me

92
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,320
to take the throne.

93
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,320
I understand that

94
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,320
now is the time

95
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,640
to answer duty's call

96
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,240
and fulfill

97
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,640
my role

98
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,480
as a royal son.

99
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,920
But I just can't

100
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,280
make peace with myself over this.

101
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,920
You once said that

102
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,480
of the two Emperor Stars,

103
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,960
only Jinxiu's shone bright.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,200
Only the one whose

105
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,080
Emperor Star gleams

106
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,360
has the right to inherit the throne.

107
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,679
How can I seize

108
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,039
what rightfully belongs to him?

109
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,640
I cannot claim the throne

110
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,320
without true legitimacy.

111
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,560
By the way,

112
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,840
who was

113
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,040
Jinxiu's mother?

114
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,520
The divine maiden who gave birth to him

115
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,800
must have been

116
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
a stunning beauty.

117
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,400
What else could explain

118
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,720
Jinxiu's ethereal beauty?

119
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,320
Perhaps if he'd been born less handsome,

120
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,960
mother wouldn't have been so consumed by jealousy.

121
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,160
Father,

122
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,800
allow me more time.

123
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,000
When my Emperor Star finally glows,

124
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,880
perhaps I too can

125
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,800
become a worthy son in your eyes,

126
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,680
just like Jinxiu.

127
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,320
I have to leave now.

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,640
These days, the affairs are demanding,

129
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
and mother's wearing herself out.

130
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,160
She needs my assistance.

131
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,920
You've rested long enough.

132
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,320
It's time to wake up,

133
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,320
old man.

134
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,640
Take a look, my lady.

135
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,080
Our rouge is quite famous.

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,040
Have you found one you like?

137
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,840
[Quick,]

138
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,200
[which one do you prefer?]

139
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,320
[Can't decide?]

140
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,720
[I'll purchase the entire collection.]

141
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,120
[I'll take this one.]

142
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,080
Sir Jinxiu,

143
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,960
I've searched far and wide for you.

144
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,720
Are you alright?

145
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,000
My lady,

146
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,600
we are strangers to each other.

147
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,440
Please keep your distance.

148
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,120
Don't you remember me?

149
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,000
It's the injury, isn't it?

150
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Baicha told me

151
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
your divine bone was extracted.

152
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,360
How are you holding up?

153
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,240
I fail to comprehend your meaning, lady.

154
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
It's alright if you don't understand.

155
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,320
Just know that

156
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,680
I won't harm you.

157
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,920
Let me check

158
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,720
if you have other injuries.

159
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,840
This is absurd.

160
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,080
Sir Jinxiu,

161
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,440
I've spent a millennium searching for you.

162
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,320
I know I've committed

163
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,280
many wrongs against you,

164
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,600
caused you pain.

165
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
But I can explain it all.

166
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,880
My lady,

167
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,280
I don't know whose heart you've broken,

168
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,120
but I'm sure he wouldn't be pleased

169
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,760
to see you grabbing

170
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,600
another man's hand in public.

171
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,800
There is no other man.

172
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,160
It has always been you.

173
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,400
If you have no other business,

174
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,760
I shall be on my way.

175
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,160
I was gone for just a moment,

176
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,400
and you're here harassing him again.

177
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,800
He said he doesn't wish to see you.

178
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,880
Sir Jinxiu.

179
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,080
Sir Jinxiu...

180
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,240
Sir Jinxiu!

181
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
why do you lie?

182
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you still angry?

183
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,480
If it would ease your hatred,

184
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,560
you can take my life.

185
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,360
Why are you so convinced I wish you dead?

186
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,680
I'll accept whatever you choose to do.

187
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,480
There are torments beyond death.

188
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,240
If you're afraid,

189
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,960
leave now.

190
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
I won't leave.

191
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,240
You killed my father.

192
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,800
I paid for your crime with my divine bone,

193
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,600
asking only that we never meet again.

194
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,520
There's nothing more between us.

195
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,160
You know my powers are weak.

196
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,200
He could have ended my life with ease.

197
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,440
I still don't understand

198
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,000
how I managed to wound him.

199
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
How did I possess

200
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,320
such strength...

201
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,880
But I clearly remember

202
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,320
his words.

203
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,000
he had placed a Soul-binding Litany in you.

204
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,800
He admitted

205
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,080
that you were not his son.

206
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,600
[He is not my son!]

207
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,000
[If he weren't the Emperor Star,]

208
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,600
[he would have been cast into Kylin Lair]

209
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,920
[and obliterated into nothingness!]

210
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,280
Why didn't you tell me then?

211
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,000
Why did you ask me to kill you?

212
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,840
Why did you speak such harsh words?

213
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,400
Because I couldn't bear to see

214
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,000
your Floralia Palace fall with me.

215
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,200
I wanted to keep you safe,

216
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,000
but things didn't go as planned.

217
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,080
These consequences,

218
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,360
they're my fault...

219
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,280
You killed him claiming to keep me safe.

220
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
You'd rather die at my hands

221
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
rather than reveal the truth,

222
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,640
again saying it was for my protection.

223
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,480
What about the Heart Seal?

224
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,640
What's your explanation for that?

225
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,040
Another act of protection?

226
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
All along,

227
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,120
your approach to me

228
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,080
held hidden intentions.

229
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,880
You're wrong.

230
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,040
Destiny played its cruel game.

231
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,280
I was unwilling to accept it.

232
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,600
I believed

233
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,079
I was bound by vengeance,

234
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,160
but once I found you,

235
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,960
I understood that

236
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,319
my search for you

237
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,240
was never driven by hate.

238
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,720
Yet you'd rather endure the Heart Seal

239
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,760
than admit your love for me.

240
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,360
So many died because of you.

241
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
Their cries kept me awake at night.

242
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,280
But when I

243
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,520
learned of Lujiu's story,

244
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,640
I finally realized,

245
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,120
I was the one at fault all along.

246
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,560
You trusted me, loved me,

247
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,680
while I kept deceiving you.

248
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,920
I feared that once you knew the truth,

249
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,280
you'd doubt the sincerity of my love.

250
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,680
I...

251
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,400
I couldn't bear to hear you say,

252
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,320
"we shall never meet again."

253
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,600
So

254
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,800
that's why your heart

255
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,320
was aching all that time?

256
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,160
Yes...

257
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,440
it hurts...

258
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,160
my heart aches whenever I think of you.

259
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,640
What is my true identity?

260
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,920
Celestial Commander,

261
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,480
Floral Deity,

262
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,920
Sir Jinxiu...

263
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,120
Before I descended to the mortal realm,

264
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,160
mother revealed that

265
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,760
I wasn't her true-born child.

266
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,840
Regardless of your identity,

267
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
to me, you are simply my Jinxiu.

268
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
My initial plan was simple:

269
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,640
descend to the mortal world,

270
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,480
find a place I like,

271
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,600
live a life I enjoy,

272
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,040
and silently pass away there.

273
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,280
The life of an immortal is endless.

274
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,040
I spent ten millennia in heaven,

275
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,520
yet now I realize

276
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,200
those decades of mortal trials

277
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,760
left deeper marks on my soul.

278
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
I was like

279
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,360
a misplaced stone,

280
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,080
just sitting there

281
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,520
while people passed by,

282
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,600
calling out "Your Divine Highness"

283
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,440
to me, a mere stone.

284
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
But only I knew

285
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,360
that inside,

286
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,520
this stone was shattered.

287
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,440
Looking back now,

288
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,480
perhaps everything had its reason.

289
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,080
Maybe

290
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,280
I was never meant to be there.

291
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,080
Perhaps...

292
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,560
you were meant to wait for me.

293
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,040
When the emperor tried to kill me,

294
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,800
he planned to cast you into the Kylin Lair.

295
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,560
So,

296
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,080
you want me to go to the Kylin Lair.

297
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,200
I am going to accompany you.

298
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,240
Whether through hell or high water,

299
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,320
I would remain at your side.

300
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,640
After all this time...

301
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,480
why does His Majesty remain unresponsive?

302
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,400
Mother, please ease your worries.

303
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,600
Father will surely be fine.

304
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,320
Your Divine Majesty!

305
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,960
Father...

306
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,200
Father!

307
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,920
Hurry!

308
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,880
Hurry!

309
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,920
Announce to all realms!

310
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,040
His Divine Majesty has awakened!

311
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,760
Yes!

312
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,640
My beloved...

313
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,360
It's me.

314
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,840
You?

315
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,120
Why did you tap me?

316
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,480
Hey, little fox,

317
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,640
have you lost your mind?

318
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,400
Don't you know they're hunting demons?

319
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,720
Yet here you are, hanging around.

320
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,600
Aren't you afraid they'll catch you?

321
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,120
Those meatballs?

322
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,600
Well, they're welcome to try.

323
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,360
Aren't you a demon too?

324
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,400
What's your business here?

325
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,760
You think I want to be here?

326
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,280
I'm on the run with these two.

327
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,760
Here I am, trying to do you a favor,

328
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,560
and you're giving me attitude?

329
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,840
On the run?

330
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
Where are you heading?

331
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,960
To Mt. Baizhou.

332
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,440
It's become a sanctuary for demons

333
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,120
who have nowhere else to turn.

334
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,440
Halt! You won't get far!

335
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,080
Oh no,

336
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,560
It's the divine troops.

337
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,520
They must have detected our presence.

338
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,600
I swear, they can

339
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,440
sniff us out like bloodhounds.

340
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,600
Let's get out of here,

341
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,280
hurry!

342
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:46,880
Hurry!

343
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,600
Why run?

344
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,920
Let me handle this.

345
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,400
General Manwu,

346
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,560
where are you off to?

347
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,480
aren't you going to greet His Majesty?

348
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,040
As the Punisher,

349
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,440
I've seen countless demons thrown into the lair.

350
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,240
I never thought

351
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,800
it might hold answers about my past.

352
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,600
I feel such pain for

353
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,840
those demons cast into the lair.

354
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,040
They suffered terribly,

355
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,240
burned by the heavenly fire.

356
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,800
This place is meant for demons

357
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,520
of the gravest sins.

358
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,440
If

359
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,160
the emperor wished to confine me in here,

360
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,760
perhaps

361
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,360
my origins are connected to demons.

362
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,560
I think it's wonderful this way.

363
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,400
You're finally like me now.

364
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,360
They can no longer preach about

365
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,440
the divide between immortals and demons.

366
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,400
You take this rather lightly.

367
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,080
I've always been this way.

368
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
The heavenly fire is perilous.

369
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,800
This journey...

370
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,160
might be one of no return.

371
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,920
When I chose to come,

372
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,440
I had already abandoned hope of survival.

373
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,280
Shall we?

374
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,040
[This is...]

375
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,400
[My king's aura...]

376
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,520
Who are you?

377
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,280
I'm half of Yanwei, the twin-headed serpent,

378
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,640
steed of Demon King Fuzhu.

379
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,880
How curious...

380
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,920
You?

381
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,080
It is you...

382
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,840
My master,

383
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,200
the sovereign of all demons,

384
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,280
he is the Demon King.

385
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,800
Your master is the Demon King?

386
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,640
My master ruled over all demonkind.

387
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,840
I've been waiting for my master

388
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,640
for so long...so very long...

389
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,920
until I

390
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,920
nearly lost all memory...

391
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,960
You,

392
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,600
saved by his finger bone...

393
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,000
you are my rightful master!

394
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,240
Finally, after all this time...

395
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,840
Master...

396
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,240
All that you wish to know

397
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,160
lies within this eye.

398
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,240
You need to recall it all...

399
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,960
and you shall remember everything.

400
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,600
So,

401
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,360
you not only

402
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,680
condemned Jinxiu to the mortal realm,

403
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,200
but also took the liberty of

404
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,000
passing the Emperor's Seal to Kunlun?

405
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,720
Jinxiu brought a demon here

406
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,440
and plotted your assassination.

407
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
His crimes deserve no mercy!

408
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,320
I only did what was necessary.

409
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,040
Such insolence!

410
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,440
Father,

411
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,800
circumstances were critical.

412
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,280
Had I not assumed temporary authority,

413
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,200
chaos would have ensued.

414
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,640
Mother acted only out of necessity.

415
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,680
Your Majesty,

416
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,480
Jinxiu was aware that Muxian

417
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,520
was the camellia pixie,

418
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,720
yet still brought her here.

419
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,480
He purposely enabled

420
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,960
her gradual approach to you,

421
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,840
leading to your grave injury.

422
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,800
Such betrayal and defiance

423
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,400
of divine order,

424
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,640
are you still defending him?

425
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,280
And that camellia pixie as well?

426
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,040
The pixie means nothing.

427
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,160
That very pixie

428
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,600
left you in this state!

429
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,840
How can you still turn a blind eye?

430
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,200
So what?

431
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,880
A hundred camellia pixies

432
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,320
would mean nothing to me.

433
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,040
Jinxiu is all that matters!

434
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,400
Father,

435
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,800
Brother's descended to live as a mortal.

436
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,920
Please let him be,

437
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
allow him to live out his days

438
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
as a mortal!

439
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,880
Ignorant boy!

440
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,920
Such foolish mercy...

441
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,280
You know nothing!

442
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,600
I fear you'll find this disappointing.

443
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,920
Jinxiu's whereabouts among the mortals

444
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,360
are currently unknown.

445
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,280
It seems no one will be able to

446
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,000
succeed your divine throne!

447
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,120
Bring him back to me,

448
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,760
dead or alive!

449
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,800
I don't care whether

450
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
he's mortal or immortal.

451
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,480
Every demon in existence

452
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,640
may die,

453
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,040
but only Jinxiu can complete

454
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,480
this grand design

455
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,120
I've crafted for millennia.

456
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,480
Yet you all,

457
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,080
with your selfish whims

458
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,040
and foolishness,

459
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,920
have destroyed my careful planning!

460
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,080
Father,

461
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,240
I don't understand...

462
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,520
You don't understand?

463
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,280
None of you could possibly understand!

464
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,600
Issue my decree!

465
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,800
Yes, Your Majesty!

466
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,640
Search every corner of all realms

467
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,280
if necessary,

468
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,240
but bring Jinxiu to me!

469
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,440
As you command!

470
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,640
This must be what the serpent

471
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,680
meant by the dream of the eye.

472
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,880
But this Mt. Baizhou

473
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,200
looks different from the one I know.

474
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,320
Did you hear anything

475
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,680
before arriving here?

476
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,680
I heard a woman

477
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,080
calling your name.

478
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,800
Good sir,

479
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,760
is this Mt. Baizhou?

480
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,600
He can't see us.

481
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,040
What are you up to?

482
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,280
So that's what

483
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,160
dream of the eye meant...

484
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,360
Lady Cixin said

485
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,760
she loves red camellias.

486
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,640
If I make them all bloom,

487
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,520
she'll surely be happy.

488
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,560
With immortals and demons

489
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,920
on the brink of war,

490
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,080
you're still focused on

491
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,400
romance with a fairy?

492
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,640
Mind your tongue!

493
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,720
Don't tarnish

494
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,280
how she sees me.

495
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,040
I say we should

496
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,840
just storm heaven with the Black Serpent,

497
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,639
defeat her brother Yaotian.

498
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,320
Wouldn't that solve everything?

499
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,560
Scram!

500
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,480
She's almost here.

501
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,440
Little troublemaker,

502
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,639
what do you want from me now?

503
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,520
Have you been causing trouble again?

504
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,120
My lady,

505
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,840
behold...

506
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,480
It's quite lovely.

507
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,480
So Lady Cixin

508
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,520
is the emperor's sister.

509
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,239
Why has father never

510
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,960
mentioned her to me?

511
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,400
At the Withered Garden,

512
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,840
I heard he mention

513
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,000
that millennia ago,

514
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,080
it was home

515
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,679
to a fairy.

516
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,520
Though no one

517
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,480
remembers her name.

518
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,600
Perhaps...

519
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,400
she was my mother...

520
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,080
Haven't seen a trace of her,

521
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,920
why so impatient?

522
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,400
This isn't right.

523
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,200
I've been sick for a day and night.

524
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,600
What if something's happened to her?

525
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,960
Surely not...

526
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,880
She's coming!

527
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,520
Quickly, lie down!

528
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,640
The agony!

529
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,040
Oh, the agony!

530
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,360
You little troublemaker,

531
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,120
what's wrong with you this time?

532
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,680
I fear I'm lovesick,

533
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,640
afflicted with

534
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,280
the illness of longing...

535
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,640
My lady,

536
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,720
where are you going?

537
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,920
Stop these

538
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,960
childish games.

539
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,280
I shall not visit you anymore.

540
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,000
But why?

541
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,040
I am the Punisher,

542
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,760
and you are a demon.

543
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,080
Our union

544
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,880
violates the divine order.

545
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,320
So what?

546
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,240
Surely it wouldn't deny

547
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,040
our child a father?

548
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
These laws you hold so dear,

549
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,640
weren't they made by yourselves??

550
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,280
That's not what I...

551
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
All things are possible.

552
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,760
Stop

553
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,280
worrying so much.

554
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,200
Do you know what

555
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,720
matters most right now?

556
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,320
What?

557
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,160
Naming our child!

558
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,760
Haven't...

559
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,560
haven't you thought about it?

560
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,040
Have you?

561
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,040
Absolutely!

562
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,960
I've long decided.

563
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,040
Our child will surely

564
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,640
become like me,

565
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,280
supreme ruler of the world,

566
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,560
king of the demon realm.

567
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,520
So

568
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,120
I plan to name him

569
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,160
"Megatron!"

570
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,120
Do you have other ideas?

571
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,720
Not to your liking?

572
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,360
I did think of another one.

573
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,000
Come...

574
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,000
"Overlord."

575
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,880
My wish is that

576
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,480
this era of peace and prosperity endures.

577
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,040
With beautiful landscapes...

578
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,120
Shall we name them Jinxiu (splendor)?

579
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,240
Jinxiu?

580
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,320
Jinxiu...

581
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,960
Jinxiu is perfect!

582
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,920
From now on, you'll be Jinxiu.

583
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,760
You'll be Jinxiu.

584
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,880
Easy there!

585
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,360
Jinxiu...

586
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,320
Merely a scratch...

587
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,680
Cixin!

588
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,680
I know

589
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,720
you won't spare us.

590
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
All I ask is that

591
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,880
you spare this child.

592
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,320
Grant him a chance to live,

593
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,080
and we'll surrender our lives now!

594
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,880
Cixin,

595
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,960
as the Punisher,

596
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,960
how could you be so stubborn?

597
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,680
Cixin,

598
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,280
I won't let you die!

599
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,320
I want you to

600
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,760
live on with Jinxiu.

601
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,680
How can I live on

602
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,120
if you perish?

603
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,440
Master...

604
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,040
Do you truly believe you alone

605
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,520
can destroy the entire demon race?

606
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,400
You've already lost.

607
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,040
After your annihilation,

608
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,840
no one

609
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,360
in this world will remember

610
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,920
the existence of you, the Demon King!

611
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,040
You heaven-born fool,

612
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,680
how ridiculous you are!

613
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,400
You may take my life,

614
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,240
but you can't eliminate all demons.

615
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,280
As long as someone remembers,

616
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,080
the Demon King will exist.

617
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,000
And as long as the Demon King exists,

618
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,040
the demons will never submit

619
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,280
to the Celestial Realm!

620
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,800
Sooner or later,

621
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,520
a new Demon King will rise,

622
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,080
succeed me,

623
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,560
and end your life!

624
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,000
My love!

625
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,040
No...

626
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,040
My love...

627
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,880
My love!

628
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,320
Jinxiu,

629
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,480
though we cannot watch you grow,

630
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,840
may your days

631
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,680
be blessed with happiness.

632
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,240
Mother!

633
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,080
My father, the Demon King...

634
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,440
my mother, Cixin...

635
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,640
were slain by the emperor

636
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,280
I once respected...

637
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,880
Jinxiu...

638
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,320
Master,

639
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,880
now you know everything!

640
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,880
You must avenge your father!

641
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,200
You are the rightful ruler

642
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,560
of demonkind,

643
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,360
the true Sovereign of all demons!

644
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,880
Jinxiu!

645
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,480
Jinxiu!

646
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,800
All kings have been allied with Kylin.

647
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,680
Kylin protects our kind,

648
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,120
and their blood was sealed here,

649
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,480
waiting for master's return!

650
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,120
Master,

651
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,400
under its protection,

652
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,320
with eternal heavenly fire

653
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,520
and the return of Kylin blood,

654
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,000
the world shall flourish in splendor!

655
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,040
Jinxiu!

656
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,520
Jinxiu!

657
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,160
Jinxiu!

658
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,440
Jinxiu!
