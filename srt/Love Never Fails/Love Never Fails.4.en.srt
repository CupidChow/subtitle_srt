3
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:23,890
What's wrong?

4
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,329
Er...

5
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,570
My heart just started beating faster.

6
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,050
Palpitations?

7
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,890
You know medicine?

8
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,810
A bit.

9
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,930
Then take a look at me.

10
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,650
Mind your manners!

11
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,250
You know medicine, so...

12
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,490
Just describe the symptoms.

13
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,850
Symptoms?

14
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,810
It's like,

15
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,850
when I first saw you,

16
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,890
the second time,

17
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,490
and even the third,

18
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,810
my heart kept racing.

19
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,410
That's palpitations.

20
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,810
Palpitations?

21
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,730
What does that mean?

22
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,130
It's a condition.

23
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,130
Why would I have it?

24
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,410
Stop asking why.

25
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,010
Here, take this.

26
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:36,970
I'll show you how.

27
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,450
Oh right,

28
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,810
I forgot to ask last time.

29
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,930
Why are you covered in scars?

30
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,250
None of your concern.

31
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,570
Perfect your makeup.

32
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,730
Don't embarrass yourself again.

33
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,650
What's your name then?

34
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,530
We've known each other so long,

35
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,050
and I still don't know your name.

36
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,130
Jinxiu.

37
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,050
Jinxiu?

38
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,530
How can I reach you

39
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,010
when I need to?

40
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,890
What's this about?

41
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,290
I keep messing up here,

42
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,570
and you know the ropes.

43
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,850
Of course I'd need you.

44
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,570
You're incorrigible.

45
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,610
This is Lilybell.

46
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,770
Speak to it.

47
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,930
Jinxiu.

48
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,210
[Jinxiu.]

49
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,210
That's amazing!

50
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,930
Now you can use it to find me.

51
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,850
Jinxiu.

52
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:42,930
[Jinxiu.]

53
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,490
Jinxiu?

54
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,130
[Jinxiu?]

55
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:45,530
Enough.

56
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,490
Jinxiu.

57
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,250
Jin...

58
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,490
Jinxiu.

59
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,090
[I warned you before.]

60
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,810
[Only by divesting all emotion]

61
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,930
[can you attain true impartiality.]

62
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,570
[If your heart clings to anything,]

63
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,690
[you'll never be a worthy punisher.]

64
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,530
Still your heart,

65
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,409
curb your desires.

66
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,730
Still your heart,

67
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,890
curb your desires.

68
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,290
Still your heart,

69
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,370
curb your desires.

70
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,370
Hongning! Where are you?

71
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,850
I've said it a hundred times.

72
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,650
The Floral Deity took her away.

73
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,890
The tree, bird, and rabbit

74
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,530
all witnessed it!

75
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,770
Why won't you believe me?

76
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,650
I just don't!

77
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,370
[Hongning!]

78
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,970
You're not my friend anymore.

79
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,530
Seriously?

80
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,370
If she's locked up

81
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,130
over some tiny slip-up,

82
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,370
you and I would've been in jail

83
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,210
like a million times by now.

84
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,330
C'mon!

85
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,930
We just pull harmless pranks,

86
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,330
gossip about deities.

87
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,610
Hongning's different!

88
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,450
She broke the Floral Oath!

89
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:36,930
It's like you slapped

90
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,770
the Floral Deity right in the face!

91
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,850
That'd piss him off.

92
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,130
Let alone he's a punisher!

93
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:43,810
Oh no.

94
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,210
Hongning's gonna be skinned alive!

95
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,530
Don't jinx her!

96
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,650
I won't believe it.

97
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,250
Stop talking nonsense!

98
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,170
I won't believe she's gone!

99
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,810
Ningmeng.

100
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,330
I beg you.

101
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,050
Send someone

102
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,170
to ask around.

103
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,890
Already did.

104
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,650
The Baicha you know—

105
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,290
no word since he went up there.

106
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,570
What are we supposed to do?

107
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,250
[Stop it.]

108
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,610
Hongning!

109
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,130
The Floral Deity

110
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:28,970
you mentioned

111
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,090
named Jinxiu?

112
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,730
Take me where he's been.

113
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,570
Who are you?

114
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,370
That's how you ask for help?

115
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,530
Need a lesson?

116
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,730
Sir, this way.

117
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:49,730
Please.

118
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,930
Go ahead.

119
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,250
After you!

120
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,890
Stay right here

121
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,370
and grow nice and quiet.

122
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,170
Don't go bullying my camellias.

123
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,410
Help. Help me!

124
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:32,770
Help!

125
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,330
Help!

126
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,770
[Help.]

127
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,770
[Help.]

128
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,170
[Help.]

129
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,170
[Help.]

130
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:55,890
[Help me.]

131
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:07,890
You alright?

132
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,610
Hi Jinxiu, I'm fine.

133
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,290
What's with the midnight show?

134
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,850
Celestial Floralia's coming.

135
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,090
I have to move the weeds.

136
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,050
So my flower seedlings can take root.

137
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,610
Why not go to

138
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,930
the Flora Grove?

139
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,610
Too crowded there.

140
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,930
But they'll thrive here.

141
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,050
Envoy Apricot sent you?

142
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,930
No wonder you got a permit.

143
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,250
It's late. Go home.

144
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,370
I can't.

145
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,410
Must guard my seedlings.

146
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,290
The weeds may seem harmless.

147
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,450
But when provoked,

148
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,050
they turn aggressive like that.

149
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,690
At best drain your spiritual energy.

150
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,330
At worst shatter your core.

151
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,610
All more reason to stay.

152
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,210
No flowers,

153
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,010
no access to the Floralia.

154
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:56,890
Let alone meet

155
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,370
the Floral Deity.

156
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,850
What's the big deal?

157
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,850
It's important.

158
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,050
"She" saved my life.

159
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,890
I must repay

160
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,050
this debt.

161
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:09,730
Very well.

162
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,330
Listen.

163
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,690
I am the Floral Deity.

164
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,930
Of course you are.

165
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:16,970
What?

166
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,410
Official Chrysanthemum

167
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,770
claims the title too.

168
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,050
Maybe I was such a deity as well

169
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:22,930
hundreds of years ago.

170
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,850
Everyone's a deity up here.

171
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,530
But the Floral Deity I seek

172
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,210
has this...

173
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,050
This

174
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,090
mark on "her" forehead.

175
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,730
Not someone

176
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,010
who just

177
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,810
wanders around like you.

178
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,410
You...

179
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,290
Alright, alright.

180
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,890
I know you mean well,

181
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,450
but I have no choice.

182
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,010
Gotta guard my seedlings.

183
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,690
What now, Jinxiu?

184
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,010
Gonna look up some info.

185
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:12,850
I...

186
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,410
Let's go.

187
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,930
My seedlings.

188
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,210
There's no other way.

189
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,810
Cast a protection charm

190
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,970
around your seedlings.

191
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,330
Don't know how.

192
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,290
Focus your spirit.

193
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,810
Say:

194
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,810
Celestial Guard, by Divine Decree!

195
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,290
Celestial Guard, by Divine Decree!

196
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,410
Why isn't it working?

197
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,250
You haven't had any training.

198
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,530
This incantation's too

199
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,650
advanced for you.

200
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,250
No choice then.

201
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,970
Clear the vines first. Then replant.

202
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,810
Help me, Jinxiu.

203
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,450
Flowers for the Floralia

204
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,570
must be grown by yourself.

205
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,770
Helping you would be cheating.

206
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,090
Well...

207
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,530
Celestial Guard, by Divine Decree!

208
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,730
Won't work.

209
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,170
No one else has

210
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,330
mastered it on the first try except me.

211
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,850
It's working!

212
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,490
Look!

213
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,170
It isn't

214
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,210
as big as mine was.

215
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,250
Big?

216
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,890
Celestial Guard, by Divine Decree!

217
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:26,890
Bigger now?

218
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,450
[You should thank me for my phalanx.]

219
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,450
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,210
Let's go.

221
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,610
You live here?

222
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,810
It looks nice.

223
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,890
But I have a weird feeling…

224
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,130
like I've been here before.

225
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,090
Shh.

226
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,410
The ancient book

227
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,330
only says

228
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,290
vines vanish in a day.

229
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,330
Nothing on

230
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,610
how to cut them early.

231
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,970
What's so funny?

232
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,770
I said research the vines,

233
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,330
not read this junk!

234
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,290
You put it here. Your stuff.

235
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:44,690
I...

236
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,130
Besides, I can't read anyway.

237
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:49,770
Fine.

238
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,410
We'll just wait a day

239
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,530
for it to disappear.

240
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,730
Really?

241
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:56,850
Perfect.

242
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,130
I'm tired anyway.

243
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,130
Time to sleep.

244
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,530
Who said you could sleep here?

245
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,450
Get up.

246
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,250
What's wrong?

247
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,970
Am I...

248
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,370
in your way?

249
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,970
I can move over

250
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,690
for you to sleep.

251
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,010
A man and woman alone shouldn't

252
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,170
[even share a roof.]

253
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,530
Especially not

254
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,610
sleeping together.

255
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,930
What does that mean?

256
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,010
You and I

257
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,970
can't stay in the same room.

258
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,610
But there's no one else here.

259
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,410
Should we call others in?

260
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,690
You...

261
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,410
This is ridiculous.

262
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,490
It's not appropriate for others

263
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:47,890
to see us like this.

264
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,690
So many rules.

265
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,730
I'm sleeping anyway.

266
00:14:59,010 --> 00:14:59,530
Get up!

267
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,250
So we can't share a room,

268
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,930
but we can bathe together?

269
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,130
Shut up.

270
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,650
I...

271
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,690
I need peace.

272
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,370
Stay here until

273
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,050
the vines dissolve.

274
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,730
Why should we stay here?

275
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,930
To cultivate.

276
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,970
Floralia Palace is lovely.

277
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,490
What's over there?

278
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,210
Quiet.

279
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,090
And there?

280
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,170
Stop talking!

281
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:18,890
Hey!

282
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,609
Isn't this for bathing?

283
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,770
Get out.

284
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,089
It's fun. Join me?

285
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,290
No.

286
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,410
Come on!

287
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:28,970
Get in.

288
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,690
Hurry up!

289
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,490
Fun?

290
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,370
Yeah!

291
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,170
I heard something.

292
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,850
You must have misheard.

293
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,770
Check over there.

294
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,330
Okay.

295
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,010
Wake up.

296
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,890
You okay?

297
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,450
Your cheeks are flushed.

298
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,490
It's nothing.

299
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,530
Look.

300
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,170
Flowers are blooming at night.

301
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,490
What's made the Floral Deity

302
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,450
so happy?

303
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,650
Stop it.

304
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,210
Look, look!

305
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,330
The mimosa.

306
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,770
It's drooping its head.

307
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,450
What's

308
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,610
making "her" shy?

309
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,810
Nonsense.

310
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,650
They say

311
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,810
"she" acts

312
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,930
all cold, but "her" head's

313
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,970
buzzing with thoughts.

314
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,210
Shut up.

315
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,610
The Floral Deity...

316
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,730
kinda weird.

317
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,930
Feels like no one can tell

318
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,570
what "she" is thinking.

319
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,970
But the flowers

320
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,890
everywhere

321
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,410
show it all for "her"!

322
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,850
Shut it!

323
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,930
Don't go guessing what Floral Deity feels.

324
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:52,890
Deal.

325
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,690
What's going on here?

326
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,690
Sir,

327
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,170
someone boiled you?

328
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,290
Why are you so soaked?

329
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,330
You…

330
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,490
Someone grilled you?

331
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,370
Why all wet?

332
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,250
Lock her up in the Phantom Reflector!

333
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,330
Yes.

334
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,730
Uh… for how long?

335
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,570
Till the world

336
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,490
ends!

337
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,450
Go count flower petals!

338
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,290
On it!

339
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,810
Don't catch a cold!

340
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,130
Your thunder punishment's not even over,

341
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,650
now what mess are you up to?

342
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,330
Know why you're locked up?

343
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,770
Tell me, why did you

344
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,410
crash into the Blossom Spring?

345
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,810
I just wanted a bath.

346
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,530
Couldn't you just pick a

347
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,090
normal spot?

348
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,090
Spill it.

349
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,970
How'd you get in?

350
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,290
Jinxiu took me there.

351
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,370
You…

352
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,010
You and him…

353
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,330
He found me first at Flora Grove.

354
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,010
We read some books,

355
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,250
then napped together.

356
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,690
Finally, we hit the bath.

357
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:45,930
[Just the two of them?]

358
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:46,690
[No clue.]

359
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,810
[How could this be?]

360
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,690
Why though?

361
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,690
Why tell me all that?

362
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,490
You want me to go ask him myself?

363
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,610
You trying to drive me to death?

364
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,930
Go ahead and ask!

365
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,970
I'm telling the truth anyway!

366
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:02,610
You…

367
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:03,730
I…

368
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,330
I…

369
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,610
Sir,

370
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,970
I beg you,

371
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,210
I have to attend the Celestial Floralia.

372
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,370
I have to meet the Floral Deity.

373
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,930
Stop talking!

374
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,450
Is this the time to talk about it now?

375
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,930
I regret coming here!

376
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,810
If it wasn't to write history down,

377
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,650
I…

378
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:25,330
Tell me,

379
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,290
with what you just said,

380
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,290
should I even write it down or not?

381
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,250
Please, pretty please?

382
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,250
Listen up,

383
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,530
one word, no way!

384
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,610
That's two words.

385
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,170
Fine.

386
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,570
Anyway,

387
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,850
no matter how you beg,

388
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,730
I'm not letting you out.

389
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,050
Get in there.

390
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,490
Hurry!

391
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,530
Where is this?

392
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,810
Move it!

393
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,050
[It's the Flora Scroll.]

394
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,810
[Once you're]

395
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,210
[done counting petals,]

396
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,650
you can

397
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,490
get out.

398
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,090
Take your sweet time!

399
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,810
Counting petals?

400
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,970
[This Flora Scroll]

401
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,410
[was an imaginary realm made]

402
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,650
[by Floral Deity to drive you nuts.]

403
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,050
[Even immortals get wrecked]

404
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,090
[after 20 years in here.]

405
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,090
[Let alone you,]

406
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,970
[a rookie pixie.]

407
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,930
Who are you?

408
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,970
Kunlun.

409
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,410
So you are that

410
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,770
Scourge Jester?

411
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,570
Even pixies know me,

412
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,250
guess I'm pretty famous.

413
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,090
Then,

414
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,410
you're Floral Deity's brother?

415
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,850
[You even know that?]

416
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,930
So you must know how to get out of here.

417
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,730
Easy. Finish counting.

418
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,610
Impossible!

419
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,770
You must know another way!

420
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,370
You're not just any pixie.

421
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,730
Scourge Jester.

422
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,650
Tell me, how to leave here?

423
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:42,930
Finish counting

424
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,330
the petals.

425
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,210
I'm done.

426
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,450
I'm exhausted!

427
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,090
The Envoy Apricot said Sir Jinxiu

428
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,490
would like this dance. But true?

429
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,850
What about you? Do you like it?

430
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,250
You're my shadow,

431
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,730
so you think what I think.

432
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,290
Keep going!

433
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,970
I'll go send the invites now.

434
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,890
Greetings, Sir.

435
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,690
What is it?

436
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,850
All the immortals

437
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,130
are making final prep in the Flora Grove.

438
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,730
But raining hard these days.

439
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,930
It's tough to protect the flowers.

440
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,690
Storms and winds

441
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,250
are part of the seasons.

442
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,890
Any complaints?

443
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,730
Everyone knows

444
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,250
it's your way of testing us, Sir,

445
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,690
no complaints at all.

446
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,050
Still, in the next few days,

447
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,890
no more crazy storms,

448
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:31,770
right?

449
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,490
Got it,

450
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,410
I'll take my leave.

451
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,130
[Then take a look at me.]

452
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,370
[Jinxiu.]

453
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,690
[Jinxiu.]

454
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,410
[Jinxiu?]

455
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,730
[Jinxiu?]

456
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,010
Is Floral Deity

457
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,850
really as bad-tempered

458
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,290
as they say?

459
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,490
Bad? That's putting it nicely.

460
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,810
We're born together,

461
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,730
but worlds apart on appearance!

462
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,890
Can you provide more details?

463
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,290
Er...

464
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,450
Three heads,

465
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,970
each with a sharp horn!

466
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,770
Mouth's like volcanoes,

467
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,210
square jaw, wide face,

468
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,410
built like an ox,

469
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,090
with fleshy wings on back!

470
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,130
Sounds epic!

471
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,170
Then I must attend the Celestial Floralia!

472
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,850
It's a chance too great to miss.

473
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,530
Right.

474
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,730
31…

475
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,210
Lost count again!

476
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,090
Counting petals

477
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,370
is harder than counting stars!

478
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,090
Yeah.

479
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,290
Unless…

480
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,330
the sky goes dark,

481
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,530
or you'll never finish!

482
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,130
The sky goes dark?

483
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,930
In the past 48,000 years,

484
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,690
there're 96 Celestial Floralias.

485
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,170
But every time,

486
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,290
only 99 flowers would bloom in full.

487
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,450
I was hoping

488
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,130
we could finally get

489
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,690
a full 100 blooming together.

490
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,090
But…

491
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,490
Since she's in the Flora Scroll,

492
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,850
she has to finish counting the petals.

493
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,250
Otherwise,

494
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,890
she wouldn't be let out.

495
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,170
[Your flowers look amazing!]

496
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,050
[Yours look great too!]

497
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,050
[Greetings.]

498
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,810
Envoy Plum, Envoy Apricot.

499
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,530
Any news

500
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,450
about Hongning?

501
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,650
You better focus on your own prep.

502
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,890
No more worries about her.

503
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,530
Got it.

504
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,730
You lot

505
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,970
stop chatting here!

506
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,130
Celestial Floralia's a big deal.

507
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,890
When NCR Matriarch gets here,

508
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,850
don't you dare mess it up!

509
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,850
Understood.

510
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,170
Let the Celestial Floralia begin.

511
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,010
Welcome, Sir Jinxiu.

512
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,850
Welcome, Sir Jinxiu.

513
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,650
Greetings, Sir Jinxiu.

514
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,890
So that's Sir Jinxiu?

515
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,530
Keep your voice down!

516
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,290
Didn't you see what happened to Hongning?

517
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,690
What a pity.

518
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,450
She worked so hard,

519
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,970
but still didn't make it here.

520
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,370
NCR Matriarch arrives.

521
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,810
[She's gorgeous!]

522
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,210
[She is definitely]

523
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,770
stunning!

524
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,010
But…

525
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,570
why is the Matriarch dancing with

526
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,889
apricot blossoms flying around?

527
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:12,850
[Weird.]

528
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,770
Zip it!

529
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,090
Your dance is so unique.

530
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,050
I'm surprised.

531
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:51,889
Celestial Floralia is a big event,

532
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,409
I couldn't come empty-handed,

533
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,050
so I prepared this dance

534
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,409
as a gift.

535
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:57,730
Sorry if

536
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,130
it's not great.

537
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,810
Just having you here

538
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,770
is a blessing for us.

539
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,690
Shouldn't have bothered.

540
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:06,450
No trouble at all.

541
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,250
As long as the Celestial Monarch likes it.

542
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,330
This way, please.

543
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:16,850
Serve the wine.

544
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,130
Serve Blossom Brew.

545
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,250
- Thank you very much, Sir.
- Thank you very much, Sir.

546
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,610
Please enjoy.

547
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,450
Tastes amazing!

548
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,690
How is it made?

549
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,930
It's so fragrant!

550
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,530
Since NCR Matriarch is here,

551
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,330
I have something

552
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,050
to announce.

553
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,530
[What is it?]

554
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,130
What is it, really?

555
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,450
I don't know neither.

556
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,650
Could it be about his marriage?

557
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:05,490
Stop!

558
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,490
Sir,

559
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,050
why is she following you out?

560
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,090
What do you mean by following?

561
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,090
We finished counting the petals,

562
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:18,970
can't we come out?

563
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,010
Move aside!

564
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,330
If I'm late, you're done for!

565
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:23,650
I helped you…

566
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,770
not even a 'thanks'?

567
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:26,530
Stop right there!

568
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,650
[Throughout the millennia I've overseen]

569
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,570
the Floralia Palace,

570
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,410
your contributions

571
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,530
to its prosperity have been invaluable.

572
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,410
But I won't stay forever.

573
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,130
So I've decided to

574
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,890
choose 12 Floral Deities

575
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,650
from the list,

576
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,690
who will jointly protect

577
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,050
and ensure the long-term peace of

578
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,890
the Palace and

579
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,810
our Flora Clan.

580
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,690
Thank you, Sir.

581
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,010
No. 1 pixie on earth?

582
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,570
But you can't even fly?

583
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,370
If I could, wouldn't I

584
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,610
be No. 1 in the sky?

585
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,090
Makes sense.

586
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,290
For this Floralia,

587
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,570
99 flower families have come together,

588
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,010
truly the celebration for our Flora Clan.

589
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,890
Ladies,

590
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,210
thank you so much.

591
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,570
Let the flower offerings begin.

592
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,410
Comes the Apricot family.

593
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,530
Greetings, Sir.

594
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,090
The apricots are in full bloom.

595
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,210
Thank you!

596
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,930
Comes the Jasmine family.

597
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,970
Greetings, Sir.

598
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,810
Long branches, few flowers, and weak scent.

599
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,970
This is the flower you've tended?

600
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,330
Sorry, Sir.

601
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,370
Check for me,

602
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,210
are my eyebrows even?

603
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:21,850
They're fine.

604
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,130
What about me?

605
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,730
Fine too.

606
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,850
My flower doesn't even look vibrant!

607
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,730
[Comes the Magnolia family.]

608
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,770
Greetings, Sir.

609
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,890
Monotonic colors,

610
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,450
sparse branches.

611
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,810
You may go.

612
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:51,730
Yes, Sir.

613
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,050
What should I do?

614
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,210
I'm really disappointing!

615
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,490
Sir,

616
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,570
Shaoyao is the last

617
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,130
to be selected today.

618
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,450
Would you like to end it now?

619
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,090
Let's end it.

620
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,610
The flower offerings come to an end.

621
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,210
Sir.

622
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:37,850
[Wait!]

623
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,330
[I'm coming!]

624
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,770
How bold, camellia pixie!

625
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,690
Aren't you in the Flora Scroll?

626
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,810
How dare you sneak into the Floralia?

627
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,690
Finished counting, any problem?

628
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,890
Floral Deity.

629
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,050
Jinxiu?
