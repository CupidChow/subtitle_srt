00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,020
Hongning,

4
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,820
what if

5
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,940
I married someone else?

6
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,740
Then I won't talk to you anymore.

7
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,220
Sir,

8
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,620
I'll treat you well.

9
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,940
Northern Celestial Realm

10
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,420
proposed a marriage of me and the Matriarch.

11
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,539
My father is in favor of it.

12
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,780
Did you say yes?

13
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,580
I turned it down.

14
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,420
Father,

15
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,250
I'm afraid I can't do that.

16
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,740
What did you just say?

17
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,260
Please decline the proposal.

18
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,180
Why?

19
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,290
There's nothing

20
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,780
between me and the NCR Matriarch.

21
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,180
I have no intention of marrying her.

22
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,820
This marriage

23
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,220
is not yours to decide.

24
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,660
Father,

25
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,540
I'll do anything else you ask.

26
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,420
But not

27
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,020
this.

28
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,900
I'll leave you alone, then.

29
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,820
I'll go back to cultivate.

30
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,340
Hongning.

31
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:02,940
Hongning.

32
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,820
You little camellia pixie,

33
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,090
I gave you

34
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,580
my word.

35
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,060
You won't go back on it?

36
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,100
I won't.

37
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,220
Then I won't let other female take you.

38
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,260
Because you're mine.

39
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,220
What am I to you?

40
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,060
You're my Floral Deity.

41
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,660
Say it again.

42
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,380
You're mine.

43
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,020
And my name?

44
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,300
Jinxiu.

45
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,780
Just

46
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,500
call me that from now on.

47
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,820
Sir, this doesn't feel right.

48
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,340
Fine,

49
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,860
only when no one's around.

50
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,780
Then I'll call you Jinxiu.

51
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,340
I really need to go back,

52
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,620
or I won't have time to cultivate.

53
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,380
No rush.

54
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,820
Many immortals are here to attend

55
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,820
the Celestial Banquet.

56
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,700
It's better not to head down now.

57
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,740
Later,

58
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,020
someone will escort you.

59
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,700
Who?

60
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,460
Sir,

61
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,420
I beg you.

62
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,019
I don't wanna do this.

63
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,420
I've served you for thousands of years.

64
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,220
And I've worked hard!

65
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,060
You're the one

66
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,740
I trust most in the Palace.

67
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,660
So I'm leaving her in your care.

68
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,420
Find a safe place

69
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,380
and take her back to Mt. Baizhou.

70
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,700
Sir,

71
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,860
you trust me, right?

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,020
She'll be safe,

73
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,500
but what about me?

74
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,540
If someone finds out,

75
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,340
I'll be...

76
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,620
If you got caught,

77
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,220
go down to the mortal realm with her.

78
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,460
Don't ever come back.

79
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,260
Go down?

80
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,180
Serious?

81
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,460
Where could I even go?

82
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,620
Think about me just a bit.

83
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,020
I wanna go to the Celestial Banquet.

84
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,580
Can I?

85
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,140
Well,

86
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,100
if you don't agree,

87
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,700
I'll just keep

88
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,300
bowing till you give in.

89
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,980
I'm sure you'll feel bad about it.

90
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,020
You're not that heartless.

91
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:04,860
I and...

92
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,180
I...

93
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,860
Thanks, Official Chrysanthemum.

94
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,020
I...

95
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,700
He really left?

96
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,940
What's going on?

97
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,580
I think that looks great.

98
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,420
It looks nothing like great.

99
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,500
It feels so festive.

100
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,860
What a mess.

101
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,380
Check it out.

102
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,900
But isn't that

103
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,180
dazzling?

104
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,980
I've never seen anything like it.

105
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,420
[What are you doing?]

106
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,140
[You turned the sky into a mess of colors.]

107
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,340
[Where are your manners?]

108
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,620
[That's more like a proper banquet.]

109
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,780
[This is the Celestial Banquet.]

110
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,340
[Show some respect!]

111
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,140
[And what if I don't?]

112
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,420
[What are you gonna do about it?]

113
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,780
[The banquet's about to begin.]

114
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,020
[Stop this nonsense, now.]

115
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,820
Your Majesty.

116
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,060
How did it go?

117
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,580
I lost track of Sir Jinxiu for a while.

118
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,780
But he's now at the banquet.

119
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,260
Lost track?

120
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,700
Please forgive me.

121
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,460
Forget it.

122
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,260
Have other immortals arrived?

123
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,020
Yes.

124
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,460
- Your Majesties.
- Your Majesties.

125
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,140
It's a

126
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,659
grand gathering of Celestial Realm.

127
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,620
It's my pleasure

128
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,820
to see all immortals

129
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,820
gather here today.

130
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,140
This celebration is the fruit of

131
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,220
devotion to the heavenly order,

132
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,580
and self-discipline.

133
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,860
May all

134
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,260
carry the duty of upholding

135
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,940
the heavenly order.

136
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,180
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

137
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,260
This banquet

138
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,020
was prepared

139
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,820
by Kunlun and NCR Matriarch.

140
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,540
You've done well.

141
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,460
Father, I'm

142
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,020
quite flattered.

143
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,220
Thanks, Your Majesty.

144
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,580
I'm honored to be

145
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,020
part of the preparations.

146
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
Everyone,

147
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,580
cheers.

148
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,540
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

149
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,540
as for the marriage proposal...

150
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,580
It's been approved.

151
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,980
I will personally divine an

152
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,060
auspicious date for the wedding.

153
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,180
Thank you so much.

154
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,900
This is a great honor for NCR.

155
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,740
At that time, I'll send

156
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,500
Golden Lotus Dew

157
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,940
as the dowry to you.

158
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,260
It's our blessing that Jinxiu

159
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,860
can marry NCR Matriarch.

160
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,620
Sir.

161
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,940
I hope you don't mind

162
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,780
the little scuffle during the banquet.

163
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,980
Kunlun's too immature.

164
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,660
Hope it didn't cause too much trouble.

165
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,420
Sir,

166
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,220
why do you look upset?

167
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,620
You're overthinking it.

168
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,100
I've known you for years.

169
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,860
I've never seen you like this...

170
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,580
Thank you

171
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,220
for helping

172
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,500
Envoy Narcissus.

173
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,540
I haven't properly thanked you.

174
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,140
This toast is for you.

175
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,940
No need to be so formal.

176
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,500
My only wish

177
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,660
is to someday be your...

178
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,700
Heaven's got big plans for my brother.

179
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,300
Jinxiu,

180
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,100
Sir Taiyi's looking for you.

181
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,380
Please excuse me.

182
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,260
Wait, don't leave just yet.

183
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,060
I don't have anything to say to you.

184
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,020
Step aside.

185
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,860
Just a friendly reminder.

186
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,780
You really haven't noticed

187
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,540
how polite he is to you?

188
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,500
Mind your business.

189
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,340
Who'd be dumb enough to marry you?

190
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,220
The line of fairies chasing me

191
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,980
could stretch to the Southern Gate.

192
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,740
Just like that?

193
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,220
Not far away.

194
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,700
It's two rows.

195
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,700
In both directions.

196
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,500
That's it?

197
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,900
You two get along quite well.

198
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,180
- That's ridiculous!
- That's ridiculous!

199
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,860
You...

200
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,100
Denying it?

201
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,380
Repeat it.

202
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,460
When I become immortal,

203
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,140
I can marry Sir Jinxiu.

204
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,700
Pardon?

205
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,620
I said,

206
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,820
when I...

207
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,620
I've said it three times.

208
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,260
Did you hear me clearly?

209
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:36,940
I...

210
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,900
I'm a bit confused.

211
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,220
You made me miss the banquet,

212
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,420
but that's fine.

213
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,980
Are you saying

214
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,860
Sir Jinxiu

215
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,860
agreed to marry you?

216
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,540
That's what he said.

217
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,540
He'll marry me as long as I'm immortal.

218
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,020
Look me in the eyes.

219
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,060
Are you serious?

220
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,260
Of course.

221
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,860
If you don't believe me,

222
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,860
go ask him yourself.

223
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,020
No, no.

224
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,660
Everyone knows

225
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,180
Sir Jinxiu and NCR Matriarch

226
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,100
are about to...

227
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,420
He told me

228
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,700
he'll tell His Majesty

229
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,300
to turn down the proposal.

230
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,620
This is

231
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,020
the latest

232
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,380
Golden Chrysanthemum Nectar.

233
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,620
Have a try.

234
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,500
It's super rare.

235
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,860
By the way,

236
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,660
if I ever did anything wrong

237
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,820
before,

238
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,820
I hope you won't hold it against me.

239
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,820
Where's that coming from?

240
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,700
You've never upset me.

241
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Good, that's good to hear.

242
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,940
Oh, the thunder punishment!

243
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,340
It's fine.

244
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,900
I know you were just

245
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,180
doing your job.

246
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,700
How many thunders are left?

247
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,380
C'mon, forget it.

248
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,260
There's no such thing.

249
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,020
It's over a long time ago.

250
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,980
No,

251
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,580
still 26 left.

252
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,820
Whenever you have time,

253
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,100
let's go finish them.

254
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,020
You're really the future Celestial Empress.

255
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,380
That mindset, perspective, and composure

256
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,820
are truly impressive.

257
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,700
When are we heading back to Mt. Baizhou?

258
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,500
They're all at the banquet.

259
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,860
No one'll notice you.

260
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,060
But I can't fly.

261
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,220
Wait, don't tell me.

262
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,780
You don't even know the flying spell?

263
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,820
How could you become an immortal?

264
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,340
What kind of future empress

265
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:54,980
are you?

266
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,260
You! I...

267
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,460
Stop!

268
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:58,940
Wait,

269
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,180
give it back to me!

270
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,780
It's a real treasure.

271
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,820
Seal the Golden Lotus Dew.

272
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,500
Prepare to send it to the Celestial Realm.

273
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,660
Yes, Sir.

274
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,700
My Lord, please reconsider.

275
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,780
It's the lifeblood

276
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,300
of the NCR.

277
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,220
A drop needs tens of thousands of years.

278
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,060
We cannot just give it away.

279
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,060
If not for it,

280
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,580
the Celestial Realm wouldn't have readily

281
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,580
agreed to the proposal.

282
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,020
Only when Luyao becomes Empress,

283
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,860
can our realm

284
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,060
once again rise to the top.

285
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,740
My Lord,

286
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,620
those up there are shrewd.

287
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,860
If we must send it,

288
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,780
it should be on the day of the wedding.

289
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,780
They're so eager to get it.

290
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,700
Something must be wrong.

291
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,220
If the delay costs Luyao

292
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
the position of the Empress,

293
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,380
that would be the real loss.

294
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,780
My Lord!

295
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,780
You're just short-sighted!

296
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:28,420
Your Highness,

297
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,540
there's something I need to ask you.

298
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,660
We grew up together,

299
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,780
and I know you well.

300
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,980
Do you truly

301
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,140
wanna marry the Celestial Commander?

302
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Why wouldn't I?

303
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,860
The marriage has been proposed,

304
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,660
but if you're unwilling,

305
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,420
I'll help you.

306
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,500
You misunderstood.

307
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,580
I agree to marry him.

308
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,980
And I'm willing.

309
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,100
Protecting this land is our duty.

310
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,540
You don't have to use your marriage

311
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,380
as a bargaining chip.

312
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,980
I am the NCR Matriarch.

313
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,260
It's my way to protect.

314
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,620
Besides,

315
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,220
I'm more than happy to

316
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,460
become the Celestial Empress.

317
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,100
I think you've got it wrong.

318
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,540
How could I?

319
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,660
I just don't want you to suffer.

320
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,340
I'll never let myself suffer.

321
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,580
Luyao!

322
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,980
You should know your place.

323
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,620
Have you sent her back?

324
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,340
Yes.

325
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,060
I escorted her to the mortal realm myself.

326
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,100
Sir,

327
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,020
Hongning told me

328
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,660
you promised to make her the Empress

329
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,620
and reject marrying Luyao.

330
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,060
Sir,

331
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,580
I think this is...

332
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,340
My father's guards are following me

333
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,900
to find out who I rejected the marriage for.

334
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,740
Before she becomes immortal,

335
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,380
I can't go to the mortal realm again.

336
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,540
I see.

337
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,980
Sir,

338
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,740
how much longer before

339
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,780
she takes the tribulation?

340
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,740
Including the merit

341
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,820
of breaking the Shuixian mirage,

342
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,100
she should ascend soon.

343
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,420
Hongning.

344
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,020
Baicha?

345
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,620
Where did you go

346
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,180
on the Lantern Festival?

347
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,620
I...

348
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,060
It's okay.

349
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,580
I just haven't seen you in a few days

350
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,060
and thought I'd check on you.

351
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,980
I can't accept your gift.

352
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,620
We didn't even spend the festival together.

353
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,100
Alright, then.

354
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,500
Days ago,

355
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,180
I heard

356
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,180
some news from the Celestial Realm.

357
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,900
What's that?

358
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,500
Marriage of the Celestial Commander

359
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,580
and NCR Matriarch.

360
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,500
I know.

361
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,580
You know?

362
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,820
So he lied to you, didn't he?

363
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,580
No, he didn't.

364
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,820
He wouldn't do that.

365
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,380
But he's a deity,

366
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,420
while you're a pixie.

367
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,940
Even if you love each other,

368
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,380
you can't be together.

369
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,420
The war between the two is bound to start.

370
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,900
Even if he chose you,

371
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,220
how will others there react?

372
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,620
Once I pass the immortal tribulation,

373
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,100
we can be together.

374
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,220
Alright.

375
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,660
I'll leave you to it.

376
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,780
Rain.

377
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,660
Snow.

378
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,500
Thunder.

379
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,540
Cut it out.

380
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Rare to see you in foul temper.

381
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,940
Where's your little camellia?

382
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,460
Off cultivating, as usual.

383
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,580
Got some tricks up your sleeve, huh?

384
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,660
A camellia

385
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,180
changed her nature for you,

386
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,860
now pursuing ascension.

387
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,020
Cut the sarcasm.

388
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,740
Tell me.

389
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,220
That day in front of Father,

390
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,100
you refused the marriage to Luyao.

391
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
Was it for her?

392
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,620
None of your concern.

393
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,340
Her spirit amuses me, truly.

394
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,500
But have you thought

395
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,580
that she's still a pixie.

396
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,100
She's cultivating to be an immortal.

397
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,300
If she succeeds, fine.

398
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,460
But if not?

399
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,540
She'll make it.

400
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,700
Sir Jinxiu.

401
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,700
Though you taught me

402
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,220
how to dodge lightning...

403
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,660
I'm still scared.

404
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,860
Please watch over me from above.

405
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,020
Sir, will I survive the tribulation?

406
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,380
I taught you the transformation.

407
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,140
Create a false form,

408
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,620
the lightning won't find you.

409
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,420
All you have to do is hide.

410
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,060
Our floral kind

411
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,580
may lack defenses,

412
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,620
but we regenerate.

413
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,940
Even if struck...

414
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,140
Don't fear.

415
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,420
But I'm terrified.

416
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,380
What if it damages my core?

417
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,780
When I regenerate,

418
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,220
what if I forget you?

419
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,540
That won't happen.

420
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,740
Don't you

421
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,980
trust me?

422
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,820
I do.

423
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,260
I'm gonna be your consort.

424
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,380
Of course I trust you.

425
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:06,970
Stay calm.

426
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,980
Once you survive this,

427
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,930
I'll personally register you

428
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,100
on the list.

429
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:13,900
Fear not,

430
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,420
I'm watching over you.

431
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,060
Remember: never leave the ground,

432
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,500
protect your core.

433
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,580
Go hide now.

434
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,180
I gotta reveal

435
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,820
my true form.

436
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,940
You... just go.

437
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,540
Okay.

438
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,620
[Hongning.]

439
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,980
[Stay calm.]

440
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,900
[Just endure this.]

441
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,660
[Survive this,]

442
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,780
[and you'll become one of]

443
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,820
[the immortals in Celestial Realm.]

444
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,940
[Then,]

445
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,130
[you can properly]

446
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,370
[stay by Sir Jinxiu's side.]

447
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,900
[This time... you must succeed.]

448
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,060
[I'm invisible...]

449
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,580
[Invisible…]

450
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,300
[It hurts.]

451
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,860
[Sir Jinxiu.]

452
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,540
[His Majesty summons you.]

453
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,620
[Golden Lotus Dew from NCR.]

454
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,260
Father.

455
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,020
Luyao and

456
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,620
I are just friends.

457
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,660
Nothing more.

458
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,540
I can't marry her.

459
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,540
Royal marriages

460
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,260
require no affection.

461
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,020
[Can't you see the realm's peril?]

462
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,860
Though NCR weakens,

463
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,340
their Golden Lotus Dew

464
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,180
is coveted by all realms.

465
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,380
With it,

466
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,420
your wounds could heal.

467
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,620
Giving us strength

468
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,780
against unforeseen threats.

469
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
I vow,

470
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,580
should the realm need,

471
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,700
even without this dew,

472
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,740
I'll lead our forces.

473
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,300
As future

474
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,380
ruler of three realms,

475
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,300
your life

476
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,060
and heart

477
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,980
aren't yours to give.

478
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,140
I understand,

479
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,340
but marriage...

480
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,980
I've sworn to another.

481
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,020
None but her.

482
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,740
How dare you!

483
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,860
I'll endure 81 heavenly strikes

484
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,820
before wedding Luyao!

485
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,580
Sir Jinxiu.

486
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,100
[Remember your destiny.]

487
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,100
[Persist in rebellion,]

488
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,620
[these lightning strikes]

489
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,620
[are just the beginning.]

490
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,660
Both of you.

491
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,700
Guard this place well.

492
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,900
No mistakes.

493
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,820
Understood?

494
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,620
Yes!

495
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,700
Hongning...

496
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,100
You actually survived.

497
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,620
Congratulations.

498
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,580
Greetings, Envoy Apricot.

499
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,100
Have you seen Sir Jinxiu?

500
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,540
Haven't seen him all day.

501
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,420
Halt!

502
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,220
Not on the list,

503
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,860
no entry to Floralia Palace.

504
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,940
Sir Jinxiu promised

505
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,940
after surviving tribulation,

506
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,300
he'd help me with that.

507
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,460
These are recent reports.

508
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,260
Check previous records for delays.

509
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,780
No mistakes tolerated.

510
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,740
But she just went through tribulation.

511
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,500
Shouldn't she...

512
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,300
Who hasn't?

513
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,860
Playing fragile over minor wounds?

514
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,540
She's just a lowly pixie.

515
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,380
Kept here by

516
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,660
Sir Jinxiu's pity.

517
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,540
Everyone here fulfills their duties,

518
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,540
working tirelessly.

519
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,180
Yet she

520
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,180
shamelessly clings to Sir Jinxiu,

521
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,020
creating endless troubles!

522
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,100
When I entered the palace,

523
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,620
Sir Jinxiu said

524
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,140
my only duty

525
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,860
was cultivation.

526
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,340
I'm simply fulfilling

527
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,540
my obligations.

528
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,820
How exactly

529
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,140
am I burdening?

530
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,820
Unlike you,

531
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,380
always causing him trouble.

532
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,380
What?

533
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,860
You...

534
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,900
How dare you?

535
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,860
Envoy Plum manages

536
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,540
all affairs here.

537
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,140
But you

538
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,140
just boss others around.

539
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,780
What exactly do you contribute?

540
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,420
What...

541
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,020
I'll deliver the reports.

542
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,300
Excuse me,

543
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,820
have you seen Sir Jinxiu?

544
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,380
No.

545
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,460
Sorry, is Sir Jinxiu inside?

546
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,540
Seen Sir Jinxiu?

547
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,260
No.

548
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,460
Seen Sir Jinxiu?

549
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,180
No.

550
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,660
Seen Sir Jinxiu?

551
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,460
No.

552
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:55,940
Still painful?

553
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,180
Where were you today?

554
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,100
Just ran an errand.

555
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,100
I almost died today.

556
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,420
You did well.

557
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,740
You said

558
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,100
you'd lift me upon the list.

559
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,380
Already done.

560
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,180
Now a junior immortal,

561
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,340
why stay in this hovel?

562
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,740
I knew

563
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,660
you'd come find me here.

564
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,660
Sir Jinxiu.

565
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,060
You haven't taught me

566
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,060
how to pass the third trial.

567
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,820
Dodging lightning's easy,

568
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,580
but immortality's price

569
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,500
must be paid.

570
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,660
No trials,

571
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,220
no ascension.

572
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,700
I mean...

573
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,780
Prioritize survival,

574
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,860
but never hide.

575
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,220
Each trial

576
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,860
brings heavier punishment.

577
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,940
So,

578
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,380
you must cultivate diligently.

579
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,020
With you here,

580
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,580
I fear nothing.

581
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,900
Sir Jinxiu.

582
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,460
Hold me again?

583
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,820
Nice.

584
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,020
Hongning.

585
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,500
Finally an immortal.

586
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,380
Of course.

587
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,340
I'll be Sir Jinxiu's consort.

588
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,780
Know you the requirements?

589
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,580
Isn't ascension enough?

590
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,060
What's this?

591
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,260
Should you

592
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,300
wed a junior immortal,

593
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,940
you must

594
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,460
first become one.

595
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,460
But Sir Jinxiu

596
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,980
is Celestial Realm's

597
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,060
supreme deity!

598
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,660
Given Sir Kunlun's condition,

599
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,460
Sir Jinxiu

600
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,020
may become Emperor.

601
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,460
His consort should be Empress.

602
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,780
To claim

603
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,180
that title,

604
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,180
you need three

605
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,180
qualifications.

606
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,540
First, lineage.

607
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,260
Second, talent.

608
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,780
Third, virtue and cultivation.

609
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,980
All must be peerless

610
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,500
to earn heavenly approval.

611
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,140
So...

612
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:24,940
I...

613
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,220
Don't interrupt.

614
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,180
Let's focus on lineage.

615
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,260
Current Empress Yihe

616
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,380
descends from West Sea royalty

617
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,620
and Empyrean Fairy.

618
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:40,940
Luyao

619
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,740
is the princess of NCR.

620
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:44,980
And you?

621
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,260
I…

622
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,420
I don't think I have parents.

623
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,940
Be confident.

624
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,780
Now the second:

625
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,220
talent.

626
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,660
Yihe mastered

627
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,700
all realms' languages and

628
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,660
knew all flora by four.

629
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,500
Luyao

630
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,260
mastered six arts by six,

631
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,140
tamed all beasts by ten.

632
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,380
And you?

633
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,260
I'm good too!

634
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,100
I can eat, sleep, make wine,

635
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,460
and cook delicious food.

636
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,380
I know magic too!

637
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,340
Magic?

638
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,620
What kind?

639
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,140
Transformation.

640
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,940
I can turn into Sir Jinxiu

641
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,020
or you...

642
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,980
I can even...

643
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,980
Okay, okay.

644
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,660
That's still just one type.

645
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,220
I can learn more!

646
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,300
Now third:

647
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,460
virtue and cultivation.

648
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,540
This is the most

649
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,060
crucial of the three.

650
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,860
If the first two fall short,

651
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,660
the third compensates.

652
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,420
Look.

653
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,340
This document

654
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,660
records your virtues.

655
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,940
It's only a few words.

656
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,140
Why taking so long?

657
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,100
I can't read.

658
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,380
"Grew weeds."

659
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,180
"Broke the Narcissus mirage."

660
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,500
That's all?

661
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
You can't read,

662
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,100
but you can count, right?

663
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,780
It's barely two lines.

664
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,020
This is for NCR Matriarch,

665
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,060
Luyao.

666
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,780
She protects her people and is beloved.

667
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,340
Impressive for her age.

668
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,180
She's that good?

669
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,860
Wanna see

670
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,060
Empress's records?

671
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,260
Yes.

672
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,700
So many...

673
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,860
From start

674
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,140
to the end,

675
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,580
all these scrolls

676
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,580
record her divine virtues.

677
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,180
To be Empress

678
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,340
requires so much virtue?

679
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,860
See?

680
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,060
A junior immortal

681
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,020
is worlds away from Empress.

682
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,260
Don't despair though.

683
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,620
This fantasy isn't

684
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,540
worth pursuing anyway.

685
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,060
Don't worry,

686
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,980
I won't despair.

687
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,260
I'll cultivate tirelessly

688
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,900
to earn this qualification!

689
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,740
You're not even listening...

690
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,580
Why

691
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,540
are you so obsessed

692
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,260
with wedding

693
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,940
Sir Jinxiu?

694
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,860
Because I love him!

695
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,140
What's happier than

696
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,020
marrying your beloved?

697
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,380
Alright, enough.

698
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,780
You shouldn't fixate on marriage.

699
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,660
Countless girls want him.

700
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,700
But he loves me back.

701
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,900
Initially I sought

702
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,260
to repay his kindness,

703
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,420
but he

704
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,260
wants no other repayment.

705
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,780
I'm totally speechless.

706
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,060
Can't believe you said

707
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,300
such bold words without blushing.

708
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,740
Unmatched in heaven

709
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,780
or earth!

710
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:41,740
Unbelievable.

711
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,860
It's the truth!

712
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,620
Lineage and talent matter little.

713
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,340
If he chooses me,

714
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,140
I'll trust him.

715
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,420
Becoming a senior would do, no?

716
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,460
Hongning.

717
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,100
Rising from junior to senior

718
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,060
is no easy feat.

719
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,020
What's the big deal?

720
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,060
You...

721
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,300
It takes

722
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,660
thousands or even

723
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,500
tens of thousands

724
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,220
of years,

725
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,660
with thunder trials

726
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,420
far worse than yours.

727
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,220
I know.

728
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:21,980
You're

729
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,940
talented,

730
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,460
but your foundation's weak.

731
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,740
Stop dreaming, okay?

732
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,980
What now?

733
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,060
Sir.

734
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,340
Tell me how

735
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,180
to increase cultivation.

736
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,420
Cultivation?

737
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,620
You said

738
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,540
lineage and talent don't matter.

739
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,300
So just teach me

740
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,900
to increase cultivation.

741
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:54,740
You...

742
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,900
Come on, stop it.

743
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,100
You'll break it.

744
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,180
Yeah.

745
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,780
There are many ways.

746
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,780
Like...
