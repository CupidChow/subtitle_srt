[Love Never Fails]
[EP06]

3
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,979
I'm here.

4
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,300
Sir, why teleport here?

5
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,540
I need to update the Flower Fairy Book,

6
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,780
you know the way.

7
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,620
Why so sudden?

8
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,820
I'll take my leave then.

9
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,100
Sir, there's no need to be

10
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,980
so stiff with me.

11
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,260
Smile a bit more, like you just did.

12
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,060
You really have

13
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
a nice smile.

14
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,660
I…

15
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,380
have a nice…

16
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,700
Come out, now!

17
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,700
How dare you run around

18
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,820
pretending to be me?

19
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,420
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,140
I didn't mean to.

21
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,260
But you told me,

22
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,860
when practicing transformation,

23
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,700
I have to stay focused,

24
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,860
and picture who I wanna become.

25
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,380
So I turned into you.

26
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,140
But...

27
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,820
I couldn't change back.

28
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,700
That's why I came to find you.

29
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,060
Who told you to use me as practice?

30
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,300
I…

31
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,820
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,579
That's all?

33
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,220
I'm really sorry!

34
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,540
You're practically committing blasphemy!

35
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,380
What did you screw

36
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,740
around with while wearing my face?

37
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:56,660
I… I didn't do much.

38
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,300
I ran into NCR Matriarch right away!

39
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,620
I… I had a sip of nectar.

40
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,740
That's all you did?

41
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,900
I just dipped my finger in some

42
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,420
and touched it to her lips, that's all.

43
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,380
Anything else?

44
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,140
Nope.

45
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,420
Oh, I also praised her beauty.

46
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,290
And I said her eyebrows

47
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,330
look amazing.

48
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:26,930
And I…

49
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,210
Do you even know what you're doing?

50
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,490
Listen up,

51
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,650
never transform into me again.

52
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:45,770
Okay.

53
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,730
Celestial 94,000-Year History, Vol. 3,

54
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,690
Sir Jinxiu cast

55
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,930
a mute spell on Official Chrysanthemum.

56
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,490
But why would he do that?

57
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,050
The writing's way too vague,

58
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,770
how's anyone supposed to get it?

59
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,970
Sir Jinxiu got pinned against the wall?

60
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,210
Educate...

61
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,690
camellia pixie

62
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,970
on human nature inside and out.

63
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,250
I won't tell anyone.

64
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,450
Not even if it kills me!

65
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,330
Sir,

66
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,250
why so early today?

67
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,570
Class is now

68
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,170
in session.

69
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,010
Men and women should keep their distance.

70
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,690
Men and women should keep their distance.

71
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,210
Right.

72
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,290
It means that

73
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,450
men and women

74
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,210
shouldn't touch or chat too freely.

75
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,570
So men and men,

76
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,770
or women and women

77
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,530
can touch and chat freely?

78
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,770
Well, not always.

79
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,650
I have a question.

80
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,250
Go ahead.

81
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,450
If a person

82
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,970
takes on someone else's face

83
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,530
and compliments a fairy,

84
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,050
why does the guy get mad?

85
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,090
He's scared that fairy may fall for him.

86
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,409
[Do you even know what you're doing?]

87
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,690
[Get back to the Withered Garden!]

88
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,530
Oh no!

89
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,290
Wait!

90
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,370
Could it be…

91
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,090
Forget it.

92
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:10,810
So,

93
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,090
we have

94
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,210
floral immortals,

95
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,250
pixies and mortals,

96
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,690
all of different genders, right?

97
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:18,810
Exactly!

98
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,090
You got it!

99
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,210
Noted,

100
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,770
I'll make sure I get it right next time.

101
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,170
Let's move on to the next.

102
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,250
Yes!

103
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,210
Keep distance!

104
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,970
Alright.

105
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,210
Good.

106
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,370
Class dismissed.

107
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,050
Hongning,

108
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:21,930
did you see

109
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,330
the materials I just brought over?

110
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,530
I think I left some behind.

111
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,850
This one?

112
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,530
What's this?

113
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,370
Why didn't you teach me this?

114
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,049
It's called

115
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,690
pair cultivation,

116
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,610
of great benefit to both parties.

117
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,929
Don't tell anyone about it.

118
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,289
I won't.

119
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,450
Go grab it.

120
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,970
[After you turned into me,]

121
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,290
[what did you see?]

122
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,210
[Not much, really!]

123
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,370
[Just a little bit.]

124
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,930
[Here, here,]

125
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:07,930
[and here.]

126
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,410
[And…]

127
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,250
[er…]

128
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,570
Left me hanging!

129
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,610
[Love is at the root of all things.]

130
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,690
[Even immortals can fall in love.]

131
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,850
[Some once fell so deep that they]

132
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,650
[wasted away, lovesick day after day.]

133
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,650
[This piece is to show all the immortals]

134
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,650
[what love is.]

135
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,250
[Pair cultivation based on love]

136
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,410
[is the best way for cultivation.]

137
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,930
Pair cultivation based on love?

138
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,650
Sir.

139
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,810
Having some free time,

140
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,370
I just dropped by.

141
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,010
About that day…

142
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,250
you are not mad at me, are you?

143
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,930
You definitely wouldn't!

144
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,370
Otherwise, the Palace

145
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,850
would be up in a storm!

146
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,770
That day…

147
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:22,930
you said…

148
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,770
It was all my fault!

149
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,290
Official Chrysanthemum

150
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,970
already explained it to me.

151
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,650
Men and women should

152
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,490
keep a distance.

153
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,690
He sure took that seriously!

154
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,770
Sir,

155
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,810
you didn't come here

156
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,690
just to confirm that, right?

157
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,370
No.

158
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,410
I came to check your cultivation.

159
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,730
I've already learned transformation!

160
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,890
My magic's stronger too!

161
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,130
You're misusing your energy.

162
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,530
Drop it.

163
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:10,850
Next, meditation.

164
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,090
Okay!

165
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,210
You're in the wrong posture!

166
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:31,610
Look,

167
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,690
sit like me,

168
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,490
back straight,

169
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:35,890
legs flat on the ground,

170
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,450
hands open, resting on your knees,

171
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,290
like this.

172
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,530
Now, close your eyes.

173
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,090
Focus,

174
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,090
feel the energy

175
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,690
flowing inside you.

176
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,970
I think meditation is way too slow.

177
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,970
Let's find a faster one.

178
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,090
There's no shortcut.

179
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,250
There is, if you help me.

180
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,850
Nonsense.

181
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,730
They say pair cultivation is faster.

182
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,930
Let's do it.

183
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,210
Who told you that?

184
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,330
Do you even know it's…

185
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,570
Based on love.

186
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,930
Sir, besides repaying

187
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,210
your kindness,

188
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,610
I think I've fallen for you.

189
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:06,730
Fallen for me?

190
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,410
Who taught you all this?

191
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,970
Official Chrysanthemum's…

192
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,370
books…

193
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,010
taught me.

194
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,290
[I swear I'm innocent!]

195
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,610
Still your heart, curb your desires.

196
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,890
Still your heart, curb your desires.

197
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,810
Still your heart, curb your desires.

198
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,650
Still your heart, curb your desires.

199
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,970
[Sir, a letter from His Majesty.]

200
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,050
Got it,

201
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,610
you may leave.

202
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:01,770
Yes, Sir.

203
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,290
Greetings, Father.

204
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,450
Rise.

205
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,130
How's your Oceanic Arts going?

206
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,810
No progress yet,

207
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,930
I'm still stuck on the third level.

208
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,330
It powers the Celestial Realm's magic.

209
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,290
Remember to reinforce the litany.

210
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:34,570
Understood.

211
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,850
To achieve higher-level,

212
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,090
you have to endure pain

213
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,930
and backlash others can't even imagine.

214
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,610
Hang in there.

215
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,610
I understand.

216
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,570
Stop right there!

217
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,250
Hongning?

218
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,130
Greetings, Sir.

219
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,410
What a coincidence!

220
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,810
What are you doing here?

221
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,210
I came to steal…

222
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,810
I mean, gather some lily nectar.

223
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,530
Don't you know the lilies in this garden

224
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,810
are under my watch?

225
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,370
I do.

226
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,090
You've got some nerve!

227
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,250
Careful there!

228
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,490
I just wanna make some nectar.

229
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,370
You can just pick the ones lower down.

230
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,690
Don't worry.

231
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,890
Only the innermost lilies

232
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,530
make the sweetest nectar.

233
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,730
You've tasted it?

234
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,170
Of course!

235
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,770
But lilies have delicate stems.

236
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,890
Picking like that,

237
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,450
you'll ruin other flowers.

238
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,770
I'm the Emperor Star,

239
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,290
Sir Kunlun!

240
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,770
I've never

241
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,810
gone out of my way to help anyone!

242
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,330
But now I'm helping you pick flowers!

243
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,810
Just zip it!

244
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,690
Someone's coming! Hide!

245
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,810
What are you doing up there?

246
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,330
I… uh…

247
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,770
I was worried the wind

248
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,130
might blow the flowers apart.

249
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,570
Isn't it your job

250
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,370
to keep an eye on the wind here?

251
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,609
That's right!

252
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,010
So I climbed up

253
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,250
to check the wind strength.

254
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,490
Done checking?

255
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:17,970
Sir.

256
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:21,329
the lilies have been thriving lately.

257
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,369
Sir Jinxiu

258
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,930
sent over a jar of flower nectar

259
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,369
to reward you.

260
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,569
Thanks, bro!

261
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,850
You've done well guarding the garden.

262
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,090
But drinking might mess things up.

263
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,130
Better not take it.

264
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:33,810
No, wait!

265
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,210
You know I love a good drink, bro!

266
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:36,850
Come on!

267
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,970
I live for this stuff!

268
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:39,650
Hey!

269
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,090
Don't just leave like that!

270
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,890
Hongning, come…

271
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,250
Hongning?

272
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,010
This is what Envoy Apricot was tending?

273
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,770
She's still

274
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,370
locked in the Phantom Reflector.

275
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,650
Learned lesson yet?

276
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,890
What is this place?

277
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,050
How do I get out?

278
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,810
[She realized she's wrong.]

279
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,050
Sir,

280
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,330
please forgive her this once.

281
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,770
Two more days, then let her out.

282
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,730
Meanwhile, you tend these flowers.

283
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,370
Sir, please keep your cool.

284
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,890
The whole apricot clan

285
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,610
got dragged into this for no reason!

286
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,850
How pathetic!

287
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,130
Sir,

288
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,530
why not take a look at the others?

289
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,570
A few fairies are waiting

290
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,890
for your guidance.

291
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:09,890
Where are they?

292
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,810
This way, please.

293
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,130
Greetings, Sir, Envoy Plum.

294
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,050
Still tending flowers so late?

295
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,690
Envoy Plum said, practice makes perfect.

296
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,250
[These have just bloomed!]

297
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:43,970
Please take a look.

298
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,570
What's different?

299
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,690
How deep purple!

300
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,410
Haven't seen one in centuries!

301
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,610
Shaoyao.

302
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,090
It's purple indeed.

303
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:21,970
Anything else?

304
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,850
Nope.

305
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,210
Then head back for now!

306
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,610
What's wrong with Sir Jinxiu?

307
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,090
Feels like he's mad at me.

308
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,610
Who let you

309
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,570
crawl around inside my robe?

310
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,450
I didn't mean to.

311
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,570
There was a crazy blackout,

312
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,410
and I got lost…

313
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:04,970
I…

314
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,170
- I didn't know where I was going…
- Tell me.

315
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,250
Where exactly did you wander?

316
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,450
I told you I got lost!

317
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,210
I don't know where I ended up!

318
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,650
Hongning,

319
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
after learning all this long,

320
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,820
you still don't know proper manners?

321
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,490
What did I do wrong?

322
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,410
No one ever told me

323
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,010
what to do

324
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,050
if I accidentally fell into

325
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,130
someone's robe!

326
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,690
No more excuses!

327
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,290
Why were you

328
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,130
alone with Kunlun

329
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:27,970
in the Wine Garden

330
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,250
in broad daylight?

331
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,770
Not like that.

332
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,610
It's daytime...

333
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,610
Didn't you say as long

334
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:36,850
as we're outdoors...

335
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,490
Hongning,

336
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,410
if you don't know how to behave yourself,

337
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,730
don't come see me again!

338
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,330
If it were Kunlun...

339
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,130
Impossible!

340
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,050
Just say "Yes, Sir."

341
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,610
Yes, Sir.

342
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,370
I just wanted to...

343
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,090
Quiet.

344
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,690
Yes, Sir.

345
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,450
You also lose your temper sometimes.

346
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,770
[Lemon Pixie.]

347
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,010
[Jiaobo.]

348
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,970
[How do I spell it?]

349
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,250
[No big deal. I'll just draw.]

350
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,130
[Everyone at Mt. Baizhou,]

351
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,450
[how have you been?]

352
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,050
[It's been a few months since I came here.]

353
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,050
[I left in a hurry,]

354
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,130
[and I didn't even get to say goodbye.]

355
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,050
[Did you miss me?]

356
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,610
[I miss you all so much.]

357
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,610
[It's a beautiful place here]

358
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,690
[with so many flowers.]

359
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,610
[I've met the Floral Deity,]

360
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,570
[but I haven't married him yet.]

361
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,410
[I need to become immortal first.]

362
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,890
[Today's the Mid-Autumn Festival.]

363
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,290
[I wish I could celebrate it with you.]

364
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,850
[Can't wait to see you again.]

365
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,850
No casting items from the Withered Garden.

366
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,350
[Casting Objects Forbidden]

367
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,330
You should also nourish flowers at night.

368
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,650
Don't slack off.

369
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,330
Still upset about that day?

370
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,450
In this way,

371
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,850
your homesickness can be settled.

372
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,210
Aren't I amazing?

373
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,850
Hiding wine here is strictly forbidden.

374
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,010
They're lower-quality brews.

375
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,010
If only Jiaobo

376
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,730
and Lemon Pixie were here.

377
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,130
I could ask

378
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,210
for more mint.

379
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,850
The wine would taste much better.

380
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:41,530
You know,

381
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,770
nothing can uplift you

382
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,890
more than a good drink.

383
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,730
The Palace rules say,

384
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,490
no drinking outside

385
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,690
the Flower Festival or

386
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,250
without the Floral Deity's permission.

387
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,490
But this isn't the Floralia Palace.

388
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,290
And...

389
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,090
aren't you the Floral Deity?

390
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,930
No guessing at divine will either.

391
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,010
Why are you staring at me?

392
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,690
Sir,

393
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,490
you're so good-looking.

394
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,050
Watch your tongue.

395
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,690
And don't drink with others,

396
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,210
or you'll be punished.

397
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,930
I can't drink with you

398
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,810
or anyone else.

399
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,090
Jiaobo and Lemon Pixie are still the best.

400
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,810
Why were you sad just now?

401
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,170
I wasn't.

402
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,810
It was

403
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,490
the moon that bullied me.

404
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,730
Sir?

405
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,410
Let me go!

406
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,370
Here he is.

407
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,250
The moon who bullied you,

408
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,850
Lunar Deity.

409
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,290
[Lunar Deity]
Wait,

410
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,890
Sir, it's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

411
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,610
I'm busy assisting Matchmaker God,

412
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,610
making cakes for Moon Goddess,

413
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,690
and feeding the Jade Rabbit.

414
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,570
How would I even have time to bully her?

415
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,050
You've got it wrong.

416
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,370
It's a

417
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,250
misunderstanding.

418
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,930
You should've said it clearly.

419
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,090
Missing your home and friends?

420
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,770
How's that the moon bullying you?

421
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,410
You were too quick to react.

422
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,450
You didn't even let me finish.

423
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,850
Sir,

424
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,530
you know,

425
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,290
every Mid-Autumn Festival,

426
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:24,810
no,

427
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,850
every festival,

428
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,290
I was with my friends.

429
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,850
They took me out

430
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,930
to have fun.

431
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,810
Jiaobo sang beautiful songs

432
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,930
and cook the best dishes.

433
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,410
Lemon Pixie told me

434
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,210
stories and jokes.

435
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,130
They took good care of me

436
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,290
and sheltered me from everything.

437
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,730
I miss them so much.

438
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,530
Do you know that

439
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,850
once you ascend,

440
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,370
it'll be harder for you to see them?

441
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,890
It's better

442
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,770
to sever the ties now.

443
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,770
No matter what I become,

444
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,490
I'll always stay with them.

445
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,530
All calamities start from attachments.

446
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,170
Only by curbing desires

447
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,490
can you survive the heavenly trial.

448
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,970
No matter what trials I face,

449
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,090
I won't leave them behind.

450
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,970
Do you know how reckless you sound?

451
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,130
You think the heavenly trial

452
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,210
is like thunder punishment 500 years ago?

453
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,330
It could be 999 divine lightning bolts,

454
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,930
1,000 years of thunder punishment,

455
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,450
or having your soul ripped apart.

456
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,050
The soul-crushing pain is unbearable.

457
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,810
Sir, is there

458
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,810
anyone you couldn't let go of?

459
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,730
Family? Friend?

460
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,890
Sir?

461
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,370
Are you drunk?

462
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,250
Sir,

463
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,410
why refused to pair cultivation with me?

464
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,770
Cultivating on my own

465
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,250
is way too slow.

466
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:21,930
Stop fooling around.

467
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,250
Get up.

468
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,810
Tell me why?

469
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,130
Do you even know

470
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,370
what it really means?

471
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,650
Of course I do.

472
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,410
I've seen it.

473
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,770
That's what it's.

474
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,810
You know, right?

475
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,570
If you don't,

476
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,610
I can teach you.

477
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,610
You're not allowed

478
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,250
to do it with anyone else,

479
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,210
or just mention it.

480
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,050
- Or you'll get punished.
- Or I'll get punished.

481
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,570
I know.

482
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,290
That's why

483
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,930
I'm only asking you.

484
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:58,770
I've told you,

485
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,970
I did practice archery last night,

486
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,570
but I aimed at the East Sea, not the moon.

487
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,130
Sir... my apologies.

488
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,050
We were just following procedure.

489
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,450
Lunar Deity's memory got wiped.

490
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,370
Besides you,

491
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,650
who else in Celestial Realm

492
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:12,730
could've done...

493
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,010
Fine,

494
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,130
it does sound like something I'd do.

495
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,210
But I didn't!

496
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,050
Why are you still here?

497
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,690
Okay, I'm leaving right now.

498
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,170
Snatching the moon?

499
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,050
Sounds kinda fun.

500
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,930
But if it wasn't me, then who?

501
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,370
Quick, put this away.

502
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,450
It's lily nectar.

503
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,530
What are you so busy with?

504
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,690
You look worried.

505
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,850
The roots of

506
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,010
this camellia are hurt.

507
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,050
But my spirit power's too weak

508
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,690
to save it.

509
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:49,850
That's easy.

510
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:51,770
Put it down.

511
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:08,969
It's done.

512
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:11,850
How impressive!

513
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,530
What a to-do!

514
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,210
Jinxiu's only a bit stronger than me

515
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,210
'cause he's picked up Oceanic Arts

516
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,290
over the past two years.

517
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:26,449
By the way,

518
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,170
are there bellflowers,

519
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,889
frostgrass, and sweet root

520
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,010
in Floralia Palace?

521
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,290
What do you need them for?

522
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,050
Make some herbal remedies.

523
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,489
Of course, there are

524
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,090
herbs in the Palace.

525
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,290
But

526
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,010
they're all in the Herb Garden.

527
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,050
Immortal miasma fills that place.

528
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:46,250
A little pixie like you

529
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,929
would pass out there soon.

530
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,210
Forget it.

531
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,950
[Herb Garden]

532
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,550
[Thick with immortal miasma.
No entry for those under millennial cultivation.]

533
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,650
Sir?

534
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,690
Are you out of your mind?

535
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,850
Why... am I here?

536
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,890
I remember I fainted just now.

537
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,290
You have the nerve to talk?

538
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,210
Didn't you see the warning?

539
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,450
With your level of cultivation,

540
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,210
how could you survive the miasma?

541
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,690
I had to hurry.

542
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,570
But you shouldn't barge in.

543
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,610
Do you know

544
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,290
if I hadn't heard the Lilybell,

545
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,530
you would've perished

546
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,930
after one hour?

547
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:39,490
I...

548
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,130
I did this for you.

549
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,730
For me?

550
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,530
I went there to pick some herbs

551
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,450
I needed,

552
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,770
honeysuckle, bellflower, frostgrass,

553
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:54,930
and

554
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,050
sweet root.

555
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,090
I want to make some remedies.

556
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,130
It's a secret recipe from my family.

557
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,090
I heard it can heal burns.

558
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,130
Your wounds look like burns.

559
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,810
How did you get so many wounds?

560
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,690
Does it hurt?

561
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,330
I said no need!

562
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,450
Besides,

563
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,570
it's not worth risking your life.

564
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,730
You're kind to me,

565
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,450
and I love you.

566
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,450
You're hurt,

567
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:31,890
and of course I have to help you.

568
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,370
You...

569
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,570
You brought me up to here,

570
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:36,850
and helped me cultivate.

571
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,650
We drank wine together.

572
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,650
You also drew eyebrows for me once.

573
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,010
No one's been this good to me.

574
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,370
I just got careless

575
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,930
and passed out from the miasma.

576
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,650
It's not hard to avoid the miasma.

577
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,450
You just need to advance your cultivation.

578
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,450
But you're

579
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,570
either causing trouble or getting punished.

580
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,290
You don't take cultivation seriously.

581
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,410
I know.

582
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,410
I'll work hard from now on.

583
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,530
You'd better keep your word.

584
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,090
I haven't made the remedies.

585
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,010
Are you leaving again?

586
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,650
What if...

587
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,650
I can't find you when I miss you?

588
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:30,930
You have the Lilybell.

589
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,530
You can find me easily.

590
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,770
You mean this?

591
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,810
If you're ever in danger,

592
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,210
just ring it.

593
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,170
What if I can't ring it

594
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,130
or can't even speak?

595
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,050
Then just pluck a petal.

596
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,770
I'll come to you right away.

597
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,170
He's gone?

598
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,770
Looks like he's in a better mood now.

599
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,090
I can't bathe in the Celestial Pool,

600
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,650
but this'll do just fine.

601
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,930
[If you're ever in danger,]

602
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:20,890
[just ring it.]

603
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,210
[What if I can't ring it]

604
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,010
[or can't even speak?]

605
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,170
[Then just pluck a petal.]

606
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,610
[I'll come to you right away.]

607
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,210
Sir.

608
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:32,850
Sir,

609
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,450
I know I'm wrong.

610
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,730
Keep your temper in check.

611
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,210
These days,

612
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,570
Envoy Plum

613
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,810
helps you look after the Apricot Clan.

614
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,330
As the Envoy Apricot,

615
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,610
you should know

616
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,450
everything you say and do

617
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,850
affects your clan.

618
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,090
Don't make mistakes again.

619
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,690
Understood.

620
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,610
Sir Jinxiu saved me twice.

621
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,610
'Cause you passed him the message, right?

622
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,250
How did you manage to do that?

623
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,650
After the Floralia,

624
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,970
any change in the mortal clans?

625
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,650
Sir,

626
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,970
after that,

627
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,010
957 new names

628
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,330
have been registered.

629
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,450
Ever since the harsh winter ended,

630
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,330
flora has flourished even more.

631
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,410
I was... just kidding.

632
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,850
Don't take it seriously.

633
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,570
It didn't fall off, right?

634
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,290
Sir?

635
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,850
It should be fine, huh?

636
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,410
Please, don't call him over.

637
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,210
Hongning!

638
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,850
Sir?
