3
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,240
Master!

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,640
Master, hurry!

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,920
Well,

6
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,400
I didn't mean to bother you.

7
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,200
I saw a block of ice in the forest,

8
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,600
knew it was Bailing,

9
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,320
so I nudged it

10
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,120
to tease him.

11
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,040
But,

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,640
Bailing turned human form, and just...

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,160
stopped breathing...

14
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,080
I...

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,400
That's...

16
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,000
Ow, ow, ow...

17
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,120
Ow, ow, ow...

18
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,400
Ouch!

19
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,640
That hurts!

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,760
Wait, Bailing,

21
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,600
why prank me?

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,680
I never messed with you.

23
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,240
I...

24
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,960
Sorry, Tian Nanxing.

25
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,640
If I hadn't,

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,120
Master wouldn't show up.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,440
Master, look.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,480
Those saplings you told me to plant

29
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,079
are now a whole forest.

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,200
Will you finally say

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,520
why you made me do it?

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,200
Wenxin.

33
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,640
Yes.

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,360
Master must have his reasons.

35
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,800
Tian Nanxing.

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,720
He has his fate in it?

37
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,680
Bailing.

38
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,760
Am I

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,480
being tested?

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,560
It's to show you that

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,960
every tree and blade of grass is hard-won.

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,080
Learn to cherish them.

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,880
Forget it.

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,920
You've re-forested for years.

45
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,160
That counts.

46
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,760
From today,

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,160
join your mates

48
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,520
and hunt demons down the mountain.

49
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,560
Thank you, Master!

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,680
I'll go now.

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,840
Avoid...

52
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,520
Wang's Village.

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,079
Don't wander far.

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,640
Be home for supper.

55
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,320
Dad,

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm heading up the mountain for herbs.

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,760
Fine.

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,200
Oh, and steer clear

59
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,640
of Mt. Cangwu.

60
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,240
Got it.

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,960
Bye!

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,400
Take care.

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,960
Hongning chatted

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
to our radishes again the other day.

65
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,880
Yesterday

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,960
I saw her talking

67
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,440
to a rock by the wall.

68
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,880
That girl...

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,480
Oh, stone, dear stone,

70
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,720
some people

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
just love

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
to gossip.

73
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,680
Always talking behind others' backs,

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,000
no filter at all.

75
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,040
But our Hongning's

76
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,360
quick-witted.

77
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,200
She'll talk to anyone she likes,

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,560
and nobody can stop her.

79
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,720
Today the creek

80
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
feels colder than usual.

81
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,120
Look at this chunk of ice!

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,040
I'll haul it back.

83
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,920
Give my drink stand a fancy twist.

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,280
Hurry up!

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,000
Wait for me!

86
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,480
Ningmeng.

87
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,920
Ningmeng.

88
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,000
Ningmeng.

89
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,800
Wake up!

90
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,000
I told you,

91
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,640
don't call me "Ningmeng" in the street.

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,560
Forgot you're not human, sorry.

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,240
Never mind,

94
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,440
you wouldn't listen anyway.

95
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,120
See what I've got?

96
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,720
Where'd you nab such a monster block?

97
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,880
Dredged it from the river.

98
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,360
Froze my tail off.

99
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,280
Hongning,

100
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
I literally shaved bits of myself

101
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,080
for your herb-lemon mix.

102
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,920
Cheers.

103
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,840
Why are you even sourer than yesterday?

104
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,600
Means I'm riper than yesterday.

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,640
Stop ripening

106
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,600
or I'll be out of business.

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,400
Those customers have no palate.

108
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,440
They can't appreciate my bathwater.

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,560
Bathwater?

110
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,960
You drink it.

111
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,560
Hongning & Ningmeng's herbal jelly.

112
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,000
Tangy, sweet,

113
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,840
and ice-fresh!

114
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,160
Lujiu,

115
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,440
sorry if I woke you.

116
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,680
I'll be on my way.

117
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,280
Slipping down the mountain again?

118
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,120
No,

119
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,080
hardly slipping.

120
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,440
Look,

121
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,720
I openly took a pixie-hunt decree

122
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,480
and came down the mountain.

123
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,080
It's my master's test.

124
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,280
Once I catch enough pixies,

125
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,160
he'll duel me himself.

126
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,360
Did you

127
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,240
steal that decree?

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,640
Seriously?

129
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,120
You think

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,760
I'm some petty thief?

131
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,920
You're right.

132
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,000
I...

133
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,640
I'm really here to catch demons!

134
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,640
Do what you like,

135
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,720
just not here.

136
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,600
Find another trail.

137
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,040
Why?

138
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,720
Why guard Wang's Village all year?

139
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,920
What treasure's tucked away?

140
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,880
None of your business.

141
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,280
Move, or I won't be so nice.

142
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,800
Want to duel?

143
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,600
If I fight you,

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,159
I get punished.

145
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,440
So, no thanks.

146
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,440
Leave now

147
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,040
or I'll have Master

148
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,600
revoke your decree.

149
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,600
Fine, I'm gone.

150
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,760
Your Samadhi Fire's nasty.

151
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,440
I'd rather dodge than roast.

152
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,360
I told you, quit running off.

153
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,280
What?

154
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,560
This is my newest herbal jelly drink.

155
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,960
Want a taste?

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,840
It's good.

157
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,200
You're easy on the eyes.

158
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,960
It's on the house.

159
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,280
For free?

160
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,000
Then I'll cool off.

161
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,200
Thanks.

162
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,960
Say,

163
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,200
any strange

164
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,960
happenings in your village?

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,440
Strange?

166
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,560
Like what?

167
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,720
Like...

168
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
Missing folk,

169
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,240
shady strangers...

170
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,720
Wang's Village

171
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
is the safest place around.

172
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,000
You're the oddest face we've seen.

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,560
Me?

174
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm a cultivator from Mt. Cangwu,

175
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
here to wipe out

176
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
demons for you.

177
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,840
Demons can cultivate now?

178
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,080
Absolutely.

179
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,040
My master judges no one.

180
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,800
Drink.

181
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
How'd you know I'm a demon?

182
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
I've spotted demons since I was little,

183
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,200
though

184
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,840
I can't tell what kind you are.

185
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,480
Ice pixie.

186
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,600
Listen,

187
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,440
while resting

188
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,400
in my true form

189
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,760
in the stream,

190
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,600
someone

191
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,520
smashed it,

192
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,720
costing me

193
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
200 years of power.

194
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,960
He can't be far.

195
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,360
Well...

196
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,200
I...

197
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,440
This is outrageous!

198
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,880
We'll catch them!

199
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,160
Why's there a block of ice in here?

200
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,680
Fished it out of the river.

201
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,480
Wait...

202
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
is this your body?

203
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,160
Confidence, please.

204
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,640
Yes, that's me!

205
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,040
-Help!
-Stop right there!

206
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,240
-You're coming back to Mt. Cangwu.
-Help!

207
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hongning, run! Go!

208
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,240
Never seen a demon arrest?

209
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
Lemon!

210
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,200
So sour!

211
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Hongning, this way.

212
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,480
Careful.

213
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,360
Here.

214
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,280
Easy.

215
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,640
Hongning,

216
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,160
you okay?

217
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm fine.

218
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,720
He's right behind.

219
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,680
You go!

220
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,440
What are you talking about?

221
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm not leaving you.

222
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,960
I'll draw him off.

223
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm just a pixie. It's not worth it.

224
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,480
Rubbish.

225
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,840
You're my best friend.

226
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,960
I'll handle him. Go!

227
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,280
Hongning...

228
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,160
I feel your pixie aura.

229
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,040
No escape!

230
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,360
Hongning,

231
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
same as ever.

232
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,440
A friend like you

233
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,600
is all I need.

234
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,320
Trying to flee?

235
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,200
Ningmeng...

236
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,760
Master!

237
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,280
The blazing-fire curse flares up again?

238
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,120
It's nothing.

239
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,520
I quelled a rogue immortal in Ganzhou.

240
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,640
Spent some of my power.

241
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,560
A short rest will fix it.

242
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
So the fire wound

243
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,280
truly can't be cured?

244
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,720
I once made a grave mistake.

245
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,760
This is my destined trial.

246
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,520
No medicine can help.

247
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,920
Master,

248
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,920
then please stay in seclusion and heal.

249
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,360
I'll manage

250
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,400
the academy.

251
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,720
Very well.

252
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,040
Hongning...

253
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,280
Hongning...

254
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,600
Don't worry.

255
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,160
From today, we're friends.

256
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,960
From today,

257
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,960
you're my best friend,

258
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,680
and my only friend.

259
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,640
Hongning...

260
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,640
Come to think of it,

261
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,920
fate loves irony.

262
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,600
In your half-dead,

263
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,760
death-seeking state,

264
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,320
you'll never

265
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,200
see her again.

266
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,960
No,

267
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,840
I will see her.

268
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,480
I must.

269
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,600
Elder White Camellia?

270
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,280
Eat him.

271
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,520
Prove your loyalty.

272
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,680
Show me you've truly submitted.

273
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,560
Serve me,

274
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,920
body and soul.

275
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,080
I can't.

276
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,720
I...

277
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,640
I just can't.

278
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,400
Devour your own kind or perish.

279
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
No!

280
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,680
I can't do that!

281
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,200
Then

282
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,640
forget about

283
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,200
meeting her.

284
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,520
Hongning...

285
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,520
Living can hurt worse than dying,

286
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,840
yet you cling to life for her.

287
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,880
Hongning,

288
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,200
I'll break out and find you.

289
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,720
You need me.

290
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,800
Wait for me.

291
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,960
Please

292
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,680
wait for me.

293
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,880
Useless!

294
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,200
All this time

295
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,960
and you still can't locate the Matriarch?

296
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,960
Forgive us, General.

297
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,160
Double the troops.

298
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Search every Matriarch Temple

299
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,400
in the NCR.

300
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,280
Flip the Three Realms

301
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,560
if you must.

302
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,280
Bring her back!

303
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,760
General,

304
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,240
both Emperor Stars of Midheaven

305
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,640
are undergoing mortal trials.

306
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,240
It's our

307
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,920
best chance

308
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,040
to rest and rebuild,

309
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,680
not chase the Matriarch.

310
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,160
Fool!

311
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,480
The Matriarch comes from the Fox Sanctum.

312
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,400
To Midheaven,

313
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,120
we're still beasts.

314
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,960
Without her and the Golden Lotus Dew,

315
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,280
Western Sea and Midheaven

316
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,560
would've crushed us

317
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,040
long ago.

318
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,360
Your point is sound.

319
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,160
Typical scholar.

320
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Spread word:

321
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,280
the useless king dies soon.

322
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,640
Beef up patrols.

323
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,319
Find the Matriarch.

324
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:12,720
At once.

325
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,040
Father faces execution.

326
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,000
How can I keep hiding?

327
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,160
You mean the Sky Fox

328
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,520
released that news on purpose?

329
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,960
In normal days,

330
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,280
he acts reckless,

331
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,920
but he's shrewd.

332
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,400
He won't dare

333
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
kill Father outright.

334
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,840
Still,

335
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,480
the NCR dungeon is damp

336
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,960
and cold.

337
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,640
How long can Father last?

338
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm wounded

339
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,600
and on the run.

340
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,440
When can I...

341
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,040
Search everywhere!

342
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,040
Where is she?

343
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,160
Rice is up!

344
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,080
Here.

345
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,200
Let me help.

346
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,960
Give it to me.

347
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,840
That girl.

348
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,240
It's getting late

349
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,200
and she still hasn't come back.

350
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,800
Don't worry,

351
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,240
Hongning'll be fine.

352
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,200
Dad,

353
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,320
Mom.

354
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,720
Why so late?

355
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,560
Come.

356
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,680
-Where have you been?
-Sit.

357
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,080
Sit and eat.

358
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,240
Lovely evening.

359
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,400
Let's eat outside.

360
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,440
Good idea.

361
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,680
Your face is a mess.

362
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,240
Dig in.

363
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,040
Here.

364
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,840
Dad, quit fussing

365
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,600
and eat.

366
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,360
You too.

367
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,040
Sweetheart,

368
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,520
why aren't you eating?

369
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,160
Mom, is it odd

370
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,000
I've seen demons

371
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,560
since I was little?

372
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,560
What's odd about that?

373
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,840
I glimpsed a god

374
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,080
giving birth to you.

375
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,040
Ask your dad.

376
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,160
True.

377
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,640
What if I befriend a pixie?

378
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,600
Nothing strange.

379
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,360
Pixies, like people,

380
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,800
come good and bad.

381
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
Make friends

382
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,800
with the good ones, right?

383
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,680
Exactly.

384
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,640
And

385
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
if my friend's in danger,

386
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,760
should I help?

387
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,440
Who's in danger?

388
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,520
No one.

389
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,280
Just asking.

390
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,640
Eat up.

391
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,760
Dad, have some more.

392
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,600
Mom, you too.

393
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:33,960
Eat.

394
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,920
[Dad,]

395
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,720
[Mom,]

396
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,320
[my friend's in trouble because of me.]

397
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,440
[He's a good soul]

398
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,880
[and I must save him.]

399
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,360
[Don't worry.]

400
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,840
[I'll stay safe.]

401
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
[Take care till I'm back.]

402
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,440
[Love,]

403
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,920
[Hongning.]

404
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,240
I have to help Hongning.

405
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,120
Fox, hey Fox!

406
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,280
I need some help!

407
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm stuck here!

408
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,040
Fox!

409
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,760
Fox!

410
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,160
I'm stuck!

411
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
My magic won't budge this!

412
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,440
I can't get out.

413
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,800
Please help me.

414
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,240
Master said: unite,

415
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,520
help,

416
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,480
and keep your word.

417
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,160
Why are you so heavy?

418
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,960
Move!

419
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,200
Move!

420
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,400
Okay.

421
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,280
Quite dashing, right?

422
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,880
Matriarch, it's late.

423
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,800
We'll lodge here tonight.

424
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,160
Please excuse me.

425
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,880
[Kunlun?]

426
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,080
Middle-of-nowhere dump.

427
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,400
There's nothing here.

428
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,720
Though the Matriarch

429
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,920
looks somewhat familiar.

430
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
[You jinx!]

431
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,840
[Running into you here...]

432
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,960
Decent features.

433
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,040
If mortal girls looked like her,

434
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,320
I'd fall hard.

435
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
You're a pixie. She's the Matriarch.

436
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,360
Stop daydreaming.

437
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,320
Why not?

438
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,080
We're both shaped like humans.

439
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,200
But then again...

440
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,840
If she met me,

441
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,720
she'd probably fall for me too.

442
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,120
I can't listen to this anymore.

443
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,000
Who's there?

444
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,640
Evil creature, show yourself!

445
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
You're the evil one yourself.

446
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,560
Who are you calling evil?

447
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,800
Good for you.

448
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,000
As a demon,

449
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,640
your transformation skills are quite impressive.

450
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,680
Your fox tail is showing.

451
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,200
And you still claim you aren't a demon?

452
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,760
[The Emperor Star has descended to undergo trials.]

453
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,680
[He has lost his memories,]

454
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,240
yet still acting like a jerk.

455
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,040
So you know me?

456
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,680
Seems I'm quiet famous

457
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,320
in the demon world.

458
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,080
How ridiculous.

459
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,000
You're infamous.

460
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
And you are a feisty little fox.

461
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,880
Interesting.

462
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,040
How about I take you as my pet?

463
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,000
How rude!

464
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,280
I'll teach you a lesson!

465
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,280
Anything else to say?

466
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
You jerk! Let me out!

467
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,560
Go on, keep talking.

468
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:03,920
Be good.

469
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,120
Daddy will take you home soon.

470
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,760
Pervert! Let me out!

471
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,640
Let me out right now!

472
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,320
Shut up.

473
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,560
Have you seen a woman

474
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,240
accompanied by a man in black?

475
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,360
Woman?

476
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,640
Man?

477
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,040
Or a nine-tailed fox?

478
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,360
Fox?

479
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,880
What if

480
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,760
I've seen the fox?

481
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
What if I haven't?

482
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,920
Answer me.

483
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,800
Fine.

484
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,680
Is it someone

485
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,880
who looks similar to the Celestial Matriarch?

486
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,760
Yes.

487
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,560
I saw her.

488
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,360
She went south.

489
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,480
Let's go.

490
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,800
-Yes.
-Yes.

491
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,200
Trying to run?

492
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,600
Where am I supposed to find Ningmeng?

493
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,520
Excuse me, is that Mt. Cangwu ahead?

494
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,640
It is.

495
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,840
Thanks.

496
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,480
Miss, please wait.

497
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,680
It's Mt. Cangwu ahead.

498
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,440
I know.

499
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,360
You just said it.

500
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,560
I'm afraid you came to the wrong place.

501
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,920
I didn't.

502
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,360
I'm heading to Mt. Cangwu.

503
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
You might not know,

504
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,480
but Cangwu Academy forbids female disciples.

505
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,760
If you seek immortality,

506
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,000
you should go to Xuyun Temple instead.

507
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,240
No, I'm not here to cultivate.

508
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm looking for someone.

509
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,520
Still not allowed.

510
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Historical records show

511
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,400
Xuyun Temple bars men,

512
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,440
while Cangwu Academy forbids women,

513
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,640
a long-standing rule.

514
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,280
Alright, I get it.

515
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,960
Fellow immortals, thank you for waiting.

516
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,520
Today is Cangwu's sword selection day.

517
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,280
We appreciate your journey here.

518
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,400
Now, please follow me up the mountain.

519
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,960
Great! Let's go!

520
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,600
Let's go.

521
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,640
After you.

522
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,880
[That person looks familiar.]

523
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,880
Whatever.

524
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,200
It has to be me...

525
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,360
Behave yourself.

526
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,320
I only let you out for air

527
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,720
in case you are suffocated.

528
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,120
If you keep acting,

529
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,000
I'll put you back in.

530
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,800
Jerk!

531
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,400
The humiliation I suffer today

532
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,000
will be repaid a hundredfold!

533
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,720
Why do you

534
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,800
keep blabbering

535
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,760
nonstop?

536
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,160
Keep it up, and I'll sell you for money!

537
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,640
Say,

538
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,680
would you fetch a good price?

539
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,360
For a cultivator,

540
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
you're so vulgar and money-obsessed.

541
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,120
You'll never achieve immortality.

542
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Seems I must teach you a lesson

543
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,760
to shut you up.

544
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,880
Fine.

545
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,160
What are you doing?

546
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,120
Bro,

547
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,640
it's not as plump

548
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,920
as you said it'd be.

549
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,840
How is this not plump?

550
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,800
I think it's only worth...

551
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,160
How much?

552
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,320
Worth about...

553
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
That's it?

554
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,880
That's plenty, bro.

555
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,760
Who'd want fox fur

556
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,640
in this scorching heat, right?

557
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,120
Fox fur?

558
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,320
What do you do for a living?

559
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,160
Me?

560
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,960
I make fur coats.

561
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
I skin foxes

562
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,080
and turn them into coats.

563
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,440
There's actually someone like you

564
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,720
in the Northern Celestial Realm?

565
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,400
D-Demon!

566
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,400
Demon!

567
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,400
Don't run!

568
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,640
Listen up,

569
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,640
this is a lesson for you.

570
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,360
Will you skin little animals again?

571
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,200
No, never again!

572
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,960
Now, piss off.

573
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,520
Go.

574
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,440
-My money.
-Get lost.

575
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,960
As a cultivator,

576
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,320
you actually aid the evil!

577
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,440
How am I aiding...

578
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,400
And you called me plump!

579
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,880
I...

580
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,440
Alright, fine.

581
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,640
I am aiding the evil.

582
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,040
I'm utterly wicked.

583
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,840
I'm Bailing the devil,

584
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,120
Mt. Cangwu's top villain.

585
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,840
Good you know it.

586
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,840
So what?

587
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,440
What can you do?

588
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
If you don't behave,

589
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,120
I'll silence you with a curse

590
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,920
and sell you back to that skinner!

591
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,040
See how tough you are then!

592
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,240
You...

593
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,840
Move!

594
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,720
Mt. Cangwu is breathtaking.

595
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,640
Really nice.

596
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,760
This place is exceptional.

597
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
Better than home.

598
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,600
Perfect for my cultivation.

599
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,880
Know what? My martial arts

600
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,960
are ideal for absorbing the world's spiritual energy.

601
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
The guy from earlier...

602
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,800
From earlier?

603
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,440
You've seen me?

604
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
I've seen you,

605
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,160
but you've never seen me.

606
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,080
Down the mountain...

607
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,080
Don't remember.

608
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,280
But who'd have thought someone so young

609
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,760
could be so remarkable,

610
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,920
making it this far.

611
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,720
Here?

612
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,840
What do you mean?

613
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,800
That mountain path

614
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,240
was to test immortal affinity,

615
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,200
called "Immortal's Guidance."

616
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,680
Mortals would get lost in the mist

617
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,440
or fail to reach here

618
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,760
for various reasons.

619
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,440
Only those with immortal destiny

620
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
can make it here.

621
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,080
You mean I have immortal affinity?

622
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,480
Of course.

623
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,280
I thought I'd be the only one.

624
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,280
Never expected

625
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,800
you'd join me.

626
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,920
Master Wenxin said

627
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,320
those who pass Immortal's Guidance

628
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,120
can proceed to sword selection.

629
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,440
He let us wait here for now.

630
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,960
This is the famed Cangwu Academy.

631
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,720
Upon entering,

632
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,400
you can feel Cangwu's aura.

633
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,560
That mystical?

634
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,160
Absolutely.

635
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,080
All cultivators yearn for Cangwu.

636
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,120
Aside from its supreme immortal arts,

637
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,520
Cangwu people

638
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,520
bear Cangwu soul,

639
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,560
that

640
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,040
indomitable, righteous spirit of the brave,

641
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,040
making its energy purer.

642
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,440
So, like me,

643
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,040
you also prepared

644
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,600
for years before coming, right?

645
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,400
Yes.

646
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,280
I prepared for many years.

647
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,760
Then

648
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,360
what magic power do you have?

649
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,320
I don't.

650
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,080
Do you?

651
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,239
I've mastered such basic spells as demon-slaying

652
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,639
and shapeshifting.

653
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,560
You came with no magic power at all?

654
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,440
I...

655
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,000
I...

656
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,200
Peony, thank you!

657
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,360
Keep my secret.

658
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,800
It's huge.

659
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,680
Where can I find him?

660
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,600
Finally figured it out,

661
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,920
the world's deadliest poison.

662
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,240
Can't let Master find out.

663
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,720
Who is it?

664
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,280
Stop right there!

665
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,960
Stop! Stop!

666
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,640
What is this place?

667
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,520
Why does it feel so familiar?

668
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,360
I-I'm sorry!

669
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,200
I didn't mean to come here...

670
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,240
Are you okay?

671
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,760
Why are you vomiting blood?

672
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,000
How did you get here?

673
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,520
How come you show up?

674
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,280
You...

675
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,680
You know me?

676
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,360
Forgive my rudeness.

677
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,640
Sorry if I offended you.

678
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,600
Who are you?

679
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,400
[She's human in this life.]

680
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,000
[Of course she doesn't remember me.]

681
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,480
[Perhaps it's for the best.]

682
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,720
Why are you dressed like this?

683
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,600
Dressed?

684
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,800
Is it strange?

685
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,760
All men in my village dress this way.

686
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,360
Men?

687
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,840
Can't you tell?

688
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm male.

689
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,200
Stop! Don't move!

690
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,920
If I catch you, you'll be sorry.

691
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,640
Master. Master.

692
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,800
Sorry to disturb you.

693
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,800
I just saw this person

694
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
trespassing in your secluded area.

695
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
You're the Master?

696
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,440
Where did you come from?

697
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,520
Master, let me apprehend him.

698
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,560
Don't! It's a misunderstanding!

699
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,280
Wait.

700
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,080
Why have you come to Cangwu?

701
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,400
I came to seek apprenticeship.

702
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,600
Apprenticeship?

703
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,960
I've loved cultivation since childhood.

704
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Hearing Cangwu is sacred ground,

705
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,440
I journeyed here.

706
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,840
So I came to find you, Master.

707
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,240
You are lying.

708
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,000
Those seeking apprenticeship

709
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,120
all gather outside.

710
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,800
You're clearly

711
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,320
a lying thief.

712
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,520
I'm not lying.

713
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,960
I was just there too!

714
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,160
But everything on Mt. Cangwu

715
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,120
has spiritual energy,

716
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,800
as you know.

717
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,560
I simply followed that energy,

718
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,600
and it guided me here.

719
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,040
You are still lying.

720
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,720
Without dark arts,

721
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,960
how could you reach this place?

722
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,320
You...

723
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,680
If she used forbidden magic,

724
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,440
the sacred flora

725
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,800
would have barred her path.

726
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,520
But...

727
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,320
See?

728
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,800
Master is much more reasonable.

729
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,200
You know what?

730
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,320
When I entered,

731
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,240
the peony flowers

732
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,360
even showed me the way.

733
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,480
That's why I found you so quickly.

734
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,960
It's so meant to be.

735
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,600
Truly an honor.

736
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,560
Now that you see me,

737
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,720
you may leave.

738
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,680
Tiannan, escort her down.

739
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,560
Master, this person is suspicious.

740
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,680
We should interrogate her.

741
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,720
Escort her down.

742
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,360
She is forbidden from ever setting foot here.

743
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,040
Wait.

744
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,680
It took me three whole days

745
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,640
to climb up here.

746
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,680
Those without immortal affinity

747
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,920
are still stranded below.

748
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,440
If I have no immortal affinity,

749
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,080
how could I have reached this far?

750
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,160
Since I have it,

751
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,400
why do you drive me away

752
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,400
for no reason?

753
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,440
Is this how you deal

754
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,720
with things on Mt. Cangwu?

755
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,920
I have my reasons

756
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,560
to send you away.

757
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,440
Then enlighten me.

758
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,680
If you can't explain,

759
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,040
we'll settle it in a fair way.

760
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,360
What do you mean?

761
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Doesn't Mt. Cangwu

762
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,720
have entrance exams?

763
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
I demand to take them.

764
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,360
If I pass,

765
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,400
I stay.

766
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,800
If I fail,

767
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
I leave on my own.

768
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:52,840
You...

769
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,680
Master,

770
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,120
it sounds a good point.

771
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,800
Fine.

772
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,920
You may participate in the exam.

773
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,480
If unchosen,

774
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,440
you descend immediately.

775
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,920
Deal.

776
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,600
You must honor your word.

777
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,840
Agreed.

778
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,800
Tiannan, escort her down.

779
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,800
Yes.

780
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,080
Let's go.

781
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,520
Master, I failed you.

782
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,000
Your seclusion is interrupted.

783
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,280
Never mind.

784
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,400
The sword selection will start soon.

785
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,320
Go ahead first.

786
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,800
I'll be there shortly.

787
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,680
Yes.

788
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,000
[Do you know how hard I've tried]

789
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,280
[restraining myself]

790
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,760
[to avoid seeking you?]

791
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,200
[Yet here you appear.]

792
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,720
Aren't you hungry?

793
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,120
How do you have energy for this?

794
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,920
Is it really that delicious?

795
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,080
Watch your tone.

796
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,120
If not for my brilliant memory

797
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,160
of your pitiful

798
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,360
temple state,

799
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,800
I'd think you were

800
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,280
some pampered

801
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,120
palace princess.

802
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,440
With your "brilliant" memory,

803
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,000
even if I admitted it,

804
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,200
you wouldn't comprehend.

805
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:01,960
Fine.

806
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,840
Then I'll believe you

807
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,160
you are an immortal.

808
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,480
Then you need not

809
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,320
eat the noodles.

810
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,400
Since you are an immortal,

811
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,960
wind and dew should suffice.

812
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,560
Leave

813
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,360
the noodles to an exceptional demon

814
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,280
like me.

815
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,280
Stuff yourself.

816
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,080
Honestly?

817
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,560
You should eat now while you can.

818
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,480
Once locked in the dungeon

819
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
of Mt. Cangwu,

820
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,640
no more noodles for you.

821
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,800
You're taking me to Mt. Cangwu?

822
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,600
Or what?

823
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,440
I'm not going.

824
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
My fox princess,

825
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,680
can't you tell who's in charge?

826
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,920
Let me clarify.

827
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,840
You're my captured demon.

828
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,000
Where I go,

829
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,880
you follow.

830
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,160
Understood?

831
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,480
This, are we clear?

832
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,080
What's wrong?

833
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,600
I didn't hurt you, did I?

834
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,720
Like you were able to.

835
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,880
What's wrong with you?

836
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,160
Why didn't you tell me?

837
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,280
Let's go.

838
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,840
Where?

839
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,000
Come with me.

840
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,920
Waiter, money's on the table.

841
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:18,760
Alright.

842
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,240
Collect it.

843
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,040
Give me your hand.

844
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,800
Come on.

845
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,400
No need.

846
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,680
Mortal herbs can't heal my wound.

847
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,080
Better treated than neglected.

848
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,440
So stubborn.

849
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,360
Weren't you taking me to the dungeon?

850
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,920
Why pretend concern now?

851
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,400
Who's concerned?

852
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,760
With your sickly state,

853
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,040
my fellow senior brothers would accuse me

854
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,040
of bullying the weak.

855
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,320
You are

856
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,600
such an ungrateful person.

857
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,240
[The sword selection approaches.]

858
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,400
[Return promptly.]

859
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,320
Sword selection...

860
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,640
Little fox,

861
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,280
prepare to be amazed.

862
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,520
Fool.

863
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,480
Let's go.

864
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,880
I'm to be your consort

865
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,600
to cultivate alongside you.

866
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,320
This time

867
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,640
in the illusion,

868
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,640
though our life was simple,

869
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,520
it brought me true joy

870
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,440
and happiness.

871
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,200
Only then did I realize

872
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,480
the greatest bliss

873
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,760
in this world

874
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,320
is staying with one you love.

875
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,680
So,

876
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,200
will you marry me?

877
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,320
[You loved that red camellia,]

878
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,200
[yet she perished]

879
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,720
[for your sake.]

880
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,000
[You indulged]

881
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,440
[fleeting passions,]

882
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,320
[but what good came of it?]

883
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,240
[Reflect on what you've done.]

884
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,040
[Still my heart, and cultivate in solitude.]
