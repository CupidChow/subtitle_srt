[Love Never Fails]
[EP16]

3
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,130
Wonder how

4
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,290
Baibuqu is doing.

5
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,890
But he's a constable.

6
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,930
Should've finished his mission

7
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,410
before me.

8
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,250
- Master.
- Master.

9
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,370
Master.

10
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,329
Where's Hongning?

11
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:19,770
Help!

12
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,850
Help!

13
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,610
My trap

14
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,250
only lasts two hours max.

15
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,690
Never thought he'd stay this long.

16
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,370
Preposterous!

17
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,210
Bailing.

18
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,770
How dare you?

19
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,930
If any harm comes to Hongning,

20
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,490
you'll answer to me!

21
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,210
So scary.

22
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,850
How could you treat a junior like that?

23
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,329
He's not officially a junior yet...

24
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,490
Still making excuses?

25
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,850
You show no remorse at all.

26
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,650
I was left in the woods

27
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,770
overnight as a kid.

28
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,210
You never made such a fuss

29
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,210
searching for me.

30
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,530
Don't you know

31
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,490
Master followed you

32
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,130
from behind every time?

33
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,410
No way.

34
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,450
You really thought we'd leave you there?

35
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,850
Cut the crap.

36
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,610
Find him first.

37
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,050
You better hope Hongning's unharmed.

38
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,810
What...

39
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,010
What's happening?

40
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,170
Such strong demonic aura.

41
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,210
Yeah...

42
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:35,810
The back mountain...

43
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,690
Help!

44
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,810
Help!

45
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:01,850
[Bailing!]

46
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,850
Help!

47
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,890
Didn't expect to meet you here.

48
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,770
Who... who are you?

49
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,050
Stay back!

50
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,250
I'll exorcise you!

51
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,210
Exorcise?

52
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,450
That's my line.

53
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,090
I was Envoy Apricot.

54
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,330
Your pathetic tricks

55
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,010
can't stop me.

56
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,770
Hongning.

57
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,970
How do you know my name?

58
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,170
- Hongning!
- Hongning!

59
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,130
Master.

60
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:42,930
- Hongning!
- Hongning!

61
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,970
Master.

62
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,450
Hongning.

63
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,370
It's all my fault.

64
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,850
I shouldn't have left him alone.

65
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,770
You're the worst.

66
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,010
A traitor who snitches.

67
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,130
When we find Hongning,

68
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,170
I'm dealing with you first.

69
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:52,650
I...

70
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,290
Shut up!

71
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,930
- Hongning!
- Hongning!

72
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,570
Hongning.

73
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,730
Hongning.

74
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,409
Stop.

75
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,170
Master's mark!

76
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,050
Follow me!

77
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,610
Hongning.

78
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,450
Master.

79
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,330
Hongning.

80
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,610
Hongning.

81
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,730
Hongning.

82
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:12,650
Master.

83
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,850
Hongning.

84
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,050
Hongning.

85
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,010
Centuries ago,

86
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,410
we both jumped into the Demotion Pool.

87
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,370
Why'd you get to live as a human

88
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,170
while I became a pixie again...

89
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,210
living in shame and hatred?

90
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,290
No wonder

91
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,570
I've liked all flowers since childhood.

92
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,570
Except apricots.

93
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,970
Maybe we're really

94
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,409
enemies in a past life.

95
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,530
You!

96
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,010
You lowly camellia pixie

97
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,450
made me stray from the path,

98
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,130
corrupted me step by step!

99
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,210
You

100
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,370
made me lose my immortality,

101
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,970
cast me

102
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,850
into this wretched state!

103
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,090
Don't know what you're talking about.

104
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,650
But I know this,

105
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,130
If people blame others

106
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,850
for all their mistakes,

107
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,570
they're the real problem.

108
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,650
Still

109
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,530
stubborn?

110
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,090
We'll see how long you last!

111
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,370
Immortal Lord!

112
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,850
Sir.

113
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,450
Long time no see.

114
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,290
Xing.

115
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,970
You broke celestial laws,

116
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,890
got punished to reincarnate,

117
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,570
why persist in evil?

118
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,810
And no remorse?

119
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,170
Xing?

120
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,450
Sir.

121
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,970
It's been centuries

122
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,570
since you last spoke my name.

123
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,210
You harmed innocent mortals,

124
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,730
committed atrocities.

125
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,530
I'll take you to the dungeon.

126
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,409
The Punisher

127
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,370
will decide your fate.

128
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,490
"Innocent"?

129
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,130
She's far from innocent.

130
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,770
Because of her,

131
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,570
I fell this far!

132
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,130
I was just a wildflower

133
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,210
until I glimpsed

134
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,010
your divine radiance.

135
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,610
I yearned to become immortal,

136
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,890
endured endless trials

137
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,290
to ascend as one.

138
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,770
At the Floralia Palace,

139
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,330
I dedicated myself to you,

140
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,730
served tirelessly.

141
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,330
But have you ever

142
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,970
even noticed me?

143
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:26,970
She

144
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,930
was just a pixie.

145
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,730
Yet you cherished her like jade!

146
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,490
You can't

147
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,730
be compared to her.

148
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,610
You walk different paths.

149
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,250
If she lives,

150
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,890
you'll face

151
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,170
heaven's wrath!

152
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,330
Both of you

153
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,050
will pay for this!

154
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,330
[Here.]

155
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,010
[Have a sip.]

156
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,010
[Thank you.]

157
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,850
Sir.

158
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,450
In this life, I die because of you.

159
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,570
Will I become your inner demon?

160
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,770
Sir.

161
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,650
Finally, I can say goodbye

162
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,410
to you.

163
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,330
- Hongning.
- Hongning.

164
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:29,930
Master.

165
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,090
Master.

166
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,530
Hongning...

167
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,370
So cold.

168
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,690
So cold...

169
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,730
Cold...

170
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,130
[Her vitality is fading.]

171
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,610
[Her core can't hold]

172
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,290
[the Golden Lotus Dew's icy aura...]

173
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,850
I'll accept my punishment.

174
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,370
Master.

175
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,130
You're bleeding?

176
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,090
Was it for

177
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,930
healing me?

178
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:13,690
It's nothing.

179
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:26,810
You're okay now.

180
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,610
Get some rest.

181
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,970
Thank you, Master.

182
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,450
[With demons rampant,]

183
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,490
[Cangwu bears the brunt.]

184
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,530
[I should send her]

185
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,890
[back to Wang's Village ASAP.]

186
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,410
Do I really need to apologize?

187
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,690
If I do…

188
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,770
I'll lose all dignity.

189
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,890
But if I don't...

190
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,089
Master will scold me.

191
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,090
It was my fault anyway.

192
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,250
Master.

193
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,050
Enjoying the view?

194
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:49,970
Uh...

195
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,650
Is Hongning awake?

196
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:52,850
Yes.

197
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,530
Good.

198
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,250
Good.

199
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,570
What's in your hand?

200
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,410
Oh, this?

201
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,850
It's...

202
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,650
Wenxin and Tiannanxing

203
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,090
asked me to bring some food.

204
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,170
They asked you?

205
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,930
Why don't they come themselves?

206
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,090
They feel bad

207
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,730
about Hongning's

208
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,970
injury.

209
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,970
They felt bad?

210
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,410
Or you, who caused the injury

211
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,570
felt bad?

212
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,010
I'm sorry, Master.

213
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,770
My bad.

214
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,010
Let's go.

215
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:31,970
Together.

216
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,690
Give me that.

217
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,770
No need, Master.

218
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,930
Don't bother with

219
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,330
such a trivial thing.

220
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,330
I made the mistake.

221
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,170
I'll apologize myself.

222
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:40,730
I insist.

223
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,850
I'll watch you apologize.

224
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,330
Master.

225
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,050
No need for that.

226
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,690
Let go.

227
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:00,930
What is it?

228
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,770
Go by yourself.

229
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,450
Make it sincere.

230
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,250
Yes, sir!

231
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,370
That immortal...

232
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,450
Was it Master?

233
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,370
Hongning, I'm sorry!

234
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,610
This was my fault.

235
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,090
Please be magnanimous

236
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,250
and have a heart

237
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,010
as broad as the sea...

238
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,850
Get to the point!

239
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,970
Please forgive me.

240
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,050
It's not his fault.

241
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,330
He only gave me advice.

242
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,970
My own weakness

243
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,890
caused the trouble.

244
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:13,770
Bailing.

245
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,890
Your arrogance

246
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,730
endangered your peers.

247
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,850
Confined to back hills.

248
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,490
Complete 100 good deeds.

249
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,130
No return until

250
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,690
completed.

251
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,050
Yes.

252
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,210
Bailing.

253
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,130
Master gave the talismans

254
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,490
to protect less experienced disciples.

255
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,610
Yet you gave it to Hongning?

256
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,330
We all know the talismans

257
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,250
are meant for us to use wisely

258
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,810
when gathering herbs.

259
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,810
It was just a prank.

260
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:42,850
You...

261
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,210
As for you, Hongning.

262
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,850
Agreeing without thinking.

263
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,010
Overestimating

264
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,330
made you put yourself

265
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,250
and many fellow disciples in danger.

266
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,490
You're banished from

267
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,970
Cangwu permanently.

268
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,490
- Uh...
- I...

269
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:03,690
What...

270
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,090
Master.

271
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,610
He snuck into the back mountain,

272
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,850
but it's excusable.

273
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,490
That pixie was powerful.

274
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,690
No way he could've

275
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,650
taken her down.

276
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,570
Besides...

277
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,530
He's been good

278
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,490
to us all.

279
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,250
Yeah.

280
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,250
Master...

281
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,650
Please don't banish him.

282
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:19,970
Enough!

283
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,210
Cangwu's rules stand.

284
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,210
Unless

285
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,930
I complete one of

286
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,170
Three Trials?

287
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,490
Right, Master?

288
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:31,570
Yes.

289
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,170
[He found a sacred artifact?]

290
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,050
[Impossible!]

291
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,530
[He actually found it...]

292
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,690
Master.

293
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,210
Cangwu's rules stand.

294
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,610
Master.

295
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,170
Finding an artifact

296
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,690
is one the of trials.

297
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,290
Master, let him stay.

298
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,530
Master.

299
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,690
Master.

300
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,290
If you still say no,

301
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,170
I'd feel embarrassed for you.

302
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:06,930
Right?

303
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,690
Master.

304
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,690
Please take Hongning as your disciple.

305
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,130
Fine.

306
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,690
Hongning.

307
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,330
From today,

308
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,970
you are a disciple of Cangwu Academy.

309
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,370
Cultivate diligently,

310
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,250
follow Cangwu's rules,

311
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,170
or your status

312
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,850
is forfeit.

313
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,050
Thank you, Master!

314
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,370
- Thank you, Master!
- Thank you, Master!

315
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,130
Oh, not again...

316
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,410
Sir.

317
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,130
She stayed.

318
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,690
And became a disciple.

319
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,530
But...

320
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,050
This wasn't my mistake!

321
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,090
Maybe it's better this way.

322
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,050
Now I can protect her.

323
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,930
Sir, let me finish!

324
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,210
What I mean is...

325
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,970
Wait, sir.

326
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,810
You've been...

327
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,490
I...

328
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,050
I...

329
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,050
Master's Sword Art

330
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,450
is ninth-level mastered.

331
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,650
Its sword energy can

332
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,130
split clouds and cleave the moon.

333
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,770
[Why isn't she looking at me?]

334
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,890
[She's been avoiding me lately.]

335
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,370
[Did my past attitude hurt her?]

336
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,210
Ningmeng?

337
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,410
What are you doing here?

338
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,450
Just wanted to check inside.

339
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:58,690
Move aside.

340
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,610
You'll get hurt.

341
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,250
[What?]

342
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,610
[You]

343
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,690
[can't go in yet.]

344
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,330
[I…]

345
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,370
[Go back.]

346
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,090
[I…]

347
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,090
[What's inside anyway?]

348
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,050
[Let me in, Bailing.]

349
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,930
[Anyone know the use of weeds?]

350
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,570
[No idea.]

351
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,650
[A special plant]

352
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,570
[absorbing human essence]

353
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,490
[and spiritual energy.]

354
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,930
[Hongning, join us!]

355
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,690
[Yeah, come on.]

356
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,410
Wait.

357
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,650
Just a sec!

358
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,810
I'll take it off.

359
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,130
What's taking so long?

360
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,370
Let me help!

361
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,210
No! No!

362
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,290
Bailing.

363
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,210
I'll take it off myself!

364
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,570
You're shy?

365
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,570
Didn't you keep pestering me to train?

366
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,490
Fine, whatever.

367
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,210
[Come on.]

368
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,770
[Oh, stop it.]

369
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,210
[Improper!]

370
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,010
Exactly.

371
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:18,970
That's the smell.

372
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,850
The citrusy scent.

373
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,650
Ningmeng.

374
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:21,650
Hurry.

375
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,690
Come out!

376
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:24,650
Ningmeng.

377
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,450
[What are you doing?]

378
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,050
Master!

379
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,610
What brings you here?

380
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,050
[So refreshing!]

381
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,610
[Feels great!]

382
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,730
[Don't grab the wrong set.]

383
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,130
[Let's go!]

384
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:37,850
[Wait.]

385
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,370
Where's my clothes?

386
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,370
[Bailing, let's go.]

387
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,090
[Time to head back.]

388
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,330
But my clothes...

389
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,690
[Go air yourself out.]

390
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,170
[We're leaving.]

391
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:48,770
When it rains,

392
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,050
it really pours.

393
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,010
Master...

394
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,970
Why take Bailing's clothes?

395
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,050
I was...

396
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,930
Afraid they'd get lost by the stream.

397
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,210
So I carried them here.

398
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,290
So you walked

399
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,770
all the way from

400
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,650
the stream?

401
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,570
Well…

402
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,690
They won't get lost here.

403
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:10,890
Why were you staring at Bailing?

404
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:11,730
I didn't.

405
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,450
Why?

406
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,570
So scary...

407
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,770
I... you...

408
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:20,770
Fine.

409
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,490
I can't tell you.

410
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,530
This is forbidden by Cangwu's rules.

411
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,010
[She loves Bailing?]

412
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,210
If you can't focus on cultivation,

413
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,610
you won't be my disciple anymore.

414
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,570
No, no! I...

415
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,450
I am focusing!

416
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,210
Just looking for Ningmeng.

417
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,570
Why's my heart racing?

418
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,490
[Does she prefer Kunlun this life?]

419
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,570
[What about me?]

420
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,210
[Storing qi to the lower belly.]

421
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,410
[Bailing.]

422
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,290
[Left!]

423
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,730
[Right!]

424
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,490
[Up!]

425
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,770
[Look.]

426
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:17,850
[Bailing]

427
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,570
[has been distracted lately.]

428
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,370
Is he

429
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,970
lovesick or something?

430
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,770
Come on.

431
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,050
Not a single

432
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,610
girl up here.

433
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,610
Who's he pining for?

434
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,890
Maybe someone

435
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,210
down the mountain?

436
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,170
Who told you that?

437
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:41,810
Definitely!

438
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:42,970
I've noticed it too.

439
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,050
They've been

440
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,370
gossiping about it.

441
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:53,850
Look.

442
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,210
What's with Hongning?

443
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,290
See?

444
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,170
Since coming back,

445
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,450
he's been distracted too.

446
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,530
You know...

447
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,290
[Where's he hiding Ningmeng?]

448
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:26,570
So

449
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,530
we must keep their secret.

450
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:31,570
Right, right.

451
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,410
Go back to practice.

452
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,290
Yeah, let's go.

453
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,650
[How can I ease]

454
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,090
[her burden?]

455
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,050
[Who's after her?]

456
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,130
[Should I just ask her?]

457
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,530
[Will she tell me?]

458
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,050
[Still no sign of Ningmeng.]

459
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,050
[Master's acting weird.]

460
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,010
[When can I leave here?]

461
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,010
Hongning.

462
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,970
If you have any worries,

463
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,570
you can go consult the Matriarch.

464
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,250
Matriarch?

465
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,210
Yes.

466
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,810
Her temple's midway up the mountain.

467
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,170
The seniors say

468
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,250
it works.

469
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,090
Maybe worth a visit.

470
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,050
[Bailing.]

471
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,770
Yeah, what's up?

472
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,210
How many good deeds

473
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,250
do you have left?

474
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,810
Ninety-nine.

475
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,730
There's nothing left to do back there.

476
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,210
True.

477
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,210
By the way.

478
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,690
The Matriarch Temple

479
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,330
was damaged

480
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,290
by Lujiu.

481
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,930
Perhaps you wanna fix this?

482
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,530
I don't.

483
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,370
Last time I fought with him,

484
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,010
Master confined me for half a month.

485
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,730
Who told you

486
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,450
to fight him?

487
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,770
I mean fixing the temple.

488
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,650
Oh, I see.

489
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:16,770
Got it.

490
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,450
Please bless me.

491
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,970
Please.

492
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,090
Please bless me.

493
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,450
Please bless me.

494
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,290
Please...

495
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,450
Tiannanxing.

496
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:33,650
I...

497
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,370
You scared me!

498
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,050
What are you doing here?

499
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,050
What's up?

500
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,530
Got something on your mind?

501
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,650
Well...

502
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,330
Exams are coming up.

503
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,810
I came to pray for good luck.

504
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:46,730
It'll work.

505
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,490
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

506
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,010
I need some luck too!

507
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,010
You…

508
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,370
Don't bother the Matriarch.

509
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,210
Okay?

510
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,130
You ditch

511
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,610
studying all year,

512
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,090
then pray to gods during exams?

513
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,690
What's the point?

514
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,650
Why are you here?

515
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,010
Wait.

516
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:03,610
Let me guess.

517
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,610
Been feeling troubled lately?

518
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,370
I came to do a good deed.

519
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,530
Repair the temple.

520
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:16,690
Good.

521
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,730
Repair?

522
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,690
Good idea, but…

523
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:21,890
The temple

524
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,010
is in bad shape.

525
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,610
It'll take you a while.

526
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,090
True.

527
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,450
Lujiu has such a bad temper.

528
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,370
I heard

529
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,250
he was just

530
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,170
passing by, didn't even

531
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,290
enter the temple.

532
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,970
He just used the magic fire,

533
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,370
trying to burn it down.

534
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,010
Lucky Master saved it.

535
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,130
I also heard

536
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,010
the Matriarch's followers

537
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,210
came to Cangwu to protest

538
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,090
when they found out.

539
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,330
That serious?

540
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,770
Ever since then,

541
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,330
Lujiu avoids this path

542
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,010
when going up or down the mountain.

543
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,450
So he's always been

544
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,690
this hot-tempered?

545
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:02,250
Alright.

546
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,170
I'll leave you to it.

547
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:03,930
I'm leaving.

548
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,690
Okay. Bye.

549
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:20,450
Hi!

550
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,930
Hongning?

551
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:23,690
You...

552
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,890
You're heading for the temple?

553
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:28,890
Yeah.

554
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,330
They say its miracles are real.

555
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,610
Alone?

556
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:39,770
It's okay, it's okay.

557
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,570
I understand.

558
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,330
I really do.

559
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,570
Your secret's safe with me.

560
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,410
I won't tell anyone.

561
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,130
Madam.

562
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,530
I heard you're very miraculous.

563
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:00,770
Could you

564
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,690
answer a question for me?

565
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,490
It's just that

566
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,810
I came across

567
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,370
a fox recently...

568
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:17,370
Wait...

569
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,850
Am I imagining things?

570
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,650
The Matriarch

571
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,969
looks like that little fox!

572
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,570
You two must be connected.

573
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,250
Definitely.

574
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,409
Bailing.

575
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,090
Hongning.

576
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,370
What brings you here?

577
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,050
You mean

578
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:51,969
when you light up

579
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,250
around her, miss her

580
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,610
like crazy when she's gone,

581
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,170
but won't admit it?

582
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,210
Yes! How do you know?

583
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,690
Hongning.

584
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,050
I've had this sickness a long time!

585
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,130
I've been there.

586
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,530
I understand.

587
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,170
But Hongning.

588
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,210
She's leaving soon.

589
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,890
What if my sickness isn't cured?

590
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,970
She's leaving?

591
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,490
Then ask her to stay!

592
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,170
Ask her to stay?

593
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,250
Well then...

594
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,890
What's going on with

595
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,010
Bailing and Hongning?

596
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,330
I saw them being intimate

597
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,250
at the temple.

598
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,570
Anyone spreading rumors about this

599
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,690
will be punished.

600
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,570
Well noted.

601
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:52,650
Absurd!

602
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,530
Slacking off again.

603
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,450
Tantalizing her

604
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,170
through the celestial realm

605
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,770
and mortal realm!

606
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,210
My words mean nothing to him!

607
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,410
[Master.]

608
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,690
[Master.]

609
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,050
I'm useless...

610
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,370
I'm useless...

611
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,970
Master won't trust me anymore.

612
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,970
Master!

613
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,170
I'm sorry.

614
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,770
It's all my fault.

615
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,930
I messed up.

616
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,170
Master...

617
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,690
Sir...

618
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,330
[So heartbroken...]

619
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,650
Master.

620
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,730
Who are you?

621
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:22,650
Why here?

622
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,050
I'm Bailing's friend.

623
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,570
Staying a few days.

624
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:30,930
Leaving today.

625
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,130
I knew it was him.

626
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:38,690
Sorry you

627
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,210
saw me like this.

628
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,450
I had no family or friends growing up.

629
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,850
Only Master cares about me.

630
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,930
But I keep letting him down.

631
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,650
I feel the same.

632
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,970
No friends now.

633
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,250
Don't know if my family

634
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,410
is even alive.

635
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,170
I kept

636
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,130
letting others down.

637
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,690
Even if you're alone

638
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,450
in this world,

639
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,610
fulfill and love

640
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,370
yourself.

641
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,210
Only by doing so

642
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,570
can you

643
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,490
take on responsibilities.

644
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,090
Following your heart

645
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,890
brings peace.

646
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,850
Shouldn't have drunk so much.

647
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,570
I feel like

648
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,850
I saw a woman.

649
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,290
How could

650
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,650
there be a woman?

651
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,130
Still your heart, curb your desires.

652
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,330
Still your heart, curb your desires.

653
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,650
Still your heart, curb your desires.

654
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,770
Still your heart, curb your desires.

655
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,130
Still your heart...

656
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,850
Still your heart, curb your desires.

657
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,690
I only left for months.

658
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,850
And you're getting disobedient.

659
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,090
It's midnight.

660
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,330
Bedtime.

661
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,650
Any violation of curfew,

662
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,810
wandering around

663
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,210
will be punished according to

664
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,570
the rules.

665
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,410
- Understood.
- Understood.

666
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,490
[After Lujiu returned,]

667
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,290
[patrols got stepped up.]

668
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,690
[I must find]

669
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,530
[Ningmeng tonight!]

670
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,410
[Hongning's right.]

671
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,570
[Maybe I should ask her to stay.]

672
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,330
Hongning.

673
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,250
- Luyao?
- Sir Jinxiu?

674
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,130
Bailing!

675
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,490
Hongning?

676
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:21,810
Who dares to

677
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,970
be out at this hour?

678
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,290
Master? What are you...

679
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:30,850
Well...

680
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,170
She's from Xuyun Temple.

681
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,210
Xuyun Temple?

682
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,210
Xuyun Temple?

683
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,210
Yes.

684
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:39,610
I didn't

685
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,090
get to tell everyone.

686
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:45,930
You two!

687
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,410
Just as the rumors said.

688
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:50,770
Master...

689
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:51,450
[Nonsense.]

690
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,650
Anyone spreading rumors

691
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,490
will be punished.

692
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,370
Yes, sir.

693
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,130
But Master...

694
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:57,890
Enough!

695
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,930
Why are you wandering?

696
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,130
Back to patrol!

697
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:01,970
Now!

698
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:05,770
[You two.]

699
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,290
[Return to your rooms.]

700
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,650
Copy Cangwu rules three times.

701
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:09,570
Pardon?

702
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:10,810
Yes.

703
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,530
[What did he say?]

704
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,570
Luyao.

705
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,410
I owe you an apology.

706
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,370
You remember.

707
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:30,690
Yes.

708
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:33,690
Is it for

709
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,530
that camellia?

710
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,810
I'm reasonable.

711
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,570
If you'd just told me the truth,

712
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,530
I might have understood.

713
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,410
But as a deity,

714
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,610
you humiliated me

715
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:00,810
on the wedding day,

716
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,210
stole Golden Lotus Dew,

717
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,890
made me a disgrace in NCR,

718
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,130
a joke in the Three Realms,

719
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,810
even put my father in danger.

720
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,330
Sir.

721
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,450
One day, I will

722
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:15,970
avenge this.

723
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,530
It was

724
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,090
all my fault.

725
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,170
I heard what happened in NCR.

726
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,610
If you ever need anything,

727
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,410
I'll do whatever I can.

728
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:34,930
No need.

729
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,530
Our bond severed

730
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,370
from that day.

731
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,650
I only ask one thing.

732
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,770
Ask away.

733
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:47,650
Seen a

734
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,450
three-tailed fox in Cangwu?

735
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,330
He is here.

736
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:02,810
Where?

737
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:03,970
Take me to him!

738
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,490
So

739
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,490
you only found a fox?

740
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,690
Any pixies like this?

741
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,890
Any other pixies?

742
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,490
You're still together?

743
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:30,450
Master.

744
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,290
It's my fault.

745
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,570
I brought her here.

746
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,130
Punish me if you must.

747
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,530
Take her to

748
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:37,490
the guest room.

749
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:39,450
Go!

750
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:42,890
Yes.

751
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:43,410
Let's go.

752
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:44,330
Thanks, Master!

753
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:45,690
Wait.

754
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,170
You haven't answered me!

755
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,730
I was just wandering.

756
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,450
What's your game?

757
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,170
Why these nightly wanderings?

758
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:03,890
Master.

759
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,650
I need to ask you something.

760
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:07,570
Ask me?

761
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,650
You look just like

762
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,410
the deity in my dreams.

763
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:13,810
Absurd.

764
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:15,210
Absurd?

765
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,010
Right.

766
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,210
Maybe

767
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,010
it was Bailing.

768
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,290
How could it be him?

769
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,810
Why not?

770
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,570
His silhouette

771
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:27,970
does seem familiar.

772
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,010
So

773
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,490
that's why you favor him?

774
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,130
Favor?

775
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,090
Well...

776
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:45,450
It's late.

777
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,370
Return to your quarters.

778
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:49,530
Yes.

779
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,570
Master scolded me again.

780
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:08,370
I was patrolling properly.

781
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,530
I saw a woman

782
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,730
in Cangwu.

783
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:12,770
But Master told me to go away.

784
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:14,970
I'm useless.

785
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:16,770
What should I do?

786
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:18,450
What now...

787
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,410
[The three-tailed fox...]

788
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:22,410
[You've already met him.]

789
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,930
[It's Lujiu on patrol.]

790
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:26,650
[He]

791
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,650
[still resents being abandoned]

792
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:29,930
[by NCR.]

793
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,210
It's unwise for you to

794
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,810
meet him now.

795
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:36,690
Impossible.

796
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,410
He's my brother.

797
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,130
He wouldn't reject me.

798
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,210
As his sister,

799
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,650
you should know

800
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:46,410
he needs time

801
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:48,690
to accept you.

802
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,090
Lujiu...

803
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,850
What should I do?

804
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,450
What should I do?
