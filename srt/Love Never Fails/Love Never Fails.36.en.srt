[Love Never Fails]
[EP36]

3
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,220
All celestial beings,

4
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,350
hear this decree.

5
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,140
The sinner Jinxiu,

6
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,350
blinded by greed, trusted demons' lies,

7
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,020
bringing in

8
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,630
assassinations and chaos.

9
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,020
Acknowledging his ignorance,

10
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,470
defiance of divine order,

11
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,350
and unbearable regret,

12
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,500
he surrenders his divine bones,

13
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,070
severs his immortal ties,

14
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,630
and exiles himself to

15
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,430
the mortal realm.

16
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,630
It shall be known throughout the realms.

17
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,150
I accepts this.

18
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,190
[The entire peony clan]

19
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,660
[shall suffer collateral consequences.]

20
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,150
[From this day forward, there shall]

21
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,940
[be no more peonies in any realm.]

22
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,310
[The sacred Celestial Realm]

23
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,870
[must endure for eternity.]

24
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,870
[It must not fall by our hands.]

25
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,260
[Therefore,]

26
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,470
[Jinxiu'll be stripped of divine status]

27
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,820
[and cast into the Demotion Pool.]

28
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,030
Celestial Commander...

29
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,870
How could that happen?

30
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,500
What...

31
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,590
What about Floral Deity?

32
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,630
Where has she gone?

33
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,030
Remember,

34
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,030
never speak of her

35
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,700
to anyone but me.

36
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,750
But...

37
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,820
You'll be the one to do it?

38
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,190
So be it.

39
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,940
You look proper

40
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,580
in that robe.

41
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,870
Remember when we're kids?

42
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,070
I burned a hole in this robe once.

43
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,230
You told Father

44
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,460
it was your mistake.

45
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,460
He saw right through you,

46
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,430
and gave me a brutal scolding.

47
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,900
A huge bump onto my head.

48
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,990
Everyone knew

49
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,500
it was always you.

50
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,550
If I knew I'd wear it someday,

51
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,630
I'd have made

52
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,020
the hole less noticeable.

53
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,230
Too bad

54
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,870
I won't see

55
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,380
your coronation ceremony.

56
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,790
Bro...

57
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,260
You don't have to endure this.

58
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,190
Father needs you to save him.

59
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,070
No more delays.

60
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,190
Do it.

61
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,260
Bro.

62
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,630
Do it.

63
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,190
Jinxiu.

64
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,550
You're the true Emperor Star.

65
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,990
You've survived

66
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,550
every tribulation.

67
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,990
You're worthier

68
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,460
of the throne than me.

69
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,990
The Emperor Star's choice

70
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,190
was wrong.

71
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,580
You're gonna be

72
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,430
stripped of divine bones,

73
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,260
divine roots,

74
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,820
and immortal destiny,

75
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,940
and be tossed into

76
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,260
the Demotion Pool to dissolve!

77
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,070
Every trace of you

78
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,940
will be erased from

79
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,870
the celestial history!

80
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,820
Gods, demons, and humans alike

81
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,550
will forget you ever existed!

82
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,630
Can you accept that?

83
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,700
Let's

84
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,430
talk about something happy.

85
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,340
Bro.

86
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,070
All this time

87
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,990
I've wanted to achieve something

88
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,260
to show you first.

89
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,990
The approval I seek

90
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,230
isn't from Father or Mother.

91
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,940
But from you.

92
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,990
All my life,

93
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,780
I've relied on you so much.

94
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,620
It's been an honor to be your brother.

95
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,980
If I could be your brother forever,

96
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,740
that would be my greatest pride!

97
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,659
My little hellion saying something

98
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,460
so sincere makes all

99
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,659
years of

100
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,300
brotherhood worthwhile.

101
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,180
Bro...

102
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,500
Don't stop.

103
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,740
[Jinxiu.]

104
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,220
Bro.

105
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,860
The peonies

106
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,780
are under Jinxiu's protection.

107
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,940
How could this happen?

108
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,380
What reckless words

109
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,260
were you about to speak

110
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,540
in the throne room?

111
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,500
I don't mean to disobey.

112
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,380
But accepting

113
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,060
the Emperor's Seal now feels wrong.

114
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,460
Wrong?

115
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,540
I stripped Jinxiu's divine bones

116
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,220
to save the last trace

117
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,460
of Father's soul.

118
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,220
If I accept the Seal while Father

119
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
is unconscious,

120
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,580
what would that make me?

121
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,460
Listen!

122
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,620
It would make you

123
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,580
the Emperor of Celestial Realm!

124
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,140
As the Emperor's son,

125
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,900
shouldn't you step up

126
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,780
in this leadership vacuum

127
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,820
to lead

128
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,940
Celestial Realm

129
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,100
in this crisis?

130
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,180
I never shirked duty.

131
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,100
Your playboy act

132
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,380
and disregard for rules,

133
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,060
wasn't that avoiding Jinxiu's sharpness,

134
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,700
responsibilities,

135
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,700
and the throne?

136
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,860
Maybe once.

137
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,780
Not anymore.

138
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,180
I'll shoulder duties,

139
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,420
but not by seizing power

140
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,980
while Father still lives.

141
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,420
If I do that,

142
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,380
that's unfilial!

143
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,780
Even though Jinxiu is banished,

144
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,900
he's still the chosen

145
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,940
emperor.

146
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,860
If I take the throne while he's fallen,

147
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,860
that's treachery.

148
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,060
Mother, do you want me to be

149
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,460
an unfilial traitor?

150
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,300
Ma'am.

151
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,980
The NCR Matriarch requests audience.

152
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,620
Your Highness.

153
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,540
I rushed here upon

154
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,820
hearing of

155
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,740
the assassination

156
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,300
and Sir Jinxiu's exile.

157
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,380
I feared for your safety.

158
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,260
But NCR

159
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,300
is still rebuilding.

160
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,300
Forgive my delay.

161
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,220
Not at all.

162
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,860
You're just in time.

163
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,580
Kunlun.

164
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,940
Luyao helped you before

165
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,180
to support your rise.

166
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,180
She's my choice

167
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
for future Celestial Empress.

168
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,460
You refused the seal

169
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,780
out of pride.

170
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,060
But consider Luyao's position....

171
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,740
As the Matriarch,

172
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,220
she deserves

173
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,660
proper recognition.

174
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,820
Sky Fox was just killed,

175
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,260
his allies still linger in the court.

176
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,220
If you can't even

177
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,540
give her a proper title,

178
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,820
what will the NCR think?

179
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,300
As a woman,

180
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,020
how can she command respect?

181
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,340
Mother, don't use her as an excuse.

182
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,820
She already admitted

183
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,900
how you manipulated her.

184
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,020
I've thought it through.

185
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,020
If I marry her,

186
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,980
it'll be for love,

187
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,060
not power, throne

188
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,780
or job.

189
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,940
I'll marry her.

190
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,900
She'll marry me.

191
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,980
Just for love.

192
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,380
And if I

193
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,140
claim the throne,

194
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,700
it'll be honorably,

195
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,860
without

196
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,500
excuses

197
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,060
or conditions.

198
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,500
Ma'am,

199
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,420
Kunlun has his reasons.

200
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,260
Please rest assured,

201
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,500
I'll support him

202
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,100
wholeheartedly,

203
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,660
no matter his station.

204
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,300
Your rehearsed

205
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,460
political platitudes

206
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,420
mean nothing.

207
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,020
Even if I don't force Kunlun

208
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,100
to take the seal today,

209
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,580
would he abandon the Realm?

210
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,860
Could he truly

211
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,500
forsake all creation?

212
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:01,980
Luyao,

213
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,260
same goes for you.

214
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,500
Whether he's Emperor or not,

215
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,420
you'll still serve him,

216
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:08,420
won't you?

217
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,300
Your debates

218
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,260
over "principles"

219
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,859
are actually

220
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,260
meaningless distinctions to my eyes.

221
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,220
You only fear

222
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,579
others' judgment,

223
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,099
and whispers

224
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,980
behind your backs.

225
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
Mother, please.

226
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,780
I have my convictions.

227
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,060
Get some rest.

228
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,500
Let's go.

229
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,020
Demon King's sword

230
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,780
serves me now.

231
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,900
So-called "kings"

232
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,740
are but insects.

233
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,660
[We're not far from Mt. Baizhou.]

234
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,300
[If that demon's hiding up there,]

235
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,660
[our searches here]

236
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,620
[is futile.]

237
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
You'd better hope not.

238
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,380
Haven't you heard?

239
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,700
The Emperor Star

240
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,660
got exiled over this demon.

241
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,540
He's stripped

242
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,780
of his bones and dissolved

243
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,500
in the Demotion Pool.

244
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,540
His blood

245
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,740
dyed Dragon's Tomb's

246
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020
mists crimson.

247
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,420
Let's capture strays for Kylin Lair

248
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,100
and be done with this.

249
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,300
Speak of the devil...

250
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,420
Baiyu.

251
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:48,860
Sir.

252
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,620
Sir.

253
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,860
You shed divinity

254
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,900
and endured the Demotion pool.

255
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,540
You need rest.

256
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,460
I'm

257
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,060
mortal now.

258
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,020
Why share my suffering?

259
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,820
You lost your divine bones,

260
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,300
so we become your bones.

261
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,740
Wherever you are,

262
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,420
that's our Floralia Palace.

263
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,540
Silly boys.

264
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,220
Sir,

265
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,100
shall we search for

266
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,540
Hongning's whereabouts?

267
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,740
No need.

268
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,380
Baicha.

269
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,820
Your wounds aren't healed.

270
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,660
You can't leave.

271
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,740
What are you doing here?

272
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,420
After Yaotian,

273
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,700
all realms know your face.

274
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,660
This is the only safe place.

275
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,020
The peonies withered for no reason.

276
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,020
I know you're worried.

277
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,340
You want to find him?

278
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,540
He's not in Celestial Realm.

279
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,220
You'd waste your time.

280
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,300
I'm trying to protect you.

281
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,420
The immortals won't

282
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,820
stop hunting you.

283
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,500
His disappearance is my fault.

284
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,500
I have to find him.

285
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,820
If you must go,

286
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,980
I can't stop you.

287
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,140
But no one knows

288
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,020
where he is.

289
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,900
You might search decades,

290
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,100
centuries,

291
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,500
or perhaps

292
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,780
you might never find him.

293
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,500
Wherever he is,

294
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,460
I will find him.

295
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,380
But Hongning...

296
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,020
Many fellows follow you

297
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,860
for the Yaotian

298
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,980
assassination.

299
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,340
They need you.

300
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,940
They need someone

301
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,580
brave enough to lead and fight for them.

302
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,380
That's not me.

303
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:31,820
But you did what

304
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,140
they never dared.

305
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,020
Everything I've done

306
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,300
was for Jinxiu!

307
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,820
That doesn't conflict

308
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,980
with leading them.

309
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,820
With the war coming,

310
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,580
if you need me,

311
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,060
I'll fight.

312
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,500
But what they need

313
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,700
is a bold leader.

314
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,020
I'm not.

315
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,620
Sir.

316
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,140
How's the preparation?

317
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,420
Thanks to your sword,

318
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,100
nearby pixies

319
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,100
are gathering

320
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,100
at Mt. Baizhou.

321
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,140
Keep an eye on those loyal to Hongning.

322
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,220
If they demand her whereabouts,

323
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,420
feed them lies.

324
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,700
Eliminate

325
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,580
stubborn ones.

326
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,180
Understood.

327
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,940
Celestial Realm's in decline.

328
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,220
Our ascendancy

329
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,940
draws near.

330
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,900
Mobilize

331
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,180
all forces.

332
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,700
Yes, sir!

333
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,220
The assassination,

334
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,300
Jinxiu's exile...

335
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,780
What a tale for the bards,

336
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,180
a thrilling tragedy

337
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,210
of fallen deities.

338
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,410
What

339
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,050
unfolds next?

340
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,090
Lujiu.

341
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,370
You should be resting.

342
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,010
Why are you here?

343
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,970
What happened to Sir Jinxiu?

344
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,330
Calm down.

345
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:08,930
Focus on recovery first.

346
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,530
Answer me.

347
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,090
What happened to him?

348
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,970
Must you

349
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,690
still hide truths?

350
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,170
Do I not

351
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,210
deserve to know?

352
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,090
Is that so?

353
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,530
Fine.

354
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,490
I'll tell you.

355
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,170
Swear you'll stay calm.

356
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,050
Hongning attempted regicide.

357
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,170
Jinxiu sacrificed his divine bones

358
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,050
and flesh to save the Emperor.

359
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,930
Now he's relinquished the throne,

360
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,130
exiled himself.

361
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:49,730
Missing without a trace.

362
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,370
Sir Jinxiu...

363
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,090
He's

364
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,130
exiled.

365
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,130
Not trials.

366
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,810
You know,

367
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,810
even if innocent,

368
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,130
he's branded

369
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,330
a criminal.

370
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,530
I know

371
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,970
your history with him.

372
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,730
But as the heir of NCR,

373
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,970
your association

374
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,850
with him will endanger

375
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,490
yourself

376
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,770
and even the whole NCR.

377
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,050
The whole NCR?

378
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,010
How absurd.

379
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,930
Its fate

380
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,170
means nothing to me.

381
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,250
I've never been

382
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,770
the true prince.

383
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,330
Don't be impulsive!

384
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,690
Would you risk

385
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,330
entire NCR for

386
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,410
a condemned

387
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,330
criminal?

388
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,770
Have you forgotten?

389
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,010
Listen.

390
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,530
Since the day I was locked up

391
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,570
and thrown into Kylin Lair,

392
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,450
I stopped being part of this realm.

393
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:50,970
Don't associate

394
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,090
its future with me!

395
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,570
I know you've suffered.

396
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,370
I brought you home

397
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,770
to right

398
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,490
Father's wrongs,

399
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,770
to atone for my past failures.

400
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,290
Lujiu.

401
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,290
Please.

402
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,690
This is your home.

403
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,850
I'm your sister,

404
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,290
then,

405
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,770
now,

406
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,770
always.

407
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,850
I care about you more than anyone.

408
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:18,970
Both you

409
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,090
and this place

410
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,610
are strange to me.

411
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,170
Luyao.

412
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,090
keeping me here

413
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,650
is selfish.

414
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,130
You do this for yourself,

415
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,130
not me.

416
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,450
You're no different from

417
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,570
that selfish, hypocritical man!

418
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:37,650
No!

419
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,210
I've always cared about you.

420
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,850
Absurd!

421
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,690
I was born with three tails.

422
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,650
Father killed Mother for

423
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,690
giving birth to me.

424
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,610
I was locked up

425
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,330
in the dungeon for centuries!

426
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,570
Everyone scorned me,

427
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,730
looked down on me.

428
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,010
Every day was

429
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,210
torture

430
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,490
until I exhausted his patience,

431
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,370
made him believe I'd never grow 9 tails.

432
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,330
He threw me away like trash

433
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,530
into Kylin Lair.

434
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,570
During all that time,

435
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,810
did you ever care about me?

436
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,930
If you truly did,

437
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,650
did you ever think

438
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:12,890
to find your

439
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,170
unknown brother? Even once?

440
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,730
Now you bring me back here,

441
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,330
parading me in front of them.

442
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,330
How is this any different from before?

443
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,210
Every time I see you,

444
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,730
it only reminds me of

445
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:30,890
the pain

446
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,690
that haunts me.

447
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,490
I'm sorry.

448
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,250
It was Sir Jinxiu...

449
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,330
He saved me

450
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,970
from Kylin Lair,

451
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,770
gave me purpose,

452
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,930
and a home.

453
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,490
He's the only one

454
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,930
who never scorned me.

455
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,490
I owe him

456
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,170
everything.

457
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,490
I can't abandon him.

458
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:04,890
Luyao,

459
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,770
if you truly want to make amends,

460
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,290
set me free.

461
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,650
Don't trap me

462
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,450
in this

463
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,050
living hell.

464
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,370
Without him,

465
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:17,930
you could've

466
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,050
lived a simpler life

467
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,490
with a brilliant future.

468
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,330
In your eyes,

469
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,050
maybe it is.

470
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,810
Perhaps you think

471
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:31,930
I'm just

472
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,610
his insignificant follower.

473
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:35,810
So what?

474
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,170
Maybe

475
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,050
you'd make

476
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,650
a fine queen,

477
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,490
and

478
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,050
give me

479
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,370
a brilliant future.

480
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,810
But honestly,

481
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,250
I don't care.

482
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:53,730
Luyao,

483
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,890
you'll never be my family.

484
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,610
Never.

485
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:01,690
Lujiu.

486
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:03,730
Lujiu!

487
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,170
[Lujiu.]

488
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,250
[What's wrong?]

489
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,890
[Are you the Matriarch?]

490
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,330
[I am.]

491
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,330
[They say]

492
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,090
[praying to you grants wishes.]

493
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:24,690
[So,]

494
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,450
[can you make me]

495
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,210
[grow nine tails?]

496
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,090
[When you grow up,]

497
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,170
[you will have nine tails.]

498
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:33,970
[Really?]

499
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,170
[Lujiu.]

500
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,050
[We met before.]

501
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,930
[But father erased your memories.]

502
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,490
Have you seen peonies?

503
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,970
No.

504
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,410
Sir.

505
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,170
Yes?

506
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:34,930
Excuse me.

507
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:35,890
They say

508
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,050
all peonies withered

509
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,130
except here,

510
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,770
but I see none.

511
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,050
You

512
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,330
took the wrong path.

513
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,650
The peonies

514
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,050
are on that mountain.

515
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,530
Have you seen them yourself?

516
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,530
At my age? No.

517
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,930
Wouldn't climb for mere peonies.

518
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,330
Just hearsay.

519
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,410
Thank you, sir.

520
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,050
Before chaos cleaved earth and sky,

521
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,090
no life stirred in the void.

522
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,530
Pangu split primordial mists,

523
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,970
deities arose,

524
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,410
then mortals and pixies...

525
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:12,890
Wait.

526
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,410
Um...

527
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,170
Didn't you

528
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,490
recite this before?

529
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,410
Odd...

530
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,610
I feel like I've said this somewhere.

531
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,290
Right?

532
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,610
Anyway...

533
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:23,930
These days

534
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,410
pixies are being hunted everywhere.

535
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,090
It's brutal.

536
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:31,850
Stop!

537
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,530
[Leave that bunny alone!]

538
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,690
Wanna surrender yourselves?

539
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,690
We're asked

540
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,610
to capture all demons

541
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,050
and toss them into Kylin Lair.

542
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,010
You can't even spare a bunny with only

543
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,370
a few hundred years of cultivation?

544
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,850
You're scoundrels

545
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,970
who have no basic morality!

546
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,210
Yeah!

547
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,450
We may be pixies,

548
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,610
but we've never harmed anyone.

549
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,370
We just wanna live

550
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,130
like humans,

551
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,530
earn a living,

552
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,890
and have a home.

553
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,490
Why hunt us down?

554
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,170
Insolence!

555
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,530
Run!

556
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:08,690
Bunny!

557
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,370
Ningmeng.

558
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,250
Jiaobo.

559
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,210
Who are you?

560
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,170
You know us?

561
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,210
Ningmeng.

562
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,890
It's really you!

563
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:28,650
Great!

564
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:30,850
Great!

565
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,810
They didn't lie to me.

566
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,770
You were reincarnated!

567
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,730
Not annihilated!

568
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,570
And you, Jiaobo!

569
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,570
What happened to you?

570
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,810
Why vanish

571
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,090
after my tribulation?

572
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,850
I know you went to find Ningmeng,

573
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,450
but how could you leave

574
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,330
without a word?

575
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,130
I was worried sick!

576
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,450
So glad

577
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,210
we're reunited!

578
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,850
I don't know you.

579
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:55,690
Miss.

580
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,010
Don't grab us like that.

581
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,570
Calm down.

582
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,530
Take it easy.

583
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,250
You must be mistaken.

584
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,850
We've never met.

585
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,490
Fine.

586
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:07,770
Then why

587
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,449
did the soldiers attack you?

588
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,330
They tried to kill this bunny.

589
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,409
Let me explain.

590
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,530
This village

591
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,010
was peaceful.

592
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:20,330
Normally soldiers wouldn't

593
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:21,810
hunt here.

594
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,929
But recently, even

595
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,570
this area is unsafe.

596
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,810
His parents

597
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,370
were taken days ago.

598
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,090
Now he's even

599
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,449
in danger himself.

600
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,210
Earlier you said

601
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,130
you're from Mt. Baizhou?

602
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,610
Have you heard of the Demon King there?

603
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,530
Demon King?

604
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,530
They say the King's

605
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,170
appeared there.

606
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,290
Demons worldwide

607
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,610
flock to her.

608
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,290
We're heading there too.

609
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,449
Do you know the King's name?

610
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,530
Hongning, they say.

611
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,330
Three heads,

612
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,490
leathery wings,

613
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,450
fearsome King Hongning.

614
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,890
I am Hongning.

615
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:09,810
What?

616
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,850
You're Hongning?

617
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,010
Yeah.

618
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,450
Why would I lie?

619
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,650
I'm here searching

620
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,850
for someone.

621
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,090
I didn't expect there to be so many

622
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,050
homeless pixies.

623
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,010
You saw it too.

624
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,330
Families

625
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,730
torn apart, thrown into

626
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,770
Kylin Lair.

627
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,930
If you trust me,

628
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,130
go to Mt. Baizhou.

629
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,450
It's safe there.

630
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,130
I'll ensure no more homelessness.

631
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:32,530
Thank you.

632
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,530
Trust me.

633
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,290
King Hongning.

634
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,330
Just call me Hongning.

635
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:42,730
Hongning.

636
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,290
You're seeking someone?

637
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,930
Any leads?

638
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,090
Why do celestial troops scour here?

639
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,570
As a pixie,

640
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,890
I believe in omens.

641
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:55,730
I think

642
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,770
it's definitely related to the peonies.

643
00:35:58,810 --> 00:35:59,610
Peonies?

644
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,130
Strange thing.

645
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,570
Years ago

646
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,930
all peonies in this village bloomed.

647
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,330
Remember?

648
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,210
Especially in the forest ahead,

649
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,890
Dragon's Tomb to the south,

650
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,930
peonies that shouldn't exist there

651
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,010
flourished most vibrantly.

652
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,890
When they bloomed,

653
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,250
soldiers never came.

654
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,570
Suddenly,

655
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,410
they all withered.

656
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,770
Shortly after,

657
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,690
celestial troops attacked.

658
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:30,770
[I think]

659
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,890
[I will find him.]

660
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,290
Sir Kunlun.

661
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,370
General Manwu.

662
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,210
They say you're using

663
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,810
the excuse of Hongning

664
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,770
to hunt pixies across the mortal realm,

665
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,170
and defy divine orders

666
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,770
by imprisoning them in Kylin Lair

667
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,970
without divine trial.

668
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,170
Sir.

669
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,690
I just desperately wanna catch her.

670
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:04,770
My troops have been

671
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,170
searching for her when

672
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,610
we discovered the chaos.

673
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,250
Demons are lawless by nature.

674
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,450
If left unchecked, the mortal realm

675
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,410
will descend into anarchy.

676
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,490
I'm only doing

677
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,410
what the Emperor commanded.

678
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,890
What nonsense!

679
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,690
Father has never

680
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,490
sanctioned executions

681
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,770
without trial!

682
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,890
You're mistaken, General Manwu.

683
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,730
This rampant hunting will

684
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,490
only escalate immortal-demon conflicts.

685
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,210
Harmful to

686
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,410
celestial rule.

687
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,130
Unlike you,

688
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,210
I'm not such a martial deity

689
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,250
hiding like a coward.

690
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,610
I've served the Emperor

691
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,010
through countless battles.

692
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,210
Back when Jinxiu was Punisher,

693
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,410
I executed countless demons.

694
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,330
You're provoking warfare!

695
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,210
Ten thousand years of peace

696
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,650
can't be destroyed by your actions.

697
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:02,730
Enough!

698
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:04,890
Two celestial generals

699
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,130
bickering like children?

700
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,170
What disgrace!

701
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:08,770
Sir Kunlun.

702
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,730
Everything I do

703
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,410
is for Celestial Realm's sake,

704
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,650
with absolute loyalty.

705
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,570
I respect you

706
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,210
only because

707
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,570
you're the Emperor's son.

708
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,970
Are you suggesting I have

709
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,730
no authority to order you to stop?

710
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,490
You hold the Seal.

711
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,890
I dare not defy you!

712
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,370
But

713
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,210
if your Emperor Star lit up...

714
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,370
I'd kneel willingly.

715
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:39,290
What a convenient excuse!

716
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,050
Father lies unconscious,

717
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,770
brother dwells in mortal realm,

718
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,170
while I hold the Seal,

719
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,730
I must protect Celestial Realm.

720
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:47,890
You may

721
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,530
defy me for

722
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,650
the unlit star.

723
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,250
But listen.

724
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,930
Anyone using

725
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,090
this as pretext

726
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,370
to overthrow the throne

727
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,610
or destroy the realms

728
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,610
will face my wrath!

729
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,770
Yes, Sir.

730
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,330
Lujiu?

731
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,130
You're here.

732
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,810
So Sir Jinxiu must be nearby.

733
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,810
How dare you show your face?

734
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,130
Jinxiu won't kill you,

735
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,330
but I will.

736
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,130
What do you want?

737
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,410
Teach you a lesson.

738
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,570
Sir.

739
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,210
We've located Hongning.

740
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,290
Excellent.

741
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:29,930
But

742
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:30,930
the Empress ordered

743
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,090
not to kill her.

744
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,730
Violating her

745
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:34,930
will lead to trouble.

746
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,210
Think twice, sir.

747
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,410
Arresting the demon who

748
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,050
assassinated the Emperor is justified.

749
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,610
Out of respect

750
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,850
for the Queen and her son,

751
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,610
I did not search openly.

752
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,770
I've clashed

753
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,890
with Kunlun.

754
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,730
Since Hongning's trail was found,

755
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,250
capture her immediately.

756
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,290
Go!

757
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,210
Understood.

758
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,410
I won't harm him.

759
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:06,810
I've searched too long.

760
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,170
How dare you

761
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,130
claim that?

762
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,170
Do you deserve his sacrifice?

763
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,010
[Find her. Now!]

764
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:18,890
If they find Jinxiu

765
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:19,930
through you,

766
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,650
I'll make you pay.

767
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,210
[All peonies withered]

768
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,770
[except this blossoming patch.]

769
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,210
[Jinxiu,]

770
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,290
[you're here, innit?]

771
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,770
He's here, isn't he?

772
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,690
He descended because of me.

773
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,450
I must find him.

774
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,010
You know he's fallen

775
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,290
for your sake.

776
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,530
How will you atone?

777
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:38,850
I'll accept any punishment.

778
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,730
You can't bear the consequences.

779
00:42:58,850 --> 00:42:59,770
Jinxiu.

780
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,170
Jinxiu.

781
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,410
Hear me?

782
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:15,970
Please don't shut me out!

783
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,010
Even Baiyu and Mokui

784
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,290
have ended up like this?

785
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,050
