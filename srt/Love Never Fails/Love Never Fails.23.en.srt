3
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,400
We're in a barrier here.

4
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,600
No one can eavesdrop on us.

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,400
You may speak freely.

6
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Father, I only wish to know,

7
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,000
did you tamper with the bracelet?

8
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,240
You mean

9
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,840
the bracelet you stole

10
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,160
from the Sage?

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,080
I knew it was your doing.

12
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,200
Jinxiu,

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,720
I never gave you that bracelet.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
You broke heaven's laws

15
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,520
and stole it yourself,

16
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,640
then handed it to the camellia pixie.

17
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,720
Why

18
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,160
come pointing fingers at me for it?

19
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,320
All I sought from the Sage was

20
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,360
a binding item to contain her powers.

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
How could it have backfired so violently?

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,320
None of this would have happened

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
if you'd faced your trial

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,400
and stayed in the mortal realm.

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,440
Jinxiu,

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,920
the Sage

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,800
warned you countless times:

28
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,280
defy destiny, and you'll reap what you sow.

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,520
Her fate is the price of your choices.

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,240
You have no one else to blame.

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,160
If not for your foolish heart's desires,

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,560
she could have lived

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
a simple mortal life.

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,120
Had you not meddled in her fate,

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,520
how would she have met such a tragic end?

36
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,320
I didn't destroy her,

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,320
you did.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,040
These consequences

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,760
are yours to bear!

40
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,960
As the future Celestial Monarch,

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,120
why concern yourself with

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,280
the lives of mortals and demons?

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,520
When those people at Mt. Cangwu

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,720
were writhing in agony

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,760
from the Samadhi Fire,

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,680
didn't you grant them mercy

47
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,560
with your sword?

48
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,960
The slaughter at Mt. Cangwu

49
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,200
happened by your decree.

50
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,640
The troops turned it into a killing field!

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,280
The bloodshed was never my intention.

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,800
I ordered Sir Taiyi

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,840
to handle this delicately,

54
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,800
merely to bring back Hongning.

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,160
But in his quest for glory,

56
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,880
he took matters into his own hands,

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,600
even conspiring with demons,

58
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,200
leading to this devastating tragedy.

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
As the Punisher,

60
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,680
he committed an unforgivable sin.

61
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,360
And now that we're being frank,

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,400
know this:

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,040
even though he's your master,

64
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,840
conspiring with demons and causing such carnage

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,800
is something we will never tolerate!

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,080
Guards!

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,360
Your Divine Majesty!

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,880
Demote Sir Taiyi to a junior immortal

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,160
banish him to the mortal realm.

70
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,960
As you command.

71
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,040
Father...

72
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,600
If you had focused on

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,000
awakening your power

74
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,320
and fulfilling your destiny,

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,960
none of this would have happened.

76
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,320
Your actions have brought

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,200
misfortune to countless souls!

78
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,680
Father,

79
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,159
I only wish for peace in all realms.

80
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,320
If being the Celestial Monarch

81
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
means turning a blind eye to justice,

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,240
placing power and authority

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,080
above others' suffering,

84
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,080
then I renounce my claim

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,680
to the throne!

86
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,160
Master,

87
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,240
please tell me the truth behind all this.

88
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,840
Jinxiu,

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
I hope

90
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,560
you'll ascend to the throne

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
and protect the Celestial Realm.

92
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,280
[Being with me has only led you]

93
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,440
[down a path of suffering and sorrow.]

94
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,120
[Though I couldn't keep you safe,]

95
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,400
[I selfishly]

96
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,480
[clung to you.]

97
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,560
[In the end,]

98
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,360
[I only brought you harm.]

99
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,440
[Maybe...]

100
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,920
[your happiness lies somewhere]

101
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,520
[far from here,]

102
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,080
[in a world without me.]

103
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,760
Your Divine Highness,

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
it's urgent!

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,960
Sir Kunlun, he...

106
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,120
Speak, what's wrong?

107
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,200
He has assaulted the official

108
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
at the Bridge of Destiny.

109
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,800
Please, Sir Kunlun, I beg you!

110
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,120
If we delay any longer,

111
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,560
we'll miss the appointed time

112
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,880
for reincarnation!

113
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,120
I've made myself clear.

114
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,880
Either I cross over with

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,800
my fellow disciples,

116
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,680
or

117
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
I'm not going at all.

118
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,440
B-but...

119
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,800
reincarnation follows the laws of fate!

120
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
I don't have that kind of authority!

121
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,040
Is that so?

122
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,680
Then I'm definitely not going.

123
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,200
You might as well beat me up again...

124
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,320
You...

125
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,680
Your Divine Highness.

126
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,000
What chaos are you creating now?

127
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,120
My brothers await at

128
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,200
the Bridge of Destiny.

129
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,960
What harm is there in crossing together

130
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,520
and preserving our brotherhood?

131
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
How can you dismiss this as mere chaos?

132
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,800
You should know that you and Jinxiu were

133
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,760
both sent for trials as Emperor Stars.

134
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,159
In this lifetime,

135
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,520
both your stars

136
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,600
have wavered.

137
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,799
By sacrificing yourself for them,

138
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
you've proven worthy of the throne:

139
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,360
saving others is saving oneself.

140
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
Your next trial will be decisive.

141
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,440
These bonds

142
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,920
you cherish so much

143
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,280
are but temporary illusions.

144
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,160
All memories will fade anyway.

145
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,040
A single lifetime or not,

146
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,880
they showed me true companionship.

147
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,520
I must see them through this crossing.

148
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,880
They're innocent.

149
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,920
They shouldn't have been casualties in this!

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
The path to the throne

151
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,240
is paved

152
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,280
with sacrifices.

153
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,200
How can you let such petty bonds hold you back?

154
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,120
I never sought to awaken my destiny,

155
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,480
nor did I ever wish to become emperor.

156
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,280
Better spend your efforts on Jinxiu!

157
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,560
You...

158
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,680
Sir Jinxiu,

159
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,840
your trial isn't complete yet.

160
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,880
Time grows short,

161
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,360
please proceed with your reincarnation.

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,160
Where are the people of Mt. Cangwu?

163
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,440
Gratitude.

164
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,880
Sir Jinxiu,

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,280
will repay this favor in the future.

166
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,320
I will.

167
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,120
Why is Lujiu here?

168
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,640
After the tragedy at Mt. Cangwu,

169
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,120
this three-tailed fox

170
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,160
took his own life

171
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,240
out of guilt.

172
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,320
I'm to blame...

173
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
it's all my doing...

174
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,280
everything is my fault...

175
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,920
all my fault...

176
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
You don't get to choose

177
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
whether to become the emperor.

178
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,440
The time has come.

179
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,760
You must proceed!

180
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,880
Greetings, Your Divine Majesty.

181
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,200
What now?

182
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,320
During the

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
consciousness extraction,

184
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,760
I saw Jinxiu in the process...

185
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,240
If you already knew,

186
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,480
why ask?

187
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,160
When Kunlun returned from his trial,

188
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,680
you ignored him.

189
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,360
Yet

190
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,960
when Jinxiu

191
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,320
broke the rules of the trial

192
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,360
by returning to the realm,

193
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,520
you deliberately covered for him.

194
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
The heir's trials have their own rules.

195
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,640
Both divine heirs failed their trials,

196
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
yet

197
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,840
you clearly favor Jinxiu alone.

198
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,320
What are you implying?

199
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,440
Fine,

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
I'll ask plainly.

201
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,760
Whose bastard

202
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,200
is Jinxiu really?

203
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,280
Insolent!

204
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,160
I warn you one last time.

205
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Never speak of this again!

206
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,520
For ten millennia,

207
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,880
Jinxiu's honored you as his birth mother.

208
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,520
Not only have you treated him harshly,

209
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,200
but now

210
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,680
you dare speak of him in such terms!

211
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,720
Am I wrong to name him for what he is?

212
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,920
On the very day

213
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,000
I gave birth to Kunlun,

214
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,240
you brought him back

215
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,560
during my labor,

216
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,200
then proclaimed

217
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,640
I had borne twins.

218
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,640
How could you do this to me?

219
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,440
This

220
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,720
happened millennia ago...

221
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,920
Can't you move past it?

222
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,480
Which one gave birth to him?

223
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,120
Why insist on making him your heir?

224
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,120
You still won't

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,360
reveal the truth to me, will you?

226
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,160
Some truths

227
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,400
are best kept hidden.

228
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,400
So be it.

229
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,560
Since you'd interfere with divine trials

230
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,520
for that bastard child,

231
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,480
don't blame me for what comes next.

232
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,640
Fox General has seized power,

233
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,440
and the Matriarch is on the run.

234
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,360
I temporarily entrust my eyes to you.

235
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,040
You must find her

236
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,080
and bring her here.

237
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,840
Ensure no one in the realm knows.

238
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,800
Understood.

239
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,520
Be on your way.

240
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,800
[The fate of my child]

241
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,800
[depends entirely on you.]

242
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,160
Hurry, this way!

243
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,240
Stop!

244
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,800
Stop right there!

245
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,960
Stop running!

246
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,880
Stop!

247
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,960
Stop!

248
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,080
Stop running!

249
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,840
Stop!

250
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,000
Where did she go?

251
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,640
Search over there!

252
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,600
Greetings, Your Divine Highness.

253
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,720
Rise.

254
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,640
Your wounds have nearly healed.

255
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,640
You'll make a full recovery soon.

256
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Gratitude.

257
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,840
I never imagined

258
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,920
the Northern Celestial Realm

259
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,400
would fall into such turmoil.

260
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,680
Given your past connections with us,

261
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,040
and our debt to you,

262
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
saving you was the least I could do.

263
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,800
Gratitude, Your Divine Highness.

264
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,680
While I'm eternally grateful

265
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,200
for your help,

266
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
But I cannot find it in my heart

267
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,200
to forgive Sir Jinxiu.

268
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,800
Such determination.

269
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I've always thought

270
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,160
we shared similar spirits.

271
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
Let me speak plainly,

272
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,200
Your grievances with him

273
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,720
mean little to me.

274
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,080
I saved you

275
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,040
because I have a favor to ask.

276
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,600
Your Divine Highness need only ask.

277
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,200
Kunlun has descended to the mortal realm

278
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,520
for his trial as the heir.

279
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,000
I cannot interfere,

280
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,760
so I hope

281
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,839
you could lend him your aid.

282
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,200
Me?

283
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
Should you help him

284
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,839
complete his trial first,

285
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,680
I shall bestow upon you

286
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,599
the position as the empress,

287
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,319
and help you reclaim your realm.

288
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,200
I pledge my full dedication.

289
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,120
Excellent.

290
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,360
Here is your reincarnation token,

291
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,320
which I've enchanted.

292
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,000
Those from your realm cannot trace you.

293
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Take this red thread

294
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,080
and find Kunlun at the Bridge of Destiny.

295
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,480
This thread

296
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,040
will bind your destinies together.

297
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,240
As I've told you,

298
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,760
they've already left!

299
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,280
Why won't you believe me?

300
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,000
What if you're trying to trick me?

301
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,040
Little fox!

302
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,600
Ah...Your Divine Highness,

303
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,560
what brings you to this place?

304
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,280
Lujiu and Jinxiu have entered

305
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,680
the mortal realm for their trials.

306
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,440
The heir's trial can't be interfered with.

307
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,240
If I wish to find Lujiu,

308
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
I must

309
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,640
join him in the trial.

310
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,640
Um...

311
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,440
allow me to join you.

312
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,320
That's perfect!

313
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,480
You mean it?

314
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,160
But

315
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,360
I need to wait for my fellow disciples.

316
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,360
Actually, there's another way.

317
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,280
What is it?

318
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,840
What are you doing?

319
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,800
Luyao,

320
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
I refuse to drink this...

321
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,840
What are you up to?

322
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,640
Come along.

323
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
Oh heavens,

324
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,840
please don't ever do this again!

325
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,160
Hongning,

326
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,440
I've obtained the Revival Gem.

327
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,400
You'll be able to

328
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
restore your original form shortly.

329
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,800
[A century passed in the mortal realm.]

330
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,680
[There existed a small kingdom]

331
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,920
[where humans and demons coexisted.]

332
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,520
[The chaos that ensued]

333
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,920
[gave this kingdom its name: State Wuzhang(chaos.)]

334
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,360
[How could they ever live in harmony?]

335
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,800
[Soon enough,]

336
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,440
[evil demons wreaked havoc.]

337
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,080
[Only when demon hunters gathered]

338
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,760
[did peace return.]

339
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,560
[Today, the corrupt Prince Xian,]

340
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,880
[obsessed with pursue of eternal life,]

341
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,560
[has brought misfortunes upon this land.]

342
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
You two.

343
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,560
-Yes.
-Yes.

344
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,240
Well, well...

345
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,000
Are you refusing my hospitality?

346
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,080
Or perhaps my maids

347
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,280
don't meet your standards?

348
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,440
Your Highness must prioritize your health.

349
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,600
How peculiar...

350
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,040
Lately, my body feels

351
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,960
increasingly heavy.

352
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,040
Those incompetent physicians

353
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,520
can't even figure out

354
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,640
what's wrong with me.

355
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,960
Useless fools!

356
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,720
Li Zhong.

357
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,480
Your Highness.

358
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,320
Deliver my decree:

359
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,320
have that incompetent physician

360
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,880
beheaded in the

361
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,480
town square tomorrow!

362
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,400
Yes, Your Highness.

363
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,280
Your Highness,

364
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,680
the physician is not at fault.

365
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,600
Incompetence itself is a crime!

366
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,920
I've heard that evil demons

367
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,080
are running rampant in the city,

368
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,920
claiming countless lives.

369
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,760
Even within the palace walls,

370
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,040
we've lost dozens of people.

371
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,880
You, as my newly

372
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,560
appointed general,

373
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,640
shall do well

374
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,720
not to try my patience

375
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,440
like those useless officials.

376
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,880
Let me warn you,

377
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,600
at your rank,

378
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,640
any mistake would mean

379
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,360
death to your entire clan!

380
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,400
However, I'll grant you this:

381
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,880
starting tomorrow,

382
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,600
you need not

383
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,480
attend the morning court.

384
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,440
Focus solely on

385
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,000
dealing with these demons

386
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,120
in the city.

387
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,600
Your Highness,

388
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,760
here.

389
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,720
Good.

390
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,480
My lady, take a look,

391
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,480
these are good stuff.

392
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,080
There's not a soul for miles

393
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,640
who hasn't heard of his evil deeds.

394
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,560
Whoever killed him

395
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,880
must have been pushed too far.

396
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,000
Right.

397
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,440
Was it suicide?

398
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,600
Impossible!

399
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,080
This is karma

400
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
coming back to bite him.

401
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,760
You all want him dead that badly?

402
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,480
Everyone in town

403
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,720
wanted him gone.

404
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,800
[The one who killed him]

405
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,000
[is a blessing from heaven!]

406
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
[With his deep pockets and]

407
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,120
[his brother-in-law being the magistrate,]

408
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,480
[he acted like he owned the place.]

409
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,480
[This gruesome end is what he deserved.]

410
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,200
[Best if they never find out who did it.]

411
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,880
[Why bother explaining anything to him?]

412
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,280
[He wouldn't understand anyway.]

413
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,880
[Just look at his fancy clothes.]

414
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,600
[Must be from some wealthy family.]

415
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,640
[He's probably cut from the same cloth.]

416
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,200
Hey, you think I'm deaf?

417
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,080
Why don't you speak a little louder?

418
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,720
G-General...

419
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,320
Tampered with the crime scene

420
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,880
and frightened the civilians.

421
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,680
Await your punishment.

422
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,280
Understood.

423
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,720
Go gather some information.

424
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,760
General, what's there to investigate?

425
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,720
The townspeople only know what they know.

426
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,280
I heard it all just now.

427
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,040
Just ask me, and I'll tell you everything.

428
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
The victim is Zheng Ke,

429
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,960
an infamous local merchant.

430
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,680
He was a tyrant

431
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,400
who abused his power

432
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,520
through his government connections.

433
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,440
He was rotten to the core,

434
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,960
causing trouble wherever he went.

435
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,000
General, let's head back.

436
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,840
This wasn't suicide.

437
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,360
Someone strangled and strung him up there.

438
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,760
With all the enemies he made,

439
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,640
this is clearly a murder case.

440
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,040
Let the Ministry of Justice handle it.

441
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,320
Why should we get involved?

442
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,160
There's more to this than meets the eye.

443
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,680
I believe he actually

444
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,040
died from drowning.

445
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,800
The marks on his neck

446
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,240
were made deliberately

447
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,200
after his death.

448
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,120
Drowned?

449
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,360
But there's not a drop of water in here.

450
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,720
Get me a strand of his hair.

451
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,520
General, this is...

452
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
This is the soul detection ritual.

453
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,480
These three burning sticks represent

454
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,960
the complete essence of his soul.

455
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,560
Though they detected

456
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,640
lingering demonic energy,

457
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,680
all three sticks ignited successfully,

458
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,080
indicating his soul wasn't torn apart.

459
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,400
This wasn't the work of

460
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,440
a evil soul-devouring demon.

461
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,000
Send the body to the Ministry of Justice.

462
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,120
Yes, sir.

463
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,840
General, new evidence has emerged.

464
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,120
The coroner found

465
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,840
water plants in the body,

466
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,160
matching those from the pond close by.

467
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,360
Zheng Ke bought

468
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,960
that pond some years back

469
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,920
as an ornamental garden.

470
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,520
No one else was even allowed near it.

471
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,360
Ten years ago,

472
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,720
a traveler staying near the pond

473
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,000
vanished without a trace.

474
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,920
Since then,

475
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,600
the lotuses in that pond

476
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,640
have bloomed later

477
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,880
and withered earlier than anywhere else.

478
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,960
No matter how beautifully they bloom,

479
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,720
they unfailingly wither completely

480
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,000
on the sixteenth day of the sixth month.

481
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,920
So, General, you suspect this

482
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,520
has something to do with the lotus pond?

483
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,560
Let's go.

484
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,840
Where to?

485
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,680
The death scene.

486
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,440
The protective seals in this room

487
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,760
have been torn away,

488
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,000
and the jade amulet on Zheng Ke

489
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,080
was mysteriously broken.

490
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,440
General, how could you tell?

491
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,000
Simple observation.

492
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Are we here

493
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,400
for demon hunting?

494
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,360
Vanquish demons, purge evil spirits

495
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,720
—by Divine Decree!

496
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,760
Enough, enough.

497
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
This demon's powers are still weak.

498
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,120
It's not some great evil.

499
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,560
Those charms won't be necessary.

500
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,600
Then what are we doing here?

501
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,160
Waiting.

502
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:11,920
Waiting?

503
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,840
You're a lotus pixie?

504
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:50,880
I am.

505
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,880
Did you take Zheng Ke's life?

506
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,320
I did.

507
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,280
I took my revenge on him

508
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,400
out of gratitude to another.

509
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,560
How is killing an act of gratitude?

510
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,960
Ten years ago,

511
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,600
I was born in the lotus pond.

512
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,280
In a year of drought,

513
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,360
I barely perished

514
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,000
if not for a young gentleman,

515
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,120
a homeless traveler who had lived nearby.

516
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,160
Day after day, he watered me,

517
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,680
keeping me alive.

518
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,720
But one night,

519
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,880
he happened to

520
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,480
acquire a crystal vase.

521
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,520
Zheng Ke, coveting this treasure,

522
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,800
murdered him

523
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,640
in cold blood

524
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,760
and buried his body in my pond.

525
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
The next morning, he filled the pond

526
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,800
with water to hide his deed.

527
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
As a demon,

528
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,400
surely you possessed some powers.

529
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,200
Why didn't you come to his aid?

530
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
He was my savior.

531
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Of course I wanted to help!

532
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,680
But my powers were too weak then,

533
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,040
almost nonexistent.

534
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
It wasn't until three years ago

535
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,760
that I survived the tribulation

536
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,200
and barely managed to take human form.

537
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,880
Yet the protective charms in the house

538
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,280
prevented me from acting.

539
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,320
So you

540
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,720
made the lotuses wither on the sixteenth day

541
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,760
of the sixth month each year?

542
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,880
His bones lay unknown in the pond.

543
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,920
Surely his soul could not rest in peace.

544
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,200
I had hoped that

545
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,760
by making the lotuses behave strangely,

546
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,040
someone might discover the oddity

547
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,080
and uncover his remains.

548
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,120
Alas,

549
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,360
none ever grasped my message.

550
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,640
For a man of such humble means,

551
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,680
how did he acquire such a precious item?

552
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,560
That crystal vase...

553
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,520
I had secretly guided him

554
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,840
to find it as a way

555
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,160
to repay his kindness.

556
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,720
Who knew

557
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,040
it would awaken Zheng Ke's greed

558
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,560
and bring disaster upon him instead.

559
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,840
Do you know anything

560
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,000
about the sudden destruction of

561
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,640
the protective charms in Zheng Ke's room

562
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,200
and his jade amulet?

563
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,720
No, I don't.

564
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,120
Someone clearly

565
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,320
orchestrated this.

566
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,240
Lotus pixie,

567
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,360
every deed has its price.

568
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,240
Fate is predetermined.

569
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,120
The will of heaven cannot be defied.

570
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
While Zheng Ke deserved punishment,

571
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,240
that was for the court to decide.

572
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,280
By taking his life,

573
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
you've broken the cosmic order.

574
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,560
I shall take your core now.

575
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,200
Once you're declined to your true form,

576
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,960
you'll make better choices.

577
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,480
leave this kingdom and

578
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,880
seek your immortal path elsewhere.

579
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,800
What are you waiting for?

580
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,640
Surrender your core and be on your way.

581
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
Young master.

582
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,080
Greetings, lady.

583
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,080
Have you been

584
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,320
feeling well lately?

585
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,600
Fret not.

586
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,800
I'll keep treating you,

587
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,880
and you will

588
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,280
recover soon.

589
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,560
How revolting children are.

590
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,440
Time to die!

591
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,400
Warrior lady, save me!

592
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,960
Where do you think you're going, demon?

593
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,200
You've been targeting lads, stealing souls,

594
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,800
and have already taken dozens of lives.

595
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,320
Now that you've fallen into my hands,

596
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,200
you'll face justice for your crimes.

597
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,120
You?

598
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,160
What can a

599
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,560
mere demon hunter do?

600
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,120
Stay out of this!

601
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,720
Still showing no remorse?

602
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,120
Then don't expect any mercy!

603
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,160
Please spare me!

604
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:42,880
If you

605
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,200
spare my life,

606
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
I'll accept

607
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,600
whatever terms you propose.

608
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,440
How interesting,

609
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,480
agreeing before hearing my terms?

610
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,360
I've committed too many sins.

611
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,200
Please, forgive me...

612
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,280
Hand over your core.

613
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,000
Please reconsider, my lady!

614
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,320
You must understand,

615
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,440
this core is

616
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,480
our most sacred possession,

617
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,080
the crystallization of our cultivation.

618
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,680
It takes immense effort to form,

619
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
and if we give up our core,

620
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,400
all our powers

621
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,960
will vanish with it.

622
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,960
Your core or your life.

623
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Choose.

624
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,280
Remember,

625
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,840
there won't be a next time.

626
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,960
Thank you for saving me, warrior lady.

627
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,840
You don't recognize me?

628
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,120
I only met you two days ago,

629
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,040
and didn't even learn your name.

630
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,320
How could I possibly know you?

631
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,960
Never mind, I mistook you for another.

632
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,520
Why are you alone

633
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,920
in such a remote place?

634
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,280
I'm a study companion to the

635
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,600
owner of the largest herbs shop in Wuzhang.

636
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,120
Since when does a

637
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,640
herbs shop owner need a study companion?

638
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,320
Lady, let me explain.

639
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,360
My master studies

640
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,280
at Qingcheng Academy.

641
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,400
Recently,

642
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,240
following a classmate's suggestion,

643
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,440
he insisted on dropping school

644
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,840
to focus on his herb business.

645
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,840
He shared these ideas with me,

646
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,600
encouraging me to

647
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,880
follow my passions.

648
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,200
I came to the outskirts to document

649
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,240
the characteristics of various plants,

650
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,640
planning to compile them into a book.

651
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,760
Who knew I'd encounter such misfortune.

652
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,680
This lad,

653
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,360
even without memories,

654
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,120
his nature remains unchanged.

655
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,800
Pardon me, lady?

656
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,040
It's nothing.

657
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,720
You mentioned

658
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,600
your master studies at Qingcheng Academy.

659
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,640
That classmate who convinced him...

660
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,720
The son of the Prime Minister, Kunlun.

661
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Do you know him?

662
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,640
Not at all.

663
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,360
Listen,

664
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,840
it's not safe out here.

665
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,480
If you're done with your business,

666
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,160
you should head back soon.

667
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,200
I'll leave now.

668
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,000
Nobody seems

669
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,720
to care about the evil demons

670
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,880
wreaking havoc in the outskirts.

671
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,760
After I return, if they ask,

672
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,120
they'll surely mock me again.

673
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,320
It's alright.

674
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,920
If anyone asks,

675
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,040
simply say

676
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,560
a lady came to your rescue.

677
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,800
Warrior lady,

678
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,640
would you tell me your name?

679
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,160
Muxian.

680
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,040
These demon-related incidents

681
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,040
are getting out of hand.

682
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,000
Indeed.

683
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,880
We got four cases this month alone.

684
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,920
Have you noticed any patterns

685
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,600
among these cases?

686
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,840
Honestly,

687
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,720
I don't see any connection between them.

688
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,840
You're hopeless!

689
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,920
Let's review the first case.

690
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,520
The first victim

691
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,160
was a notorious local thug.

692
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,240
He was untouchable even by law enforcement,

693
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,840
had a reputation for terrorizing the city,

694
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
but ended up killed by a mantis pixie,

695
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,560
throat pierced clean through.

696
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,040
The second case?

697
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,480
A serial sex offender

698
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,360
who used homemade poisons

699
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,280
to drug and assault women

700
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,680
before disposing of their bodies.

701
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,720
An aconite pixie seduced him

702
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,640
in drinking poison and died.

703
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,600
The third case

704
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,680
was that violent thug

705
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,760
who'd beat up anyone

706
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,760
servants, waitstaff,

707
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,200
even his own parents.

708
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,080
A bear pixie ripped him to shreds,

709
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
left him completely disfigured.

710
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
And the fourth victim,

711
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,920
another infamous thug

712
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,680
who'd escaped justice.

713
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,240
People literally celebrated his death.

714
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,320
But they all got what they deserved.

715
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,200
The world's better off without them.

716
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,320
That's precisely what concerns me.

717
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,400
This could be a clever diversion.

718
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,600
Why is it that every victim

719
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,320
happens to be a notorious criminal?

720
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,280
But these demons were victims themselves

721
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,240
before taking revenge.

722
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,560
Surely it's just a coincidence.

723
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,040
Why are you reading so much into it?

724
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,600
Their motives might be justified,

725
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,920
but it's all too perfect.

726
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,520
Where's Kunlun? Has he returned?

727
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,720
Yes, just returned. He's grounded.
