[Love Never Fails]

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,750
[EP15]

4
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,640
[Keeping your memories]

5
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,880
[already broke the rules.]

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,520
[And he keeps calling for me!]

7
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,919
[Sir,]

8
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,600
[what am I supposed to do?]

9
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,440
[I'm fine.]

10
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,800
Sir, what's going on?

11
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,360
She… came to me.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,079
Sir,

13
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,160
you know me,

14
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,040
I'm the Official Chrysanthemum,

15
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
I'm no coward.

16
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,480
If you need me,

17
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,520
I'd walk through fire for you…

18
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,600
She may not remember me,

19
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,280
but she still falls for me.

20
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,600
Forget what I said.

21
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,360
Am I just

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,720
doomed to fate with her?

23
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,320
There's something

24
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
I probably shouldn't say…

25
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,960
When starting like that,

26
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,120
you have to get it off your chest.

27
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,280
Here's the thing:

28
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,720
A second chance is rarer

29
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,720
than the first hello.

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,640
You've done all you could, but

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,800
Hongning still showed up.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,160
That means…

33
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,880
This lifetime,

34
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,040
I can't mess it up again.

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
If I accept her,

36
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
I'll break her heart.

37
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,640
Well, you've broken mine.

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,760
You're blocking both ends,

39
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,840
talking in circles!

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,480
Wait…

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,920
Sir,

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
how are you so sure

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,079
Hongning still has feelings for you?

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,800
I mean

45
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,520
how do you know

46
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
she's still into you?

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,640
She said

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,440
seeing me makes her heart race.

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,440
And I'm all she thinks about.

50
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,480
Right…

51
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,880
that sounds like her.

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,560
No!

53
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,160
If I accept her,

54
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
I'll definitely break her heart!

55
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,480
Then if that's how you feel,

56
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:07,960
why not…

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,280
But if I reject her,

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,720
I'll still break her heart!

59
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,480
Ugh, I'm at a loss for words!

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,960
Every time you meet Hongning,

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
you turn into a teenager!

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,320
Sir,

63
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,600
you say she

64
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,519
shouldn't stay with you,

65
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
but where's the

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
follow-through?

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,400
No!

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,440
Hold on!

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,720
You kept cutting me off,

70
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
I got worked up,

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
don't take it the wrong way!

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,840
Forget it.

73
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,600
This isn't Floralia Palace.

74
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,320
Right,

75
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,960
this isn't Floralia Palace.

76
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,200
Just spit it out.

77
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,080
Sir,

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,960
this all

79
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,360
comes down to you.

80
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,280
Think about it.

81
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,320
What did she

82
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,800
like about you before?

83
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
She said I was good-looking!

84
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,360
Toothbrush!

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,360
It poked my throat!

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,200
That's it!

87
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,200
Okay then,

88
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,440
we start with your looks.

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,840
[If she likes your face,]

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,200
[don't give her that face.]

91
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,760
[Let her live Shuixian's story,]

92
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,120
[and she didn't learn a thing!]

93
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,800
[She just remembered
Duanfei painted for Shuixian!]

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,200
[The peach tree beams so red.
How brilliant are its flowers!]

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,000
The maiden's getting red.
Good for the nuptial bowers.

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,840
The peach tree beams so red.
How plentiful its fruits!

97
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
[The maiden's getting red.
She's the family's root.]

98
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,120
[The peach tree beams so red.
Its leaves are manifold.]

99
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,520
Go past Master's chamber,

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,760
it's the dungeon.

101
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,280
[She's the family's root.]

102
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
[The peach tree beams so red.
Its leaves are manifold.]

103
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,840
What else does she like about you?

104
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,440
She said I'm great at Arts.

105
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,000
What Arts?

106
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,880
How did the sword fall?

107
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,480
The Arts are gone too.

108
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,159
Hongning,

109
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,480
can you stop hovering around me?

110
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm not hovering!

111
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,880
I'm learning from you, Master.

112
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,240
Since I got hurt,

113
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,640
I can't use my sword,

114
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,920
and my Arts are rusty too.

115
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,760
Honestly,

116
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,360
I've got nothing to teach you.

117
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,680
No!

118
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,280
That's fine.

119
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,120
I don't know anything yet anyway.

120
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,040
Even just watching you practice your sword

121
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,880
is still helpful.

122
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm cultivating under you from now on.

123
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,400
[Does Hongning]

124
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,920
[really wants to stick with me?]

125
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,240
Fine, we'll train another day.

126
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
Take care, Master!

127
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,320
[As long as I stay with Master,]

128
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,760
[I'll find a shot to sneak]

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,440
[into the dungeon and find Ningmeng!]

130
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,640
Hongning,

131
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,840
although you're not officially

132
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,040
a disciple of Cangwu Academy,

133
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,280
you should make the best of it.

134
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,320
Helping your seniors out

135
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
is part of your job,

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,040
it's your duty too.

137
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,320
So from today on,

138
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,880
you'll be cleaning all of

139
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,720
the Cangwu Academy.

140
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,000
I love cleaning!

141
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,400
[Just to catch one more glimpse of me,]

142
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,440
[you're really willing to]

143
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,880
[work day and night?]

144
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,760
[Sweeping's the perfect excuse]

145
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,160
[to go find Ningmeng in the dungeon!]

146
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,840
[Oh, Hongning,]

147
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,880
[why didn't you think of this sooner?]

148
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,640
[Could it really be]

149
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
[fate keeping her here?]

150
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,120
Smells amazing!

151
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,760
Hey, junior.

152
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,480
Time to eat.

153
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,640
Senior…

154
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,200
Wait!

155
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,960
You've been eating like a horse lately!

156
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,520
I'm still growing, alright?

157
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,000
You're huge already!

158
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,280
No more to grow.

159
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,560
Eat up.

160
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,680
Your words

161
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,560
compromise your efforts.

162
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,040
Even a good thing

163
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,640
sounds awkward

164
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,960
coming from you.

165
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,680
Why are you so picky?

166
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,400
I bring you food every day,

167
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,760
and I've gotta be polite too?

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,040
Nice talk

169
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,960
and I'll have a

170
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,320
good appetite.

171
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,040
I…

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,320
Fine.

173
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,440
Then…

174
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,360
Miss,

175
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,320
have a bite?

176
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
Ma'am?

177
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,960
Your Highness,

178
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
just take a bite.

179
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,680
Thanks for looking after me these days.

180
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,120
You helped me out,

181
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,800
why not go all the way

182
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,080
and let me leave?

183
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,760
I won't let you off!

184
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,440
You're keeping me…

185
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
You're keeping me locked up here,

186
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,920
what's the point?

187
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,040
I…

188
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,840
I…

189
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,640
I just want you to eat more

190
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,400
and put on some weight!

191
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,280
So when I turn you in,

192
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,960
they'll think

193
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,400
I caught some big pixie!

194
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,040
Why else

195
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,160
would I treat you so nicely?

196
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,520
Still the same!

197
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,680
Not any change!

198
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,720
Still such a pain,

199
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,720
still so annoying!

200
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,360
Only a fool would send you back!

201
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,440
Right back into the jaws

202
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,840
of those heavenly soldiers?

203
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,040
His spirit power?

204
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,560
Junior,

205
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,760
I'm almost starting to pity you.

206
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,440
Pity me?

207
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,360
Didn't you see Master

208
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,880
personally training Hongning?

209
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,320
That's…

210
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,040
'cause Master's scared Hongning's too slow

211
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,760
and might drag us down.

212
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,720
True!

213
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,080
Someone as sharp as you

214
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,760
doesn't need that kind of help.

215
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,360
[To get rid of Hongning,]

216
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,560
[I need to play the long game.]

217
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,880
Anyway,

218
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,840
let me ask you.

219
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,560
Are foxes just

220
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,440
born ungrateful?

221
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,640
That's not true!

222
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,560
Look at Senior Lujiu, he's so

223
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
loyal to Master!

224
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,760
Then what do foxes like?

225
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,520
No clue.

226
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,840
Why ask me?

227
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,280
Go ask Senior Lujiu.

228
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,120
Good point.

229
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,360
No idea when he's

230
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
coming back though.

231
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,160
Master,

232
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,760
I lost Hongning.

233
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,720
It's my fault, Master!

234
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,680
All my fault!

235
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,040
Master!

236
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,160
Sir,

237
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,480
can I have one last hug?

238
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,840
I only came

239
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,240
to congratulate you on your wedding

240
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,680
with NCR Matriarch.

241
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,880
Sir,

242
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,080
I don't want to be your Empress anymore.

243
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,080
[Hongning,]

244
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,200
[in the last life,]

245
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,880
[I broke my promise to you.]

246
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,800
[Did fate bring us back]

247
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,640
[so I could make things right?]

248
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,920
[I don't know if I'm helping you]

249
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,200
[or hurting you all over again.]

250
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,240
Master, what's wrong?

251
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:05,920
I'm fine.

252
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,400
Keep training.

253
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,640
Master,

254
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,320
why is your trauma

255
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,080
acting up again?

256
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,280
It's fine.

257
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,880
I'll be okay after some rest.

258
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,880
Oh right, Master,

259
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,960
there's something else.

260
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,360
Lately some of the disciples

261
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,120
have been talking behind our backs.

262
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,200
I know.

263
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,280
Hongning isn't a formal disciple,

264
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,560
and her foundation is weak.

265
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,560
I've been

266
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,800
too strict with her.

267
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,400
Master,

268
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,960
I mean…

269
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,400
With some many disciples in the Academy,

270
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,800
you've only ever taught "him" alone.

271
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,040
The others might be jealous.

272
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,200
Could give "him" a hard time

273
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,800
back in the dorms?

274
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,720
She's still living in the dorms?

275
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,480
Hongning,

276
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,240
why are you wrapped up like a burrito?

277
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,040
Aren't you hot?

278
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,640
Not at all.

279
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,400
Maybe I'm just naturally cold
and can't stand the chill.

280
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,320
Then let me cuddle you,

281
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,480
might help you cool down.

282
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,160
Come on!

283
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,920
No need!

284
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,080
It's okay really!

285
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,920
I…

286
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,560
I'm not cold, really!

287
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,680
What are you looking at?

288
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I just finished a map of Cangwu.

289
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,080
A map of Cangwu?

290
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,560
Show me.

291
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,760
Here you go.

292
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,000
You made this? That's amazing!

293
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,800
Of course.

294
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,560
Never underestimate

295
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,080
a constable's skills and instincts.

296
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Can I keep it?

297
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,400
I get lost all the time.

298
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,000
Sure thing!

299
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,600
Thanks!

300
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,680
No prob.

301
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,560
Senior Bailing's pet corner.

302
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,440
He keeps pets?

303
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,280
Heard he's got a fox.

304
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,160
Oh and

305
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,200
don't tell anyone about this!

306
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,000
It's his secret!

307
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,600
I won't.

308
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,760
Thanks!

309
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,280
You sure know a lot.

310
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,680
Told you,

311
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,600
never doubt my ability.

312
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Since everyone

313
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,040
thinks I treat Hongning differently,

314
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,120
then maybe

315
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,200
she should get her own room.

316
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,800
Just to avoid disputes.

317
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,040
Wenxin, go check

318
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,760
if the new dorm's got enough blankets

319
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,880
and firewood.

320
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,640
If not, get more from the shed.

321
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,280
I'm off the grid for a bit.

322
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,960
This is…

323
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,000
Hongning,

324
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,400
I think Master really cares about you.

325
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,240
Does he?

326
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,400
The other seniors said

327
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,720
Master never teaches anyone personally.

328
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,600
But with you, he does…

329
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,080
That's because he's always
off the grid cultivating,

330
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,640
and he worries I'd slow Cangwu down.

331
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,200
Is that true?

332
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,160
Isn't it?

333
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,520
If someone

334
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,720
really cared about you,

335
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,520
how could he not notice

336
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,040
if you're eating right

337
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,840
or sleeping okay,

338
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,320
only pushing you on school stuff?

339
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,240
Anyway,

340
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,080
I just wanna

341
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,560
hog this big bed all to myself,

342
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,040
so comfy!

343
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,840
Dream on!

344
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,960
Hongning.

345
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,240
Senior Bailing, what are you doing here?

346
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,760
Master says

347
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,440
this room's too small for Hongning,

348
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,240
and "he" is moving to the new dorms.

349
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,720
[Not much time left for you!]

350
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,840
Message delivered,

351
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,760
go or don't, I don't care

352
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,960
I'm going!

353
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,560
Now!

354
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,520
So we're not cuddling anymore?

355
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,320
Why is this fox so dramatic?

356
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,040
What if she doesn't eat?

357
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,000
What now?

358
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Bailing…

359
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,160
[will he ever learn to lock a door?]

360
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,000
Great, now we're both stuck.

361
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
If you hadn't dragged me here,

362
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,640
this wouldn't have happened!

363
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,840
Why is everything I do wrong?

364
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,480
You and Master are both impossible!

365
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,440
Forget it.

366
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,640
Go ahead and eat.

367
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,400
Not hungry.

368
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,640
I really don't get you!

369
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,960
Why are you always so hard on yourself?

370
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,640
You're starving,

371
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,240
but still acting all proud!

372
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,880
Your hand's badly hurt,

373
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,440
but all you think about is picking

374
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,560
fights with those heavenly soldiers!

375
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,800
What?

376
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,200
Do you hate comfort?

377
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,760
Life's not always comfy!

378
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,640
When duty calls,

379
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,040
comfort means nothing!

380
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,480
Who says that?

381
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,040
First of all,

382
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,520
to be yourself,

383
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,760
you've got to love yourself.

384
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,560
Only then can you handle

385
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,320
real duty and responsibility.

386
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,320
Also being comfy

387
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,920
doesn't mean being spoiled.

388
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,840
It means listening to your heart,

389
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
that's how you find peace.

390
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,760
If I hadn't heard it myself, I'd

391
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,800
never believe those words came from you.

392
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,080
Well…

393
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,120
I've got loads of charm!

394
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,520
Take your time to feel it out.

395
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,120
Why are you still standing there?

396
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,200
Go and have your meal!

397
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,160
Meal?

398
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,920
You mean your spirit power or the rabbit?

399
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm an immortal,

400
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,480
and you're a pixie, how can you

401
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,600
gave away spirit power like snacks?

402
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,080
Because I want to. Problem?

403
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,320
Here.

404
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,760
Take it back!

405
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,000
Later,

406
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,880
when I truly need it,

407
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,080
you can give it back.

408
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,320
Deal!

409
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,800
When awake,

410
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,080
you chatter nonstop.

411
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,360
Being quiet like this

412
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,440
isn't so bad.

413
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,600
Upon closer look...

414
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,040
you're not unattractive.

415
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,800
Why haven't seen Master today?

416
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,560
I heard he's gone off-grid for recuperation.

417
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,320
He won't emerge for some time.

418
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,640
Recuperation?

419
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,080
People say he suffered grave injuries.

420
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,280
The cause remains unclear.

421
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,400
The only one who knows

422
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,720
is Brother Lujiu

423
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,640
He's a fox pixie

424
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,880
who's followed

425
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,640
Master loyally.

426
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,560
Then why

427
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,520
have I never seen Brother Lujiu?

428
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,880
They say

429
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,000
Master dispatched him

430
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,800
on some secret mission

431
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,240
that's still ongoing.

432
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,040
I'll head out now.

433
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,360
Fo... Brother Lujiu?

434
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,520
You're back!

435
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,320
You're back!

436
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,720
If I catch you slacking off again,

437
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,120
I'll toss you into the alchemy furnace!

438
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,080
Do you realize

439
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,120
slacking on duties

440
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,960
might cause mistakes!

441
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,320
Come on!

442
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,360
Come on! Hurry!

443
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,960
Brother Lujiu.

444
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,120
He's Lujiu?

445
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,160
What are they doing?

446
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,040
Such a commotion.

447
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,880
Utterly ruleless!

448
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,840
Brother Lujiu.

449
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,600
This is

450
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,880
the world's most potent poison

451
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,800
I've researched for ages.

452
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
The only one of its kind in the realm.

453
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,280
Whoever encounters it faces doom.

454
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,400
-Wanna have a...
-Brother Lujiu.

455
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,200
Brother Lujiu.

456
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,040
No, no, no thanks!

457
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,920
Brother Lujiu

458
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,720
Greetings, Brother Lujiu!

459
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,160
Lujiu is back?

460
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,640
Brother Lujiu?

461
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,760
Brother Lujiu,

462
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,080
what's wrong?

463
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Kneeling in penance again?

464
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,320
Actually, I came to

465
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,040
ask you something.

466
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,360
Since you're also a fox—

467
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,720
besides rabbits,

468
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,120
what's your usual diet?

469
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,400
Owls?

470
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,000
Or rats?

471
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,800
Scram.

472
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,360
Then tell me

473
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,000
your hobbies.

474
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,200
Like

475
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,000
tree-climbing?

476
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,920
Burrow-digging?

477
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,880
Or maybe mud-rolling?

478
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,800
Get lost!

479
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,240
Still that fiery temper

480
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,240
after all these years!

481
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,160
One more thing—

482
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,000
I took

483
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,880
your goose-down quilt

484
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,040
in your room to Hongning

485
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,360
per Master's order.

486
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,680
Not stolen!

487
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,960
Though I can't fathom

488
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,240
what madness drives

489
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,120
Master's favoritism.

490
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,640
Whatever! It doesn't matter!

491
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,880
I'm going to Master now.

492
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,240
Persevere!

493
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:45,960
Persevere!

494
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,880
Hongning?

495
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,720
Hongning!

496
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,520
Master, are you inside?

497
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,160
Master! Master! Master!

498
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,880
Enter.

499
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,760
Master,

500
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,840
you're in seclusion?

501
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,040
What do you think?

502
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,840
Well,

503
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,120
I have something to report.

504
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,360
Prepared to explain

505
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,200
your quintessence loss?

506
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,600
You already know what I'd say?

507
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,080
Let me clarify!

508
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,920
Here's what happened:

509
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,760
Down the mountain,

510
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,840
I encountered

511
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,800
a 10,000-year-old herb pixie.

512
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,480
She disguised as a food vendor.

513
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,040
I initially didn't recognize it!

514
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,680
Taking pity,

515
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,760
I bought medicinal soup.

516
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,000
Who'd imagine

517
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,320
lethal poison within!

518
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,520
Thus I lost 200 years' quintessence.

519
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,480
Then I

520
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,760
battled her for three days!

521
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,920
That's the truth.

522
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
What did the herb pixie look like?

523
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,360
The herb pixie...

524
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,880
Well, the herb pixie...

525
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
When she revealed

526
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,840
her true form,

527
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,560
she was over six feet tall

528
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,280
with massive wings,

529
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,840
glowing eyes,

530
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,000
and a body burly as a black bear!

531
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,320
Didn't you claim being dragged

532
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,400
into forced marriage that day?

533
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,800
Yes!

534
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,640
The village chief...

535
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,160
he was...

536
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,760
Enough.

537
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,440
Drop the act.

538
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,080
Speak truth.

539
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,280
Master,

540
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
I'll be frank.

541
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,800
A lone white hare darts east and west,

542
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,200
glancing back in unrest.

543
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,800
New clothes may shine brighter,

544
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,400
but old...

545
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,720
Close the door behind you.

546
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,280
Master,

547
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,600
I just wanted to say—

548
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,800
you dote so on that new disciple,

549
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,560
could you spare me some kindness?

550
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:12,960
Out with it.

551
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,680
More martial manuals?

552
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,720
Actually, I just need some money.

553
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,600
Why do you start craving money

554
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,960
after descending the mountain?

555
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,560
Master,

556
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,720
didn't you always

557
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,160
teach us that

558
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,400
cultivation requires

559
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,960
worldly experience first?

560
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,840
By mortal standards,

561
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,040
you've reached

562
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,880
coming-of-age.

563
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,960
You should make your own money.

564
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,040
But Cangwu Academy

565
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,960
never taught me how to do that.

566
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,160
How did Master Wenxin

567
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,520
teach you Qi cultivation?

568
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,280
Enlightenment.

569
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,520
[Why is it so tough]

570
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,679
[to get some money]

571
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,320
[to make the little fox happy?]

572
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,760
Why did you

573
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,159
come here?

574
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
I… Why…

575
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,320
Why? Why?

576
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,600
What is your purpose?

577
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,679
Wh-what purpose?

578
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,400
How did you evade my surveillance?

579
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,320
Evade you?

580
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,239
No!

581
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,520
Don't explain.

582
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,960
I don't want to know.

583
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,239
No excuses.

584
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,520
You… you…

585
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,760
You know me?

586
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,639
I...

587
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,560
I don't know you!

588
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,719
We never met!

589
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,560
Then…

590
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,600
I failed...

591
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,960
to contain you.

592
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,560
Brother Lujiu!

593
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,719
Wh-what're you doing?

594
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Cut it out!

595
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm useless!

596
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,560
I neglected my duty.

597
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,120
I'm useless!

598
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,760
I'm useless!

599
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,240
I'm useless!

600
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,400
What kind of madhouse is Cangwu Academy?

601
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,840
Oh no!

602
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,240
Poor Ningmeng!

603
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,560
Master,

604
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,200
I'm sorry.

605
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,760
I failed to shield you

606
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
from Hongning's approach.

607
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,840
Rest assured,

608
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,520
I'll drive her away

609
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,240
by any means!

610
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,440
No need.

611
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,800
Master!

612
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,080
didn't you decree

613
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,600
to keep her from Cangwu?

614
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,560
Cangwu has been

615
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,440
plagued by pixies.

616
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,960
It's perilous out there.

617
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,520
Hongning's earnest in her cultivation.

618
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,600
Forcing her departure now

619
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,720
would hinder her cultivation path!

620
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,200
But her presence

621
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,880
disrupts your cultivation!

622
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,960
No wonder your seclusion broke!

623
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,680
All this

624
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,520
is my fault!

625
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,920
Master,

626
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm so sorry! Master!

627
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,360
Lujiu,

628
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,520
cry all you want.

629
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,000
Master,

630
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,400
I'm sorry!

631
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,600
It was all on me!

632
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,640
My bad!

633
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,480
Next time you descend the mountain,

634
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,680
purchase more spirit sand and elixirs.

635
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,600
List every item clearly.

636
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,000
No oversights.

637
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,960
Is this all you've got?

638
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,960
Bailing,

639
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,720
are you short on money?

640
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,920
Got more?

641
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,920
None left! Truly!

642
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,720
Truly none left!

643
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,960
Then shut up!

644
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,520
Bailing,

645
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
did you rack up gambling debts

646
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,840
last descent?

647
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,200
Absurd!

648
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,040
I descended to hunt pixies,

649
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,840
not frivolous activities.

650
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,640
Then why the sudden need for money?

651
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,120
Besides,

652
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,320
you can't just

653
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,000
rely on us paupers!

654
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,520
Hey! Look there!

655
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,080
Master gave him

656
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,680
a private chamber

657
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,840
with goose-down quilts,

658
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,960
silk pillows,

659
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
and something like that.

660
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,760
All sellable luxuries!

661
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,840
Outrageous!

662
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,640
Master won't spare me a copper,

663
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,760
yet spoils him rotten?

664
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,560
Exactly!

665
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,560
Since Hongning arrived,

666
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,560
he struts through courtyards unchecked!

667
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,440
Strut before me?

668
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,320
He'd better check

669
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,080
if his legs bend sideways!

670
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,280
That's very like you to say that!

671
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,680
Time for disciplinary lessons.

672
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,600
What's up?

673
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,000
Hongning!

674
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,040
Perfect timing!

675
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,680
Here you are!

676
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,960
Deliver these for me!

677
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,560
Thanks!

678
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,960
Where to?

679
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,440
Hongning,

680
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,520
you're back.

681
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,400
These are our soiled robes.

682
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,160
Wash them for me.

683
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,920
I... I...

684
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,200
I injured my hands during

685
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
dawn cultivation.

686
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:19,880
It hurts!

687
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,960
But I just...

688
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,000
I'll head out now!

689
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,040
Hold it steady.

690
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,800
Mine! Mine!

691
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,200
My appetite's grown recently.

692
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:08,760
Thanks

693
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,160
I…

694
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,840
Hongning,

695
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,280
they bully you openly.

696
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,720
Aren't you angry?

697
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,800
Not at all.

698
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,240
They're bigger guys.

699
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,600
burn more energy,

700
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,520
It makes sense they eat more.

701
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,840
If I pick fights over

702
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,240
such small stuff,

703
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,360
I'll just become their target.

704
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,560
To make them accept me,

705
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,320
I must show them my worth first.

706
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,320
I didn't expect

707
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,400
someone your age

708
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,720
to think like this.

709
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,960
When I was young,

710
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,080
village kids always picked on me.

711
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,360
Later though,

712
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,800
we became friends.

713
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
But right now,

714
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,600
my main focus is becoming

715
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,040
Cangwu's official disciple!

716
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,280
Then you won't

717
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,160
mind if I sit

718
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,480
farther away?

719
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Gather round!

720
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,960
Hongning's too nice that

721
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,720
I can't bring myself to bully him.

722
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,080
It's no fun!

723
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,840
Totally!

724
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,080
I tossed my dirty laundry at him.

725
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,800
He not only washed it,

726
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,600
but also patched up

727
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,200
the holes too!

728
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:45,760
Really?

729
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,720
Yes! Seriously!

730
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,080
He cultivates hard, got natural talent.

731
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,000
Bet he'll become

732
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,880
an official disciple sooner or later.

733
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,280
Fair point.

734
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,440
Though Master favors him,

735
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,000
he remains humble.

736
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,280
[This can't continue.]

737
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
[I must devise a plan.]

738
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,320
You've all heard of

739
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Cangwu Academy's Three Trials, right?

740
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,440
First—capture pixies.

741
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,320
Second—obtain magical tools.

742
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,120
Third—

743
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,960
find the sacred

744
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,520
Nine-Leaf Spirit Fungus.

745
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,560
Complete any one

746
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,640
of these trials,

747
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,440
and you'll earn Master's reward.

748
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,600
Becoming official disciples?

749
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,080
It won't take long!

750
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,920
So today, your mission is to

751
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,160
search Mt. Cangwu's backwoods

752
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,760
for the Nine-Leaf Spirit Fungus.

753
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,400
Nine-Leaf Spirit Fungus?

754
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,520
Legends say it's capable of

755
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,920
resurrecting the dead

756
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,320
and even pulling souls back

757
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,360
from the underworld!

758
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,160
Exactly.

759
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,120
So…

760
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,440
if I find the Nine-Leaf Spirit Fungus,

761
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,840
does that mean I can become

762
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,880
an official disciple?

763
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,240
Absolutely.

764
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,280
And if I become a disciple,

765
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,800
can I explore every corner

766
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,120
of Mt. Cangwu?

767
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,600
Of course!

768
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,360
Wait, Brother Bailing!

769
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,600
I've heard these woods

770
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,040
crawl with fierce beasts.

771
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,640
No worries!

772
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,200
Mt. Cangwu is sacred ground.

773
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,160
Any creatures here are

774
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,880
aligned with righteous cultivation.

775
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,840
Here!

776
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,800
Communication talismans for you both.

777
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,000
One each.

778
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,040
Reach out to me

779
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,360
if there's danger.

780
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,640
No need to fret—

781
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,560
this is just a trial run for

782
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,720
your official disciple status.

783
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,840
Understood!

784
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,200
Brother Bailing,

785
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,040
honestly,

786
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,400
my cultivation luck's too weak to

787
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,640
find the Nine-Leaf Spirit Fungus.

788
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,560
You catch on quick!

789
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,040
You flatter me.

790
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,080
Head back then.

791
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,280
Really?

792
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,720
Thanks, Brother Bailing.

793
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,560
Could Hongning get into any trouble?

794
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
What trouble?

795
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
I'm right here!

796
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,080
You don't trust me?

797
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,360
Of course, I do.

798
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,640
I'll take my leave.

799
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,240
Go on then!

800
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,560
That's what you get for stealing my thunder!
