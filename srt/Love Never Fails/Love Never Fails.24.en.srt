00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:54,600
24.

4
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,590
25.

5
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:09,850
So,

6
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,250
what did you do this time?

7
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,770
Enough with the stern face.

8
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,050
You're even stricter than my father.

9
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,090
What happened?

10
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,890
Well, you know...

11
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,850
the tutor couldn't stand me,

12
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,010
so he kicked me out.

13
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,970
What did you do this time?

14
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,090
I was wronged.

15
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,690
I didn't do anything.

16
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,250
I just...

17
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,370
What?

18
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,610
I just...

19
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,370
helped other students

20
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,170
find what they

21
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,690
truly seek in this life.

22
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:47,970
Like?

23
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,770
Like digging up herbs

24
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,170
or performing lion dances and such.

25
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,450
Kunlun,

26
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,690
Among four great academies,

27
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,250
you've been expelled 3 times in half a month.

28
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,570
What are you trying to do?

29
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,090
My ambitions lie elsewhere.

30
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,090
You know that.

31
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,490
Jinxiu,

32
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,610
you didn't come just

33
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,890
to ask about my studies,

34
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,170
did you?

35
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,210
Don't you

36
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,050
usually worship

37
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,810
at the Matriarch Temple?

38
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,690
Noticed anything strange?

39
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,730
Why suddenly care about the Matriarch?

40
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,690
Listen,

41
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,410
don't you dare scheme against her.

42
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,850
Otherwise, even if we are brothers,

43
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,810
I'll will turn

44
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,890
against you and make you

45
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,610
my sworn enemy.

46
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,250
Could you stop copying Lujiu's idioms?

47
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,810
So pretentious.

48
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,250
Lately, the city's seen

49
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,610
fewer cases

50
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,930
of demons harming people.

51
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,730
But this month, there were four cases

52
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,570
of good demon punishing evildoers.

53
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,410
You suspect

54
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,130
they aren't coincidences?

55
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,890
That the Matriarch might be involved?

56
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,690
It makes sense

57
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,050
that she takes action

58
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,130
herself.

59
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,290
But as a goddess,

60
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,010
why does she go to such lengths?

61
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,970
You might be right.

62
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,050
These demons must

63
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,850
have a mastermind.

64
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,050
If not the Matriarch,

65
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,649
then who?

66
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,250
Demons do good deeds? Sounds great.

67
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,170
Why obsess over it?

68
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,330
But State Wuzhang has no such rules.

69
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,890
What meaning

70
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,050
do these rules hold

71
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,450
for ordinary people?

72
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,290
Disciplining demons like this

73
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,170
isn't something mortals can do.

74
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,770
If the mastermind

75
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,130
isn't a demon,

76
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,610
then it must be...

77
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,890
a demon hunter.

78
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,050
Yes, must be.

79
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,050
You are impossible!

80
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,970
Sage,

81
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,250
I have a question for you.

82
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,250
They descended to endure trials 20 years ago.

83
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,650
Why can't we find

84
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,930
any trace of them or her in this life?

85
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,810
Then do you know

86
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,250
where the Matriarch is now?

87
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,090
When will she appear?

88
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,690
Why are you here?

89
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,530
You're here to ask about Jinxiu,

90
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,170
why can't I

91
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,970
ask about Kunlun?

92
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:55,970
Watch your tone!

93
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,490
If there's nothing else,

94
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,050
I'll take my leave.

95
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,530
[Useless fools!]

96
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,970
My King, Calm down.

97
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,650
You can't even find

98
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,490
the injured Matriarch.

99
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,810
Can't even match

100
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,730
her shadow!

101
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,370
What use are you to me?

102
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,410
My King,

103
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,730
we've searched the entire NCR.

104
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,130
She's likely beyond

105
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,610
our reach now.

106
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,530
Maybe

107
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,450
she's taken

108
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,810
to the Western Sea for trials.

109
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,090
Nonsense!

110
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,610
Just a woman who's been rejected,

111
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,690
where in the Three Realms

112
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,409
could she possibly take refuge?

113
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,530
What about that old man in prison?

114
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,810
As required,

115
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,210
we're keeping him barely alive.

116
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,450
How cold-hearted!

117
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,250
Won't she even care

118
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,490
for her own father?

119
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,610
Pass my order,

120
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,930
smash every Matriarch temple!

121
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,970
Let's see

122
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,730
how long

123
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,690
this wish-granting goddess

124
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,210
can keep hiding!

125
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,330
[Out of Tao, One is born;]

126
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,650
[out of One, Two;]

127
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,130
[out of Two, Three;]

128
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,130
[out of Three, the created universe.]

129
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,610
[The universe carries the yin at its back]

130
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,050
[and the yang in front...]

131
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,690
Kunlun!

132
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,050
Keep your voice down.

133
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,050
I sneaked out from home.

134
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,010
House arrest again?

135
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,370
Obviously!

136
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,850
With all of you gone,

137
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:35,730
the tutor took his anger

138
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,730
out on me,

139
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,409
came to my house

140
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,450
and tattled to my parents!

141
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,610
You asked for it.

142
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,530
Then you shouldn't have listened to me.

143
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,290
Go back.

144
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,490
Return to school right now.

145
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,290
Hmph.

146
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,450
You snuck out

147
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,770
just to see me?

148
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,850
I went to pay respects to the Matriarch

149
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,610
to seek blessings.

150
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,930
Just stopping by.

151
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,850
On my way back,

152
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,730
I thought I'd visit the outskirts...

153
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,930
Don't!

154
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:02,970
Why?

155
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,970
My herb gatherer

156
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,490
was attacked by

157
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,810
a fox spirit there recently

158
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,410
and nearly died.

159
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,770
Luckily, a master

160
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,530
saved him.

161
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,490
Really?

162
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,890
Why would I lie?

163
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,250
Just don't go.

164
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,570
If you're in danger,

165
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,130
you can't expect

166
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,410
the Matriarch to save you.

167
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,130
What's...

168
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,290
that master's name?

169
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,410
It's a woman,

170
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,130
called...

171
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,610
uh...

172
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,810
Muxian.

173
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,690
Muxian?

174
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,610
It's said

175
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,170
she's a demon hunter.

176
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,130
Hey, come back!

177
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,090
Brother.

178
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,050
Jinxiu.

179
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,610
Hear me?

180
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,730
Jinxiu.

181
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,330
[Message dart.]

182
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,130
[Something's wrong.]

183
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,650
[Seal and trap done.]

184
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,690
[Now I'll wait for him.]

185
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,170
[These cores]

186
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,170
[can only sustain your body temporarily.]

187
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,090
[You have little time left for revenge.]

188
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,410
Evil begets evil.

189
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,530
No one escapes judgment.

190
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,570
Sir,

191
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,410
must we rush to the haunted house?

192
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,290
Can't we

193
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,490
rest a bit first?

194
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,850
You insisted on coming.

195
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,930
Rest if you dare risk death.

196
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,090
How could you say that?

197
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,650
I was sent by Prince Xian.

198
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:52,610
Wine.

199
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,010
You...

200
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:53,570
Lujiu.

201
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,090
This area recently had cases

202
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,330
of demons attacking people.

203
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,770
We shouldn't stay long.

204
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,490
Sir, may I have a word?

205
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,530
Our Ministry of Law

206
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,250
only handles urban demon cases.

207
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,530
Why take such risks

208
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,050
investigating this wilderness?

209
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,010
Do you know

210
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,410
how many demon attacks

211
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,730
occurred out here

212
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,930
and how many lives

213
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,050
were lost?

214
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,730
Just this month,

215
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,050
58 attacks

216
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,450
occurred,

217
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,850
and 123 people died.

218
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,690
The civil and judicial ministries

219
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,290
concealed these reports.

220
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,090
Yet we pride ourselves

221
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,810
on solving a few

222
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,930
urban cases.

223
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,930
His Majesty and Prince Xian ignored this.

224
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,610
They must have their reasons.

225
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,370
What reasons?

226
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,410
Officials, gentry,

227
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,250
merchants, city dwellers,

228
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,250
or villagers...

229
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,090
All are mortals.

230
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,650
What difference does status make?

231
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,610
You're right, General.

232
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,450
That haunted house ahead

233
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,450
once had over 20 family members.

234
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,130
Yet half dead in a month.

235
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,250
Exorcists sent there

236
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,730
were either killed or injured.

237
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,170
The survivors had to flee.

238
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,330
Some bold villagers moved in,

239
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,290
defying the rumors.

240
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,770
Next day,

241
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,010
they all somehow died.

242
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,610
That demon must be formidable.

243
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,530
[Who sent that message,]

244
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,170
[and for what purpose?]

245
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,250
[General,]

246
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,570
[must we really stay here?]

247
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,930
[Tidy up the rooms.]

248
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:57,890
[We'll rest here tonight.]

249
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,610
[This way.]

250
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,410
[This place, right?]

251
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,050
[But in this remote wilderness...]

252
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,050
[It's right ahead.]

253
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:16,730
[Let's go.]

254
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,730
Lujiu, mind your manners.

255
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,730
I'm Jinxiu,

256
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,170
from State Wuzhang,

257
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,530
just passing through.

258
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,850
It's getting late,

259
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,490
so we're staying the night.

260
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,650
We'll leave tomorrow.

261
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,330
This place is too crude.

262
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,170
There's a manor downhill.

263
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,530
Go there instead.

264
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,330
Miss, may I ask

265
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,890
if you are the owner of this place?

266
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,010
I'm just lodging here too.

267
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,890
But this place is dangerous.

268
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,770
If you insist on staying,

269
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,730
be careful.

270
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,450
Such being the case,

271
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,530
why are you staying?

272
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,490
What's there to fear?

273
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,650
Even a young lady

274
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,090
dares stay here.

275
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,610
There are so many of us.

276
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,570
Even if there's a demon,

277
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,490
so what?

278
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,770
Maybe

279
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:11,890
that demon

280
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,330
is some delicate beauty.

281
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,810
I'd love to meet her.

282
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,530
I wish she'd show up.

283
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,130
Go clean up now.

284
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,090
Let's go.

285
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,610
Come on, guys.

286
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,010
I think

287
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,090
someone committed

288
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,210
murders here

289
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,490
and blamed

290
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,010
demons.

291
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,810
It's merely rumor.

292
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,090
[Here,]

293
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,050
[cheers.]

294
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,010
[Now, let's drink.]

295
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,010
[It'll help us warm up.]

296
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,130
[Guys,]

297
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,210
[don't stop.]

298
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,410
[Come on, keep drinking.]

299
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:07,890
[Here.]

300
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,330
I'm Wang Hu,

301
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,090
from the capital.

302
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,930
We are all drinking outside.

303
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,930
Why are you

304
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,130
staying here alone?

305
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,970
If you're in trouble,

306
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:54,970
just say the word.

307
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,890
As long as it's within my power,

308
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,490
I'll help however I can.

309
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,170
Thanks.

310
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,450
I may be untalented,

311
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,089
but my family's well-off.

312
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:15,730
And I'm working for Prince Xian.

313
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:16,849
I have

314
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,130
some influence in the city.

315
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,530
Miss,

316
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,970
if you've nowhere to go,

317
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,010
why not...

318
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,369
Follow you?

319
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,370
You seem lonely

320
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,930
and pitiful,

321
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,970
better find a good man.

322
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,370
My wife is virtuous.

323
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,370
If you are with me,

324
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,690
I promise you'll be well-fed

325
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,010
and well-provided.

326
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:45,890
Alright.

327
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,690
I'll go with you.

328
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,930
Since you've agreed,

329
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,370
why don't we...

330
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,690
Ghost!

331
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,650
[Ghost! A ghost!]

332
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,130
[What's wrong?]

333
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,850
[You must be drunk.]

334
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,490
[That's just a woman.]

335
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,570
[Where's the ghost?]

336
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,170
Where?

337
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,170
Yeah, what ghost?

338
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,250
Are you all blind?

339
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,650
It's right there.

340
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,490
The female ghost.

341
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,170
It's her.

342
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,130
Wang Hu!

343
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,130
You are drunk,

344
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,810
seeing things.

345
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,450
Sir,

346
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,090
I...

347
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,210
I saw her transform!

348
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,450
Since when is my eyesight

349
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,810
so poor?

350
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,570
She's

351
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,370
the ghost haunting

352
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,610
that house.

353
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,090
You bragged about

354
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,130
catching a ghost,

355
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,170
yet you got drunk,

356
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,650
barged into her room,

357
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,010
and now call her a ghost.

358
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,490
Know what?

359
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,250
The ghost is in your heart.

360
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,210
Sir,

361
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,450
think about it.

362
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,970
A young woman

363
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,930
is staying alone in the wilderness.

364
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,850
Everyone here died,

365
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,010
only she survived.

366
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,650
Isn't that strange?

367
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,890
So delicate and pretty,

368
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,890
if not a ghost,

369
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,890
then she must be a demon,

370
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,330
using dark magic to harm people.

371
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:06,930
I'll drag her for questioning!

372
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,570
Don't be rude.

373
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,490
She is a ghost.

374
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,610
Miss, why trick him?

375
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,690
He's the one making noise,

376
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,090
disturbing my peace.

377
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,610
Instead of disciplining your subordinate,

378
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,330
you question me?

379
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,890
Since he's my subordinate,

380
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,490
I have to ask

381
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,170
to avoid being mocked unjustly.

382
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,370
Are you alone here?

383
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,090
Are you interrogating me?

384
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,690
Don't get me wrong.

385
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,490
If someone's pretending to be a ghost,

386
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,890
finding the truth

387
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,410
benefits you, too.

388
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,210
You outnumber me.

389
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,410
If you insist on defending your man,

390
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,690
there's nothing I can do.

391
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,690
But you should know better.

392
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,930
Your man entered my room,

393
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,170
called me a ghost,

394
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,650
and ruined my reputation.

395
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,890
Shouldn't you apologize first?

396
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,810
A man barged into my room at night,

397
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,650
demanding I go with him.

398
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,570
Where did he get such audacity?

399
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,490
I failed to discipline him.

400
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,290
I apologize on his behalf.

401
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,290
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

402
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,410
You don't get cockroaches unless

403
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,450
there's crumbs....

404
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,090
Lujiu.

405
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,890
A stray dog barking

406
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,170
at the moon should know its kennel.

407
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,130
Besides,

408
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,010
trouble exists everywhere.

409
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,610
Why should I hide?

410
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,730
I need rest.

411
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,490
If there's nothing else,

412
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,730
please leave.

413
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,050
[This place is dangerous.]

414
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,930
[Stay vigilant.]

415
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,890
[Do not act alone.]

416
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,810
Come on, drink.

417
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,490
No more.

418
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,090
I can't.

419
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,210
Go away.

420
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,090
Worthless.

421
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,130
Sir.

422
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:45,850
[What happened?]

423
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,250
[Weird.]

424
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,370
[No idea how he died.]

425
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:47,810
[How come...]

426
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,410
[This looks so odd.]

427
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,370
[He died...]

428
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,370
[What should we do?]

429
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,090
[There are]

430
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:54,970
[no wounds on him.]

431
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:55,650
[Yeah.]

432
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,330
[None.]

433
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,250
[No wounds at all.]

434
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,690
[He was just fine last night.]

435
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,730
[Not a single injury.]

436
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,370
How do you know

437
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,490
there's no injury?

438
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,050
They're trained martial artists.

439
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,210
They'd recognize wounds.

440
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,690
He was found like this?

441
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,210
More disheveled than now.

442
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,530
[What do you think?]

443
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,410
In my opinion,

444
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,690
you should leave quickly.

445
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,250
With the killer still at large,

446
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,530
blaming ghosts

447
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,610
plays

448
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,370
right into the killer's hands.

449
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,570
What ghosts?

450
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,610
Just rumors.

451
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,130
I'd like to confront that killer.

452
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,450
Stay if you wish,

453
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,290
but you'll risk your own life

454
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,050
and others'.

455
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,450
So you also believe

456
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,970
it's the work of ghosts?

457
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,330
[Why waste words with her?]

458
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,810
Do you have anything else to say?

459
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,770
You suspect me?

460
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,250
You warned us last night,

461
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,490
clearly intentional.

462
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,250
Wang Hu was strong,

463
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,970
and he offended you.

464
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,010
Your resentment toward him

465
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,410
is logical.

466
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,530
False accusations need no proof,

467
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,770
just your baseless

468
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,170
assumption.

469
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,490
You even know the method.

470
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,770
Wang Hu's disheveled clothes

471
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,170
suggest seduction.

472
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,770
In this place,

473
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,250
you are the only woman.

474
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,970
If not you, then who?

475
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,690
Besides, Wang Hu was right,

476
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,010
what woman

477
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,370
stays alone in the wilderness?

478
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,370
Lujiu,

479
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:05,930
don't be rude.

480
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,850
Do you know our young master

481
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:10,810
is the General of Wuzhang?

482
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,130
I'm just a demon hunter,

483
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,450
traveling alone is normal

484
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,730
and legal.

485
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,090
Who you are

486
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,170
isn't my concern.

487
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,090
I do have doubts,

488
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,890
but your courage to live here alone,

489
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,890
defying rumors,

490
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,610
rivals any man's.

491
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,170
I admire that.

492
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,490
Without evidence,

493
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,130
how could I trouble you?

494
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,090
My man died.

495
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,730
I didn't stop you

496
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,610
examining his body.

497
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,290
But if

498
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,930
you know anything,

499
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,490
please share it.

500
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,010
I'd appreciate it.

501
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,530
[General,]

502
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,290
[that Muxian is suspicious.]

503
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,850
[Why trust her?]

504
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,810
[Though unfamiliar,]

505
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,170
[she feels]

506
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,290
[strangely familiar somehow.]

507
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:19,970
But

508
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:20,930
my intuition says

509
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,930
she's a demon.

510
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,530
Intuition again?

511
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,570
I...

512
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:28,810
Do not harm her.

513
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,930
[Come and take a look.]

514
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,490
Still here?

515
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,730
I wish to talk to you.

516
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:19,610
Sure.

517
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,970
Have we met before?

518
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:26,610
Never.

519
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,970
Yet you feel like

520
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,290
an old acquaintance,

521
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,810
as if we've crossed paths.

522
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,090
I have one of those faces.

523
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,730
Not surprised if you think I look familiar.

524
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,290
I've met many.

525
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,770
If we had history,

526
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,330
I'd remember.

527
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,490
The city's not far away from here.

528
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,330
Perhaps we passed

529
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,210
each other there.

530
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,370
If you insist,

531
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,290
I can't argue.

532
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,010
One thing puzzles me.

533
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,050
You champion justice,

534
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,490
yet ignore urban demons.

535
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,730
Why?

536
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,690
I've never heard of any deaths

537
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,210
from urban demons.

538
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,610
How about

539
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:12,970
Zheng Ke's case?

540
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:14,930
Yes, I have.

541
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,970
To avenge her benefactor, a lotus spirit

542
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,370
drowned the killer.

543
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,250
Do you think

544
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,970
she's a good spirit or a bad one?

545
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,170
Without witnessing it,

546
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,010
I can't say.

547
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:31,850
Alright,

548
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,850
let me explain then.

549
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,410
Zheng Ke murdered for wealth,

550
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,650
then plastered his home

551
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,970
with protective charms

552
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,610
and wore jade amulets

553
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,090
against vengeful spirits.

554
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,450
The lotus spirit saw it,

555
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,050
yet could do nothing.

556
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,050
On the day Zheng Ke died,

557
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,370
his jade pendant was broken,

558
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,890
his protective charms

559
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:53,890
were torn.

560
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,970
Only then could the spirit act.

561
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,050
Who do you think

562
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,970
aided in secret?

563
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,850
Since you've already concluded,

564
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,570
why ask me?

565
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,330
Using spirits

566
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,650
to punish evil.

567
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,850
I believe

568
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:19,930
certain

569
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,850
skilled demon hunters are behind it.

570
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,130
Like

571
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,290
Muxian yourself.

572
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,930
If you find this unreasonable,

573
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,010
you may investigate thoroughly.

574
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,810
Evil demons should be eliminated,

575
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,650
but good ones losing their cultivation

576
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,770
is quite tragic.

577
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,450
Depriving them of power

578
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,690
only to benefit others...

579
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,050
I don't see

580
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,650
why you're telling me this.

581
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,010
If you are seeking

582
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,210
like-minded allies,

583
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,090
you've come to the wrong person.

584
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,690
Good men killing evil demons is justice.

585
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,090
Good demons killing evil men is too.

586
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,650
Instead of hunting demons,

587
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,330
you should find those wicked

588
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,650
and bring them to justice.

589
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,530
Evil demons will be punished,

590
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,050
so will evil men.

591
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,650
I merely commented,

592
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,370
yet you're so sharp-tongued.

593
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,450
I can't tell

594
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,370
what's more dangerous now,

595
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,570
you or the demons.

596
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,090
If you think I'm dangerous,

597
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,810
then leave.

598
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,130
Just joking.

599
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,050
You are this close,

600
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,490
making my heartbeat quicken for sure.

601
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,930
That's palpitations.

602
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,490
Rest will help.

603
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,770
Even these words

604
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,090
feel strangely familiar.

605
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,650
Be careful tonight.

606
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,330
Call me

607
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,210
if you need me.

608
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,650
You only arrived last night too.

609
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,730
Last night, only Wang Hu died.

610
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,210
I warned you to leave,

611
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,450
but you insisted on staying.

612
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,410
I came alone

613
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,770
because I'm prepared.

614
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,170
Be careful.

615
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,250
I'm retiring.

616
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,370
Way too argumentative.

617
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,050
Not charming at all.

618
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,050
You be careful too.

619
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:12,530
Come in.

620
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,010
You complained about a man

621
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,850
barging in your room at night,

622
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,450
what are you

623
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,890
doing now?

624
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,010
Know why

625
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,650
I

626
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,890
avoided you earlier?

627
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,530
Why?

628
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,770
You said

629
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,410
we were acquainted.

630
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,530
Actually, we knew each other in the past life.

631
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,730
We did?

632
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,970
Your grace and wisdom

633
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,050
impress me.

634
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,690
Why not

635
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,250
stay longer and enjoy

636
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,050
each other's company?

637
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,370
It's late.

638
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,170
Please leave.

639
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,410
Why rush?

640
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,490
The night is long,

641
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,410
why not share a bed?

642
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,490
I could entertain you.

643
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,450
I don't share beds.

644
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,450
You're blushing.

645
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,050
So you do

646
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,330
fancy me.

647
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,130
You are not her.

648
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,090
As I thought,

649
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,770
you like this face of mine.

650
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,770
Leave now,

651
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,370
and I'll grant you a quick death.

652
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:02,850
Otherwise,

653
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,330
I will...

654
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,370
How cruel.

655
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,210
After tonight,

656
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,770
there may be no tomorrow.

657
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,850
Here to save him?

658
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,170
Came to collect his corpse,

659
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,969
but could bear

660
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,449
you mimicking me

661
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,889
for such vulgar acts.

662
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,170
He should

663
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,610
like you, huh?

664
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,730
I mirror hearts' desires.

665
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,810
That I became you

666
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,250
proves it.

667
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,570
Nonsense.

668
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,050
Stay here. I'll go after him.

669
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,410
Let your savior stay?

670
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,210
If you go,

671
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,170
you'd be worse off.

672
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,130
You are

673
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,490
so ungrateful.

674
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,450
Dare follow me here?

675
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,730
Sir, what are you doing?

676
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,090
Muxian!

677
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:01,810
Are you hurt?

678
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,050
Put me down.

679
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,170
I can walk myself.

680
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:14,890
Don't move.

681
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,410
You are highly-skilled.

682
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,530
How'd you fall for that spirit's charm?

683
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,210
Because he was mimicking you

684
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,450
and distracting me.

685
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,330
Don't say that.

686
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,450
Give me the medicine.

687
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,570
I'll do it myself.

688
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,610
Stop staring. Go.

689
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,330
Don't play tough.

690
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,290
Untreated,

691
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,330
the wound will fester tomorrow.

692
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,090
Aren't you curious

693
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,090
why I said I'd collect

694
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,090
your corpse?

695
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,170
No.

696
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,450
Why not?

697
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,570
I believe

698
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,290
you won't harm me.

699
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,210
That spirit won't return tonight.

700
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,370
I'll rest now.

701
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:06,970
Please leave.

702
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,730
Alright.
