[Love Never Fails]
[EP20]

3
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,400
I could only find this around here.

4
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,800
Use it to stop the bleeding now.

5
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,380
I'll look for other herbs later.

6
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,660
You seem quite knowledgeable about these.

7
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,580
'Cause I've had my fair share

8
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,780
of injuries.

9
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,620
Why were you injured so often?

10
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,620
A childhood on the road isn't exactly safe.

11
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,220
Oh yeah,

12
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,580
your name is...

13
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,700
I...

14
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,180
Yao will do fine.

15
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,980
Yao...

16
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,500
Lady Yao,

17
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,900
what brought you here

18
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,460
from Xuyun Temple?

19
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,660
Some villains

20
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,180
took over my home.

21
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,420
They're still after me.

22
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,820
I barely escaped.

23
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,420
Villains?

24
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,900
Rest assured,

25
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,100
we'll keep you safe.

26
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,380
No one would dare harm you.

27
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,260
I came here

28
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,020
hoping to find my family.

29
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,380
Together, we can

30
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,660
reclaim our home.

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,780
So this journey is

32
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,580
about finding your family?

33
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,860
I'd be glad to help.

34
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,860
Why show me such kindness?

35
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,620
Growing up alone,

36
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,740
without family...

37
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,900
I know too well how

38
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,300
it feels to have no one to turn to.

39
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,380
I wouldn't wish that loneliness on anyone.

40
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,780
Surely you must

41
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,020
resent your family deeply.

42
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,540
[Father!]

43
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,660
[Did you come to see my training?]

44
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,660
[How dare you address me as father?]

45
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,620
[Father...]

46
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,300
[Listen,]

47
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
[I could never sire a three-tailed fox like you.]

48
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,060
[You have no place]

49
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,459
[among our nine-tailed fox clan!]

50
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,380
[Out of my sight!]

51
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,020
I have no family.

52
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
I've long since forgotten them.

53
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,700
Once your wounds heal,

54
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,700
we'll continue our journey.

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,300
Get some rest.

56
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,020
I'll go find us something to eat.

57
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,780
Baicha.

58
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,580
Hongning.

59
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
Master checked your wounds.

60
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,860
Are you feeling any better?

61
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,580
Much better.

62
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,580
Here, take this medicinal brew.

63
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,340
It'll help with your healing.

64
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,420
Thank you.

65
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,580
Remember that little black snake who

66
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,300
returned with you from the Dragon's Abyss?

67
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,380
He healed remarkably fast

68
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
thanks to this same brew.

69
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,140
Little black snake?

70
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,220
It was odd, really.

71
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,820
He kept calling me "master"

72
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,900
at the Abyss.

73
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,460
Master said it's because of his injury,

74
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,900
something wasn't

75
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,060
quite right up here.

76
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,340
Where is he now?

77
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Ningmeng is keeping an eye on him.

78
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,820
Hongning,

79
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,900
this black snake...

80
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,940
he might be an ancient demonic being.

81
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,980
An ancient demonic being?

82
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,580
[Hongning!]

83
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,500
[Hongning!]

84
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,140
Ningmeng!

85
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,460
The black snake remains unconscious.

86
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,140
Perfect timing!

87
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,940
Let me introduce you to a friend.

88
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,020
Hold on!

89
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,060
How dare you dilute our friendship

90
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,140
by making new friends?

91
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,100
Stop being so jealous!

92
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,100
This is Baicha.

93
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,900
I found him wounded

94
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,100
at the Dragon's Abyss.

95
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,140
Master and I brought him here to recover.

96
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,620
Oh yeah,

97
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,220
Master was looking for you just now.

98
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,700
Take good care of him for me, alright?

99
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,340
Fine, fine,

100
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,020
now get going!

101
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,540
- OK.
- Just go.

102
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,540
Oh, it's you?

103
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,900
Are you the Ningmeng from Mt. Baizhou?

104
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,820
The elder of your clan told me

105
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,220
you're thrown into the Kylin Lair.

106
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,260
How did you manage to escape?

107
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,100
Someone helped me

108
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,460
cheat death.

109
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,140
But why are you here?

110
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,180
I came to watch over Hongning.

111
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,060
When I heard she was at Cangwu,

112
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,860
I couldn't help but worry,

113
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,740
so I came to keep her company.

114
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,740
Baicha,

115
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,620
I don't know why you're here,

116
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,020
but I need to make something clear:

117
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,860
as you can see,

118
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,900
Hongning is now a mere mortal.

119
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,260
She's lost all her previous memories.

120
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,420
She's happy now,

121
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,260
so don't you dare disturb her peace.

122
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,900
Even you take this stance?

123
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,940
She's forgotten everything about

124
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,860
your time together on Mt. Baizhou.

125
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,380
Doesn't that bother you at all?

126
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,060
That's not what matters.

127
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,180
As a true friend,

128
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,300
I only want her to be happy.

129
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,740
Her happiness is all that counts.

130
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,740
Look at all the foolish sacrifices

131
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,820
she made for Jinxiu in her previous life.

132
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,380
Can you stand by and watch her

133
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,940
walk down that same tragic path again?

134
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,940
Whatever happened

135
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,180
in the Celestial Realm,

136
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,420
whatever she endured, I may not know.

137
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:52,620
But look at Hongning now,

138
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,820
though mortal,

139
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,340
she's wise,

140
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,460
courageous, and optimistic.

141
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,380
Isn't that wonderful?

142
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
And master has no memory

143
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,860
of his previous life either.

144
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,500
If fate has brought them together here,

145
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,620
why not trust in heaven's design?

146
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,660
Just let destiny take its course.

147
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,700
Has no memory?

148
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,940
You might want to think again.

149
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,380
What are you getting at?

150
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,980
This master you speak of...

151
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,740
He remembers everything

152
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,340
from his past life.

153
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,900
In fact,

154
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,620
he just came to threaten me.

155
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,820
No, that can't be.

156
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,340
Everyone says that when Emperor Star

157
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,540
undergoes trials, he forgets everything.

158
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,860
Do you really believe that immortals

159
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,820
and demons like us

160
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,260
follow the same rules?

161
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:30,820
Are you that naive

162
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,179
to think they won't use their privileges

163
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,659
to serve their own purposes?

164
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
But...

165
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,020
master is genuinely good.

166
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,900
That's just an act!

167
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,500
Jinxiu is nothing

168
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,620
but a complete hypocrite.

169
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,660
In his past life, he pretended to be kind,

170
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,420
toyed with Hongning's feelings,

171
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,180
falsely promised to marry her,

172
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,740
but in the end, he wed the NCR Matriarch.

173
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,300
He's the reason she ended up in the Demotion Pool.

174
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,820
I've come here

175
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,380
to unmask his true self,

176
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,900
to free you from his web of lies.

177
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,380
Master...

178
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,460
he wouldn't...

179
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,700
Hongning and we all

180
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,900
came from Mt. Baizhou,

181
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,660
and I owe her my life.

182
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,020
She saved me in my darkest hour.

183
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,660
Why would I lie?

184
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,700
In the Kylin Lair,

185
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,260
I endured endless torture.

186
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,060
From other demons there,

187
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,500
I learned that Jinxiu,

188
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,500
during his time as the Punisher,

189
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,140
abused his power by

190
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,420
arbitrarily throwing demons

191
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,300
into the Lair where they're left

192
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,580
to suffer in heavenly fire.

193
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,460
Many of our fellows met mysterious deaths!

194
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,100
That explains all the demons in the dungeon...

195
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,940
Even here,

196
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,980
he continues his old ways.

197
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,060
I came here

198
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,900
to protect Hongning

199
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,020
and innocent pixies like you

200
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,220
from suffering the same fate.

201
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,420
I must go to the dungeon now

202
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,260
and ask those demons...

203
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,380
Hold on!

204
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,180
You won't get any helpful proof.

205
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,820
They're a bunch of unsophisticated demons.

206
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,700
But how can I prove anything then?

207
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,620
I have some leads.

208
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,260
What's that?

209
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,100
The Twin-Headed Serpent.

210
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,580
The... what?

211
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,380
Legend speaks of an ancient serpent.

212
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,540
Its twin heads were mirror images,

213
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,180
one adorned with black scales,

214
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,780
the other with cyan scales.

215
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,860
It served as the Demon King's loyal servant,

216
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,900
journeying through realms,

217
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,740
across the sacred paths of rebirth.

218
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,460
Upon its master's capture,

219
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,020
it fought valiantly against

220
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,900
the celestial troops

221
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,460
for seven days and nights,

222
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
until a divine force split it asunder.

223
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,420
It became two serpents.

224
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,100
One fell into the Kylin Lair,

225
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,380
while the other

226
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,540
simply vanished.

227
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,380
How does this connect to my Master?

228
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,460
I don't know yet.

229
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,940
The legend ends here.

230
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,780
[The Demon King...]

231
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,260
[Hongning...]

232
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,900
[If that black snake awakens,]

233
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,700
[it will surely recognize]

234
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,100
[the cyan serpent eye within me.]

235
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,860
[I must act before that...]

236
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,220
Hongning mentioned

237
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,100
you brought back a black snake.

238
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,140
Yeah, what about it?

239
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,220
It's possible that

240
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,500
he is the one

241
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,500
that vanished long ago.

242
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,020
This way.

243
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,020
This area here

244
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,220
is the prime training ground

245
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,900
for us disciples.

246
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,220
You seem to have a pleasant life.

247
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,460
Has he remained unconscious?

248
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,660
Master has treated him.

249
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,100
He should wake up any time now.

250
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,620
[I knew it...]

251
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,380
[If the black snake is the one from the legend,]

252
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,260
[and he calls Hongning master,]

253
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,660
[then she must be the Demon King]

254
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,980
[that the cyan serpent spoke of.]

255
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,100
[No,]

256
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,700
[she can't be!]

257
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,180
[I have to get her to leave with me.]

258
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,100
I can't go to him again.

259
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,580
If I do, people will

260
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,500
be telling stories about it for ages.

261
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,100
Mortal marriage proposals have their rituals.

262
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,780
How did Duan Fei propose back then?

263
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,260
Why can't I recall the details?

264
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,860
[The mountains sink,]

265
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,820
[the rivers flow,]

266
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,620
[my heart is moved by]

267
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,740
[your companionship through every...]

268
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,060
What rubbish am I reading?

269
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,420
[The first meeting between both families.]

270
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,820
[Choosing the appropriate place.]

271
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,260
[Matters to note during parental meetings.]

272
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,520
[Gifts for the parents' meeting,]

273
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,460
[and...]

274
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,540
No, this isn't right either.

275
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,620
[Through cycles of blossoming and fading,]

276
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,260
[the wild...]

277
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,500
[The Courtship Primer!]

278
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,420
[Feeling happy to meet you,]

279
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,660
[love you, pursue you,]

280
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,820
[date you, test you,]

281
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,820
[please you, flatter you,]

282
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,820
[miss you, longing for you,]

283
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,300
[confess to you, follow you,]

284
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
[beg you, cry for you,]

285
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,460
[and go crazy for you.]

286
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,620
[Marrying you...]

287
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,780
She should understand

288
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,540
that was my way of proposing, right?

289
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,340
If she recalls our past life's history

290
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,140
and says no,

291
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,860
what then?

292
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,060
[Master?]

293
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,380
One moment!

294
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,380
Master,

295
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,100
were you looking for me?

296
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,260
Did I...

297
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,980
look for you?

298
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,500
You weren't?

299
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,100
Yes, I was.

300
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,900
Well...

301
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,780
Do you have something to tell me?

302
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,540
How did you know that?

303
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,140
Just say it, I'll accept whatever it is.

304
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,020
Are you sure?

305
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,340
[Could it be...]

306
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,060
[she knows I want to propose?]

307
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,180
[Tell me the story about]

308
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,220
[that camellia pixie!]

309
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,860
Eat more at dinner.

310
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,300
I had dinner already.

311
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,180
Are the camellias pretty?

312
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,700
Yes, pretty.

313
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,500
Was that a wrong answer?

314
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,820
[Bearing cold snow beneath heaven's gaze,]

315
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,420
[who wouldn't praise the camellia's ways!]

316
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,260
[Camellia's ways!]

317
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,780
[Can't he grasp my hint?]

318
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,380
[What is she getting at?]

319
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,980
[Look there,]

320
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,380
[Master is sitting next to Hongning.]

321
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,420
[Just eat!]

322
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,620
[Enjoy the food!]

323
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,619
This has

324
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,980
the same lovely color as the red camellia.

325
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,660
Carrots are nutritious.

326
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,980
You should have more.

327
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,700
This one

328
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,660
is prettier than the red camellia!

329
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,860
Tomatoes are healthy too.

330
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,220
If you enjoy them,

331
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
I'll ask them to make more.

332
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,940
Alright, fine!

333
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,580
Your Divine Holiness,

334
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,780
I know Master cares for me,

335
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,780
and I trust him deeply.

336
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,420
But what significance did that camellia

337
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
from the previous life

338
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,420
hold for him?

339
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,620
Would it be alright if I asked him?

340
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,140
Hongning, hey.

341
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,260
Here to repair the statue again?

342
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,460
Is it because of the fox lady?

343
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,060
Do you also see

344
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,140
her resemblance to the Matriarch?

345
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,140
I asked Master about

346
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,900
her identity.

347
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,260
He said

348
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,580
I'll have all the answers

349
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,100
once I achieve immortality.

350
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,660
So I guess

351
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,940
she must be

352
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,020
the Matriarch herself.

353
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,540
What's your next step?

354
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,300
To attain immortality ASAP.

355
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,700
And she's so protective of Lujiu...

356
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,500
Their connection must run deep!

357
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,980
When he returns,

358
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,820
I'll question him thoroughly.

359
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,380
They might even be family...

360
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,780
This should

361
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,140
lead to the NCR.

362
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,820
My Lady,

363
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,060
did you ever find your brother?

364
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,820
He's very close to me now,

365
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,620
yet sometimes he feels so far away...

366
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,210
I appreciate your efforts along the way.

367
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,170
It's nothing really.

368
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,210
This is a place

369
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,020
I don't wanna come to.

370
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,780
But I promised to escort you back,

371
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,460
and I'll keep my word.

372
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
NCR men?

373
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,380
I'll slay every last one!

374
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,180
Spiritual Flame?

375
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,940
Nine-tailed Fox?

376
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,820
You're Luyao, the NCR Matriarch!

377
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,220
Jiu,

378
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,500
we're not safe here.

379
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,420
Let's leave now.

380
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,580
Why did you lie to me!

381
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,740
I didn't mean to.

382
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,900
The General Fox's ambitions are vicious.

383
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,340
He seized the throne and

384
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,980
holds our father captive in the palace.

385
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,740
I barely escaped with my life.

386
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,340
You're my only family now.

387
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,220
Please, come home with me.

388
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,940
The NCR needs you.

389
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,540
I'm merely a worthless three-tailed fox.

390
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,140
Father kept me locked away since birth.

391
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,820
Since when did the NCR

392
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,260
ever need me?

393
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,900
And when did I

394
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,140
ever have a sister I've never met before?

395
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
Come back with me.

396
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,900
Let's take back our place.

397
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,380
I will give you justice!

398
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,020
Your Highness,

399
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
from childhood to now,

400
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,700
have I ever been

401
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,220
considered one of you?

402
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,300
It was your lofty father who

403
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,700
personally ordered me to the Kylin Lair.

404
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,820
I am the disgrace,

405
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,140
the sin of the NCR!

406
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,700
And now you want me back?

407
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,820
To where?

408
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,460
We owe you.

409
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,380
I must

410
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,460
make it up to you!

411
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,020
I don't have a sister.

412
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Listen,

413
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,460
don't ever appear before me.

414
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,820
Or I'll skin you alive

415
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,860
and break your bones!

416
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,740
[My Lady, why practicing the sword again?]

417
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,860
[Didn't the King]

418
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,100
[just order you to]

419
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,580
[focus on embroidery?]

420
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,660
[But I don't like that.]

421
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,020
[Does Father permit my visit to my brother?]

422
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
[My little darling,]

423
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,180
[don't mention him again!]

424
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,580
[The King gets furious]

425
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
[every time he hears his name.]

426
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,500
[If you keep this up,]

427
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,100
[we'll all face punishment.]

428
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,100
[Why?]

429
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,140
[He's my brother.]

430
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,580
[Why can't I see him?]

431
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,700
[Because he's the son of the King,]

432
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,860
[who's a noble nine-tailed fox.]

433
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,060
[But he's born with three tails.]

434
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,500
[That's his fault!]

435
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,900
[His existence]

436
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,020
[is the greatest shame to the King!]

437
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,100
[Remember,]

438
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,540
[forget your brother.]

439
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,420
[My Lady,]

440
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,700
[you've got to prove yourself now!]

441
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
[You are the last hope of]

442
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,940
[the NCR!]

443
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,620
Master, you wanted to see me?

444
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,260
There's more

445
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,540
I didn't tell you today.

446
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,100
What's that?

447
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,260
I'm gonna tell you about

448
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,220
your past life.

449
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,660
In the last life,

450
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,180
we once shared a bond.

451
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,740
I wanted you to cultivate immortality,

452
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,060
but it led you to fall into

453
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,380
the Demotion Pool and suffer greatly.

454
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,060
I didn't want to tell you this,

455
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,420
but after the Dragon Abyss thing,

456
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,780
I realized my true feelings.

457
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,740
I thought long and hard,

458
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,100
and I don't wanna

459
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,780
ignore my feelings anymore.

460
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,860
I don't wanna run away from

461
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,180
the painful memories neither.

462
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,940
You've been curious

463
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,260
if I'm the deity you saw

464
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,540
when you're a child.

465
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,860
I dare not admit it.

466
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,060
Because I feared

467
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,700
you'd remember those past lives

468
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,180
and it would cause you pain again.

469
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,460
But what scares me more

470
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,300
is you turning me down

471
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,460
and starting to hate me.

472
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,580
Now the choice

473
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,500
is in your hands again.

474
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,900
If you want to remember

475
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,220
the past,

476
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,060
I'll help you, no question.

477
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,300
But if you don't,

478
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,380
I won't push it anymore.

479
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,100
Master,

480
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,100
just one thing I want to ask.

481
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,420
Back at the Dragon Abyss,

482
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,540
was the one you said who made you smile

483
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,380
me from my last life?

484
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,620
Yes.

485
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,220
So I was

486
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,820
the camellia pixie in the past life?

487
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,460
Yes.

488
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,940
As for digging up the past,

489
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,940
I…

490
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,780
I still need time to think.

491
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,500
No rush,

492
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,220
I'll wait.

493
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,380
Hongning.

494
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:47,900
Baicha,

495
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,100
I made this from spirit herbs.

496
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,780
It will help you get your power back.

497
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,460
Try it.

498
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,700
Oh right, Ningmeng.

499
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,820
Bring a bowl to the black snake too.

500
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,140
What's up with him?

501
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,580
The black snake woke up

502
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,780
and left without a word.

503
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,220
He's still sulking.

504
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,860
Good thing he's awake.

505
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,700
I was really worried.

506
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,660
Worried about him?

507
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,540
Listen,

508
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,540
he's still that black snake,

509
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,820
cold-blooded!

510
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,020
Seriously,

511
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,460
I took care of him day and night.

512
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:25,740
Guess what?

513
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,340
He just left in the middle of the night!

514
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,620
Heartless!

515
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,060
Forget it,

516
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,860
you two wouldn't

517
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,020
get it anyway.

518
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,060
Really fed up this time!

519
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,380
Totally!

520
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,780
Fine, you chat, I'm out.

521
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,380
Hongning,

522
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,700
thanks for everything.

523
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,900
When I first met you,

524
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,100
I felt an instant bond.

525
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,620
Of course,

526
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,940
we really

527
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,380
were close back then.

528
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,060
You saved my life.

529
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,540
In the last life,

530
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,820
and this one too.

531
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,900
Right, Baicha.

532
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,820
I've always wanted to ask.

533
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
In the last life,

534
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,460
Master and me were…

535
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,420
Hongning,

536
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,300
once you remember,

537
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,460
you'll know the truth.

538
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,940
You faced heavenly tribulation for him,

539
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,060
but he…

540
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,140
broke your heart.

541
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,380
What happened?

542
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,220
When you took the tribulation,

543
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,900
I risked everything to beg him to save you.

544
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,060
But I didn't even get to see him.

545
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,820
A fairy from his place tricked me

546
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,900
to the Celestial Palace.

547
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,100
I ended up locked in the Kylin Lair,

548
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,900
burned by heavenly fire.

549
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,180
I couldn't stop worrying about you.

550
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,820
Then demons in the Lair said

551
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,420
he married the NCR Matriarch,

552
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,860
broke off your engagement,

553
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,620
and pushed you into the Demotion Pool,

554
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,100
Your soul nearly scattered to the winds!

555
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,140
How could he do that to you?

556
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,700
He's no deity in my book!

557
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,060
There must've been some mix-up.

558
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:04,860
Hongning,

559
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,820
you've always been

560
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,900
kind-hearted.

561
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,100
Even in this life as a mere mortal,

562
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,980
you're still the same at heart.

563
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,780
But as your friend,

564
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,620
I can't just sit by and watch!

565
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,660
I took some from

566
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,900
the Memory Spring.

567
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
One sip,

568
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,860
and the past will come rushing back.

569
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,140
Stop right there!

570
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,260
Ningmeng?

571
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,340
Why are you here?

572
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,740
I…

573
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,770
Master Wenxin sent me

574
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,330
to check on the pixies.

575
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,100
It's really weird!

576
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,180
No clue

577
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,700
what energy they soaked up,

578
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,260
but they're all fired up now.

579
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,260
Heard it's the Demon King

580
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,420
who gave them a boost of power.

581
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,660
Demon King?

582
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,540
Who's that?

583
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,820
How would I know?

584
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,940
I'm not, anyway.

585
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:06,980
Besides,

586
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,540
they talked in bits and pieces.

587
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,020
I couldn't catch the whole thing.

588
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,340
Fine.

589
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,060
I'll go report

590
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,700
to Master Wenxin later.

591
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,100
Ningmeng.

592
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,460
What are you planning to report?

593
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,460
Why lie?

594
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,020
I…

595
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,260
got into Cangwu before Baibuqu.

596
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,820
But he got picked for the dungeon!

597
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,540
I was… jealous.

598
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,180
I wanted to feel important too!

599
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,100
Well, look at you!

600
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,250
Such a pixie!

601
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,340
You're drowning in envy!

602
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,140
Ridiculous!

603
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,660
This is Cangwu's core,

604
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,620
not a place for games!

605
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,060
Back off!

606
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,980
Come to my room for punishment!

607
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,660
Yes, sir.

608
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,420
You…

609
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,540
[You're shaped]

610
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,060
[by the petals of camellias.]

611
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,660
[You'll]

612
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,940
[be called Hongning.]

613
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,860
[Hongning?]

614
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,820
[You know me?]

615
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,260
[Floral Deity?]

616
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,460
[Jinxiu?]

617
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,380
[May I be your queen?]

618
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,700
[You should pursue the path of immortality.]

619
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,900
[When the petals fall,]

620
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,580
[I'll marry you.]

621
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,540
[Sir Jinxiu,]

622
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,420
[you told me...]

623
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,699
[you would never wed the Matriarch.]

624
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:19,580
[Sir Jinxiu,]

625
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,860
[I shall not be your Divine Empress.]

626
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,060
[Find happiness with the Matriarch.]

627
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,940
[Run!]

628
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,420
[Run!]

629
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,540
Master.

630
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,300
The petals

631
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,220
are about to fall.

632
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,020
Do you remember promising me

633
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,850
that you'd marry me?

634
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,370
You remember it all now?

635
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,490
Yes, all.

636
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,460
I feel so sorry.

637
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,020
What's there to be sorry for?

638
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,540
You've always protected me,

639
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,740
got me through the Bridge of Destiny,

640
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,060
watched me grow up.

641
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,100
You've done enough.

642
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,980
I'm the one who let you down.

643
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,940
But in this life,

644
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,940
you still found me,

645
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,020
you never left me behind.

646
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,020
Hongning,

647
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,780
I'll keep my promise to you.

648
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,900
When the petals fall,

649
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,420
I'll marry you.

650
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,060
But,

651
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,100
I'm a mortal this life,

652
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,900
my time,

653
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,100
my life,

654
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,700
and my memories,

655
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,260
they only last a few decades.

656
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,500
I don't have long enough to stay with you.

657
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,540
I'm afraid…

658
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,340
I'm not strong enough,

659
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,940
and I can't stand beside you.

660
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,460
Would you still want to be with me?

661
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,500
I don't want,

662
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,020
and I couldn't bear to lose you again.

663
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,620
All your fault!

664
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,820
I've been jealous of myself for so long!

665
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,580
So how are you gonna punish me?

666
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,820
Make you stay with me

667
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,820
forever and ever.

668
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,700
Deal.

669
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:09,940
[Master!]

670
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,700
[The flowers on Mt. Cangwu]

671
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,420
[suddenly all bloomed at once,]

672
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,260
[no idea why!]

673
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:12,980
It's kinda spooky!

674
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,340
Well,

675
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,180
I've got stuff to do,

676
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:22,890
I'm leaving now.

677
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,580
Hongning!

678
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,820
This is…

679
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,450
The mint you gave me back then.

680
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,460
Please prepare the wine well

681
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,420
for our wedding.

682
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,940
What did I just hear?

683
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,100
Wedding?

684
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:47,860
I…

685
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,420
Master,

686
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,580
uh…

687
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,500
I left something boiling,

688
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,780
gotta go check…

689
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,660
Stop right there.

690
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,210
Master,

691
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:00,980
I swear I didn't see

692
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:01,740
or hear anything!

693
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,700
And I won't say a word!

694
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,420
I swear!

695
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
Go tell everyone

696
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,380
I'm marrying Hongning!

697
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,220
Hongning,

698
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,860
did your memory come back?

699
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:33,860
Baicha,

700
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,460
I remember now.

701
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,980
You're the white camellia I saved

702
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,180
back in the Withered Garden.

703
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,020
That's great,

704
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,380
you remembered!

705
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:42,860
Then…

706
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,460
we can go back to Mt. Baizhou together!

707
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,100
Baicha,

708
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,940
in this life,

709
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
I have my home

710
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,580
and my parents here.

711
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,260
But…

712
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,820
your roots are in Mt. Baizhou.

713
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,180
I'm a white camellia,

714
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,100
you're a red one,

715
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,540
we're meant to live there together!

716
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,100
I remember

717
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,380
a lot from my past life,

718
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
but in this life,

719
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,380
I still have things to do.

720
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,500
My parents who raised and

721
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,660
my fellow disciples are all here.

722
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,580
And,

723
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,580
I accepted Master's proposal.

724
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,100
I'll live here from now on.

725
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,780
What?

726
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,820
He's a liar!

727
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,900
He'll hurt you again!

728
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,100
Why would you say yes to him?

729
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,660
Baicha!

730
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,340
In the past life,

731
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
thank you for going up,

732
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,500
trying to beg Sir Jinxiu to save me.

733
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,660
But there were many behind

734
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,980
that you don't even know.

735
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,820
He had no choice

736
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,060
but to marry the Matriarch.

737
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,260
I jumped into the Demotion Pool

738
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,380
to repay him for the Golden Lotus Dew.

739
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,140
He helped me through the Bridge of Destiny,

740
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,100
that's how I got to be a mortal.

741
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,620
The blazing fire curse he bears

742
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,300
was all because of me!

743
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,220
Hongning,

744
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,900
you two don't stand a chance together.

745
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,220
He's a deity,

746
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,780
but you're a pixie!

747
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,540
There's no future for the two of you.

748
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,940
Only I can be with you!

749
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,980
Calm down.

750
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,940
Aren't we friends?

751
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,620
I care about you as a friend,

752
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,100
but I'm in love with him.

753
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,620
Do you even understand love?

754
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,060
Love?

755
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,020
How could I not?

756
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,420
It's 'cause I love you

757
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,060
that I escaped the Kylin Lair,

758
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,980
going through

759
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,860
hell and back

760
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,500
to find you.

761
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,660
Because of love,

762
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,860
I risked my life

763
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,180
to beg them to save you

764
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,260
at the Celestial Realm!

765
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,140
Hongning,

766
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,820
I fell in love with you

767
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,100
the moment I saw you

768
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,980
in the Withered Garden.

769
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,700
Didn't you feel it at all?

770
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,580
What you're saying isn't love.

771
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,900
If it's real love, you both

772
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,780
feel the same way,

773
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,700
and you'd put their joy

774
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,500
above everything.

775
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,460
Alright.

776
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,340
One day, you'll understand.

777
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,620
I'm the one

778
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,940
who loves you most.
