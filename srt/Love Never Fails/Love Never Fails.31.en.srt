00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,840
[Moonlight and lamplight unchanged stay,]

4
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,760
[as I long for your homeward way.]

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,920
[Moonlight and lamplight unchanged stay,]

6
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,920
[as I long for your homeward way.]

7
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,160
Perhaps I was wrong all along.

8
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,040
Hongning.

9
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,920
Jinxiu...

10
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
I've been looking everywhere for you.

11
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,320
I know.

12
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,880
Do you realize

13
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,200
I thought

14
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,920
you had vanished?

15
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
Tell me this isn't just another dream...

16
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,120
No.

17
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
You came looking for me,

18
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,120
and...

19
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,680
here I am.

20
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,440
This place...

21
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,200
it's filled with beautiful camellias.

22
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,080
Whenever my heart ached for you,

23
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,760
I would come

24
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,520
and plant one.

25
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,760
I called for you

26
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,159
through lilybell countless times.

27
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,720
Why didn't you ever respond?

28
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,440
The lilybell needs to be enchanted first

29
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,680
to pass messages.

30
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,960
There you go.

31
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,320
From now on,

32
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,120
you'll be able to reach me anytime.

33
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
I need you to be honest with me.

34
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,440
Why did you disappear?

35
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,720
After the Wuzhang conflict,

36
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,960
my mortal form was lost.

37
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,280
My soul drifted endlessly,

38
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,520
lost and confused.

39
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
In my scattered state of mind,

40
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,320
finding you was

41
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,400
my only clear thought.

42
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,160
Somehow,

43
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,840
fate led me here.

44
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,680
Then why keep hiding from me?

45
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,080
I couldn't bring myself to return.

46
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,360
The weight of your hatred...

47
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,880
I couldn't bear it.

48
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,120
I couldn't face you.

49
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,080
I failed to protect you,

50
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,400
causing your twig to break,

51
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,200
forcing you to become a demon,

52
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,640
making you fall into the Demotion Pool

53
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,120
where you suffered unimaginable agony.

54
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,480
I'm so sorry...

55
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,640
That life at Mt. Cangwu...

56
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
My pride and arrogance

57
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,280
got the better of me.

58
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,280
I was so convinced I could keep you safe,

59
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,280
but my actions led to your parents' deaths

60
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,080
and brought war to Mt. Cangwu.

61
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm deeply sorry...

62
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,560
In our Wuzhang life,

63
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,600
I hid behind the comfort

64
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,200
of my forgotten memories,

65
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,320
completely blind to the pain

66
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,000
and vengeance you carried within.

67
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,760
For all of this,

68
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I am truly sorry.

69
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,240
That's why

70
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,440
I stayed away...

71
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,240
How could I possibly seek your forgiveness?

72
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,840
Please stop...

73
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
In that endless void,

74
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,840
without even a glimmer of light,

75
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,840
I kept thinking

76
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,720
how wonderful it would be

77
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,280
if you came looking for me.

78
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
But I kept telling myself...

79
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,840
I had no right

80
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,320
to such hopes.

81
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,200
I was the one who failed you,

82
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,480
who caused you so much suffering.

83
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,480
I deserved my solitude as punishment.

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,840
Stop...

85
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,720
Let me take you home.

86
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,360
That's impossible.

87
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,800
Tell me why.

88
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,680
I'm caught in a

89
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
timeless void.

90
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,200
I still can't return to you properly.

91
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm only able to meet you now

92
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,920
because my wish has reached you.

93
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,960
How could I possibly return to the future?

94
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,720
When full moon greets another year,

95
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,360
these faithful lights still linger here.

96
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,640
Yet you're still here,

97
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,960
trapped in the moment of that wish.

98
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,960
Just knowing you searched for me

99
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
means everything.

100
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,280
At next Moon Lantern Festival,

101
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,280
I promise

102
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,360
I'll bring you home.

103
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,600
Alright.

104
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,200
My lady,

105
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,560
have you found Sir Jinxiu?

106
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,560
I know how to bring him back now.

107
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,320
How?

108
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,280
We wait.

109
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,480
Your Divine Majesty,

110
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,200
since Sir Jinxiu departed

111
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,520
for his trial in the mortal world,

112
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,160
the position of Punisher has been vacant.

113
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,280
Now the mortal world is plagued by demons.

114
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,560
If we don't appoint

115
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,000
a new Punisher soon,

116
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,640
these evil beings will grow even bolder.

117
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,080
The Punisher must

118
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,480
not only possess immense power

119
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,040
but also command respect and authority

120
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,880
throughout all the realms.

121
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,960
Who could possibly

122
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,960
measure up to Jinxiu?

123
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,000
Ever since completing his trial,

124
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,920
Sir Kunlun has overseen the cycle of seasons,

125
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,960
commanded the forces

126
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,360
in the search for Sir Jinxiu,

127
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,760
and brought order to the mortal realm.

128
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,640
It now enjoys peace and prosperity.

129
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,360
His competence

130
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,280
has truly surprised me.

131
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,640
Thank you, Father.

132
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,160
We've had no word of

133
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
Jinxiu's whereabouts for so long now.

134
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,200
The role of Punisher

135
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,880
is essential for the safety of all realms.

136
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,000
We cannot leave it vacant.

137
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,800
What would you propose?

138
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,720
Might I suggest Sir Kunlun

139
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,400
for the position?

140
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,440
He and Jinxiu

141
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,520
grew up together,

142
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,680
and his powers are no less formidable.

143
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,000
While his younger self

144
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,040
may have been too immature

145
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,200
for such positions of power,

146
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,240
his experiences in the mortal trails

147
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,560
have transformed him completely.

148
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,560
Should you grant him this opportunity,

149
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,480
he would not take it lightly.

150
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,880
Mother,

151
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,120
I understand father's reservations.

152
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,800
I have yet to prove my worth

153
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,720
to earn such authority.

154
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,040
However,

155
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,040
there is another role I humbly seek,

156
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
if father would consider my request.

157
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,640
Go on.

158
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
The Celestial Banquet approaches.

159
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,080
Even without Sir Jinxiu's presence,

160
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,120
we must

161
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,160
hold this celebration

162
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,200
as it represents

163
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,160
our realm's flourishing.

164
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,520
I humbly request to

165
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,640
take charge of its organization.

166
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
I can still recall

167
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,800
how you

168
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,800
turned the last celebration

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
into an overly theatrical display.

170
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,920
Please rest assured, father.

171
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,840
This time I'll exercise proper restraint

172
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,160
and ensure all guests' satisfaction.

173
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,480
Very well.

174
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Since you're showing such initiative,

175
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,200
I'll entrust it to you.

176
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,960
I am grateful, father.

177
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,240
[Sir Jinxiu,]

178
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,120
[my heart aches for you.]

179
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,640
[Hongning, ]

180
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,600
[does your heart yearn for me as well?]

181
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,800
Place that over there.

182
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,640
Yes, Your Divine Highness.

183
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,200
Greetings, Sir Kunlun.

184
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
It's just the two of us here.

185
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,600
No need for such formality.

186
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,360
I knew you were preparing

187
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,840
for the Celestial Banquet,

188
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,840
so I brought you

189
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,480
some sweet nectar.

190
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,400
My gratitude.

191
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,320
Our forces are looking for him,

192
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,080
but there's no news yet.

193
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,400
But, of late,

194
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,920
memories of

195
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,080
my younger days keep surfacing.

196
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,840
Do these memories concern Sir Jinxiu?

197
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,000
Indeed,

198
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,440
about Jinxiu.

199
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,840
Our natures were

200
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,560
poles apart since youth.

201
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
I was always bold

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,800
and demanding,

203
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,840
while he would selflessly yield,

204
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,760
offering me the finest of all things.

205
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
He never voiced

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,920
his own wishes.

207
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,520
During studies and spiritual practice,

208
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,800
he remained serene and steadfast.

209
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,920
And he would shield me

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,960
from the consequences of my misdeeds.

211
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,120
If only...

212
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,200
he had put himself first sometimes.

213
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,880
Yet I sensed a deep sadness in him.

214
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,960
Has he carried the burden since childhood?

215
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,400
Born in the Celestial Realm

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,840
as the crown prince,

217
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,280
he was destined for two great roles:

218
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,560
the Punisher and the future Celestial Monarch.

219
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,920
In such a position,

220
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
showing emotion was forbidden.

221
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
The realm wouldn't tolerate it,

222
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,720
and our parents

223
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,600
absolutely forbade it.

224
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,760
[No wonder joy rarely touched his face...]

225
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,240
The banquet has both torn lovers apart

226
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
and brought hearts together.

227
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,600
A millennium ago,

228
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,920
when I first hosted it,

229
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,120
I was untouched

230
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,520
by life's complexities.

231
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,240
I sought only to create

232
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
the grandest spectacle.

233
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,840
Now, as I prepare another,

234
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,120
I see that

235
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,800
such grandeur is but a passing moment,

236
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,360
leaving only emptiness in its wake.

237
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,640
That's not true.

238
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,600
Like flowers that bloom and fade,

239
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
like the dance of the stars.

240
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,800
Those who dwell forever

241
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,800
in our hearts

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,040
will surely meet us again.

243
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,240
May they return to us soon.

244
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,120
Long live

245
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,400
the emperor and empress!

246
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,120
Father,

247
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,920
all guests are seated.

248
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,760
The banquet may commence.

249
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,000
Proceed.

250
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,760
[The hour has come.]

251
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,600
[The Moon Lantern Festival is about to begin.]

252
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,359
Is King Baicha over there?

253
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,599
Baicha?

254
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,240
Yeah.

255
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,000
Isn't everyone here

256
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,280
for him?

257
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,240
Word is that the Demon King is returning

258
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,800
to restore our demons' glory.

259
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,000
He's gathering forces.

260
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,480
I know nothing of this.

261
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,360
Let's go.

262
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
I knew I was right!

263
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,360
Jinxiu!

264
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,480
Let me take you home.

265
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,160
Let's go home.

266
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,760
This banquet truly

267
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,640
demonstrated the august dignity

268
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,400
of our realm.

269
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,560
I'm genuinely impressed by

270
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,040
how well you've orchestrated

271
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,440
this event.

272
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,360
True.

273
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,760
Our son has matured

274
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
far beyond his previous nature.

275
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,360
Your praise humbles me, father, mother.

276
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,000
I acknowledge my past misconduct,

277
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,280
which brought you much disappointment.

278
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,360
Throughout my youth,

279
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
Jinxiu was my guardian,

280
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
taking upon himself burdens

281
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,560
that were rightfully mine.

282
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,960
With his disappearance,

283
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,880
it's time I shoulder these duties.

284
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,920
Father,

285
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,920
I humbly seek your faith in me.

286
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,920
Your words bring me

287
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,320
great comfort.

288
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,080
You have indeed

289
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,200
made considerable progress these days.

290
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,600
I hope you will

291
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,680
honor the title of Punisher

292
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,080
and faithfully guard

293
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,880
the order of the realms.

294
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,200
Report!

295
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,160
Your Divine Majesty,

296
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,240
Sir Jinxiu has returned!

297
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,200
Father, mother,

298
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,320
I pay my respects.

299
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,800
My child,

300
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,280
you're truly alive!

301
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,240
You've finally returned!

302
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,320
Father, mother,

303
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,960
forgive me for bringing you such concern.

304
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,480
What happened?

305
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,560
Where have you been all this time?

306
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,680
Father,

307
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,560
after my tribulation,

308
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,600
I drifted beyond the realms

309
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,680
into the dark void.

310
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,480
My consciousness was dim.

311
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,680
My return was made possible

312
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,960
thanks to Lady Muxian.

313
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,960
Muxian?

314
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,400
Even my West Sea's Eye

315
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,920
couldn't detect your presence.

316
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
What extraordinary powers does

317
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,200
she possess to have found you?

318
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,080
It was through a dream.

319
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,880
Father,

320
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,040
in Wuzhang,

321
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
Muxian and I formed

322
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,560
a bond of affection.

323
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,240
When my soul was

324
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,080
lost and wandering,

325
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,160
by chance,

326
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,200
it fell into her dreamscape.

327
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,720
Nonsense!

328
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,800
Dreams are mere illusions.

329
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,040
How could your soul enter her dream?

330
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,640
Enough.

331
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,920
The boundaries between dreams and reality

332
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,600
are not always what they seem.

333
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,120
Let us not dwell on how

334
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,520
her powers surpassed

335
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
your West Sea's Eye.

336
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,800
What matters most is that

337
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,320
Jinxiu has returned.

338
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,600
The divine lineage

339
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,120
of our realm shall persist.

340
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,080
You depleted a millennium's worth of power

341
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,640
all for a dream.

342
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,480
It was because of me

343
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,240
that his spiritual root was damaged.

344
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,920
Whether just a dream or not,

345
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,560
I had to do all within my power.

346
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,680
Very well.

347
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
The Emperor Star has finally returned.

348
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,560
Let the Celestial Realm's

349
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,080
glory reign eternal!

350
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,840
Sir Jinxiu has returned!

351
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,560
It's a bless!

352
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,120
Sir Jinxiu.

353
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,760
We must express our gratitude to

354
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,400
Sir Kunlun for tending to the

355
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,880
Floralia Palace while Sir Jinxiu was away.

356
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,520
It was only right.

357
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,680
Had this been you from a millennium ago,

358
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,880
I suspect my palace would

359
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,640
have been demolished.

360
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,640
A thousand years is a long time.

361
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,080
I am not the same

362
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,480
playful child I once was.

363
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,840
Greetings, Your Divine Highness.

364
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,960
My dear fairies, it has been long.

365
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,200
You've finally returned!

366
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,880
You don't know how worried

367
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,240
the fairies have been.

368
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,760
These flower knots were all made by us,

369
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,720
praying for your safe return.

370
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,480
Fairies,

371
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,800
I really appreciate it.

372
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,680
Shaoyao,

373
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,280
with such beautiful blossoms,

374
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,080
you must be close to becoming an envoy?

375
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,040
If my flowers please you, that's enough.

376
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,640
[Where's His Divine Highness?]

377
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,800
[My beloved master!]

378
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,560
[Where are you?]

379
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,120
Where, oh, where is my master?

380
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,560
Your Divine Highness...

381
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,480
My lord.

382
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,240
Surely...I'm not drunk, am I?

383
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,000
How much have you had?

384
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,600
You're alive!

385
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,480
Thank heavens!

386
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,360
I've missed you terribly!

387
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Quick, take him

388
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,200
back to rest.

389
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,040
You're alive...that's all that matters...

390
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,160
I'm not leaving...

391
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,280
not leaving...

392
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,800
not leaving...

393
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,800
I've missed you so much...

394
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,440
Lady Muxian,

395
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,480
you have my deepest gratitude.

396
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,880
Please forgive me, Sir Kunlun.

397
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,080
I wasn't

398
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,120
entirely truthful with you before.

399
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,880
It's alright.

400
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,240
You must

401
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,720
have had your reasons.

402
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,000
Though I must say,

403
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,920
I rather miss the

404
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,000
camellia pixie you once were.

405
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,560
Oh, Your Divine Highness...

406
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,120
I've missed you so terribly...

407
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,240
Ask anyone here...

408
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,320
Every day I told them...

409
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,520
I missed you so much...

410
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
[When you were gone,]

411
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,480
[the flowers...they just weren't the same.]

412
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,840
[But now you're back...]

413
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,560
[everything's right again!]

414
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,720
[These flowers...]

415
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,960
[they'll bloom even more beautifully...]

416
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,120
[Look how vibrant they've become...]

417
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,080
[look...]

418
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,520
Baicha,

419
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
I knew I'd find you here.

420
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,760
I'm a demon.

421
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,520
I've simply returned

422
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,240
to my rightful place.

423
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,600
The destruction of Wuzhang

424
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,560
is on your hands.

425
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,280
So what?

426
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,800
Without my force of resentment,

427
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,760
would you be standing where you are now?

428
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,080
Tell me,

429
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,640
are we really so different?

430
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,840
End this now,

431
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,480
before more harm is done.

432
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,080
End it?

433
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,120
How could I just end it?

434
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,120
You finally achieved merits,

435
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,160
earned your immortality,

436
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,560
yet you were wasting

437
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,760
all the energy trying to find him.

438
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,840
How can you ask me to stop?

439
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,120
That was my choice to make.

440
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,400
I've moved heaven and earth for you,

441
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
all to help you seek revenge.

442
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,560
I would give you the world if you asked,

443
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,840
do anything within my power.

444
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,520
But him?

445
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,640
What has he ever done for you?

446
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,680
Can't you see how I feel about you?

447
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,480
I've always been clear.

448
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,040
My every action is

449
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,800
driven by my love for him.

450
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,480
Yes, you saved my life,

451
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
and I'm in your debt.

452
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,560
If you wish,

453
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
you can have my life in return.

454
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,360
Return it?

455
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,560
How could you possibly do that?

456
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,120
Why are you so willing

457
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,160
to throw your life away?

458
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
I said...I'm in your debt...

459
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,040
I'll make it right...

460
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,800
Everything I've done for you

461
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,560
was never about

462
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,800
getting something in return.

463
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,960
That's precisely how I feel...

464
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,240
about him...

465
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,200
He murdered your parents.

466
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,720
He's the hypocrite who persecuted our kind

467
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,760
while preaching righteousness!

468
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,880
Have you forgotten all of that?

469
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,680
I haven't forgotten.

470
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,440
But my love remains.

471
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,680
So be it...

472
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,320
You cherish this love so much.

473
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,680
Let's see how you enjoy

474
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,000
being consumed by that love.

475
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,720
What are you doing to me?

476
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,240
This is the Heart Seal.

477
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,920
The more you love him,

478
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,440
the more agony you'll feel,

479
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,600
the tighter it will strangle.

480
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,840
You wanted to sacrifice

481
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,160
your life for love?

482
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,160
Well, now you have your chance.

483
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,880
How could you be so cruel...

484
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,960
Love makes...

485
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,760
monsters of us all.

486
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,360
To what do I owe the honor?

487
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,720
I came to see how the keeper

488
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,680
tends to her flowers.

489
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,920
Your long absence must have

490
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,880
left you with many duties to fulfill.

491
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,680
True,

492
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,960
but they're behind me now.

493
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,200
I came here specifically to see you.

494
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,400
Your presence in the Withered Garden

495
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
might spark unwanted gossip.

496
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,800
Let them whisper.

497
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,080
I care only for what's in your heart.

498
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,000
You're different now.

499
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,160
How so?

500
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,280
You're more talkative.

501
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,320
And...

502
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,600
is this new me

503
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,280
better or worse?

504
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,000
Anything about you

505
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,800
is perfect to me.

506
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,480
During my trial,

507
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,320
I learned to

508
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,040
appreciate life's

509
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,840
simple pleasures.

510
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,080
I promised myself then

511
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,880
that upon my return,

512
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,080
I would cherish every moment with you,

513
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,360
compensating for all the time we missed.

514
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,480
You truly

515
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,280
have changed so much

516
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,520
from when we first met.

517
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,480
Indeed.

518
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,040
Because I no longer wish to

519
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,800
let go of what matters most to me.

520
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,280
Hongning,

521
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,240
to me,

522
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,840
you matter more than anything.

523
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,760
What's the matter?

524
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,240
I'd rather you called me Muxian.

525
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,520
I've always liked that name better.

526
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,760
As you wish.

527
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,000
Greetings, mother.

528
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,440
It's been quite some time

529
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,480
since your awakening.

530
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,640
Forgive me, Mother.

531
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,400
My search for brother has kept me away.

532
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,360
What brings you

533
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,400
to me now?

534
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,640
I seek

535
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,280
your permission to

536
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,800
command the Western Sea forces.

537
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,240
Military affairs have never interested you.

538
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,240
Why this sudden request?

539
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,520
It's for Luyao's sake.

540
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,440
The northern realm's affairs

541
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,360
are beyond even Central Realm's reach,

542
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,400
much less ours.

543
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,800
Besides,

544
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,880
you have no military experience.

545
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,320
What good would thousands of elite troops

546
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,440
do under your command?

547
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,640
True, I have no military experience.

548
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,880
But since my trial in Cangwu,

549
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,840
where I lived as a humble ice pixie,

550
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,160
I've learned much.

551
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,960
Fighting alongside Cangwu's disciples,

552
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,800
facing death together,

553
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,560
I learned the true meaning of loyalty.

554
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,400
In Wuzhang,

555
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,960
as the prime minister's son,

556
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,840
I learned the art of governance

557
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,200
and discovered the value of friendship.

558
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,080
I've indulged my own whims long enough.

559
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,800
Life demands that

560
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,080
we shoulder our responsibilities.

561
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,000
Your journey to the mortal world

562
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,040
has truly matured you.

563
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,200
Mother,

564
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,640
Luyao is my friend.

565
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,360
As the Matriarch who protects her people,

566
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,080
she deserves my help.

567
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,200
That is

568
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,840
what friendship demands.

569
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,440
Moreover,

570
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,600
General Fox's ambition

571
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,160
poses a growing threat.

572
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,840
His long-standing hostility towards us

573
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,840
will eventually become a serious concern.

574
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,440
You've finally grown up.

575
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,560
Mother, I apologize for all the worry

576
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,120
my past foolishness has caused you.

577
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,400
Your Divine Highness,

578
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,280
Envoy Plum seeks an audience.

579
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Let her enter.

580
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,480
Yes.

581
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,400
Greetings, Your Divine Highness,

582
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,520
Sir Kunlun.

583
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,760
What brings you here, Envoy Plum?

584
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,960
I've brought you some Blossom Brew,

585
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,000
personally brewed by Sir Jinxiu himself,

586
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,560
along with freshly made desserts.

587
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,520
He brewed it himself?

588
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,040
Yes, Your Divine Highness.

589
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,199
That's very kind of him.

590
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Envoy Plum,

591
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
take these back.

592
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,920
But mother,

593
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,040
he prepared these personally.

594
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,159
Take them back.

595
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,520
Yes, Your Divine Highness.

596
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,480
Kunlun,

597
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,640
while I'm proud of

598
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,160
your maturity.

599
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,480
But understand this,

600
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,200
the Western Sea troops are fierce and untamed.

601
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,000
They cannot be given away freely.

602
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,480
If you want their allegiance,

603
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,920
you must earn it with your own strength.

604
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,160
I understand, mother.

605
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,040
[How will I tell His Divine Highness]

606
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,000
[that his wine was refused?]

607
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,400
[It will surely pain him...]

608
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,160
[Aren't those desserts]

609
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,440
[Jinxiu personally made for the empress?]

610
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,160
General.

611
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,960
Must I find her

612
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,920
to claim my throne?

613
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,040
General,

614
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,960
the throne could be yours,

615
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,800
but the people might resist.

616
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,120
With her Nine-Tailed lineage,

617
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,920
she commands deep public loyalty.

618
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,000
Without her support,

619
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,080
we may face considerable opposition.

620
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,040
What absurd traditions!

621
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,440
On the battlefield,

622
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,760
might makes right.

623
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,160
Nothing else matters!

624
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,240
But General,

625
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,320
this tradition dates back to ancient times.

626
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,600
She represents our clan's future.

627
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,000
Disregarding this

628
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,960
could bring misfortune...

629
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,840
A naive little girl like her

630
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,560
representing our entire clan?

631
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,400
Utterly absurd.

632
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,800
Dismissed!

633
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,280
Yes, general.

634
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,960
Your Divine Highness!

635
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,280
Your Divine Highness!

636
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,160
Your Divine Highness!

637
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,280
Why are you in such a panic?

638
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,000
Your Divine Highness,

639
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,360
please look at this!

640
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,720
A wedding invitation from NCR?

641
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,960
The NCR Matriarch

642
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,800
is to wed the new king.

643
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,680
They sent this specifically for you,

644
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,800
and also said...

645
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,640
Said what?

646
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,520
They...

647
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,040
thanked you for canceling the marriage.

648
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,760
General Fox imprisoned the king and usurped his throne.

649
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,080
The Matriarch has just returned to NCR.

650
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,240
They must be using him

651
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,440
to force her into marriage.

652
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,840
Is Kunlun aware of this?

653
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,080
Surely Sir Kunlun doesn't know yet.

654
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,440
With his quick temper,

655
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,760
-should he learn of this...
-Jinxiu!

656
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,000
Greetings, Sir Kunlun.

657
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,920
I'll excuse myself.

658
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,000
What are you up to lately?

659
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,880
I hear you're constantly busy,

660
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,440
never leaving the Floralia Palace.

661
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,920
I just came to check on you.

662
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,760
You're not busy these days?

663
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,160
What would keep me busy?

664
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,480
I just

665
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,800
oversee the weather

666
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
and learn about governance.

667
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,680
It's quite pleasant.

668
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,200
Have you been

669
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
keeping in touch with Luyao?

670
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,760
Why would I contact her?

671
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,600
She has her own matters to attend to.

672
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,440
Be honest with me,

673
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,960
do you have feelings for her?

674
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,440
No.

675
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,280
Are you certain?

676
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,000
Absolutely not.

677
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,440
Kunlun,

678
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,160
you need to look into your heart.

679
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,480
Set aside all other concerns

680
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,320
and tell me honestly,

681
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,640
do you

682
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,880
love Luyao?

683
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,920
She's already returned to her realm

684
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,680
to save her people.

685
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,440
I'm no longer needed.

686
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,280
You're acting peculiar today,

687
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,360
bringing up such matters.

688
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,960
This is a wedding invitation from NCR,

689
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,720
between General Fox and Luyao.

690
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,000
We don't know the full situation yet.

691
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,560
If you wish,

692
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,440
we could consult with

693
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,440
father and mother about this.

694
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,000
Kunlun, swear to me

695
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,800
you won't do anything impul...

696
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,080
Kunlun!

697
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,800
What brings you here with such haste?

698
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,920
I need your troops.

699
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,000
I told you,

700
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,000
you have to earn it.

701
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,280
Name your price, mother.

702
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,720
Anything I possess is yours.

703
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,280
Do you swear to this?

704
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,400
We can form a sacred contract.

705
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,680
Very well,

706
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
3000 elite soldiers

707
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,160
for your binding oath.

708
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,240
Agreed.

709
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
No regrets?

710
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,160
What terms do you propose, mother?

711
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,920
Promise to

712
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,080
compete with Jinxiu for the throne.

713
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,960
Western Sea forces will be yours to command,

714
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,720
and all power in the Central Realm

715
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,960
shall belong to you.

716
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,000
Jinxiu is destined to be the sovereign.

717
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,000
My Emperor Star

718
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
hasn't even begun to shine.

719
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,280
When there's will,

720
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,520
there's always a way!

721
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
But I've never wanted to

722
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,800
compete for the throne.

723
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,080
Have you given up on saving Luyao?

724
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Mother, you already knew?

725
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,560
The northern realm has announced

726
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,160
to all corners of the world

727
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,800
that General Fox will wed the Matriarch.

728
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,440
Without power or military might,

729
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,960
how can you cross into their territory?

730
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
How will you rescue your beloved?

731
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,960
I cannot agree to such terms.

732
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,880
Don't you want to rescue her?

733
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,400
I will save her on my own.

734
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,000
But I won't use this

735
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,640
as a bargain.

736
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,320
You shall be the ruler of Central Realm.

737
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,000
You must take the throne!

738
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,840
Muxian.

739
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,760
What's the matter?

740
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,160
I'll be leaving for a while.

741
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,240
The northern realm sent

742
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,160
a wedding invitation for Luyao and General Fox.

743
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,720
Knowing Kunlun's headstrong character,

744
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,760
I fear he'll

745
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,200
rush to the northern realm

746
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
to confront Luyao directly.

747
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,600
So I must go.

748
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,880
Why would Luyao agree to this marriage?

749
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,400
The timing of

750
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,440
this wedding announcement

751
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,840
suggests they're holding her captive,

752
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,080
using this marriage to secure the throne.

753
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,400
So without Luyao,

754
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,520
he cannot claim the throne?

755
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,440
In the northern realm,

756
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,800
the Matriarch of the Nine-Tailed Fox

757
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,320
represents hope.

758
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,440
Sky Fox's bloodline

759
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,760
differs greatly from the Nine-Tailed Fox.

760
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,600
Without Luyao's support,

761
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
he'd struggle to win the people's hearts.

762
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,200
Does bloodline matter that much?

763
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,400
I know what's on your mind.

764
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,800
Don't worry,

765
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,080
I'll handle everything.

766
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,400
But you possess the superior status,

767
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,240
but I don't...

768
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,360
That doesn't matter.

769
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,240
Our love is all that matters.

770
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,040
Everything else can be overcome.

771
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,280
Has Jinxiu left for NCR?

772
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,040
Yes, he has departed.

773
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,600
Is Muxian in the Floralia Palace?

774
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,840
She's tending to the duties for Sir Jinxiu.

775
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,720
Greetings, Your Divine Highness.

776
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,240
You may rise.

777
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,960
It's been long since I've seen Jinxiu,

778
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,000
so I came to visit the Floralia Palace.

779
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,720
I hear that

780
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,480
Envoy Plum and Official Chrysanthemum

781
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,600
have been diligently

782
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,200
managing the palace

783
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,480
while Jinxiu is away.

784
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,000
I'm grateful for your dedication.

785
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,560
Gratitude.

786
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,320
We simply fulfilled

787
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,760
our responsibilities.

788
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,040
Muxian,

789
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,040
how are you faring as the keeper

790
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,600
of the Withered Garden?

791
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,000
Your Divine Highness,

792
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,560
all goes well,

793
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,800
though I still have much to learn

794
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,520
from my fellow officials.

795
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,840
Jinxiu's term as the Floral Deity will soon end.

796
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,880
He'll return to Central Realm

797
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,400
to assume the throne.

798
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,960
One of you

799
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,080
will become

800
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
the new Floral Deity.

801
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,920
You should all

802
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,880
cultivate diligently

803
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,360
and seize this opportunity.

804
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,520
Yes, Your Divine Highness.

805
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,440
Envoy Plum,

806
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,480
having been raised in Central Realm,

807
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,400
you embody our traditions perfectly.

808
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,120
For a millennium, you've shown self-discipline,

809
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,600
and your cultivation is impressive.

810
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,080
Your future looks promising.

811
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,520
Gratitude, Your Divine Highness.

812
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,480
Later,

813
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,480
I shall discuss with Jinxiu regarding the role.

814
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,720
He must ponder this decision thoroughly.

815
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,080
She is quite odd.

816
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,000
She never visits the Floralia Palace

817
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,840
because she has no love for flowers.

818
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,840
No love for flowers?

819
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,720
But the Emperor is from the Pine Clan,

820
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,880
and Jinxiu's true form is a peony.

821
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,440
Haven't you noticed

822
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,000
she seems to prefer Sir Kunlun?

823
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,200
Why?

824
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,680
Let's not probe further,

825
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,680
let's not probe further.
