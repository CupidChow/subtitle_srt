[EP14]

3
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,009
Come on here!

4
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:55,729
How was it?

5
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,009
No problem.

6
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,930
But what exactly is the Sword Trial?

7
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,050
To put it simply,

8
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,290
it's to see if you have a spiritual root.

9
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,210
Spiritual root?

10
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,930
Don't tell me you

11
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,250
don't even know what that is?

12
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,170
Er..

13
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,090
Mortals can't cultivate

14
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,450
unless they have one.

15
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,650
What does that mean?

16
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,610
So you mean,

17
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,290
if I don't have

18
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,450
a spiritual root,

19
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,210
I'll fail the trial?

20
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,170
Exactly.

21
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,570
Out of thousands,

22
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,530
only a few are destined for immortality.

23
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,930
Even fewer are born with such roots.

24
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:37,970
Wait.

25
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,170
I just walked through the Immortal Mist.

26
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,610
Doesn't that mean

27
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,970
I have one?

28
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:44,970
Not necessarily.

29
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,850
Many powerful cultivators

30
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,970
have weak roots

31
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,370
and rely entirely on effort.

32
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,730
But that won't work in Cangwu.

33
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,170
How many spiritual roots are there?

34
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,650
Usually five,

35
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,010
metal, wood, water, fire, and earth,

36
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,290
from strongest to weakest in spirit power.

37
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,530
And earth is the weakest.

38
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:06,970
I don't care.

39
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,210
I really don't.

40
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,090
As long as I can stay here

41
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,210
and pass the trial,

42
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,930
any spiritual root is fine.

43
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,770
It's fate we met.

44
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,370
If I become an immortal someday,

45
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,810
you can come worship me.

46
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,810
I'll have your back.

47
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,570
Thanks, really. Thank you.

48
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,890
You seem way too confident.

49
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,730
Of course.

50
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,010
If you've got a spiritual root,

51
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,170
you can feel it.

52
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,610
For example,

53
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,090
mine's fire.

54
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,250
How do you even know that?

55
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,810
Hey, wait,

56
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,530
doesn't that hurt?

57
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,730
That's nothing.

58
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,370
I was born for cultivation.

59
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,010
[Staying here is the only way]

60
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,850
[I can find Ningmeng.]

61
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,610
[I've got to give it everything.]

62
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,730
[Master Wenxin has arrived!]

63
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:05,810
[Master Wenxin?]

64
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,730
[Ningmeng?]

65
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,530
Making it through our tough selection

66
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,490
to be here means

67
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,010
you're destined for the immortal path.

68
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,850
Whether you can

69
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,690
pass this trial or not, I hope

70
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,490
stay true to the pursuit of immortality.

71
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,090
[It's him.]

72
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,050
[Ningmeng must be here.]

73
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,290
Summon the sword!

74
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,770
Of Fulin County, Ganzhou,

75
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,650
Baibuqu,

76
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,010
please.

77
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,570
I'll go first.

78
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,650
I'm Baibuqu, from Fulin County, Ganzhou.

79
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,330
I've long aspired to immortality

80
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,250
and have admired Cangwu for years.

81
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,370
Everyone knows

82
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,370
our county

83
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,090
is blessed by immortals.

84
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,890
There are many legends about immortals.

85
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:36,730
I've been

86
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,730
able to control fire since I was little.

87
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,409
So I must have a fire root.

88
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:41,730
Proceed.

89
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:00,890
Congrats.

90
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,410
You have an earth root.

91
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,570
You may stay and continue cultivation here.

92
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,130
What... earth...

93
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,570
Earth root?

94
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,450
That's impossible!

95
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,290
I've been able to put out fire

96
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,410
with my hands since I was a kid!

97
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,810
How could an earth root?

98
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,050
Stop there.

99
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,610
You're just thick-skinned.

100
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,650
Next! Next!

101
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,650
Next,

102
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,210
- Canghai of Mt. Duanli.
- That's strange.

103
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:21,730
Step forward.

104
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,730
How could it be earth?

105
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,450
Greetings, Master Wenxin.

106
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,690
I've cultivated on Mt. Duanli

107
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,130
for 20 years.

108
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,930
I came here hoping to

109
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,330
advance my cultivation.

110
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,490
Looking forward to your advice.

111
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,090
Go ahead.

112
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:53,810
Please head back.

113
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,610
Why?

114
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,330
I can't have no spiritual root!

115
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,050
You may have strong cultivation,

116
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,370
but that doesn't mean

117
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,690
you're born with a spiritual root.

118
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,890
No way.

119
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,930
I've been a strong cultivator

120
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,250
since I was a kid.

121
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,130
How could I not have one?

122
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,730
The spirit sword didn't react.

123
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,130
Please step back.

124
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,970
No reaction?

125
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,690
What if the sword's wrong?

126
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,090
I came all the way to seek immortality.

127
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,290
Let me speak to the head

128
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,370
of the academy.

129
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,650
I'm in charge of the Sword Trial.

130
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,450
Canghai,

131
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,970
please leave.

132
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,170
Didn't expect that

133
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,370
Cangwu Academy rejected me

134
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,290
just based on a plain

135
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,690
peachwood sword.

136
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,890
So arrogant,

137
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,930
how could you ever guide others?

138
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,050
I must see the Head today!

139
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,290
What?

140
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,770
Have I been too nice to you?

141
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,250
Elder Wenxin tried to reason with you,

142
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,370
but you wouldn't listen.

143
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,010
Do I have to force you?

144
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,210
You can't even follow rules.

145
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,250
What are you cultivating for?

146
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,250
Bailing, watch your tone.

147
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,650
But he's the one being rude first.

148
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,770
Greetings, Master.

149
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,130
Apologize.

150
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,730
Yes, sir.

151
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,130
I'm sorry, old...

152
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,010
Mr Canghai.

153
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,929
I'm Canghai of Mt. Duanli.

154
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,450
I was out of line earlier.

155
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,929
Pease forgive me.

156
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,049
That's nothing.

157
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,850
It was my disciple who acted rudely.

158
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,330
Please don't take it to heart.

159
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,450
I'm surprised by

160
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,770
such pure ice magic of your disciple.

161
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,570
No wonder the spirit sword

162
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,290
couldn't detect my spiritual root.

163
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,970
It's been eye-opening.

164
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,090
Thank you for your time.

165
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,450
Goodbye.

166
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:04,970
Bailing,

167
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,410
after the Sword Trial,

168
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,650
plant trees for ten years in the back hill.

169
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,130
Got it.

170
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,130
Is the trial over?

171
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,010
Master,

172
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,410
there's one guy left.

173
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,130
Then continue.

174
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,410
Hongning.

175
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,290
Master,

176
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,650
I'm Wang Hongning from Wang's Village.

177
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:30,970
Begin.

178
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,610
[Why does he look kinda familiar?]

179
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,370
Seems like you...

180
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,050
Wait.

181
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,650
I'm not ready.

182
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,490
Let me try again.

183
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,770
[Spirit Sword,]

184
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,810
[I'm not here to become an immortal.]

185
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,450
[I'm doing this 'cause my best friend]

186
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,170
[is trapped inside Cangwu Academy.]

187
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,330
[Passing this trial]

188
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,890
[is the only way I can stay]

189
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,130
[and find him.]

190
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,450
[Please, I beg you.]

191
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,530
[Even an earth root would be enough.]

192
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,970
Hongning, you have no spiritual root.

193
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,010
I...

194
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,850
[Spirit Sword, please.]

195
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,170
[Have you ever had a friend?]

196
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,210
[My friend was taken because of me,]

197
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,530
[and I'm really worried about him.]

198
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,570
[I beg you.]

199
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,970
[Just grant me a root.]

200
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,690
It's over.

201
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,330
Someone, escort Hongning out.

202
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,690
Wait! Wait!

203
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,690
I said let me try one more time!

204
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,570
It's glowing! It's glowing!

205
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,290
Look! It lit up!

206
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,010
Master, look,

207
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,010
it lit up!

208
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,530
Five types of roots.

209
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,770
But I've never seen

210
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,090
the sword glow purple before.

211
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,010
Master, look,

212
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:39,730
it's glowing.

213
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,970
Can I stay now?

214
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,130
No.

215
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,410
Why not?

216
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,970
You can't go back on your word.

217
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,930
You said if the sword lights up,

218
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,010
I can stay.

219
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,570
The Spirit Sword detects spiritual roots.

220
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,930
But it has never

221
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,410
glowed purple before.

222
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,810
It's not one of the five roots,

223
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,730
but it still lit up!

224
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,330
You just never saw it before.

225
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,330
Rules are rules.

226
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,570
You need to leave.

227
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:05,650
I...

228
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,730
Master, there's trouble.

229
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,610
The dungeon's in chaos!

230
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,330
What happened?

231
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,130
The demons inside

232
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,130
suddenly got restless.

233
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,290
They kept shouting Demon King.

234
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,090
It felt off,

235
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,330
so I came to report.

236
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,970
Demon King?

237
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,410
Tiannanxing, get them settled.

238
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,530
The rest of you, come with me.

239
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,210
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

240
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,490
I...

241
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,330
Is there a pixie called

242
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,010
Ningmeng in your dungeon?

243
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,570
Ningmeng?

244
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,210
Yes.

245
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,050
You know him?

246
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:39,970
Guards.

247
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:41,850
Wait!

248
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,650
Hey, what are you doing?

249
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,730
Tying you up, obviously.

250
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,130
So you won't run around.

251
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:47,770
Just stay here.

252
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,210
No, no, no!

253
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,650
Wait! Hold on, wait!

254
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,130
Come back! Come back!

255
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,250
At least don't tie me up so tight.

256
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,370
Ningmeng...

257
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,970
- Demon King!
- Demon King!

258
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,650
Let us out!

259
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,090
- Our king is back!
- Our king is back!

260
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,530
King's power!

261
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,010
I want the king's power!

262
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,010
Demon King walks the earth again!

263
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,810
Master,

264
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,570
the demons in the dungeon

265
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,610
suddenly went

266
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,970
into a frenzy.

267
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,930
Give me the King!

268
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,450
Demon King!

269
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,450
Demon King!

270
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,970
Demon King?

271
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,530
Mt. Cangwu is protected by immortals.

272
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,370
There's no Demon King here!

273
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,610
The King's returned to rule three realms!

274
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,450
I want his power!

275
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:04,930
Hey.

276
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,090
Hey, Baibuqu.

277
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,730
What's going on over there?

278
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,250
Looks like demons

279
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,370
are rioting in the dungeon.

280
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,770
Demons?

281
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,530
What kind?

282
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,010
Is he yellow?

283
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,090
Yellow?

284
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,530
The color is what you

285
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,650
care about right now?

286
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,610
The Head told us

287
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,970
to stay put here.

288
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,930
Well,

289
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:27,650
untie me.

290
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,570
I'm going to the dungeon.

291
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,890
Are you nuts?

292
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:30,770
Even Mr Wenxin

293
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,370
might not be able to handle those things.

294
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,370
Didn't you say

295
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,130
a true Cangwu disciple needs to be brave?

296
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,370
The dungeon's in chaos.

297
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,690
If we don't go help them,

298
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,850
what's the point of

299
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,810
cultivating at all?

300
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,410
I didn't expect you

301
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,210
to have that kinda courage.

302
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,170
Alright. I'm going with you.

303
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,410
No, no, wait! Come back!

304
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,450
Untie me first!

305
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,810
Oh! Right, sorry!

306
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,010
But just to be clear,

307
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,210
if I get expelled for this,

308
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,210
you have to vouch for me.

309
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,090
Got it.

310
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,090
Wait for me!

311
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,930
You wicked scorpion,

312
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,210
I spared your life back then out of pity

313
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,010
for your damaged core.

314
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,490
And this is how you repay?

315
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,090
You ruined my thousand years of cultivation,

316
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,970
slaughtered my kin, crushed my hope,

317
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,010
and locked me in

318
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,010
this dark dungeon

319
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,730
to rot.

320
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,050
And you call that mercy?

321
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,450
We capture spirits

322
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,090
to uphold justice.

323
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,250
You brought this on yourself

324
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,090
when you hurt the innocent.

325
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,770
I'm not in the mood for debate.

326
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,170
Hand over the Demon King,

327
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,610
and I'll leave.

328
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,210
Ice pixie,

329
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,690
you're one of us.

330
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,930
Yet you kill your kind

331
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,170
with these petty mortals.

332
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,050
Aren't you ashamed?

333
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,610
And look at you, still rambling on.

334
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,730
So funny.

335
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,170
After all the evil you've done,

336
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,210
you dare talk about shame?

337
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,690
Today I'll I take your core!

338
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,770
Then I will show you

339
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,050
what I've got!

340
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,290
Who is that?

341
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,770
The scorpion spirit from Ganzhou.

342
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,290
He used to wreak havoc in the mortal world.

343
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,850
Master captured him.

344
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,610
Looks like he broke out

345
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,450
to take revenge.

346
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,290
They're barely holding him off.

347
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,450
Yeah, they're struggling.

348
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,050
[This is a good chance to find Ningmeng.]

349
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,170
[But]

350
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,810
[with so many pixies here,]

351
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,130
[how can I find him?]

352
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,130
Keep an eye on Master for me.

353
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,730
Where are you going?

354
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,570
Ningmeng?

355
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,210
Ningmeng?

356
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,130
Ningmeng?

357
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,690
Ningmeng?

358
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,010
Ningmeng?

359
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,089
Go reinforce the other cells.

360
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:15,970
Leave this one to me.

361
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:16,609
Yes, sir.

362
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:33,930
Watch out!

363
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,490
Are you okay?

364
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,290
Scorpion,

365
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,730
I spared your life because I thought you

366
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,010
could be guided to immortality.

367
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,410
You won't

368
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,170
get that chance again.

369
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,890
Put them in the cell.

370
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,650
Got it.

371
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,170
Bailing.

372
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,530
Yes.

373
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:25,930
Escort him down the mountain.

374
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:26,690
I...

375
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,210
Yes.

376
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:28,890
Come with me.

377
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,450
Master,

378
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,090
why did he pass out?

379
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,410
[You get hurt]

380
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,250
[every time you're near me.]

381
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,730
[After all this,]

382
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,970
[you still haven't changed.]

383
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,570
[You reckless little camellia pixie.]

384
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:02,690
Master,

385
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,050
don't send me away.

386
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,450
I beg you.

387
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,410
Don't make me leave.

388
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,290
Master,

389
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,850
I've figured it out.

390
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,250
They're stirred up by the scorpion spirit

391
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,370
and planned to break out of

392
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,930
the dungeon during the Sword Trial.

393
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,890
Something feels off.

394
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,650
They weren't acting on impulse.

395
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,610
They kept shouting

396
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,570
about releasing their king.

397
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,050
The Demon King was slain by

398
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,090
the Celestial Realm 10,000 years ago.

399
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,210
They were clearly misled.

400
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,250
But...

401
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:15,850
Forget it.

402
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,770
Once the Punisher descend,

403
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,770
let him handle it.

404
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,290
Master!

405
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:20,890
Yes.

406
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:22,650
Master.

407
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,810
You're late.

408
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:25,930
Where have you been?

409
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:27,850
I...

410
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,810
went to catch spirits in the nearby village.

411
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,290
Then the village chief

412
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,970
wanted me to marry his daughter

413
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,210
and wouldn't let me leave.

414
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,730
It took a while for me to get away!

415
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,450
Your stories are getting more ridiculous.

416
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,050
I noticed your power had

417
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,850
dropped by 200 years in the dungeon.

418
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,010
That's why you couldn't hold them off.

419
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,970
Did you have duels again?

420
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:51,770
Master,

421
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,570
you know what

422
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,850
Bailing's like.

423
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,250
He may seem arrogant,

424
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,890
but deep down, he's kind and honest.

425
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,410
Honest and kind?

426
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,330
And as his elder,

427
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,450
you ought to keep him in line.

428
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,050
Yes, Master.

429
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,610
Oh, er...

430
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,690
about that disciple in the dungeon...

431
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,970
Once he's recovered, send him away.

432
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,370
Master,

433
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,690
he saved me just now.

434
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,850
Please give him a chance.

435
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,690
I've decided.

436
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,490
When he's healed,

437
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,890
reward him and

438
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,290
send him down.

439
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,850
Copy that.

440
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:42,530
Bailing!

441
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,050
Why are you

442
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,330
sneaking around?

443
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,850
You really scared me!

444
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,290
I just came in to

445
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,730
grab some medicine.

446
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,210
Are you okay?

447
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,330
Don't tell me you got hurt again.

448
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,730
How is that possible?

449
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,490
Who could possibly hurt me?

450
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,050
Really?

451
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,530
You've nearly emptied all the herbs here.

452
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,210
There's still plenty left! You...

453
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,890
Oh, right,

454
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,890
when is Lujiu coming back?

455
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,170
He's been summoned

456
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:10,890
and could be back anytime.

457
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,850
Any time?

458
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,330
Did you mess with him again?

459
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,250
No way.

460
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,730
We get along great.

461
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,810
Seriously?

462
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,330
If you two have a fight,

463
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,250
don't forget to tell me.

464
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,530
Get lost.

465
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,450
Trying to climb out the window?

466
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,850
Do I look like a fool?

467
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,530
Aren't you taking me to the dungeon?

468
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,450
Why brought me here?

469
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,730
I don't wanna see you.

470
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,650
A bit crowded there today.

471
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,410
If you don't wanna see me, close your eyes.

472
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,050
You actually shut your eyes?

473
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,850
Hey, give me your hand.

474
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,370
What for?

475
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,050
What do you think?

476
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:58,810
I'll poison you

477
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,930
and make you suffer?

478
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:00,930
You!

479
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:01,970
Relax.

480
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,410
Doesn't your hand hurt?

481
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,490
This might sting a bit.

482
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,650
With that attitude,

483
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,610
it's a miracle anyone would marry you.

484
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,210
That's none of

485
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,090
your business.

486
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,210
Just let me go.

487
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:48,410
What?

488
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,570
Listen up,

489
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,890
you're staying right here.

490
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,850
The grumpiest guy in our academy

491
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,130
is about to get back.

492
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,770
If he sees you,

493
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,890
he'll probably skin you alive

494
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,290
and...

495
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,450
Getting skinned alive is

496
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,930
better than being tortured by you.

497
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,450
Quite tough.

498
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,210
If you're so ready to die,

499
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,650
why'd you run from

500
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,330
those heavenly guards?

501
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,250
I...

502
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,490
[Qijing's still out there.]

503
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,210
[The NCR is still occupied.]

504
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,410
[I have to stay alive.]

505
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,170
What?

506
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,970
I got it right, huh?

507
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,210
Honestly,

508
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,850
just stay here and focus on healing.

509
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,210
Take it easy.

510
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,970
If you die,

511
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,690
I'll turn your fur into a scarf

512
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,530
and wear it every day.

513
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,250
You!

514
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,090
You?

515
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,210
You what?

516
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,250
Are you hungry?

517
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,410
I'll get you something.

518
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,090
I'm starving. Hurry up.

519
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,170
Alright.

520
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,850
Wait, this isn't right.

521
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,810
You're ordering me around

522
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:01,810
like I'm your servant?

523
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:02,810
Obviously.

524
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,130
I've never met anyone like you.

525
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:05,930
Just go!

526
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,130
Fine, I'm going.

527
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,650
Geez, so bossy.

528
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,290
Master,

529
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,370
he's been unconscious for so long.

530
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,850
Is he badly hurt?

531
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,930
Shall I use some of my herbs...

532
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,850
No need. The injury isn't serious.

533
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:52,730
But

534
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,770
he's been sleeping for a long time.

535
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,330
Shall I go wake him up?

536
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,290
You'll never wake someone pretending to sleep.

537
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,610
So what do we do?

538
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,090
Just wait.

539
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,130
I'm starving.

540
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,570
This must be

541
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,890
the Head of the Academy's room?

542
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,730
No wonder Mom and Dad

543
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,250
didn't want me coming to Mt. Cangwu.

544
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,490
He's so terrifying

545
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,650
and cruel.

546
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,490
They must have captured Ningmeng.

547
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,210
That smells so good.

548
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,170
Tasty.

549
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,570
How am I supposed to find Ningmeng?

550
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,650
Should I

551
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,290
ask the Head of the Academy?

552
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:54,890
No way.

553
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,490
He looks terrifying.

554
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,170
What if he kills Ningmeng?

555
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,050
- I've gotta find him myself.
[- Hongning!]

556
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,330
[Hongning!]

557
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,490
[Hongning.]

558
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,370
Hongning.

559
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,210
You're awake?

560
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,170
Yeah, right.

561
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,010
What's up, Bailing?

562
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:15,770
Nothing really.

563
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,970
You saved me,

564
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,370
so I wanna say thank you.

565
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,450
No need! I was...

566
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,090
just doing what anyone would.

567
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,810
One more thing.

568
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,890
I'd like to ask

569
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,530
whether we met before.

570
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,570
No way.

571
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,330
You've got the wrong person.

572
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,930
I've got

573
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,410
one of those average faces.

574
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,610
Really. Nothing special.

575
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,450
Is that so?

576
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,810
Then why do I feel...

577
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,170
Bailing, by the way,

578
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,730
I wanna ask you something.

579
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,130
Did you recently bring back

580
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:56,850
a pixie?

581
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:58,650
[How does he know]

582
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,090
[I brought back a fox?]

583
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,090
Is it kind of

584
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,370
round?

585
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,770
[And fluffy?]

586
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,250
Shut up!

587
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,330
Stop talking nonsense.

588
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,370
I'm warning you,

589
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,890
be careful with your words.

590
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,250
Cangwu is more dangerous than you think.

591
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,290
One wrong word

592
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,810
could get you killed.

593
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,690
You hear me?

594
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,290
So keep your mouth shut.

595
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,450
Okay, okay, I will.

596
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,410
Don't be mad, Bailing.

597
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,890
I was just asking.

598
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,050
No big deal, really.

599
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,610
Look, I've been up too long.

600
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,450
I'm a little dizzy.

601
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,930
I'm gonna lie down and rest.

602
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:34,770
Wait!

603
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,850
He definitely took Ningmeng.

604
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,330
I need to

605
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,970
think of a plan to save him.

606
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:10,930
This guy's trying

607
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,250
to dig up my secret.

608
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,690
Right now, he's a

609
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,850
ticking time bomb.

610
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:16,570
No,

611
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,170
I must think of a way

612
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,970
to kick him out.

613
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,050
You're awake?

614
00:33:59,290 --> 00:33:59,850
Master.

615
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,170
You got a good appetite?

616
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,290
It's fine.

617
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,930
No. I forced the food down my throat.

618
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,090
Get dressed. I'm sending you back.

619
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,130
No, no, no!

620
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,730
Wait, hold on!

621
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,889
Suddenly I feel kinda dizzy.

622
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,210
And I'm having heart palpitations.

623
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,050
I don't feel good.

624
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:27,449
[Er...]

625
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:30,690
[My heart just started beating faster.]

626
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:34,889
[Palpitations?]

627
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,610
[You know medicine?]

628
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:39,770
[A bit.]

629
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,770
[Then take a look at me.]

630
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,449
Master, what's up?

631
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,650
It's just a condition. Don't overthink it.

632
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,770
Once you're better, I'll send you back.

633
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,090
I'm not leaving.

634
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,770
Then tell me the truth.

635
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,290
Why did you come here?

636
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,010
To cultivate.

637
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,490
That's impossible.

638
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,930
How's impossible?

639
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,530
You're not me. How would you know?

640
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,530
Because I do.

641
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,050
You didn't pass the Sword Trial.

642
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,330
You can't stay here.

643
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,850
And you, as the master,

644
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,690
should return the favor.

645
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,330
I saved your disciple.

646
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,770
And I got seriously injured.

647
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,890
You are faking it.

648
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:28,930
I'm not.

649
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:29,930
Look for yourself.

650
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:42,610
Hongning,

651
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,810
I've got to say

652
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,130
you really impressed me.

653
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,210
Brave and clever.

654
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,570
Thanks. You flatter me.

655
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,530
There are plenty of

656
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,890
gifted cultivators at the Academy.

657
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,170
Even if you got admitted,

658
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,930
that doesn't guarantee you'll make it.

659
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,930
The ones living here are elites.

660
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,610
So as newcomers,

661
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,410
you must watch your words and actions.

662
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:05,730
Cangwu Academy

663
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,410
is known for its strict rules.

664
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,090
Talk less,

665
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,090
and do more.

666
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:12,770
Got it?

667
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:13,490
Yes.

668
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,930
I'm stick this strip on you!

669
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,210
Yep! You lost! Hold still!

670
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,610
You lost. Here comes the strip.

671
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,570
Take this.

672
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,730
And another one!

673
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,210
Why are you targeting me?

674
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,050
Trying to cheat now?

675
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,450
What is going on in here?

676
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,930
Is this how you behave at Cangwu?

677
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,170
Listen!

678
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,010
Clean up your dorm

679
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,850
and get fully dressed.

680
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,530
If I ever see

681
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,770
such a mess again,

682
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,050
you'll be driven out!

683
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,650
Yes.

684
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:54,650
That includes you!

685
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:58,650
Me?

686
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,410
Didn't you say

687
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,330
this place had strict rules?

688
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,570
That's 'cause...

689
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,730
they're on break now!

690
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:12,810
Move!

691
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,850
I will...

692
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:17,650
Wait.

693
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,770
The more I look at you,

694
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,650
the more familiar you seem.

695
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,850
Where did we meet?

696
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,570
No way.

697
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,050
This is the first time

698
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,410
I've ever left home.

699
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,610
Think about it,

700
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,170
if I'd met someone

701
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,970
as handsome and

702
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,090
powerful as you before,

703
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,970
I would've come to Mt. Cangwu

704
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,610
a long time ago.

705
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,090
Fair enough.

706
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,530
It's not too late now.

707
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,690
Go inside and get some rest.

708
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,010
This is where I'm staying?

709
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:56,690
Of course.

710
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,930
How could I rest?

711
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,130
I need to start studying.

712
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,650
Bailing, teach me how to cultivate.

713
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,130
Cultivate?

714
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:08,770
[If I can master]

715
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,530
[their cultivating techniques,]

716
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,530
[I might be able to stay here.]

717
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,690
[If he can't keep up with others,]

718
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,650
[I'll have an excuse to kick him out.]

719
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,690
Let me introduce myself again.

720
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,410
I'm Bailing.

721
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,770
the youngest yet the most gifted

722
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,330
disciple on Mt. Cangwu.

723
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,850
Starting today,

724
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,370
I'll be guiding you in cultivation.

725
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,210
Yes.

726
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,010
Did you understand what I said?

727
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,290
Yes. Got it.

728
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,690
Thank you.

729
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,530
Listen,

730
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,170
cultivation builds from the inside out

731
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,890
and the bottom up.

732
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,090
If your foundation isn't steady,

733
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,890
no matter how talented you are,

734
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,050
you won't get far.

735
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,530
Besides,

736
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,450
there are many prodigies

737
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,650
on Mt. Cangwu.

738
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,250
Take me

739
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:04,890
as an example.

740
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,530
I've been praised since I was a kid.

741
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,210
But do I ever brag in front of you?

742
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:09,850
I didn't...

743
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,010
Well, Bailing,

744
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,450
maybe we should get back to breath control?

745
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,250
It's energy refinement.

746
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,370
Right.

747
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,210
The refinement involves

748
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,010
three types of energy.

749
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,250
The first is essence...

750
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,490
[his place is huge.]

751
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,410
[Where on earth can I find Ningmeng?]

752
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,810
The one we're focusing on

753
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,210
is spiritual energy.

754
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,610
It flows through your spiritual root.

755
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,130
You draw the essence

756
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,370
of nature into your body.

757
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:43,450
Master.

758
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,170
Master.

759
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,050
Master, what brings you here?

760
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,250
I was in seclusion for days

761
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,890
and didn't check in on their training.

762
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,570
Since I had time today,

763
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,850
I thought I'd drop by.

764
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,250
Where's Hongning?

765
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,010
He...

766
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:00,890
Hongning?

767
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,210
Bailing is teaching him energy refinement.

768
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:04,770
Energy refinement?

769
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:06,970
With Bailing?

770
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,090
Keep your eyes on this.

771
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,250
Now slowly use your spiritual energy

772
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,570
to control them.

773
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,050
There's plenty to learn.

774
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,810
[Lunch time! Lunch time!]

775
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,610
[Lunch? The fox...]

776
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,770
I have something to do. Gotta go!

777
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,130
You haven't finished the lesson!

778
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,930
It's all about enlightenment.

779
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,810
Got it?

780
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,490
Enlightenment?

781
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,730
How am I supposed to do it?

782
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,050
Did you get it?

783
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,490
Maybe a little.

784
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:55,290
What is this?

785
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,010
It's

786
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,730
my report on Cangwu Academy.

787
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,250
A report?

788
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,170
Go ahead.

789
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,810
Bailing is

790
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,810
the youngest disciple

791
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,770
and also an ice pixie.

792
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,010
Tiannanxing ranks second.

793
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,170
He's a tough guy.

794
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,050
The Sword Trial

795
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,210
was hosted by Master Wenxin.

796
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,530
There's one person

797
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,930
we haven't met yet, the eldest disciple,

798
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:22,850
Lujiu.

799
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,930
It's said that he worships our Master

800
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,730
and follows his every command.

801
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,970
What about our Master?

802
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,210
He's the Head of Cangwu Academy,

803
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,290
the legendary Jinxiu.

804
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,730
Jinxiu?

805
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,530
100 years ago, he rose out of nowhere,

806
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,250
slayed evils in Mt. Cangwu,

807
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,210
and restored peace.

808
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,290
He's kept this region safe.

809
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,090
Since then, he's

810
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,530
wiped out countless

811
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,810
powerful evil spirits.

812
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,690
But

813
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,290
lately,

814
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,210
he's often been off the grid,

815
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,130
probably due to a bottleneck in cultivation.

816
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,850
How do you know all this?

817
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,250
Old habit.

818
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,770
Before

819
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,250
I came to here,

820
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,930
I was a constable

821
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,970
in Ganzhou.

822
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,410
[Guess if I wanna find Ningmeng,]

823
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,050
[I have to go through him.]

824
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,410
Baibuqu,

825
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,290
I think I've figured it out.

826
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,970
I think I got something too!

827
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,970
What is it?

828
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,250
I...

829
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,450
Greetings, Master.

830
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,330
Master, I've seen the whole world.

831
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:08,850
I've felt I'm really sleepy.

832
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:10,930
Why are you here?

833
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,330
Have you recovered?

834
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,210
Not yet,

835
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:15,930
but Bailing said

836
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,010
cultivating would

837
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,050
help me heal faster.

838
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,090
Remember,

839
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,330
the core of the cultivation

840
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:28,570
is focus.

841
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,290
Complete focus.

842
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,410
Feel the spiritual energy from deep within.

843
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,130
Now, tell me, what do you see?

844
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,210
I see total darkness.

845
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,370
Hongning, what about you?

846
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,770
I see you, Master.

847
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:09,530
[You!]

848
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:14,530
[You...]

849
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,890
[Didn't I tell you to stay focused?]

850
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,370
[Why did you turn into a peony?]

851
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,530
[Because all I was thinking about was you.]

852
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:23,450
Nonsense!

853
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:30,650
He's angry?

854
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,970
[No. I can't let her stay here.]

855
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:35,290
Master.

856
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,010
Stop that. Keep an eye on Hongning.

857
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:37,890
Don't let him wander around.

858
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:39,970
No wandering around?

859
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:41,570
Like this?

860
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,130
Or like this?

861
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:44,730
Gosh!

862
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:46,010
No wandering around?
