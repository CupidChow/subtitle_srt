[EP07]

3
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,400
Hongning?

4
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,520
Sir,

5
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
you really came.

6
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,639
Stop right there.

7
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,880
This is dripping wet.

8
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,840
Did something

9
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,280
threaten you?

10
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,960
No.

11
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,560
I was trying to chat

12
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,240
with the Lilybell,

13
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,440
but it ignored me.

14
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,440
I regret ever giving you that plant.

15
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,120
It climbed out by itself!

16
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,640
Why talking with your back?

17
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,240
Think about it.

18
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,560
Why do I

19
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,400
always find you in bath?

20
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,920
You like bathing that much?

21
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,960
Can you imagine if...

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,240
Bathing?

23
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,200
You mean soaking?

24
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,840
Back on Mt. Baizhou,

25
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
I loved hot springs with the pixies.

26
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
So comfy.

27
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,040
So you bathe

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,520
with others down here?

29
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,240
Before my human form,

30
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,520
they'd dunk me in springs

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,920
and rain pools.

32
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,640
Next time I'll take you.

33
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,000
By Floralia Palace law,

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,160
Hongning may

35
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,120
bathe only at midnight,

36
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
alone, and must never

37
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
mind-link me while doing it.

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,920
Break it again

39
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,800
and I'll seize your Lilybell.

40
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,880
Since when is that a rule?

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,600
Just now.

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
You're being mean.

43
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,840
Wait!

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,120
What now?

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,440
The herbal mix I made for you

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,360
is ready.

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,280
I can walk by myself.

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,240
Let's go.

49
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Hongning, how dare you!

50
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,800
Well...

51
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,080
Covering my eyes is such a pain.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,880
See no evil.

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,560
It's etiquette.

54
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,080
Why so many rules?

55
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,159
Mortal or immortal,

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,200
desire breeds want,

57
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
want breeds chaos.

58
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,640
The Northern Celestial Realm

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,159
set codes to curb it.

60
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,159
Shared rules for all.

61
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
Cultivation starts by

62
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,480
restraining desire.

63
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Even gods must.

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,400
Chaos turns gods

65
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,520
into demons,

66
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,720
and Heaven strikes them down.

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,080
How did you

68
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,120
get hurt so badly?

69
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,560
It...

70
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,080
It must hurt terribly.

71
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,520
No one

72
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,120
has ever wept for me.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,440
Have you ever cried for anyone?

74
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,120
Human,

75
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,000
demon,

76
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,920
or god?

77
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,120
Sir,

78
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,560
those wounds are backlash

79
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,720
from the Oceanic Codex.

80
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,520
These herbs

81
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
can't heal you.

82
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,720
They'll inflame the cut,

83
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,760
especially the Baihe nectar.

84
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,440
It's all right.

85
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,840
All right?

86
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,880
You refuse my

87
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,720
celestial remedies

88
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,880
yet prefer this?

89
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,920
Well,

90
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,920
she put her heart into it.

91
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,240
Romance makes poison

92
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,880
of any draught.

93
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,760
What...

94
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,400
Wait.

95
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,640
That is good medicine.

96
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
Good medicine indeed.

97
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,280
Still, the backlash

98
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,880
grows worse. How strange.

99
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
Don't be scared.

100
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,480
This is dew.

101
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,120
Drink it now.

102
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,080
Slow down.

103
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,920
Easy.

104
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,560
Easy.

105
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,680
You've been dry so long.

106
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,960
Drink slowly.

107
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,840
Here's fresh soil too.

108
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,480
You can have it.

109
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,240
You're a red camellia?

110
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,400
We are from the same clan.

111
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,679
I'm a camellia pixie.

112
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,480
Pixie?

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,039
You passed the trial?

114
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,880
No,

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,240
I broke Heaven's rules

116
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,640
and got caught.

117
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,440
A pixie here

118
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,320
in Floralia Palace.

119
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,040
So,

120
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,880
where did you come from?

121
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,320
Mt. Baizhou.

122
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,680
I'm from Mt. Baizhou too.

123
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,800
The Baicha

124
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,960
who ascended next door,

125
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,120
that was you?

126
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,880
Yes.

127
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,240
But you're already a flower immortal.

128
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,040
Why treat you like this?

129
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,000
I reached Heaven

130
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,200
to claim my immortal register...

131
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,200
Thank you.

132
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,440
Thank you.

133
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,840
Thank you.

134
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,360
Thank you.

135
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,480
Where are you from?

136
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I'm Baicha,

137
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,920
from Mt. Baizhou.

138
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,280
Mt. Baizhou,

139
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,080
dens of demons?

140
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,400
Yes.

141
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,360
Wait there.

142
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,200
Move.

143
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,400
My turn.

144
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,360
Thank you.

145
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,800
I...

146
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,080
Thank you.

147
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,840
Thank you.

148
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,240
Thank you.

149
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,080
Please,

150
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,960
my register...

151
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,360
Cousin!

152
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,400
You're Ziteng?

153
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,480
I am.

154
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,000
Kept me waiting forever.

155
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,720
Forgive me.

156
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,800
Tribulation was hard.

157
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,160
I'm late.

158
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,760
Thank you, Envoy Apricot.

159
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
From this day

160
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,520
you're fairy Ziteng.

161
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,520
Come, into Floralia Palace.

162
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,160
Envoy Apricot,

163
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,000
well,

164
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,160
what about my register?

165
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,960
Still here?

166
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,880
The last register is taken.

167
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,120
Nothing left for you.

168
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,240
Off you go.

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,680
Why?

170
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,160
Passing the trial

171
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,000
should earn a register.

172
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,200
Who said so?

173
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,240
Heaven's decree.

174
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,160
The decree also says

175
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,840
pixies can't become gods.

176
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,080
Passing the trial

177
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,520
means nothing

178
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,440
if fate says no.

179
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,320
It said no to you.

180
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,480
Run along.

181
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,520
So I lack that fate

182
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,120
yet...

183
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,880
this pixie gets hers?

184
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
That "pixie"

185
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,920
is now fairy Ziteng.

186
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,360
One more word

187
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,520
and I'll throw you out.

188
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,600
Come on.

189
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,160
That Apricot Envoy was cruel.

190
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,640
She had no right.

191
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
I wouldn't leave,

192
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,400
so I hid in the Withered Garden.

193
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,480
No dew, no rain.

194
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,400
I withered

195
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,720
until you revived me.

196
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,440
Don't worry,

197
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,680
with me around

198
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,920
no one will bully you anymore.

199
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,280
They look down on me

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,280
for being a pixie.

201
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
I thought ascension

202
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,680
would shed that label.

203
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,000
Turns out,

204
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,480
nothing changed.

205
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,360
Why are we lesser?

206
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,480
You're not wrong.

207
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,520
It's them.

208
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
We have hands

209
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,240
and feet like they do,

210
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,800
only our

211
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,880
homes differ.

212
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,640
Why are they deemed superior?

213
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,600
I thought

214
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,960
you stayed

215
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,520
because you

216
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,520
revered the gods.

217
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,200
I'm staying,

218
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,000
but not to worship.

219
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,920
I owe a debt.

220
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,440
What debt?

221
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,920
The Floral Deity once saved me.

222
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,880
I must repay him.

223
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't worry.

224
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,880
He'll see

225
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,640
justice done for you.

226
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,240
No,

227
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,480
I broke Heaven's rules

228
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,760
by hiding here.

229
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,080
He won't spare me.

230
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,200
Then what?

231
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,480
You can't live here forever.

232
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,520
If you're scared,

233
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,160
I'll sneak you

234
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,560
back to Mt. Baizhou.

235
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,760
But...

236
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
I still want to be immortal.

237
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,360
You feel it's wrong too,

238
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,640
don't you?

239
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,360
If that's your choice,

240
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,040
follow your heart.

241
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,520
Every flower

242
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,400
should bloom

243
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,760
where it wishes.

244
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,240
I don't know how to help yet,

245
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,680
but whenever you need me,

246
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,640
I'll be here.

247
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,280
No one

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,560
has ever cared for me

249
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,200
this way.

250
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,520
To think we would meet here.

251
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,280
Don't worry.

252
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,800
From now on,

253
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,400
we're friends.

254
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,600
From now on,

255
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,600
you're my best friend,

256
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,360
and my only friend.

257
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,000
Sir.

258
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,240
Sir.

259
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,560
What is he looking for?

260
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,760
He's been circling an hour.

261
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,320
Wonder what he's after.

262
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,920
Greetings, Sir.

263
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,320
What are you looking for?

264
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,880
One blossom on this magnolia is missing.

265
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,800
Forgive me.

266
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,960
Magnolia Fairy is still away,

267
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,800
so I'm tending it.

268
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,520
It's all right.

269
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,960
Magnolias are fussy.

270
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,800
Still, in Flora Grove

271
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,240
a gap spoils the view.

272
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,360
Sir,

273
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,280
please,

274
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,480
don't trouble yourself...

275
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,480
It's okay.

276
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,000
A true Floral Deity handles every pot.

277
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,160
No.

278
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,920
Let go.

279
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
You are Floral Deity.

280
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,280
Leave it to me.

281
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,720
Then...

282
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,480
let's go together.

283
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,480
Very well.

284
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,720
Hongning,

285
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,840
look who's here.

286
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,560
Shaoyao.

287
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,400
Shaoyao.

288
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Shaoyao.

289
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,000
Sir,

290
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,480
you've come to watch me train?

291
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,120
No,

292
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,600
just delivering this pot.

293
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,280
Not to watch me cultivate?

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,920
Oh, just this one pot?

295
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,960
Shaoyao, what about you?

296
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,240
I'm also here to drop one off.

297
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,360
Two people

298
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,480
for a single plant?

299
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,760
Does any law say

300
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,240
only one courier per pot?

301
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,120
Guess not.

302
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,160
All right, I'll place it inside.

303
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,599
It bloomed fine.

304
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,319
Why banish it to the Withered Garden?

305
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,160
One blossom short.

306
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,599
It looked odd among thousands.

307
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,760
True.

308
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,720
The Flora Grove is vast.

309
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,480
I'll take my leave.

310
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,480
Sir!

311
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,040
Yes?

312
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,720
Well,

313
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,720
take care.

314
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,200
A white camellia pixie!

315
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,760
Leave Hongning out of this.

316
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,800
She has nothing to do with this.

317
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,080
I rescued him.

318
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,560
No,

319
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,800
I found him in the Withered Garden.

320
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,480
I restored his energy.

321
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,720
White camellia pixie,

322
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,920
this palace is tightly guarded.

323
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,640
How did you slip inside?

324
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,840
I admit my crime.

325
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,080
Sir,

326
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,880
he ascended by passing trial.

327
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,480
The truth is...

328
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,920
Apricot Envoy stole his register!

329
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,200
That's a lie!

330
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,920
Sir,

331
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,920
that wasn't true.

332
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,400
I never met him!

333
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,160
Sir,

334
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,360
Hongning speaks the truth.

335
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,080
I once braved lightning at Mt. Baizhou,

336
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,320
seeking to change my fate,

337
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
to join the immortals.

338
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,000
But sadly,

339
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,360
though I passed the heavenly trial,

340
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,080
in the end,

341
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,360
the Envoy, for selfish gain,

342
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,920
blocked me outside Floralia Palace.

343
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,360
I swear, I speak the truth.

344
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,880
White camellia pixie,

345
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,960
you did pass the trial,

346
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,120
but without a register

347
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,120
you're still a pixie,

348
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,840
now hiding in the Withered Garden.

349
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,000
By Heaven's law

350
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,120
you should be expelled from Heaven.

351
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,400
Sir.

352
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,840
Envoy Apricot,

353
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,520
any explanations?

354
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,560
He comes from Mt. Baizhou,

355
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,360
a place swarming with demons.

356
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,360
And now he's skulking in the Garden.

357
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,440
His intention is unknown.

358
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,440
I only meant to protect the Court.

359
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,400
To stop future disasters.

360
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,480
Consideration ends by the third violation

361
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,880
You've abused

362
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,640
Heaven's code

363
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,160
and misused registers.

364
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,880
Such arrogance

365
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,240
cannot be tolerated!

366
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,600
As of now

367
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,640
you're stripped of rank,

368
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,920
demoted to junior immortal,

369
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,160
and assigned to guard Flora Grove.

370
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,800
Mercy, Sir!

371
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,800
A pixie hidden in Floralia Palace

372
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,960
shames us all.

373
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,120
From this moment,

374
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,680
no one is to gossip outside these walls.

375
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,720
Break the rule and face punishment.

376
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,840
Understood.

377
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,400
Envoy Plum,

378
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,640
escort Kunlun and Hongning.

379
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,600
They're not

380
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,840
to take a single step out.

381
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,960
Yes, Sir, your highness.

382
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,840
Envoy Apricot.

383
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,240
Envoy Plum.

384
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,960
Envoy Plum,

385
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,040
wrong title.

386
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,360
I'm just a junior immortal now.

387
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,760
Sir Jinxiu is furious.

388
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,000
That's why he punished you so harshly.

389
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,520
Lay low for now.

390
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,040
Reflect and stay out of trouble.

391
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,800
Don't stir up more mess.

392
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,480
So you came to laugh at me?

393
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,720
Unlike you,

394
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
I was born low, and had to

395
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,600
fight for every ounce of respect.

396
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,520
Excuse me?

397
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,360
I was born a pixie,

398
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,840
clawed my way up here.

399
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,880
In this Floralia Palace,

400
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,040
everyone calls me "Envoy",

401
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,600
yet snickers

402
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,040
at my bloodline.

403
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,760
You're overthinking.

404
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,000
Envoy Plum,

405
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,800
you grew up in this palace.

406
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,080
You have no idea

407
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,600
how hard the climb is

408
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,160
for us groundlings.

409
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,320
Since I took this post

410
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
I've been strict and fair,

411
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
exactly what the

412
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,400
his Highness preached.

413
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,560
He's the one bending rules now,

414
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,040
not me.

415
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,040
You're too stubborn.

416
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,840
Yes,

417
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,160
stubborn, not slippery.

418
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,000
Gods are gods,

419
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,680
pixies are pixies.

420
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,280
Reward and punishment must stay clear.

421
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,360
Yet he

422
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,800
took that red camellia pixie to Heaven

423
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,040
and tolerated a white camellia bloom up here.

424
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,680
I won't let it slide.

425
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,280
Baicha.

426
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,760
Baicha.

427
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,480
Baicha.

428
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,120
Hongning?

429
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:24,960
How bold!

430
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,200
How dare you block the way?

431
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:26,920
Seize her!

432
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,200
I...

433
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,840
-Stop!
-I...

434
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,360
Greetings, Sir Kunlun.

435
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,480
Leave Baicha with me.

436
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,720
He's due at the Demotion Pool.

437
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,040
A short wait won't hurt.

438
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,200
Heaven's penalty can't stall.

439
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,680
Baicha isn't on the pool list.

440
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,800
His Highness added him off-record.

441
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,760
If Sir Taiyi hears this,

442
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,640
Baicha would be dead.

443
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
Difficult old man.

444
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,440
Tell me,

445
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,240
would delaying

446
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,320
the penalty be worse,

447
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,040
or defying me?

448
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,000
Uh...

449
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,400
Baicha,

450
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,040
I'm sorry.

451
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,240
I failed to protect you.

452
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,880
No at all.

453
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm the one who got you into trouble.

454
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,960
If it weren't for you,

455
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,240
I'd be dead in the Withered Garden already.

456
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,520
But you're denied access to immortal.

457
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,760
It's so unfair.

458
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,600
They're immortals, and I'm just a pixie.

459
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,600
That's my fate.

460
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,520
Hongning.

461
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,120
Thank you for saving my life.

462
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,400
I'll remember your kindness

463
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,880
for the rest of my life.

464
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,520
What are you going to do now?

465
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,880
What will happen to him down in Demotion Pool?

466
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,800
Demotion Pool

467
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,080
is the place to punish wrongdoing immortals.

468
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,120
They will be no longer immortals after demotion.

469
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,360
But he's not even an immortal yet.

470
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,800
Then he will be demoted to be a pixie

471
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,320
that can never upgrade again.

472
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,960
Hongning.

473
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,320
Trust my brother's decision.

474
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,520
Hongning.

475
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,000
Thanks to you, I'm lucky enough to

476
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,920
still be a pixie.

477
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,800
I'm not obsessed with becoming immortal anymore.

478
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
You have immortal roots

479
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,280
and the bond with

480
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,520
Floral Deity.

481
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,200
Work hard on your cultivation.

482
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,160
You will be the first immortal from Mt. Baizhou.

483
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,280
After that,

484
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,840
I'll be proud that I have an immortal friend.

485
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,520
Baicha.

486
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,440
Sir Kunlun.

487
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,440
It's the time now.

488
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,680
Alright, alright.

489
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,080
Take him now.

490
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,440
Hongning!

491
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,280
Hongning!

492
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,040
I'll pray for you

493
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,440
whenever I can.

494
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,280
Baicha!

495
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,040
Take care of yourself!

496
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,000
Sir Taiyi.

497
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,880
The sentence has been carried out today.

498
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,520
Seven immortals have been deprived of power

499
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,520
by Demotion Pool.

500
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,760
And twelve evil spirits were

501
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,880
sent to the Kylin Lair

502
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,960
waiting for Sir Jinxiu to punish.

503
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,720
Give me the list of these seven immortals.

504
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,480
Yes, sir.

505
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,160
That's all?

506
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,080
Yes, sir.

507
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,560
How dare you

508
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,080
harbor evil spirits

509
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,440
and obstruct the execution?

510
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,400
Mercy, Sir Taiyi!

511
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,240
I didn't!

512
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,000
Guards!

513
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,960
Take him to the Demotion Pool!

514
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,920
Mercy! Sir Taiyi!

515
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,440
I was just following orders!

516
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,200
Mercy!

517
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,080
Mercy! Sir Taiyi!

518
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,360
Envoy Apricot was right.

519
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
These camellias

520
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,720
are really something.

521
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,560
Sir Jinxiu.

522
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,000
Baicha was taken?

523
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,440
Yes.

524
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,800
Did Hongning go with him?

525
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,240
Don't worry.

526
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,280
She was taken

527
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,840
back to the Withered Garden

528
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,440
and locked up.

529
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,240
There's no way she can

530
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,240
sneak out again.

531
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,840
But...

532
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,600
but no one could

533
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,640
stop Sir Kunlun

534
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,320
from getting in.

535
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,800
Sir Jinxiu.

536
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,520
Speak.

537
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,600
Hongning and Sir Kunlun

538
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,560
were arrested by Celestial Military.

539
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
No lies and excuses!

540
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,800
NCR and the East Sea

541
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,280
complained

542
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,040
that you harbor

543
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
that white camellia pixie.

544
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,400
The prohibition of pixies in Celestial Realm

545
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,600
is not to be violated.

546
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,280
Who gave you the nerve to do that?

547
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,720
What's done is done

548
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,560
and he was taken to Demotion Pool.

549
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,640
I know those seniors

550
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,040
have hated me for long

551
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,000
and gave me hard time by this excuse.

552
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,360
What more do you want?

553
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,440
You've really grown up, haven't you?

554
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,160
Since your release,

555
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,080
I thought you had learned your lesson.

556
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,720
Before long,

557
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,280
you've made such a big mistake again!

558
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,920
You think you can

559
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,800
get away with everything?

560
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,800
Of course not!

561
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,960
Since I was born,

562
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,760
you have been keen

563
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,600
on punishing me.

564
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,920
I know you've

565
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,840
looked down on me,

566
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,640
thinking I'm an eyesore.

567
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,600
Why don't you

568
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,360
send me to the Demotion Pool

569
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,800
or Kylin Lair? That will

570
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,640
end all your troubles!

571
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,680
Enough!

572
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,920
Father, Mother.

573
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,240
Jinxiu.

574
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,360
You've come just in time.

575
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,640
Your brother befriended

576
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,760
evil pixies

577
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,000
and messing up Floralia Palace.

578
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,320
You're in charge of the Palace.

579
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,840
Tell me what happened

580
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,120
and punish him harshly

581
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,360
without mercy!

582
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,720
Please rest assured.

583
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,840
I will punish him severely.

584
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,720
However, he has got nothing to do

585
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,600
with the harboring.

586
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,800
It's my responsibility.

587
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,560
What do you mean?

588
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,720
Father.

589
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,880
Baicha was qualified for becoming immortal,

590
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,080
yet he missed the time to register

591
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,840
and was stranded in Withered Garden.

592
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,640
Now he's been expelled.

593
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,680
In that case,

594
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,320
that's the end of the ruckus.

595
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,040
Baicha might be pardoned for being stranded,

596
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,560
but rules are rules.

597
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,400
His clan will be banned from

598
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,400
blooming for a hundred years.

599
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,160
Your Majesty.

600
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,600
There's another pixie

601
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,600
in the Floralia Palace.

602
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,600
What?

603
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,840
There's another?

604
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,840
Bring her up!

605
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,120
Your Majesty.

606
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,720
Your Majesty, Baicha was...

607
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,440
Silence!

608
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,000
Before you're

609
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,680
spoken to.

610
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,920
Jinxiu.

611
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,760
It's you who brought

612
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,960
this camellia to Celestial Realm?

613
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,040
Yes.

614
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,520
Celestial Realm forbids pixies.

615
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,600
As the Punisher,

616
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,600
how dare you violate the law?

617
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,720
I have seen the error of my ways.

618
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,920
I got carried away.

619
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,880
But this camellia pixie

620
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,560
is innocent.

621
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,600
May Your Majesty...

622
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,080
Enough!

623
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,520
I'm tired of excuses.

624
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,560
I'll punish you for breaking rules.

625
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,760
It's just that I never expected you

626
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,000
to be so ridiculous!

627
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,680
It seems that Kunlun's

628
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,120
disruptive behaviors come from his brother!

629
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,560
Tell me.

630
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,480
Does she have anything to do with

631
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,600
that previous camellia?

632
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,640
You indulge her so much.

633
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,200
Does that also mean

634
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,520
that you like her?

635
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,200
Father.

636
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,280
She was brought here as a warning

637
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,520
and to take punishment for her

638
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,680
violation beneath.

639
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,880
Nothing personal.

640
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,400
I didn't expect her to

641
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
make such a big mistake

642
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,160
instead of reflecting on herself.

643
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,320
It's all my fault.

644
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,200
As the Punisher,

645
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,720
it's my duty to take the blame.

646
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,200
I'll punish her to the mortal world

647
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,520
immediately

648
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,040
Jinxiu.

649
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,200
[Go and get your own 81 Celestial Punishments]

650
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,160
[according to the rules.]

651
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:24,920
[Yes, Sir.]

652
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,680
[You are the Punisher of Celestial Realm,]

653
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,560
[an example to the immortals]

654
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,400
[and the embodiment of rules.]

655
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,920
[You can't afford]

656
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,840
[to make a single mistake.]

657
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,320
[Do you understand?]

658
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,120
I apologize for my error.

659
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Didn't Sir Taiyi know

660
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,239
that you got such serious injuries?

661
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,040
He hits you badly every time.

662
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,280
It's alright.

663
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,480
Sir.

664
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,560
Hongning should leave now.

665
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,760
Official Chrysanthemum.

666
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,560
Out.

667
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,520
I'll take my leave.

668
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,920
Hongning.

669
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,880
Hongning.

670
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,880
Shaoyao.

671
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,800
Give me some more time.

672
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,880
Be quick.

673
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,200
Hongning.

674
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,480
If you get

675
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
bullied beneath,

676
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,360
turn to any peony of my clan,

677
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,560
and they will help you.

678
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,960
Thank you, Shaoyao.

679
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,120
These are

680
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
nectar and wine from cotton rose,

681
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,760
hibiscus blossom and sunflower.

682
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,600
These are

683
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,640
the farewell letters

684
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,680
from the Morning glories.

685
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
They should've seen you off, but they're taken to

686
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,760
rebuild Flora Grove now.

687
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,920
I can't take these.

688
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,120
They're too valuable.

689
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,880
They took you too much efforts.

690
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,840
I can't.

691
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,400
You must take it.

692
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,040
If you don't,

693
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,480
they'll blame me.

694
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,560
Take it.

695
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,520
Okay.

696
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,680
Thank you, Shaoyao.

697
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,920
Hongning.

698
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,600
You've helped me so much,

699
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,200
but I'm not able to do the same for you.

700
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,440
I'm so sorry.

701
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,360
That's not true!

702
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,680
I came here, got to know you

703
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,680
and become friends with you.

704
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,200
It's the best thing that happened to me.

705
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,360
Really?

706
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,800
I'll try to make some mistakes

707
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,160
to be demoted to see you.

708
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,800
Don't!

709
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,000
You should keep cultivating.

710
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,200
Think about it.

711
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,320
Maybe we have chance to

712
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,440
reunite at the Floralia Palace in the future.

713
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,200
You're right.

714
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,080
Then I'll stay here

715
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,360
and wait for you.

716
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,240
It's about time.

717
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,640
I'll leave now.

718
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,560
Look after yourself.

719
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,480
Take care.

720
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Stay well.

721
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,600
You can go back.

722
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,800
I can take care of the rest.

723
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,680
Yes.

724
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,520
Come on.

725
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,080
Don't be so upset.

726
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,760
Pity that you haven't finished your punishment,

727
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,920
but don't worry,

728
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,160
I'll be up here

729
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,120
to punish you

730
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
after you go back.

731
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,920
I'll be watching you.

732
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,120
Official Chrysanthemum.

733
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,720
Can I see Sir Jinxiu

734
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,240
one more time before I go?

735
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,160
I'm begging you.

736
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,040
Can't you behave?

737
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,800
Do you know how much trouble

738
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,160
you've caused him this time?

739
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,160
But I couldn't just stand

740
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,280
and watch Baicha suffering.

741
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You're just a pixie.

742
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,400
Why do you always have to

743
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,600
challenge the conventions

744
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,720
of the immortals?

745
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,600
You know?

746
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,520
The immortals rule the Celestial Realm.

747
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,200
Their rules are above all.

748
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,560
You're a just an insignificant pixie.

749
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,160
Why do you have to go against the authority?

750
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,240
Listen.

751
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,760
Don't

752
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,480
blame Sir Jinxiu this time.

753
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,640
He's doing this

754
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,840
for you.

755
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,440
Under that circumstance,

756
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,960
if he hadn't done so,

757
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,440
you

758
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,240
might have been put into Kylin Lair

759
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,560
and been annihilated.

760
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,680
I understand.

761
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,120
I just want to see him one more time.

762
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,880
If I don't, the next time we meet

763
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,520
will be a long, long,

764
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,120
long time from now.

765
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,240
You understand?

766
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,640
You don't!

767
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,680
I don't think

768
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,600
you've ever understood!

769
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,360
You don't.

770
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,440
Sir Jinxiu is the Emperor Star!

771
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,440
Once passing trial,

772
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,400
he will be back to Midheaven.

773
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,360
Even though you could come back,

774
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,760
you couldn't see him.

775
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:08,960
What are you doing?

776
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,400
You're going to summon him by this?

777
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,560
That's a high-level spell.

778
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,920
Unless it's authorized by Sir Jinxiu himself,

779
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,280
even Emperor and Empress

780
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,600
can't summon him at random.

781
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,520
Don't you understand? I tell you...

782
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,480
Sir Jinxiu.

783
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,840
My apologies, Sir Jinxiu.

784
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,080
Why waste your chance to summon?

785
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,760
Sir Jinxiu,

786
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,840
I have something cooking on stove.

787
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,720
Could you take her to the Gate for me?

788
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,680
The Lilybell is for you

789
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,080
to call for help in times of trouble.

790
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,720
I'll come wherever I am.

791
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,400
Don't use it for no reason.

792
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
Sir Jinxiu.

793
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,440
Why do you look so bad?

794
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,560
Are you being punished again?

795
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm okay.

796
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,320
Sorry.

797
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,560
I didn't realize the consequences.

798
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,200
It's my bad.

799
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,360
You did nothing wrong.

800
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,440
The celestial rule isn't wrong, either.

801
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,960
You wanted justice for Baicha.

802
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,640
But the celestial rule

803
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,360
is for keeping order

804
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,680
for the Realms.

805
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,560
Will you miss me

806
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,680
after I'm gone?

807
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,440
Leaving

808
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,160
is for your own good.

809
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,400
But I'm going to miss you.

810
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,480
Hongning.

811
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,640
If I say

812
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,040
you have chance to become a junior immortal

813
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,960
if you keep cultivating yourself,

814
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,240
will you do it?

815
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,160
Will that enable

816
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,440
me to see you?

817
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,720
You could stay in the Floralia Palace.

818
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,160
Really?

819
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,040
Then I will do that!

820
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,640
No matter how hard it is,

821
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,440
as long as I can see you again

822
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,000
and stay at Floralia Palace,

823
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,320
I'm afraid of nothing!

824
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,440
Sir Jinxiu.

825
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,240
I'm leaving now.

826
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,320
Can you give me a hug?

827
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,080
Work hard on your cultivation.

828
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,440
Then let's say goodbye.

829
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,360
Wait.

830
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,480
I'm not sure I can protect you every time

831
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,320
when you in mortal world.

832
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,400
This Camellia Hairpin

833
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,600
can transform into a sword

834
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,880
and protect you in danger.

835
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,440
Sir Jinxiu.

836
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,560
Why are you so nice to me?

837
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,280
It's time to go.

838
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,760
Sir Jinxiu.

839
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,880
Wait for me!

840
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,240
Hongning.

841
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,920
You will become immortal.

842
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,960
Be quick!

843
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:22,960
What are you thinking?

844
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,920
Alright, alright.

845
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,320
Just be quick.

846
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,600
Look!

847
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:26,960
It's... it's...

848
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:27,640
Where?

849
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,800
It's... it's...

850
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,480
it's Baicha, the immortal!

851
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,920
No way.

852
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,040
He's home by now.

853
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,880
It must be him.

854
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,480
It's him!

855
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,360
Yes, it's him!

856
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,240
Sir Baicha.

857
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,080
What an attitude

858
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,440
as an aristocrat!

859
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Sir Baicha, where are you going?

860
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,640
Back on cards.

861
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,680
Come on.

862
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,400
Your Majesty.

863
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,800
The servant in Nebula Pavilion said that

864
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,840
Emperor Stars are still in the mysterious clouds.

865
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,000
There's no other change yet.

866
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,080
Alright. Leave.

867
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

868
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,200
Come out.

869
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,320
Your Majesty.

870
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,400
How's Envoy Apricot doing?

871
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,800
Your Majesty,

872
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,240
she's been punished in Flora Grove.

873
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,520
Sir Jinxiu was really irritated this time.

874
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,800
I'm afraid

875
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,920
she won't be able to

876
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,320
greet you for a while.

877
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,200
I knew her bossiness

878
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,800
would get her in trouble one day.

879
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,160
She is reckless.

880
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,680
I will remind her.

881
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,080
I'll do my best

882
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,120
to serve Your Majesty these days.

883
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,280
You're a clever girl.

884
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,600
What about Kunlun?

885
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,720
Sir Kunlun is very powerful.

886
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,960
He disappeared right after returning to the Palace.

887
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,280
I was unable to detect him.

888
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,640
Fine.

889
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,640
If he's up to something,

890
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,800
he'll make it known.

891
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,560
You'd better concentrate

892
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,080
on Jinxiu.

893
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,280
The princes are your care.

894
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,920
I'll come to report as frequent as possible.

895
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,280
Okay, you can leave.

896
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

897
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,160
"My care".

898
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,120
If I don't,

899
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,040
how can I rest assured?
