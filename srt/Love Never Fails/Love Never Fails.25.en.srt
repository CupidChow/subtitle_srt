00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:43,670
[Love Never Fails]
[EP25]

3
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,440
Evil-warding soup?

4
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,680
Thanks.

5
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
Don't overthink it.

6
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,680
I just

7
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,280
made too much of it for Sir Jinxiu.

8
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,160
[These are leftovers.]

9
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,639
[Just wanted to thank you]

10
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,760
for saving him.

11
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,960
Soup made from the pheasant

12
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,040
he caught.

13
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,520
Who knows if you'd

14
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,720
bite the hand that feeds you?

15
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,600
Such a grand favor.

16
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,800
How could I forget?

17
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Is there something wrong with it?

18
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,240
Nothing.

19
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,360
But I found another one

20
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,480
in my room earlier.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,520
[Likely your doing.]

22
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,320
Care to explain?

23
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,280
While I wasn't looking,

24
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,480
you left

25
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,280
another one under my window.

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,000
[No wonder the demon came last night.]

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,160
You do have a special interest in me.

28
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,840
If you don't trust me,

29
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,240
so be it.

30
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,600
Consider my kindness wasted.

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,320
"Kindness"?

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,240
Seems more like

33
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,079
using me as bait.

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,680
If I were you,

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,720
I'd get them out of here now.

36
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,440
They're innocent.

37
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,240
Quite bold, aren't you?

38
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,440
But it won't help.

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
Some things

40
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,360
are beyond mortal power.

41
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,000
Stubbornness

42
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
will only get others killed.

43
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,960
You're mortal too.

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
Which is why I'm unsure.

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,640
If it's a peach demon,

46
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,520
why not burn its roots?

47
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,600
A millennium-old demon

48
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,840
has split soul from form.

49
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,240
It doesn't need its tree-body.

50
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,560
[Even if we burn its root,]

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,440
[it can flee elsewhere.]

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,720
With such power,

53
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,680
it can come and go as it pleases.

54
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,920
Yet it stays. Why?

55
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,000
Perhaps

56
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,680
it holds something precious here.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,560
Our best bet

58
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,280
is to wait patiently.

59
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,720
Peachwood repels evil like

60
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,160
talismans.

61
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
They're powerless against its own kind.

62
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,400
What if

63
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,840
we find ancient cypress

64
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,360
[to carve a sword?]

65
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,960
Cypress rules all trees.

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
"Of earthly beings,"

67
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,600
"only cypress stands virtuous."

68
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,560
There's a market nearby.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
Let's check there.

70
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,760
Hot buns!

71
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,640
Try one!

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,000
Hot buns!

73
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,159
Fresh from the steamer!

74
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
Come on, sir.

75
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,520
Try one!

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,040
Sir, try this!

77
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,400
Miss.

78
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Hot buns.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,320
Still quite warm.

80
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,520
Come on, buy one.

81
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,200
Miss.

82
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,080
Have a look!

83
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,800
[Fine potted plants.]

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,560
[Lilybell?]

85
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Speak to it.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,760
Jinxiu.

87
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,680
Jinxiu.

88
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,400
Amazing.

89
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,080
Now you can find me with this.

90
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,520
Jinxiu.

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,400
Jinxiu.

92
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,400
You like lily-of-the-valley?

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,800
I'll buy it for you.

94
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,280
No thanks.

95
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,440
I hate them most.

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,240
Miss Muxian is so strange.

97
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,480
You kindly offered her a gift...

98
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,320
Hold your tongue.

99
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,160
You practice demonic arts?

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,680
It's immortal arts.

101
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,240
What for?

102
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,440
Eternal life.

103
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,600
Sounds dull.

104
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,880
You don't want to be immortal?

105
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm just a mortal with skills.

106
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,120
Too busy for

107
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,880
[immortality.]

108
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,080
[Besides,]

109
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,720
loads of people wanna be immortal.

110
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,800
But I'm not one of them.

111
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,560
Why sneer?

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,440
Hypocritical.

113
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,040
Though known each other a few days,

114
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,240
we've faced death together.

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,960
I'm being honest.

116
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,920
If I could choose,

117
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,480
I'd stay human.

118
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,840
There's something

119
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,320
I need your help with.

120
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,240
Go on.

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
The peach demon craves brains.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,480
It came for you before.

123
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,120
It will return.

124
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,680
Mix this

125
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,440
talisman in wine.

126
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,560
Then give it

127
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,720
to the demon.

128
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,480
Ridiculous.

129
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,520
It's a good chance to eliminate evil.

130
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
You refuse?

131
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,400
What if

132
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,600
it takes your form again?

133
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,680
You have...

134
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,240
No.

135
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
Doesn't matter.

136
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,320
Nobles like you

137
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,600
shouldn't risk yourselves.

138
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,600
Such tasks are for those beneath you.

139
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,640
Fine.

140
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,880
But you'll do something for me.

141
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,240
What is it?

142
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,920
Rehearse with me.

143
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,520
[The wine has the talisman dissolved.]

144
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
[The demon won't notice.]

145
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,840
Will it come?

146
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't worry.

147
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,520
With someone as tempting as you,

148
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
[how could it not?]

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,440
Then why won't you

150
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,640
rehearse with me?

151
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,840
Stop that or I'll

152
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,280
lose patience.

153
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,560
Forget it.

154
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
Do you fancy me?

155
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,240
When it comes,

156
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,560
tap table thrice,

157
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,440
and I'll know.

158
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,280
As if I need

159
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,120
a girl's protection.

160
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,920
Just a partnership.

161
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,960
Still here, sir?

162
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,480
Missing me?

163
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes.

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,400
You truly

165
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,040
adore this face.

166
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,280
Of course.

167
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,480
Where's your

168
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
little lover hiding?

169
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
I sent

170
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,680
everyone away.

171
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
Just you and me.

172
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,040
So you're meeting me secretly

173
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,960
behind her back?

174
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,360
I have feelings for her,

175
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
but lack the chance to confess.

176
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,000
But you

177
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
have her face.

178
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Let's not spoil the mood.

179
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
Have a drink?

180
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,400
Afraid I poison you?

181
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,320
How could I

182
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,800
not trust you?

183
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,520
Demon! Surrender and die!

184
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,080
[No.]

185
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,960
[A distraction!]

186
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,760
Jinxiu!

187
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,840
Jinxiu!

188
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm here.

189
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,240
Why follow me?

190
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,400
I can't leave you alone.

191
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,680
What if you got hurt?

192
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,680
Leave now.

193
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,440
I won't save you if he attacks.

194
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,400
You don't think I'm

195
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,040
ungrateful, do you?

196
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,720
The demon escaped.

197
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,280
He'll retaliate.

198
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,120
I'll come with you.

199
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,920
I told you he's powerful.

200
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,760
I can't protect you.

201
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,520
Did you think

202
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,200
my words

203
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,480
to the demon were lies?

204
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,000
I have feelings for her,

205
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
but lack the chance to confess.

206
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,840
We met by chance.

207
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,440
You must find me

208
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,200
ridiculous.

209
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,240
But I won't let you

210
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,240
face danger

211
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,360
alone.

212
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,120
Don't

213
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,800
feel obligated though.

214
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,840
The demon comes and goes,

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,680
yet only...

216
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,360
Yet only

217
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,960
haunts this mansion,

218
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,720
spares nearby villages.

219
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,400
Unless...

220
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,280
A barrier.

221
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,600
Two peach demons?

222
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,840
We brothers

223
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,480
had no wish to fight.

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
You feast on brains and kill.

225
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,960
If no retribution,

226
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,800
where's justice?

227
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,880
I killed, yes,

228
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,560
but out of necessity.

229
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,680
[I had no choice.]

230
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,640
Surrender your core,

231
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,120
and we'll spare you.

232
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,200
An eye for an eye, that's justice.

233
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,920
Little girl.

234
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,600
You overreach!

235
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,120
Muxian.

236
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,160
I can save your brother.

237
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,600
His soul's damaged.

238
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,880
I have Kylin Grass.

239
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,440
How can I trust you?

240
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,720
You have no choice.

241
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,640
He's practically dead.

242
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,880
[Surrender your core]

243
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,280
[and you can cultivate anew.]

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,880
You brothers

245
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,080
might reunite someday.

246
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,360
But if he dies now,

247
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,480
[his soul vanish forever.]

248
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,200
This estate's special.

249
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,080
It converges celestial energy.

250
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,720
That's why you

251
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,680
[stay hidden,]

252
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
[using illusions.]

253
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,920
This is my little brother Wuling.

254
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,119
He damaged

255
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,280
[his soul]

256
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,599
[during tribulation.]

257
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,359
Sacred energy here

258
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,160
preserves his soul.

259
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,320
[But humans are the apex of spirits.]

260
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,160
[They live here in droves]

261
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,960
and absorb most energy.

262
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,440
Making it hard to replenish.

263
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,040
I had to act.

264
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,840
You drain human's essence

265
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,240
to save him?

266
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,200
But that

267
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,560
isn't enough.

268
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,280
You killed the owner

269
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,080
to deter others.

270
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,560
Without owners,

271
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,000
people won't

272
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,400
meddle anymore.

273
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,120
I didn't want to harm you.

274
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,240
But I could tell,

275
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,680
you're not ordinary.

276
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,080
[Feared you'd cause trouble.]

277
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,360
[So I killed your men,]

278
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,760
[disheveled my clothes,]

279
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,000
all to make you think

280
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,280
there was a ghost,

281
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,760
turning suspicion toward you.

282
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,800
[So they'd take you away.]

283
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,280
You say you had no choice,

284
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,080
yet you've embraced evil.

285
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,120
Evil?

286
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,000
We followed

287
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,840
proper cultivation!

288
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,520
But only one could ascend.

289
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,920
My brother could've succeeded,

290
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,040
but he sacrificed himself

291
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,200
to save me.

292
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,680
I used all my power

293
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,680
just to keep his soul intact.

294
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,520
If I didn't,

295
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,560
[my brother would…]

296
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,200
Consider my offer.

297
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,560
Why do you want my core?

298
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,320
I have my reasons.

299
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,720
Please save

300
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,160
my brother.

301
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,760
But Wuzhang has no Kylin Grass.

302
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,080
It grows in Kylin Lair.

303
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,640
A friend who ventured there

304
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,480
gave me that.

305
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,440
The lair blazes with celestial flames.

306
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,080
Even minor immortals

307
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,440
struggle to approach it,

308
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,440
[let alone mortals.]

309
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
[No idea how my friend]

310
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,760
[managed it.]

311
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,800
[The brothers...]

312
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,240
[One risked his life]

313
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,360
[for the other,]

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,040
[the other descended into evil.]

315
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,320
[Even millennia apart]

316
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
is better than despair.

317
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
[If fate binds them,]

318
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,120
[time won't sever]

319
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,440
[their bond.]

320
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,360
Why could only one

321
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,720
survive the tribulation?

322
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,080
Heaven's will,

323
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,640
as Bi Qin said.

324
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,720
Heaven's choices

325
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,880
are beyond mortal grasp.

326
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,120
You trust Heaven's will?

327
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,360
I do.

328
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,720
But mortal life's unpredictability

329
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,680
intrigues me more. They say

330
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,240
immortality is the goal of cultivation,

331
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,920
but most immortals are callous.

332
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,800
With endless lifetimes,

333
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,000
death becomes meaningless.

334
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,160
Humans

335
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,520
have but one life.

336
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,080
[Decades of love and hate]

337
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,560
[vanish with]

338
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
death.

339
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,280
Yet this impermanence

340
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,440
makes life more intriguing.

341
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,760
Taking down this demon

342
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,520
is justice for the dead.

343
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,240
No riding?

344
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,880
No need.

345
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,640
Farewell.

346
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,960
Take care.

347
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,320
Miss Muxian.

348
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,240
Would you

349
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
come back with me?

350
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,640
I mean,

351
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,360
the city is plagued by demons.

352
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,440
Will you help me hunt them?

353
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,600
I've

354
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,840
wandered alone

355
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,240
for too long.

356
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,120
I'll pass.

357
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,360
What if

358
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,240
it's not about hunting demons?

359
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,560
What if it's about love?

360
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,240
You want me to come

361
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,440
because you love me,

362
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,040
or just for fun?

363
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,880
I don't flatter like other girls do.

364
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,600
You must find that novel.

365
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,080
But it's just curiosity.

366
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,920
Not love.

367
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,200
Never mind.

368
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,680
It's about to rain.

369
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,840
Take this umbrella.

370
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,080
I don't like red.

371
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,480
You're awake, Miss.

372
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,760
Where am I?

373
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,400
This is the general's villa.

374
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,160
Where is he?

375
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,520
Busy with duties.

376
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,160
Won't be back soon.

377
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,680
[He asked]

378
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,720
[you to rest here.]

379
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,800
Thank him for saving my life.

380
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
You can

381
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,640
tell him yourself

382
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,680
when he returns.

383
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,360
Just call me if you need anything.

384
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,360
This one—

385
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,200
Third daughter of the Minister of Works.

386
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,960
Master of

387
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,760
music, chess, calligraphy, painting.

388
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,440
Right.

389
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,800
Auntie, not right.

390
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,080
Jinxiu

391
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,560
prefers someone devoted.

392
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,640
How about Eldest daughter

393
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
of the Commander's family?

394
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,040
[Gentle, virtuous,]

395
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,200
well-educated.

396
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,720
Still not right.

397
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,680
Both are too dull.

398
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,720
Boring companions.

399
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,400
Right?

400
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,040
You're meddling again.

401
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,080
I'm not.

402
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,200
My ladies.

403
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,080
General, Master Kunlun.

404
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,840
Need you back

405
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,840
at the mansion.

406
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:13,960
Thank you, aunts,

407
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,160
for your kindness.

408
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,520
But I'm not

409
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,120
ready to marry yet.

410
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,120
Nonsense!

411
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,680
[Since you and Kunlun]

412
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,960
[call us "Anutie",]

413
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,800
we're family.

414
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
Your marriage

415
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,200
is our concern.

416
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,120
[Exactly.]

417
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,760
[You're of age.]

418
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,080
By noble family traditions,

419
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,120
it's long

420
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,760
[overdue.]

421
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,560
Sorry, duty calls.

422
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,640
Excuse me.

423
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,800
What...

424
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,600
Jinxiu!

425
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,320
[Jinxiu is perfect]

426
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,560
in every way,

427
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,880
but why

428
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,720
is he so indifferent

429
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,280
to love?

430
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,440
He's

431
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,240
too picky.

432
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,160
Ordinary girls

433
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,520
can't impress him.

434
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,560
You're no better.

435
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,720
What's with you today?

436
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Covering for him?

437
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,760
No.

438
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,480
Not at all.

439
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,480
[You're of age too.]

440
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,880
These girls,

441
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,560
none appeal?

442
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,120
Not a single one?

443
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,120
Choose a bride.

444
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,920
My heart's taken.

445
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
She's peerless

446
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,360
and graceful.

447
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,960
No one compares to her.

448
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,240
No one.

449
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,400
Which noble's daughter?

450
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,800
A

451
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,040
celestial maiden.

452
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,560
Ce...

453
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,320
What did he say?

454
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,560
A celestial maiden?

455
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,920
Did I hear it right?

456
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,760
Forget it.

457
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,880
He's making

458
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,200
fun of us again.

459
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,600
General,

460
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,040
unrest grows in the city

461
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,960
since we left.

462
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,560
Most officials are overwhelmed,

463
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,600
requesting reinforcements.

464
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,320
Any clues?

465
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,800
Nothing major.

466
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,440
Usual disputes were

467
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,320
manageable,

468
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,640
but now they're fighting

469
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,560
to the death.

470
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,640
We all find it alarming.

471
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,400
Any demon traces?

472
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,520
That's the odd part.

473
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,480
Demon traces are rare.

474
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,360
[Most conflicts]

475
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,640
[don't bear the marks]

476
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,000
[of demons.]

477
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,240
The conflicts

478
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,280
are in crowded areas.

479
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,320
The more crowded,

480
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,920
the worse.

481
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,200
Crowds breed chaos.

482
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,000
Tell them.

483
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,960
Increase patrols.

484
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,520
Especially at night.

485
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,520
Our own units handle separate routes.

486
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,680
You two.

487
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,280
Bring me the related

488
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,360
case files.

489
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,520
Yes, sir.

490
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,320
General, regarding Prince Xian,

491
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,440
arrangements have been made.

492
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,520
The mansion hasn't been safe lately,

493
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,440
guards, maids and

494
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,520
even some of

495
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,480
my spies missing.

496
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,760
Tell them to be cautious.

497
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,880
Self-preservation first.

498
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,880
Duties second.

499
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,640
Understood.

500
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,560
What are you standing there for?

501
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,680
To protect you!

502
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,520
I'm the General of Ministry of Law.

503
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,640
Since when do I need your protection?

504
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,080
I...

505
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,160
[I need no protection!]

506
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,160
Feel better?

507
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,920
It's you.

508
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,080
You followed me that day.

509
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,680
Oh, don't be ungrateful.

510
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,280
I found you collapsed

511
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,400
in the grove.

512
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,600
Without me,

513
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,000
you'd be dead.

514
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,240
I'm no ingrate.

515
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,400
I'll remember this debt.

516
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,440
Well,

517
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,800
we shared life and death.

518
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,360
No need for formality.

519
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,200
Are you threatening me

520
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,840
to repay this debt?

521
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,640
Is that

522
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,160
how you see me?

523
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Human hearts are fickle.

524
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,040
Demons and humans can be told apart,

525
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,640
but hearts?

526
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,320
Impossible to read.

527
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,280
That's why

528
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,320
you cultivate?

529
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,280
Just tell me what you

530
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,600
need from me.

531
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,480
So I can repay this debt

532
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,040
[and leave.]

533
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
A life debt can't be repaid so easily.

534
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,840
Operas say

535
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,200
"marry your savior."

536
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,440
Enough. Leave.

537
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,640
Both sharp-tongued.

538
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Yours cuts sharper.

539
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,239
I won't marry you.

540
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,239
My life you can have.

541
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,400
Why would I want your life?

542
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,120
Use your skills to help me

543
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,639
purge demons

544
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,679
in town.

545
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,639
I follow my own path.

546
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,560
If heaven's justice were real,

547
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,440
Bi Qin's tragedy wouldn't happen.

548
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,800
I give up.

549
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,560
[You can hunt demons anywhere,]

550
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,239
here or on the road.

551
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,920
Recover first.

552
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,159
Smooth talker.

553
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,520
A rare compliment.

554
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,639
Thanks.

555
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,080
You haunt my dreams

556
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,880
but hide your face.

557
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,680
Must you torment me?

558
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,920
Looks nothing like you.

559
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,840
Not even close.

560
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,680
Is my

561
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,240
devotion lacking?

562
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,560
But I've prayed at

563
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,000
every Matriarch Temple in town.

564
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,000
The statue resembles you,

565
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,600
but it's not really you.

566
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,400
Maiden.

567
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,520
Where can I find you?

568
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,040
Have a look!

569
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,960
This way!

570
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,880
Let's go.

571
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,120
I love this place.

572
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,880
Yeah?

573
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,440
Wrong eyes.

574
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,440
Nose too flat.

575
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,680
Lips uneven.

576
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,720
Take a look!

577
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,680
Stop staring!

578
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,080
Come on.

579
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,120
[Come again!]

580
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,320
[Come inside!]

581
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,320
[Sir.]

582
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,200
[Come in and have a seat.]

583
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,080
[Come on.]

584
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,120
Pardon me, Miss.

585
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,080
I mistook you for someone else.

586
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,720
Looking for someone?

587
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,000
You've come to the right place!

588
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,400
Ladies!

589
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,480
Wait.

590
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,440
-No, I'm not...
-Come on in.

591
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,400
Please!

592
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,560
No, I...

593
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,680
Entertain him well.

594
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,400
None are her.

595
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,360
Huh.

596
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
[Poor taste.]

597
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,040
[Indeed.]

598
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,440
[Young master, wait!]

599
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,560
Sir,

600
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,320
why leave so soon?

601
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,320
[Can't find who I'm looking for,]

602
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,680
[I'm leaving.]

603
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,680
What beauty do you seek

604
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,840
that

605
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,120
we lack?

606
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,440
Honestly,

607
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,160
I only know

608
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,320
she resembles

609
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,480
the Celestial Matriarch.

610
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,760
You're joking, sir.

611
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,400
Seeking divinity here?

612
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,320
You flatter us too much.

613
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,680
No, no.

614
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,000
Actually,

615
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,720
you're all lovely.

616
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,400
Just

617
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,600
a touch ordinary.

618
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,320
Does Celestial Matriarch know

619
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,280
your devotion?

620
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,000
No.

621
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,680
What a pity.

622
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,560
To be honest,

623
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,080
I pray daily

624
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,360
for a true love,

625
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,160
someone to grow old with.

626
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,320
Yet

627
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,120
here I am, still trapped.

628
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,040
She's not

629
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,200
effective.

630
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,040
How dare you say that?

631
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,240
Go get your madam now.

632
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,600
I'll buy your freedom.

633
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,320
Really, sir?

634
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,200
Absolutely.

635
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,480
Right now.

636
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,200
Decided yet?

637
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,880
Marry me or not?

638
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,280
Marry you?

639
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,760
Why would I?

640
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,800
Then why

641
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,400
redeem me?

642
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,000
Because you

643
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,400
said she's not effective.

644
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,640
I did it to defend

645
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,480
her honor.

646
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,320
Why else

647
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,680
would I spend the money?

648
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,720
What's wrong?

649
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,280
Why'd you stop?

650
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,320
With that sharp tongue,

651
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,880
you're gonna die.

652
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Demon!

653
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,880
Listen.

654
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,840
You may take my body,

655
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,880
but never my heart.

656
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
My heart belongs to the Matriarch.
