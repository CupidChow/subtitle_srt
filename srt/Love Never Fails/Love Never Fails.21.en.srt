[EP21]

4
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,880
Master,

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,520
no clue why, but the pixies

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,479
in the dungeon

7
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,440
are getting hyped lately.

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,960
I'm worried

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,240
there's some strange

10
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,640
energy at play.

11
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,320
No need to worry.

12
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
I'll set up a barrier.

13
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,280
Tell the disciples to

14
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,880
go grab their protection charms.

15
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,800
Yes.

16
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,720
Any word from Lujiu?

17
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,160
He sent a communication talisman,

18
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,680
said not to worry about him,

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,400
he's already on his way back,

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,760
we'll see him soon.

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,200
Good.

22
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,480
Ningmeng,

23
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,800
where'd you find all these pretty flowers?

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,840
Pretty, right?

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,480
Got them down the hill.

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,800
Once I finish this,

27
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
I'll give it to you

28
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,400
on my wedding day.

29
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,600
Never seen anyone make this.

30
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,000
What's it even for?

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,760
To pass on some joy, of course!

32
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Guess you just don't get it.

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,960
Ningmeng…

34
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,240
thanks for sticking with me

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,520
through two lifetimes.

36
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,240
That means a lot to me.

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,240
Alright then.

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,520
So just tell me,

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,960
who's better,

40
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,560
me, or Jiaobo?

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,640
You're both great.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,920
You say that while holding my flowers?

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,760
Alright,

44
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,560
you win, you're better, happy?

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,600
That's more like it.

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,200
Lately,

47
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,960
a lot's been coming back to me.

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,360
I even remembered that

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,200
bedtime story you used to tell me!

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,680
Which one?

51
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,280
A crane pays debt?

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,880
I remember every single word!

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,760
Nope, I can't cry!

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,800
I'm just really happy!

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,040
I've gotta go tell Jiaobo, our dear

56
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Hongning finally got her memories back!

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,840
She has to come to your wedding!

58
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,400
Don't run too fast!

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,840
[Where's Hongning?]

60
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,480
[She'll be here soon!]

61
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,640
Mom, Dad.

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,280
Hongning!

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,640
She's here!

64
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
-Hongning!
-Auntie!

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,680
Auntie, what brings you here?

66
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Came to find my lost daughter-in-law!

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,960
Master of Cangwu Academy invited us over.

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,880
He said he's marrying you!

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,760
Hongning,

70
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,240
on the way here, your auntie said

71
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,320
she's covering the whole wedding,

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,320
proposal, betrothal, and all!

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:30,920
That's right!

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,960
Mom, Dad…

75
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,880
You're not mad I

76
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,880
didn't tell you such big news

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,520
sooner, are you?

78
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,040
Silly girl,

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,000
all your Mom cares about

80
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,120
is whether

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,280
you're doing okay,

82
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,040
if your future husband really loves you.

83
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,560
Nothing else matters!

84
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,920
Exactly!

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,560
Just look at this lovely family!

86
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,000
Hongning,

87
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,320
your situation's a bit special.

88
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,880
Normally I'd just grab your birth charts

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,400
and pick a date.

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,600
But,

91
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,200
none of the fortune-tellers

92
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
dared read your Master's birth chart,

93
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,320
three of them turned it down!

94
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,400
How am I supposed to pick a date?

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,720
Didn't dare read it?

96
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,520
Yeah!

97
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,920
They said reading it would be

98
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,240
prying into heaven's secrets,

99
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
and it'd cost them their lives!

100
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
What's your Master's deal?

101
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,960
Hongning.

102
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,800
Jinxiu,

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,560
come, sit!

104
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:18,920
No need to be formal!

105
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,760
Uncle, Auntie,

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,400
I brought the wedding dress.

107
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,360
See?

108
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,560
That's my son-in-law!

109
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,520
It's…

110
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,520
all silk!

111
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,040
Mom, it's gorgeous!

112
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,640
Must've cost a lot!

113
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,280
Let's not go overboard!

114
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,240
What do you know?

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,920
It's our son-in-law's heartfelt gesture!

116
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,920
Besides,

117
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,400
Hongning's worth it!

118
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,880
Still, no need to splurge!

119
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,000
Hongning,

120
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,240
do you like it?

121
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,000
It's beautiful.

122
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,280
If it's from you,

123
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,560
I love it.

124
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,360
Glad you do,

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
I worked hard on it.

126
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,640
By the way, Master,

127
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,720
your birth chart's unreadable.

128
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,960
So…

129
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,640
when should we set the date?

130
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,320
How about

131
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,800
the seventh of July?

132
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,280
That's a lucky day!

133
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,160
Let's go with that!

134
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Good pick!

135
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,640
Lucky day!

136
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,360
Perfect!

137
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,560
Great!

138
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,080
[Here we go!]

139
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,720
[A bit to the left.]

140
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,440
[Alright.]

141
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,560
Tie it tight.

142
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,760
One more loop.

143
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,280
Okay!

144
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,240
Let's set it down over there.

145
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,720
Shouhou.

146
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,840
What a name.

147
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,880
[Little Fox,]

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,040
[wish you were here.]

149
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,240
No!

150
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,640
It…it lit itself!

151
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,360
[Don't!]

152
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
I was wrong!

153
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,120
Enough!

154
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
It's a big day,

155
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,760
no fighting!

156
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,520
Yes, Master.

157
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,000
-Let's go!
-Master, look at him!

158
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,480
No respect

159
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,720
-at all!
-You guys…

160
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,240
Honey,

161
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,720
can't you stop pacing

162
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,320
and help me out here?

163
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,520
What can I do?

164
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,200
My girl's getting married,

165
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
can't say I'm thrilled.

166
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,840
Don't be like that!

167
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,000
What do you want me to say?

168
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,000
Even if he's a deity,

169
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,600
I still don't want to let her go!

170
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Look at you!

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,480
You really are Ningmeng!

172
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,200
Don't touch me!

173
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,159
I'm just curious.

174
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,120
Hey,

175
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,679
you've been

176
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,960
circling me for ages!

177
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,600
You're gonna wear a hole in my fur!

178
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,360
Don't move!

179
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
You're giving me goosebumps!

180
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,560
Hongning,

181
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
you really do

182
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,840
talk to fruit

183
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,840
and animals!

184
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,720
I do!

185
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,160
I said it when we were kids,

186
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,600
you guys just never believed me.

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,480
Wait…

188
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,880
they're all pixies?

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
So our whole village

190
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,360
is crawling with pixies?

191
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,840
Yep.

192
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,040
Even my big black dog

193
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,240
talked to you?

194
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,960
Your dog's not a pixie,

195
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,520
it's just a spirit.

196
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,160
Then…

197
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,240
Hongning,

198
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,600
before I leave,

199
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
can I get a few

200
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,600
pixie-banishing charms?

201
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,560
Sure!

202
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,440
I'll give you a few to stay safe.

203
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,480
But don't mess with them,

204
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
they're good pixies,

205
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,840
they won't hurt you.

206
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,720
Still thinking about Black Serpent?

207
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,360
He didn't even

208
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,720
say bye after

209
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
all that care I gave him!

210
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,240
He should've said something, right?

211
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,920
Living alone at the bottom of cliffs

212
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
for years left him a bit twitchy,

213
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,160
don't take him seriously.

214
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,520
Ningmeng,

215
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,280
Jiaobo…

216
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,640
still won't come to my wedding?

217
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,320
I never knew she was so stubborn!

218
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,480
I told her to come early and help out,

219
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,160
she called here some kind of

220
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,000
sacred no-go zone, shouldn't stick around.

221
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,440
She just kept dragging her feet!

222
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,720
Took me forever to talk her into it!

223
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,520
She…

224
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,440
should be on her way now.

225
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,720
Master.

226
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,040
Where are you going?

227
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,560
Hongning's trying on…

228
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,120
her wedding dress,

229
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,920
I'm bringing her some jewelry.

230
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,360
Jewelry?

231
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,320
You can't go in!

232
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Why not?

233
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,360
You're a guy, how could you go in there?

234
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,720
Do Lemon Pixies even have gender?

235
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,480
Fair point.

236
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,440
Give it to me.

237
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:26,960
Nope,

238
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,920
I… I'm going.

239
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
I'm her bestie!

240
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,280
Give it!

241
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,160
Then…

242
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,920
Go.

243
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,840
Back to sleep.

244
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,440
Go on!

245
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,520
Is it a bit tight?

246
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
Maybe I've gained weight lately?

247
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,800
Do I look okay in this?

248
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,640
Try it and see.

249
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,400
Sir!

250
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,320
Are you still

251
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,360
that same camellia pixie

252
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,360
I met?

253
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,320
Why so shy now?

254
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,280
I'll go try it on then.

255
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,680
[Do I look good?]

256
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,640
[Can I be your Empress?]

257
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,480
[When you like someone,]

258
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,120
[you wanna see them all the time.]

259
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,520
[Just seeing you makes me happy.]

260
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,520
[I wanna stay with you forever.]

261
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
[Sir, I'm not just]

262
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,280
[grateful to you,]

263
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
[I've fallen for you too.]

264
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,280
[You said at the Celestial Floralia]

265
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,320
[if I become an immortal,]

266
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,120
[you'd make me as your Empress.]

267
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,840
[Don't go back on that.]

268
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,560
Is it bad looking?

269
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
Yeah, I guess

270
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,760
it's not quite me.

271
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,600
You look

272
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,520
really amazing!

273
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,080
Sir,

274
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,560
are you sure about this?

275
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,680
I'm just a mortal,

276
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,720
if we marry,

277
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,560
what about the Celestial Monarch and Celestial Empress?

278
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,920
Don't worry,

279
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,600
I'll figure it out.

280
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,720
Really?

281
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,960
I promise

282
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,320
I'll convince them.

283
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,480
What's wrong?

284
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,920
It just feels…

285
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,880
everything's so unreal.

286
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
In the past life,

287
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,960
I tried so hard

288
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,400
to be your Empress.

289
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,960
Could it really be so easy now?

290
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,040
Not in this life.

291
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,680
I'll always be here, protecting you.

292
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,280
I'll never break my word again.

293
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,200
Lujiu?

294
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,960
Lujiu,

295
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,160
when did you get back?

296
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,120
You…

297
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,040
How's it going with Little Fox?

298
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
When did you start caring about me?

299
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,120
I just wanted to ask

300
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,920
how's Little Fox doing?

301
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,760
She should be doing well.

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,040
After all, she's home now.

303
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,040
She has her family,

304
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,600
and her friends there.

305
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,680
True.

306
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,880
She probably doesn't need us.

307
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,240
Is this it?

308
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,480
Even though he's a deity,

309
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,840
he's really broke!

310
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,800
Can't even get a proper

311
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,640
sheep or cow!

312
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,440
Right!

313
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,880
When I married you,

314
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,320
at least I brought two ducks!

315
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,200
Yeah!

316
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,320
Well,

317
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,440
the Cangwu Academy

318
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,880
looks quite impressive!

319
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,320
Stop the ducks!

320
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,880
Is this really our Master?

321
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,560
I'm not so sure anymore.

322
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,400
See,

323
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,119
when someone's in love,

324
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,920
[their brain really does turn to mush!]

325
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,440
[That's scary!]

326
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,520
I really wanna know

327
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,640
what ridiculous things

328
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,920
our Master will do for Hongning!

329
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
[Seems like he's done all he can.]

330
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,240
What's Master doing now?

331
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,240
Who knows?

332
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,360
[Hongning,]

333
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
do you mortals not give silk when you marry,

334
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,400
but ducks instead?

335
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,440
[The ducks are coming your way!]

336
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,120
Master, I'll help you!

337
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,720
Another fool!

338
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,920
I wish my Little Fox were here.

339
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,800
Then I could

340
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,360
catch ducks with her.

341
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,000
The third one!

342
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,800
Lujiu doesn't want to return with me.

343
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,520
In the vast NCR,

344
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,840
you're the only friend I have left.

345
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,520
[Search over there!]

346
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,200
Where are you going?

347
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,120
No!

348
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,360
You can't go alone,

349
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,280
it's too dangerous!

350
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,720
They have the Deity-slaying Talisman!

351
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,800
Where is the sinner, Luyao?

352
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,440
[Speak!]

353
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,680
Stay alive…

354
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,120
[Matriarch shouldn't have gotten too far.]

355
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,000
[Chase!]

356
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,240
[Boring.]

357
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,080
[Why are they locking me up here,]

358
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,160
[learning dance and embroidery?]

359
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,360
[Why are they]

360
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,040
[keep telling me about responsibilities]

361
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,680
[and duties I don't understand?]

362
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,160
[Are you playing with me?]

363
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,600
[My name is Luyao,]

364
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,000
[you're my shadow]

365
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,440
[and my first friend.]

366
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,760
[What's your name?]

367
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,560
[You can't speak?]

368
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,680
[You look like a mirror to me.]

369
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,920
[You're a magical mirror.]

370
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,840
[Could I call you Qijing?]

371
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,120
[Great!]

372
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,720
[I have a friend now!]

373
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,520
[I have a friend now!]

374
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,080
[I have a friend now!]

375
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,080
Don't worry.

376
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,880
I'll make sure to take you home.

377
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,600
You're my first friend,

378
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,200
my only…

379
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,320
and best friend.

380
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,800
Are you really marrying him tomorrow?

381
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,240
Why do you still believe that

382
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,560
he's coming back to marry you

383
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,480
and keep his promise?

384
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,240
Are you out of your mind, Hongning?

385
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,080
You're a pixie,

386
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,080
he's spent decades finding you,

387
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,720
he must have some other agenda!

388
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,480
If he wanted to catch me,

389
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
he would've done it already.

390
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,000
Do you know

391
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,400
you might be the Demon King?

392
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,560
Demon King?

393
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,040
The black snake you met in the Dragon's Abyss

394
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,120
is an ancient divine beast.

395
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,320
It was the mount of the Demon King

396
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,800
Fuzhu from ten thousand years ago.

397
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,760
But it called you its master.

398
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,080
So,

399
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,880
it's very possible you're the Demon King's bloodline.

400
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,080
Impossible.

401
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,040
How is that impossible?

402
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,560
Do you know how quickly you cultivated

403
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,080
in Floralia Palace?

404
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,040
You crossed immortal tribulation

405
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,040
easier than ordinary immortals too!

406
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,200
I noticed then that

407
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,720
your power is extraordinary.

408
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,520
And with the black snake calling you master,

409
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,960
I'm even more convinced!

410
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,040
But I've never heard of

411
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,800
the Demon King!

412
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,680
And Master never mentioned it!

413
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,400
There are so many hidden secrets!

414
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,040
Just because we don't know them

415
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,200
doesn't mean they don't exist!

416
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
The power of the Demon King can

417
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,280
command all pixies in the Three Realms.

418
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,040
He wants to use you

419
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,280
to gather all the pixies

420
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
and then wipe them out!

421
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,280
You're talking nonsense!

422
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,280
If Master was like that, why

423
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,800
would all the pixies in Cangwu Academy

424
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,600
have a chance to cultivate?

425
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,280
Those are pixies

426
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,720
blessed with divine fate!

427
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Typical of them,

428
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,520
ranking pixies like some celestial caste system!

429
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,520
Blessed pixies get divine perks,

430
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,320
while the rest get purged!

431
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,000
Your Master

432
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,080
acts all noble,

433
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,520
but he's really just a bloody executioner!

434
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,200
The gap between immortals and pixies

435
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,600
has existed for a long time.

436
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,960
Master can't bear all of this alone!

437
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,240
Are you deliberately this oblivious?

438
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,280
I risked my life

439
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,320
to return to your side from the Kylin Lair

440
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,000
because I want to lead all the pixies

441
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,960
to fight against the Celestial Realm!

442
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,360
The Dragon's Abyss is bottomless.

443
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,520
I risked death

444
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,040
to bring you Memory Spring,

445
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,720
just want you to remember

446
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,360
you used to be a camellia pixie!

447
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,840
You were killed by those immortals,

448
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,920
don't you get it?

449
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,960
You're blinded by hate!

450
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,680
You've got it out for all immortals,

451
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,760
you know that?

452
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
You're the one who's been blinded,

453
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,880
not me.

454
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,920
Don't you get it?

455
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,240
I really like you.

456
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,000
That's not me,

457
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,920
it's your headcanon.

458
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,000
So…

459
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,280
you're really choosing to

460
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,080
side with the immortals?

461
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,160
I'm not siding with the immortals,

462
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,800
I'm following my heart!

463
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,560
I'm getting married.

464
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,920
If you wish me well,

465
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,760
stay for a drink.

466
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,560
If not…

467
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,080
then go.

468
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,320
Fine.

469
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,480
Alright.

470
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,520
Hongning,

471
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,520
you'll pay for

472
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,160
what you chose today.

473
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,240
Baicha!

474
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,880
It's really you!

475
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,440
It's been a while!

476
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
How have you been?

477
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,760
You came for…

478
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,920
Hongning's wedding, right?

479
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,480
I was just leaving.

480
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,840
What's wrong?

481
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,200
You don't look happy.

482
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,360
Hongning and Jinxiu

483
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,120
shouldn't be together.

484
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,840
Why not?

485
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,440
What's wrong with them?

486
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,080
I think

487
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,480
they're perfect for each other!

488
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,000
The groom is a

489
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,680
Floral Deity from the Celestial Realm,

490
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,840
future Celestial Monarch!

491
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,280
And the bride is

492
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,920
our Mt. Baizhou's pride!

493
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,760
They make a great match!

494
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,080
Immortals and pixies can't be together!

495
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,640
Why not?

496
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,560
Love can

497
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,080
break any rule!

498
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,880
[Besides, they've been]

499
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,680
[through so much,]

500
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,360
and finally made it!

501
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,240
We should be happy for them!

502
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,840
And,

503
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,960
Sir Jinxiu's amazing!

504
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,560
[There's nothing he can't handle!]

505
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,800
[With his power,]

506
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,800
how could pixies like us…

507
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,920
who can't even cultivate

508
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,320
stand a chance?

509
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,040
What's going on with you?

510
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,080
Master,

511
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,920
I found it while patrolling.

512
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,720
No sign of life when I got there.

513
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,160
Don't let word get out.

514
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,440
Yes.

515
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,320
Master.

516
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,400
Hongning!

517
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,080
They say it's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding!

518
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,920
Go back, quick!

519
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,640
But I need to ask you something.

520
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,840
What is it?

521
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,800
Do you know anything about the Demon King?

522
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,160
Why would you ask that?

523
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,480
Am I… the Demon King?

524
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,240
Of course not.

525
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,440
Really?

526
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,600
Really.

527
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,960
Good, that's a relief!

528
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,560
I'm fine, Master.

529
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,760
See you tomorrow!

530
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,680
Greetings, Master!

531
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,800
Master,

532
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,240
all the disciples have gathered.

533
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,520
Good.

534
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,520
Today's my wedding day.

535
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,920
Lots of guests are coming.

536
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,680
Even some from Mt. Baizhou.

537
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,240
Remember,

538
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,240
don't be rude.

539
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,480
Me?

540
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,800
Master,

541
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,320
don't worry, I've got this!

542
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,040
When they arrive,

543
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,800
I'll wine and dine them!

544
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,600
To avoid trouble,

545
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,960
check every invite carefully.

546
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,680
Only those with the Cangwu Academy's seal

547
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,800
can enter.

548
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
[Block off]

549
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,240
all the main paths too.

550
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,560
Got it!

551
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,800
Come,

552
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,480
everyone head up!

553
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,560
[Mom,]

554
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,960
[this place is amazing!]

555
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,280
[I wanna learn magic too!]

556
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
[I bet I've got talent!]

557
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,320
Look, I'll show you!

558
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,520
How was that?

559
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,440
You wish!

560
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,640
Why not shoot for the moon!

561
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,920
Get back to

562
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,200
hitting the books!

563
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,400
You never focus,

564
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,520
always daydreaming!

565
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,560
Move aside!

566
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,480
Head up!

567
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,840
Mom!

568
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,880
Maybe I really can reach the moon one day!

569
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,280
Mom!

570
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,760
Okay, thanks.

571
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,640
This one's mine.

572
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,240
Here you go.

573
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,520
Senior,

574
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,200
what are you writing?

575
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,360
It's Hongning's wedding,

576
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,840
I wanted to give her a gift.

577
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,640
Thought long and hard,

578
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,720
I recalled that

579
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,320
she's flunked a bunch of tests.

580
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,120
So,

581
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,600
I made her

582
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,560
a study guide!

583
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:03,960
That's great!

584
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,520
Wait,

585
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,080
that's your wedding gift?

586
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,720
What?

587
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,840
Got a problem?

588
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,880
No!

589
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,560
I mean it's thoughtful!

590
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,640
Of course!

591
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,360
Hongning was my first friend

592
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,400
on Mt. Cangwu!

593
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,120
Didn't expect

594
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
she's a girl

595
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,720
and now she's marrying our Master!

596
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,640
So that means…

597
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,280
Master is

598
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,520
my brother-in-law!

599
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,000
Too much on the plate!

600
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Pick it up!

601
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,080
Come on!

602
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,040
[Look at Master!]

603
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,160
[He's a real catch!]

604
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,480
[This way, please.]

605
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,440
[Come!]

606
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,000
[He looks so different today!]

607
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,640
[Yeah!]

608
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,400
[He's got that special aura!]

609
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,480
Never seen Master

610
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,640
look this festive!

611
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,480
Exactly!

612
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:07,920
[Seriously!]

613
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,320
[What a charmer!]

614
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,880
Master, turn around!

615
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,280
Master,

616
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,920
I got too excited!

617
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,679
Such a rascal.

618
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,400
Master,

619
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,520
I want a hug too!

620
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,520
Back to business,

621
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,719
what about the others? All set?

622
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,679
Is the dungeon guarded?

623
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,400
Lujiu kept an eye

624
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,760
on everything himself.

625
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,120
[Also, Baibuqu and the little bros]

626
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,440
[are guarding the dungeon.]

627
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,440
Good.

628
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,400
Hand out the charms now.

629
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,320
Yes, Master.

630
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,480
Bailing,

631
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,320
how are Father and Mother?

632
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,320
Who?

633
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,680
Hongning's Mom and Dad.

634
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,320
Who?

635
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,440
My in-laws!

636
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,560
How are they doing?

637
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,000
That's right!

638
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,800
Your Dad-in law,

639
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,240
he's gone to the bathroom over ten times today!

640
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,560
Hasn't stopped at all!

641
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,920
Look, there he goes again!

642
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,720
Must be too nervous.

643
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,640
And Mom-in law, still with Hongning.

644
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,200
And Hongning…

645
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,080
Master,

646
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,320
why so many questions today?

647
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,720
Not like you at all!

648
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,680
You're nervous too?

649
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,360
Alright.

650
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,760
Trust me.

651
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,800
I'm here,

652
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,600
so you'll

653
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,320
get your bride safe and sound.

654
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,000
Where are you sticking it?

655
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,600
[I…]

656
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,680
[Master, it's time.]

657
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,920
[Bailing, time to fetch the bride!]

658
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,400
Blush.

659
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,040
That's lip balm, the other one!

660
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,360
Hey buddy,

661
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,680
why are you still here?

662
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,440
The bride

663
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,760
can't be seen by any guy now!

664
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,720
Out you go!

665
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,360
It's fine.

666
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,880
Just pretend I'm one of the girls.

667
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,040
[Come on, smile!]

668
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,720
Auntie,

669
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,920
is the blush too bright?

670
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,720
Not bright enough!

671
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,040
[The brighter, the more festive!]

672
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,040
Hongning's Mom,

673
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,440
why the tears now?

674
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,320
[Come help her with her hair!]

675
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,000
Hurry!

676
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,240
First stroke to the end,

677
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,440
a lifetime without worries.

678
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
Second stroke to the end,

679
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,600
safe and carefree.

680
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,200
Third stroke to the end,

681
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,440
plenty of kids and long life.

682
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,440
Last stroke to the end,

683
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,040
hearts forever tied.

684
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,360
Mom,

685
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,160
this was such a big decision

686
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,840
and I didn't talk to you in advance.

687
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,240
You're really not mad at me?

688
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,880
My girl,

689
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,920
as long as you're happy,

690
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,200
I'm okay with anything.

691
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,960
All I want is for you to be happy.

692
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,400
With you and Dad,

693
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,400
I'm already super happy.

694
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,600
Alright.

695
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,120
Stop or your makeup's gonna run.

696
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,160
And you, Ningmeng,

697
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,200
thanks for growing up with me

698
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,840
in this life.

699
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,560
What now, Hongning?

700
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,520
You getting married

701
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,200
or going to war?

702
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,480
Listen,

703
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,040
even after you're married,

704
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,920
I'm still one of the most important people

705
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,120
in your life!

706
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,760
Bride ready?

707
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,680
It's almost time!

708
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,080
Yes, we're ready!

709
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,520
This is a happy day,

710
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,480
no crying now.

711
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,880
Everyone smile!

712
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,280
Where's Dad?

713
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,040
Your Dad?

714
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,920
He went off to cry somewhere.

715
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,640
[Didn't want you to see him like that.]

716
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,240
[He's not mad at you.]

717
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,520
Alright.

718
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,360
Time for the bride to head out.

719
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,080
Exactly!

720
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,000
Let's go.

721
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,880
Go.

722
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,040
Come on.

723
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,000
Wait, no veil yet!

724
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,240
Veil…

725
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,640
Dad.

726
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,880
How would you head out

727
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,400
without the most important thing?

728
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,440
Alright, sweetheart.

729
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,360
Let's go.

730
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,680
If that guy ever bullies you,

731
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,560
just come home.

732
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,000
Dad will take care of you forever!

733
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,560
[I don't care if he's a deity or whatever,]

734
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,320
I'm not scared!

735
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,640
And neither should you be.

736
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,440
Beauty shines like the moon,

737
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,640
but a red camellia blooms from within.

738
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,640
Time to veil the bride.

739
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,320
Let me

740
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,280
kneel and thank Mom and Dad.

741
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,240
Get up, quick!

742
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,400
Up.

743
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,480
Get up, Hongning.

744
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,520
Let's go.

745
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,840
Green leaves, red cherries.

746
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,120
[No more clinging to the balustrade.]

747
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
[No more peeking through the curtain.]

748
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,880
Here comes the bride!
