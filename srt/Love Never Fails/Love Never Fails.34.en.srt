[English subtitles are available]

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:44,000
[Love Never Fails]
[EP34]

3
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,850
[You must be tired.]

4
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,290
Sir Jinxiu?

5
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,570
Now you're the Floral Deity.

6
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,810
No need to call me that.

7
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,210
But I haven't done a good job.

8
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,050
That's not your fault.

9
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,250
Jinxiu,

10
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,290
when will you inherit the Imperial Seal?

11
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,370
My Mother had it divined.

12
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,410
Should be any day now.

13
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,210
You'll make a great monarch.

14
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,330
Truth is,

15
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,090
I don't want to be that.

16
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,050
Why?

17
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,650
Because I'm not fit for it.

18
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,250
Your achievements are unmatched,

19
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,730
with peerless cultivation.

20
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,570
As the Emperor Star chosen by heavens,

21
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,050
you're the only candidate.

22
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,810
My Father

23
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,810
is a god of grand vision.

24
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,210
He is calm and clear-headed

25
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,570
in matters of right and wrong.

26
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,970
But me?

27
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,770
I often get

28
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,890
caught up in emotions.

29
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,290
For thousands of years,

30
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,450
I've

31
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,050
struggled to make decisive choices.

32
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,290
Even when I do,

33
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,610
I keep questioning if they're right.

34
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,250
Sometimes after

35
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,570
delivering divine punishment,

36
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,570
I lie awake at night.

37
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,610
Why didn't you ever tell me any of this?

38
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,650
Because I didn't want to burden you.

39
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,409
What about your Mother?

40
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,650
She's calm, wise,

41
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,130
and virtuous.

42
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,930
But I feel like

43
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,890
I can never get close to her.

44
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,370
[You're the one who set]

45
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,409
[a bad example!]

46
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,450
[Mother...]

47
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,530
So,

48
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,570
after you sent her pastries,

49
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,850
you got all nervous?

50
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,890
I didn't even know

51
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,050
if she accepted them.

52
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,730
[So the blossom brew Envoy Plum took away]

53
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,770
[should be returned by the Empress.]

54
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,690
Jinxiu,

55
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,650
it's getting late.

56
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,090
You should head back and rest.

57
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,570
It's fine.

58
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,850
I'll stay with you a little longer.

59
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,570
Muxian,

60
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,850
you're finally back.

61
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,170
The Floral Scroll hasn't

62
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,810
changed much after all this time.

63
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,810
Please don't go back in there again.

64
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,050
[Muxian]

65
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,810
[enters Flora Pavilion]

66
00:06:59,050 --> 00:06:59,850
[and...]

67
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,810
What nonsense are you writing now?

68
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,170
C'mon!

69
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,250
Recording every move of

70
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,210
the Floral Deity

71
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,170
is my duty as a historiographer.

72
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,410
Did you write this much detail

73
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,090
when Sir Jinxiu was around?

74
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,450
Of course I did.

75
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,210
You know,

76
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,170
I'm a historiographer!

77
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,890
Don't question my professionalism.

78
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,890
How did Sir Jinxiu grow up

79
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,090
in the Celestial Realm?

80
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,450
How would I know

81
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,450
what he's like back then?

82
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,130
Historiographer, huh?

83
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,770
I only record those

84
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,330
after he became Floral Deity.

85
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,210
You said

86
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,650
the Empress seldom comes to here

87
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,490
and doesn't like the Flora Clan.

88
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,610
Why?

89
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,370
Didn't I tell you already?

90
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,050
Don't dig into it.

91
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,090
But

92
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,330
she's Sir Jinxiu's mother.

93
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,210
Why would she dislike the Flora Clan?

94
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,650
You...

95
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,850
Can you just drop it?

96
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:02,770
Wait.

97
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,570
Why is Sir Kunlun's true form ice,

98
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,810
while the Sir Jinxiu's is a peony?

99
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,530
Why so many questions?

100
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,530
I already told you

101
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,410
I don't know anything.

102
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,130
If you're really that curious,

103
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:13,690
just...

104
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,170
go ask the Sage.

105
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,850
Sage?

106
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,770
Head to the Divine Ancestral Hall.

107
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,090
What's that?

108
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,090
All deities in Celestial Realm

109
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,450
can seek answers

110
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,650
from Sage

111
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,770
every three years.

112
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,450
Once every three years?

113
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,490
Yeah, only once.

114
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,330
And

115
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,409
it comes with a price.

116
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,530
What kind?

117
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,690
A price no one can predict.

118
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,610
Where are you going?

119
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,290
Wait, come...

120
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,170
Should I write this down or not?

121
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,930
What historiographer?

122
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,050
That's so hard!

123
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,690
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

124
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,450
I am Muxian,

125
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,650
a humble Floral Deity.

126
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,410
Sage,

127
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,330
I didn't mean to disturb you.

128
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,010
I came here to

129
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,690
ask something about Sir Jinxiu.

130
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,570
Our fates are entwined.

131
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,050
I need to know

132
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,250
how to heal the injuries afflicting him.

133
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,170
Break the Soul-binding Litany?

134
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,210
What is it? How do I break it?

135
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,250
[Who is suppressing his power?]

136
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,530
I also want to know

137
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,210
why has he

138
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,730
never won

139
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,010
his mother's favor?

140
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,690
Isn't he the Emperor Star?

141
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,290
Why was his birth record destroyed?

142
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,490
Who did it?

143
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,890
[Could there be secrets]

144
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,170
[behind his birth?]

145
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,810
Greetings, Your Highness.

146
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,690
No need for formality.

147
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,370
Is Mom in the palace now?

148
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,970
Yes,

149
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,130
Your Highness.

150
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,530
No need.

151
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,890
I'll deliver it myself.

152
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,410
As expected of Sir Kunlun.

153
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,330
Mother.

154
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,690
You may leave.

155
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:21,890
Yes, Ma'am.

156
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,850
What brings you here today?

157
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,690
I brewed some wine recently,

158
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,410
and it tastes much better than before.

159
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,490
I also made some mortal pastries.

160
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,370
Perhaps you'd like to try them.

161
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,570
Leave them there.

162
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,810
Please have a try.

163
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,730
I said

164
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,010
leave them there.

165
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,530
Mother,

166
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,210
there's something else I'd like

167
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,210
to discuss with you.

168
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,730
I've been through two lifetimes of trials

169
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,650
and spent a thousand years in the void.

170
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,570
I barely stayed in the Celestial Realm.

171
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,410
Now that I'm finally back,

172
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,050
work keeps me busy again.

173
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,450
I hardly get a moment with you.

174
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,970
So I'd

175
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,570
like to hold a family banquet,

176
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,250
giving a chance for us

177
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,330
to chat

178
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,570
beyond business.

179
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,410
You've got work.

180
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,490
You've done your duty

181
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,410
by coming to see me sometimes.

182
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:41,930
The family gathering...

183
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:42,850
[Mom!]

184
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,330
Oh, Jinxiu, hello.

185
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,210
Why didn't you tell me you're coming?

186
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,810
I went to your hall first,

187
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,130
but you weren't there.

188
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,810
Mom.

189
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,650
Aren't these the pastries we had at Wuzhang?

190
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:02,930
Jinxiu,

191
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,290
you sent them over, right?

192
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,010
I want some too.

193
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,930
Already sent to your place.

194
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,450
You're the best.

195
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,530
Mom,

196
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,090
did I interrupt you?

197
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,210
What were you talking about?

198
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,890
Nothing serious.

199
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,010
I was just asking Mother

200
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,730
about holding a family banquet.

201
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:20,890
A family banquet?

202
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,890
We've never done that.

203
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,890
All these years,

204
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,090
we've only gathered for big events

205
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,530
like the Celestial Banquet.

206
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,530
Other than that,

207
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,450
we rarely spend time together.

208
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,290
In this case,

209
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,650
a family banquet could mean a lot.

210
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,010
What do you think, Mom?

211
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,930
If you have time,

212
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,650
then go ahead.

213
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,210
Thanks, Mother.

214
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,130
Jinxiu,

215
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,530
is it okay

216
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,690
if I invite Luyao to join us?

217
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,770
[Our fates are entwined.]

218
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,250
[I need to know]

219
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,450
[how to heal the injuries afflicting him.]

220
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,290
[Break the Soul-binding Litany?]

221
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,530
[How did the injury on you]

222
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,930
[come about?]

223
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,850
[A backlash from cultivating]

224
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,650
[the Oceanic Arts.]

225
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,170
[It is required for the Monarch.]

226
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,450
[Kunlun have to master it too?]

227
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,170
[Yes.]

228
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,370
[Then why only you suffered]

229
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,570
[such severe backlash?]

230
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,170
[Perhaps because]

231
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,450
[Kunlun didn't cultivate hard.]

232
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,210
[Soul-binding Litany]

233
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,650
[and Soul Binding Bracelet..]

234
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,610
Lujiu,

235
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:24,570
time to take medicine.

236
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,210
Get lost.

237
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,850
If it gets cold,

238
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,530
it'll taste bitter.

239
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,770
Get out!

240
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,010
Why did you bring me back here?

241
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,050
Why?

242
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,130
I'm your sister.

243
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,050
This is your home.

244
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,930
Let me make this clear one last time.

245
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,290
I have

246
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,690
nothing to do with you

247
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,810
or the Northern Celestial Realm.

248
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,570
I have no sister

249
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,530
and no home!

250
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:05,930
Lujiu...

251
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,570
Don't touch me!

252
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,170
Lujiu,

253
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,690
The NCR is in ruins.

254
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,370
You're all I have left.

255
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,690
Back when Father locked me up,

256
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,450
when I was sick and dying,

257
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,610
did you even think of me?

258
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,410
When he threw me into the Kylin Lair,

259
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,370
where were you?

260
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,490
You call us siblings

261
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,010
and family.

262
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,850
But for the past 10,000 years,

263
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,850
you've been the noble

264
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,970
Nine-Tailed NCR Matriarch.

265
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,730
And I'm just a three-tailed fox

266
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,770
everyone despises.

267
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,090
We were never family.

268
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,410
Lujiu,

269
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,690
I'm so sorry.

270
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,850
I have

271
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,170
the strength to protect you now.

272
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,250
I'm here,

273
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,290
no one will ever hurt you again.

274
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,130
Out!

275
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,050
Now!

276
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:04,930
Alright.

277
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,610
I asked you to write our love story.

278
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,250
Why does it

279
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,730
read like a romance novel?

280
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:40,970
Wait,

281
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,250
Sir,

282
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,210
if you think

283
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,410
it's not detailed enough,

284
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,850
I can rewrite it.

285
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,330
There is

286
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,730
something good about it.

287
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,610
Okay.

288
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,410
Oh, right,

289
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,450
Sir,

290
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,690
Muxian

291
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,130
was asking about you earlier.

292
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,770
What did she ask?

293
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,170
Just some random stuff.

294
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,530
What kind?

295
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,770
You know, random stuff.

296
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,610
Like what?

297
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,130
It's just random stuff!

298
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:12,810
Wait,

299
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,530
I...

300
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,930
Is that really necessary?

301
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,290
Don't...

302
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,370
You know what,

303
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,890
I feel like there's this growing

304
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,130
distance between us.

305
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,570
Sir,

306
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,450
not at all.

307
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,810
Sir,

308
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,730
I'm always loyal to you.

309
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,530
Fine.

310
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,530
Where is she?

311
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,130
She's probably looking for you.

312
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:40,850
Alright,

313
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:41,610
I'm leaving.

314
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,090
Keep up the good work.

315
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,050
Remember,

316
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,690
she proposed to me first.

317
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,410
Don't get it wrong.

318
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,330
Sure.

319
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,010
Got it.

320
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,410
Well done.

321
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:55,810
Sir,

322
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,570
I'll always be yours!

323
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,410
[Does it hurt?]

324
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,490
[No, I'm used to it.]

325
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,450
[Aren't those the pastries]

326
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,170
[Jinxiu made for the Empress?]

327
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,970
[Break the Soul-binding Litany?]

328
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,690
[No.]

329
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,170
[I can't let them hurt Jinxiu.]

330
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,690
[Muxian!]

331
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,650
Muxian.

332
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,210
Where did you go?

333
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,250
Jinxiu's been looking everywhere for you.

334
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,010
Please,

335
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,450
next time you head out,

336
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,450
could you at least tell me first?

337
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,010
Jinxiu asked me to

338
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,330
take good care of you.

339
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,570
If anything happened to you,

340
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,250
I...

341
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,490
What's wrong?

342
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,410
You've only been gone a short while.

343
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,170
Are you feeling unwell?

344
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,530
Or did someone mess with you?

345
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,410
His Majesty...

346
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,130
Where does he live?

347
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,290
Of course he's in the Celestial Realm.

348
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,410
Such a weird question.

349
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,450
Hey.

350
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,690
What?

351
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:10,570
I...

352
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,530
But...

353
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,970
what's going on here?

354
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,810
I, Flower Deity Muxian,

355
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,890
am here to see His Majesty.

356
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:18,650
Sorry,

357
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,490
but you should

358
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,730
report it in advance.

359
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,930
But it's urgent.

360
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,130
Sorry,

361
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,730
don't make this hard for me.

362
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,250
[Muxian?]

363
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,770
[Greetings, Your Highness.]

364
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,490
Why are you here to see my Father?

365
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,410
Even as Flower Deity,

366
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,650
is it that hard to meet His Majesty?

367
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,730
The rules are strict here.

368
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,450
But if it's urgent,

369
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,010
you can tell me.

370
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,290
I'll speak to him.

371
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,130
Nothing serious.

372
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,930
Ater what happened with Datura,

373
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,370
I realized it's not that hard for a demon

374
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,250
to sneak here and assassinate a god.

375
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,490
What if someone tries to

376
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,690
kill His Majesty?

377
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,050
Do you even hear yourself?

378
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,930
Floralia Palace is nothing like

379
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,050
the Celestial Realm.

380
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,850
Floral deities

381
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,330
are known for

382
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,850
their beauty.

383
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,610
But when it comes to power,

384
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,730
they're no match for the immortals here.

385
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,810
What happened in the Floralia Palace

386
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,410
would never happen here.

387
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,490
But Datura only

388
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,370
pulled it off

389
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,250
with Ziteng's power.

390
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,890
Stop worrying.

391
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,130
Well, you said

392
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,690
floral deities are weak.

393
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,370
Yes, they are.

394
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,050
But I'm not.

395
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,450
[I rushed here]

396
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,690
[without thinking.]

397
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,250
[But I might]

398
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,970
[cause Jinxiu trouble.]

399
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,930
[I should be more careful next time.]

400
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,170
Why did you come find me

401
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,850
last night?

402
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,050
I requested a family banquet

403
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,410
from my parents.

404
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,210
A family banquet?

405
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,130
In Wuzhang,

406
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,290
though I was orphaned,

407
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,410
my aunt and uncle loved me.

408
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,090
Every festival

409
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,970
or big occasion,

410
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,770
we'd have a family dinner.

411
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,330
We'd gather around the table,

412
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,570
just catching up

413
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,210
and chatting.

414
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,450
It was such a joy.

415
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,490
So you

416
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,690
want to hold

417
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,330
a family banquet here?

418
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,610
And I want you

419
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,890
to be there.

420
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,570
Me?

421
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,970
In the family banquet,

422
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,490
I'll formally tell my parents

423
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,930
I'm going to marry you.

424
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,650
Jinxiu wanna host a family banquet.

425
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,410
I've already agreed.

426
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,170
He learned

427
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,410
nothing useful during the trials.

428
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,490
He means well.

429
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,610
At that time,

430
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,810
only he disappeared into the void.

431
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,330
All spared no effort to find him.

432
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,730
Bell Immortal even spent 1,000 years.

433
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,890
He must feel guilty.

434
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,410
Enough,

435
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,250
no need to speak for him.

436
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,290
It's just a family banquet.

437
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,730
No need to worry.

438
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,130
But after that,

439
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,050
the return of Emperor Star

440
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,890
and the succession

441
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,730
are what truly matter.

442
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,050
So you still intend for Jinxiu

443
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,090
to inherit the throne?

444
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,730
I've said it many times.

445
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,010
I don't want to repeat.

446
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,890
The Emperor Star's ascension is fated.

447
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,810
I wouldn't dare question that.

448
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,490
But

449
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,890
Kunlun is devoted to supporting Jinxiu.

450
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,370
Even I can't

451
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,530
sway him.

452
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,010
During the trials,

453
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,610
though his star didn't shine,

454
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,690
but he did grow a lot.

455
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,610
You may not know this.

456
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,970
He fell in love

457
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,810
with Luyao,

458
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,370
the NCR Matriarch.

459
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,650
Your Majesty,

460
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,290
please give them your blessing.

461
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,250
Well then,

462
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,410
the NCR will be

463
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,330
our unshakable ally.

464
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,690
Just as

465
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,170
once you supported me.

466
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,730
Exactly.

467
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:25,970
Good.

468
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,730
I approve

469
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,450
their marriage.

470
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,130
Thanks, Your Majesty.

471
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:40,770
Oh,

472
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,370
one more thing you need to know.

473
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,490
Jinxiu will bring

474
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,570
Muxian to the family banquet.

475
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,130
Hongning,

476
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,690
I never should've let you live.

477
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,250
Stand tall!

478
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,130
Chin up!

479
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,610
You're generals.

480
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,370
Stop cowering

481
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,490
like that.

482
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,770
How can you set examples for your troops?

483
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:34,930
You're dismissed.

484
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,330
- Yes.
- Yes.

485
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,290
[Why are you calling me?]

486
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,370
You're there?

487
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,850
[It's been two days since you saw me.]

488
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,690
[Are you feeling a bit empty?]

489
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:55,810
Do

490
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,010
you need me to train your troops?

491
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,690
Or

492
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,290
can you feel I've been missing you?

493
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,850
That's why you called?

494
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,290
[Of course.]

495
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,570
Well, not just that.

496
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,370
I've got something important

497
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,170
to tell you.

498
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,730
[Jinxiu was allowed for a family banquet.]

499
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,770
[It's never been held before.]

500
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,250
I have no idea

501
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,250
what it'll be like.

502
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,610
[What's on your mind?]

503
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,490
I...

504
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,650
It may not

505
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,250
[be as grand as the Celestial Banquet,]

506
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,130
[but it's still meaningful.]

507
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,730
I really want you to come with me.

508
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,490
It's a family banquet.

509
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,770
What's it got to do with me?

510
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,970
You can't pretend nothing happens.

511
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,370
I'm telling you,

512
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,170
you...

513
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,290
You stole my first kiss.

514
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,530
[I'm sticking with you for life.]

515
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,490
If you don't show up,

516
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,050
I'll rush over and carry you here in my arms.

517
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,050
When is it?

518
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,090
[In a few days.]

519
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,250
Kunlun,

520
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,050
the NCR is still in ruins.

521
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,610
As the Matriarch,

522
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,130
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

523
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:08,970
[I know]

524
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,250
[this banquet]

525
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,290
[matters to you.]

526
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,850
But my priority

527
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,570
is restoring

528
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,010
the realm now.

529
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,930
If that's how you...

530
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,010
[Once the NCR is stable,]

531
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,170
I'll head to the Celestial Realm.

532
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,610
No, I shall come to your place

533
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,690
and celebrate with you.

534
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,010
[I'm Bailing from Cangwu.]

535
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,610
[I beg you, Matriarch.]

536
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,610
[I want to spend my life with Little Fox.]

537
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,370
[I'm Kunlun from Wuzhang.]

538
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,130
[The Matriarch's power is unmatched.]

539
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,450
[I want to be with Luyao]

540
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,690
[for the rest of my life.]

541
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,610
When that day comes,

542
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,730
[I'll come to the Celestial Realm]

543
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,610
[as the Matriarch]

544
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,330
and hold a grand wedding for us.

545
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,970
It's rare

546
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,570
to see such things

547
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,530
in the Celestial Realm.

548
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,610
Got nothing better to do?

549
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:55,650
Getting shy?

550
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,890
C'mon, Jinxiu.

551
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,570
Isn't this nice?

552
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,690
Seeing mortal things

553
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,250
in the back garden here

554
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,130
is honestly a miracle.

555
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,250
I'm warning you,

556
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,530
no fireworks tonight.

557
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,330
Come on,

558
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,290
how could I mess up your big night?

559
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,130
Kunlun,

560
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,770
what do you think?

561
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:22,850
Great.

562
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,250
This is amazing.

563
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,130
Your Highness.

564
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,130
Isn't that the Eight Treasure Duck

565
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,570
we loved so much back in Wuzhang?

566
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,090
Yes.

567
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,130
I want to bring back everything

568
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,690
we cherish there.

569
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,530
So our parents can have a try.

570
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:44,890
Jinxiu,

571
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,370
I imagined all sorts of possibilities,

572
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,010
but I never thought

573
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,930
you'd have such a soft side.

574
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,130
Look around.

575
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,930
Candles and lanterns...

576
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,170
If the heavens had real nights,

577
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,610
the flickering candlelight

578
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,810
would be poetic.

579
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,130
How perfect.

580
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,610
Kunlun,

581
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,450
maybe it's better you

582
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,170
don't show up tonight.

583
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,490
No, Jinxiu.

584
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,850
I was kidding.

585
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,490
I'm genuinely happy for you.

586
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,850
Ever since you got together with Muxian,

587
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,210
you finally seem human.

588
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,650
Human?

589
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,410
What nonsense are you spouting?

590
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,130
I mean,

591
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,450
lovers destined to be together.

592
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,450
Shut up.

593
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,730
I've never been to such occasions.

594
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,330
I don't know what

595
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,290
a god's family banquet

596
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,370
is like.

597
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,250
Well...

598
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,610
Which dress should you wear?

599
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,850
Just pick any one.

600
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,410
How could you?

601
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,450
You're having a banquet with

602
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,490
the Monarch and Empress.

603
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,850
I've met

604
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,530
them many times.

605
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,250
This is different.

606
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,170
When you met them before,

607
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,970
you were just Muxian,

608
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,370
or the Floral Deity.

609
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,130
But this time is special.

610
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:31,890
It's

611
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,210
a family banquet.

612
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,690
You,

613
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,210
Muxian,

614
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,530
are the future Celestial Empress,

615
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,370
their daughter-in-law.

616
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,610
If you dress too plain,

617
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,650
others might look down on you.

618
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,410
Right.

619
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,090
How about the gown you wore

620
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,410
when you're appointed as Floral Deity?

621
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,170
No, no, no.

622
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,010
It might seem too flashy.

623
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,450
You're saying no

624
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,690
to everything.

625
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,170
Why are you so picky?

626
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,930
I'm picky?

627
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,250
You're no better.

628
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,210
You can't

629
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,290
help with anything.

630
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,530
How can you be so useless?

631
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:06,890
I...

632
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,530
Don't talk to me.

633
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,770
Muxian,

634
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:14,090
at the family banquet,

635
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,530
the Monarch,

636
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,730
the Empress,

637
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,610
and Sir Kunlun will attend.

638
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,370
We can't

639
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,210
afford to lose face.

640
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,330
Muxian,

641
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,610
look, what about this one?

642
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,449
I think this one is just fine.

643
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,889
C'mon,

644
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,650
isn't this outfit a bit

645
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:37,650
too simple?

646
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,489
Exactly.

647
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,610
That's good.

648
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,770
Simple is good.

649
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,130
Wait...

650
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:46,929
Actually,

651
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:47,489
you...

652
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,050
No...

653
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,170
Shut up.

654
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:50,929
This is all your fault!

655
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,170
I...

656
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,210
This place

657
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,810
feels so much more alive.

658
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,330
What do you think?

659
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,730
It reminds me of

660
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,930
the day you took me to your uncle and aunt.

661
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,090
I'm glad you like it.

662
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,890
I was really nervous.

663
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:27,770
[Jinxiu]

664
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,370
[has really]

665
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,090
[changed.]

666
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,250
Let's go.

667
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,530
Father,

668
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,450
Mother.

669
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,490
Greetings,

670
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,330
Your Majesties.

671
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,970
Well done, Jinxiu.

672
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,650
I never imagined

673
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,290
the Celestial Realm would look like this.

674
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:55,730
Thanks, Mom.

675
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,010
You are the future Monarch.

676
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,970
You should focus

677
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,970
on your coronation.

678
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,050
Understood.

679
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,490
Let's go.

680
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,290
Since Jinxiu hosts this banquet,

681
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,050
I may not be as thoughtful as him,

682
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,570
but I've still prepared something for you.

683
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,610
Showing up this late,

684
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,930
where are your manners?

685
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,130
The mortal feast

686
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,570
must be paired with fine wine.

687
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,770
Celestial wines are

688
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,970
either bland as water

689
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,050
or overwhelmingly sharp.

690
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,690
Try this wine from the mortal realm.

691
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,890
Took me quite a bit of effort to find it.

692
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,370
Alright.

693
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,570
Now that everyone's here,

694
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,890
let's begin.

695
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,650
[This is the closest I've ever been to Yaotian.]

696
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,410
Mortal family banquets

697
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,010
vary in taste from place to place.

698
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,330
Dad, Mom, you wouldn't believe it.

699
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,010
Jinxiu tried cooking

700
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,130
in the mortal realm.

701
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,290
And it was truly awful.

702
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,330
No wonder he made pastries

703
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,010
himself after returning.

704
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,170
Muxian, you're now the Floral Deity.

705
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,650
Your poise and demeanor

706
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,690
are nothing like

707
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:07,730
the junior immortal

708
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,810
you were when you just ascended.

709
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,450
I'm flattered.

710
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,930
Before, you also cultivated

711
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,810
in the mortal world.

712
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,930
Did your family have any

713
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,050
special traditions for banquets?

714
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,610
I

715
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,490
was orphaned.

716
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,730
I never had a family banquet before.

717
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,050
Mortal affairs

718
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,250
are trivial.

719
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,610
It's no loss that

720
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,090
you never had family banquets.

721
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,250
Now that you've ascended

722
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,490
and become immortal,

723
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,330
there's no need to

724
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,530
dwell on your past.

725
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,370
Father, Mother, I have

726
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,610
something important to ask of you.

727
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,850
I've agreed for you

728
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,970
to hold such a banquet.

729
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,490
What more do you want?

730
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,090
[Report!]

731
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,850
[Urgent matter.]

732
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,250
The Punisher is requested.

733
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,490
Punishment takes precedence.

734
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,970
Let's end

735
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,250
the banquet here.

736
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,570
Father!

737
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,410
This won't last long.

738
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,570
I can take Jinxiu's place

739
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,890
for the punishment just once.

740
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,850
I've wanted to

741
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:19,970
try out the Punisher's look.

742
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:20,570
Nonsense!

743
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,730
The Punisher's role isn't a game!

744
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,690
Duties come first.

745
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,690
Just go.

746
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,290
Father.

747
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,090
Please grant me

748
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,850
your blessing to marry Muxian.

749
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,330
Insolence!

750
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,930
You've suffered in tribulations,

751
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,050
so I've been more than lenient with you.

752
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,610
But you're pushing your luck

753
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,250
and neglecting your duty!

754
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,930
For her,

755
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,690
have you even forgotten who you are?

756
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,570
Father.

757
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,010
It doesn't conflict with my duty.

758
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:01,890
No conflict?

759
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:03,810
You broke off

760
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,290
your engagement with the Matriarch,

761
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,730
sowing the seeds of trouble.

762
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:10,370
If not

763
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,250
for Kunlun's

764
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,010
engagement with Luyao,

765
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,650
the NCR would've slipped

766
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,170
from our control because of you!

767
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,410
You're about to inherit the throne.

768
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,490
But still you waste your time here,

769
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,770
recreating so-called mortal scenes!

770
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,250
What are you thinking?

771
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,970
Are you taking this seriously?

772
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:33,810
Father...

773
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,490
Kunlun,

774
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,170
stop pleading for Jinxiu.

775
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,170
Divine Punishment awaits.

776
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,210
Why are you still here?

777
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,090
Father!

778
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:50,370
Father,

779
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,890
growing up in the Celestial Realm,

780
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,370
I've diligent and careful,

781
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,690
following your teachings.

782
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,090
Without these trials,

783
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,970
I'd never have truly understood

784
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,210
what you, Mother,

785
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:07,970
and Kunlun

786
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,570
mean to me.

787
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:11,610
Muxian

788
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,730
is the love of my life.

789
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,770
I'm asking

790
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,130
for your

791
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,930
blessing to marry her.

792
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,570
I've ruled as Monarch for 10,000 years

793
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,610
and never held a family banquet.

794
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,970
Do you know why?

795
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,170
Because

796
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,130
it makes you weak!

797
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,090
I

798
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,850
allowed you this banquet

799
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,810
out of leniency and compassion.

800
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,810
But indulgence is impossible!

801
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,170
You've been back long enough.

802
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,370
I thought you'd know better,

803
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,170
but you're still

804
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,210
shortsighted!

805
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,370
You think

806
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,450
those trials are

807
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,850
for understanding

808
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,530
love and feelings?

809
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:15,770
Never!

810
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,650
They're to teach you that

811
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,930
amid the conflicts and chaos,

812
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,130
only order,

813
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,730
fairness, and justice

814
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,770
endure!

815
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:27,570
Father,

816
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,930
all I want

817
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,530
is to be with the one I love.

818
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,490
That doesn't mean I'll slack off!

819
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:40,770
You have no right.
