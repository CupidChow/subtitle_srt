3
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,520
Floral Deity...sir?

4
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,280
Jinxiu?

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,160
Insolent! How dare you

6
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,280
speak his sacred name!

7
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,840
You bear the sacred mark?

8
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,520
You, are you really Floral Deity?

9
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,639
Hongning.

10
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,320
Y-you...

11
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,400
do you actually know me?

12
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,640
Madam Floral Deity

13
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,600
must be breathtakingly beautiful!

14
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,600
She must have a heart of gold.

15
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
I just know she's a nice person!

16
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,560
Listen to me,

17
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,840
I am the Floral Deity.

18
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,440
The Floral Deity I seek,

19
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,160
bears a...

20
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,000
a sacred mark

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,079
right on her forehead.

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,840
She certainly wouldn't be like you,

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
always hanging around here

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,800
passing time.

25
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,440
Hey...

26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
Camellia pixie,

27
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,600
you have escaped the Scroll,

28
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,079
and the blossoms still slumber.

29
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,079
You're not qualified here!

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,760
Sir,

31
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,520
she does have an invitation.

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,480
Why not give her a chance?

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,720
That's right, sir!

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,520
Please give her a chance!

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,520
Sir!

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,400
Present your flower.

37
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,920
[Look, there's nothing!]

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,480
[It hasn't bloomed at all!]

39
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,120
[What's going on?]

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,079
You come empty-handed,

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,520
no blooms,

42
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,960
no nectar.

43
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,120
You still have the courage to show up?

44
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
Your flower hasn't bloomed.

45
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,640
You may leave now.

46
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,160
I...

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,320
Sir...

48
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,079
It has bloomed!

49
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,480
It's bloomed, Hongning!

50
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,840
How extraordinary...

51
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,960
This is not a camellia!

52
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,800
It just...

53
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,520
It's not right.

54
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,240
This isn't a flower at all!

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,320
I know every flower in existence,

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,280
yet I've never seen anything like this.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,560
Out with it!

58
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,680
What dark sorcery have you cast?

59
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,480
No...

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,200
I didn't do anything, really.

61
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,720
This is the flower of the weeds.

62
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
Difu?

63
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,080
[Difu...]

64
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,680
It is not an ordinary plant.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It possesses its own spirit.

66
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,080
Yet its fierce nature and

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,560
habit of consuming other plants

68
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,120
make it difficult to nurture.

69
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,520
How did you manage to grow it?

70
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,120
I...

71
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,840
I think I...

72
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,760
Once it takes hold,

73
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,200
it's nearly impossible to eliminate.

74
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,040
Clearly,

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,159
it has been feeding off

76
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,720
your camellias.

77
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,400
She has failed to cultivate camellias.

78
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,320
What are you waiting for? Take her away!

79
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,880
I...

80
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,000
Apricot,

81
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,400
you must know

82
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,920
better than anyone

83
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,320
why Hongning chose to

84
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,159
plant camellias

85
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,840
in that soil dominated by weeds.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,880
Since the weeds

87
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,760
consumed camellias,

88
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,480
you should not be held responsible.

89
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,240
It cannot cultivate spiritual power and

90
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,680
is difficult to tame.

91
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,680
So it has never received equal treatment

92
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,000
or patient care from anyone.

93
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,800
Now, it has bloomed

94
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,960
for the first time in millennia

95
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,480
thanks to your spiritual energy.

96
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,200
Far from being at fault,

97
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,200
you've achieved something remarkable.

98
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,159
Camellia pixie,

99
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,760
the Floral Deity has graced you with praise.

100
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,920
Show your appreciation in return.

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,640
Gratitude, sir!

102
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,600
What reward do you wish for?

103
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,880
May I ask for anything I want?

104
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,480
Let me hear your request first.

105
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,080
If it's within my power, I shall grant it.

106
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
May I be your queen?

107
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
What are you all laughing about?

108
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
Why are you laughing?

109
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,920
Camellia pixie,

110
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,120
you're ignorant about love and marriage.

111
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,360
Why would you make such a demand?

112
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,080
I want to show my gratitude.

113
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,160
He saved my life before.

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
There're countless ways to show gratitude.

115
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,480
Besides,

116
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,480
tending to flowers and plants

117
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,600
is the duty of Celestial Monarch.

118
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,560
He has also saved my edelweiss before.

119
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,000
Does that mean the edelweiss

120
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,600
should also become his queen?

121
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,960
She made a valid point.

122
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,800
Among these hundreds of flowers,

123
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,840
His Divine Highness saved ten of them.

124
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,680
Should they all follow your example?

125
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,240
Then...

126
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,480
How else can I express my gratitude?

127
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,440
All Divine Queens are celestial beings.

128
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,080
You should pursue the path of immortality.

129
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,840
The path of immortality?

130
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,680
Yes.

131
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,360
Once I attain immortality,

132
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,120
could we be together?

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,560
First, achieve immortality.

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,840
Yes!

135
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
-We wish you a gracious departure!
-We wish you a gracious departure!

136
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,240
Finally,

137
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,720
I've been waiting for you for ages.

138
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
How did she get out?

139
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,920
I've got nothing to do with it, OK?

140
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
See for yourself!

141
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,960
Why didn't I think of that?

142
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,960
It's impossible to count all the petals.

143
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,240
If you set it on fire, the answer is zero,

144
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,280
right?

145
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,400
This camellia pixie

146
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,920
is indeed something!

147
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
She wouldn't beg

148
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,120
even when I gave her the chance.

149
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,560
Tell me, where did you find

150
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,960
such an amusing little thing?

151
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,080
By the way,

152
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
why is she so obsessed with you?

153
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Did you do something to her?

154
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
What's going on between you two?

155
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,000
Something feels off.

156
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,360
I'll stop.

157
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,360
Stop...

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,480
We should go.

159
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,800
Where to?

160
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,160
Father and Mother are summoning us.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,080
Are there other Floral Scrolls as well?

162
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,360
Yeah, there are.

163
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,640
You want to fight?

164
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,840
Let me warn you!

165
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,800
I've grown stronger within the scroll.

166
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,240
Today will be the day I subdue you!

167
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
Come forth if you dare!

168
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,680
What?

169
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,080
You secretly advanced to the third level

170
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,840
of the Oceanic Art during my absence?

171
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,960
I didn't wait for your absence, nor did I do it secretly.

172
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,840
Well, you should at least untie me.

173
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,440
This is rather embarrassing.

174
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,800
How heartless you are!

175
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,120
Embarrassed?

176
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,000
Everyone's already used to your antics.

177
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,640
Why does she get to stay?

178
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,560
If I had known this would happen,

179
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,840
I shouldn't have sent her an invitation!

180
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,280
Greetings, my lady!

181
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,000
No formalities.

182
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,280
My incompetence has made me a fool.

183
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,680
I sincerely apologize.

184
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,480
Don't worry about it.

185
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,840
Are you here to see His Divine Highness?

186
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,200
He went back to the Celestial Realm with Sir Kunlun.

187
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,920
I'm not.

188
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,440
I came specifically for you.

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Me?

190
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,360
Greetings, father, mother.

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,120
Spending centuries on mere petals,

192
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,040
it surely deserves a place in the archives.

193
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,720
Mother,

194
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
if only you knew.

195
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,080
Every time I counted,

196
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,640
I contemplated

197
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,320
my past transgressions,

198
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,360
filled with repentance.

199
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,520
That's why it took so long.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
The flowers in the scroll

201
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,200
die at dusk and bloom at dawn...

202
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,000
It is truly a refined form of torment.

203
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,000
Yet,

204
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,800
while I have suffered,

205
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,880
it has indeed tempered my mind and spirit.

206
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,720
Living in the scroll, you're well-fed,

207
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,800
free from royal responsibilities,

208
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,560
and, how fortunate,

209
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,520
saved from seeing your royal parents.

210
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,520
My, what cruel punishment you've endured!

211
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,720
Mother,

212
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,120
he has truly spent these years

213
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,920
in sincere reflection.

214
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,320
After he froze all of Mt. Misty 's backside,

215
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,080
you still wish to defend him?

216
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,600
Enough now.

217
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,280
It happened centuries ago.

218
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,680
He's served his punishment.

219
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,560
There's no need to dwell on it.

220
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,560
Jinxiu,

221
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,480
Has he truly finished counting the petals?

222
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,160
Cease this constant defending of him.

223
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,400
He couldn't escape the scroll

224
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
until every petal was counted.

225
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,920
Kunlun

226
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,680
has finished the task.

227
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,040
So how many petals were there in total?

228
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,400
Mother, about that...

229
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,800
I'll tell you in private.

230
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,720
Father,

231
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,840
I genuinely realize my faults now.

232
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,960
I promise I'll find a way to restore

233
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,840
the divine vegetation I damaged.

234
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,080
You've matured.

235
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,200
Your Divine Majesty,

236
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,920
now that Sir Kunlun has returned,

237
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
we should entrust him with proper duties.

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,920
Fair point.

239
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,040
However,

240
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,080
when I put you in charge of the weather,

241
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,960
you made quite a mess of it.

242
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,560
Let's start with something simpler.

243
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,880
Jinxiu,

244
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,720
see if there're any positions in the

245
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,640
Floralia Palace that would suit him.

246
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,080
Yes, father.

247
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,040
Gratitude, father.

248
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,520
I vow to diligently cultivate my powers

249
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,640
alongside my brother, father.

250
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,600
My queen, what would you advise?

251
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,520
Cause any more trouble,

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,720
I'll personally see to your punishment!

253
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,480
Yes, mother!

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,920
This sacred stone from the lotus pool

255
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,560
of the Northern Celestial Realm (NCR)

256
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,840
has been infused with divine energy for millennia.

257
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,440
It enhances one's spiritual cultivation.

258
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,640
My lady,

259
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,560
this is far too precious.

260
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,520
You've served faithfully by

261
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,520
His Divine Highness's side.

262
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,800
You've earned it.

263
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,840
I merely did my job, my lady.

264
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,120
I rarely interact with other floral fairies.

265
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,880
Sir Jinxiu's overwhelmed with his duties.

266
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,840
Without you,

267
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,120
I wouldn't have the faintest idea

268
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,480
how to lighten his burden.

269
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,880
I'm flattered, my lady.

270
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,840
It's no secret that you and Sir Jinxiu

271
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,120
are promised to each other.

272
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,320
The sacred union merely awaits

273
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,680
his return to the Celestial Realm.

274
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,360
Promised union?

275
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
That was merely a casual jest

276
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,240
between my father and His Divine Majesty.

277
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,320
It shouldn't be taken seriously.

278
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,960
Besides, didn't we just witness a fairy

279
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,560
confessing her feelings to Sir Jinxiu?

280
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,040
That Hongning is nothing but a shameless,

281
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,960
ill-mannered country flower.

282
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,960
Did you know?

283
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,840
She's from Mt. Baizhou.

284
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,680
Mt. Baizhou?

285
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,760
So, that makes her a...

286
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,160
demon?

287
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,160
Indeed,

288
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,200
she's a demon through and through.

289
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,280
She bloomed without permission.

290
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,520
Sir Jinxiu caught her

291
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,160
and brought her here for punishment.

292
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
She's been nothing but trouble ever since.

293
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,240
Sir Jinxiu would keep a creature like that

294
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,080
in the Celestial Realm?

295
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,640
My lady, perhaps you haven't heard,

296
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,480
the Camellia clan has long fallen from grace.

297
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,640
They can't achieve divine ascension.

298
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,200
Sir Jinxiu merely feels pity for them.

299
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,880
This one just happened to cross his path.

300
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,720
No wonder...

301
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,480
Be at peace, my lady.

302
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,560
Even if she's blessed with divine destiny,

303
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,360
her ignorance of heavenly etiquette

304
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,960
will surely lead to her departure.

305
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,800
Envoy Plum,

306
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,000
this is the complete Flower Fairy List.

307
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,120
I need you to thoroughly examine

308
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,600
the qualifications of everyone listed here,

309
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,920
then assist me in

310
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,400
selecting the 12 Flower Fairies.

311
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,840
Understood.

312
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,200
These flowers are flourishing far better

313
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,440
than they did centuries ago!

314
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,240
It's all thanks to you,

315
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,320
peacefully residing

316
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,280
in the Flora Scroll

317
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,760
these past centuries.

318
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,480
With all your troublemaking,

319
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,680
they could never have flourished so well.

320
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,080
No need to thank me for that.

321
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,240
There are no idle positions in here.

322
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,160
Since you're so fond of wine,

323
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,800
you shall oversee the Wine Garden.

324
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,920
The lilies there are in full bloom,

325
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,840
requiring nurturing day and night.

326
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Do not slack in your duties.

327
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,680
Well, rest assured.

328
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,920
Piece of cake!

329
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,680
Greetings, Sir.

330
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,560
Sir Kunlun.

331
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,840
Envoy Apricot.

332
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,360
Sir,

333
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,760
they have urgent matters to report.

334
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,720
Sir,

335
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,840
that little pixie has shown

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,320
constant disregard for our sacred rules.

337
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,200
She even crashed the floralia without a flower.

338
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,200
Her continued presence here

339
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,560
will only undermine your authority.

340
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,440
You call that crashing?

341
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,480
I was the one who brought her in.

342
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,880
If you had objections,

343
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,800
why didn't you voice them then?

344
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,119
I dared not contradict

345
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,839
your wishes back then.

346
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,720
Were you hesitant to contradict me,

347
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,920
or was it

348
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,760
Envoy Apricot you dared not cross?

349
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,760
We wouldn't dare!

350
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,040
Sir,

351
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,200
I willingly accept any punishment

352
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,720
to set an example for others.

353
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,240
However, rules are rules.

354
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,119
I humbly request the pixie be banished.

355
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,840
I wasn't aware you had

356
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,920
become the one making such decisions.

357
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,240
But she's a demon, after all!

358
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,880
Have you forgotten your own beginnings?

359
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,560
I...

360
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,680
Envoy Plum,

361
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,120
what's your take on this?

362
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
In my humble opinion,

363
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,680
while it's true she shouldn't be registered

364
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,320
without her camellia blooming,

365
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,840
she did merit in cultivating the weeds.

366
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,240
Perhaps we could let her cultivate here.

367
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,120
However, her demon status might indeed

368
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,440
cause some concerns

369
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,320
among the immortals.

370
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,560
Jinxiu,

371
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,280
how about this:

372
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,760
let her stay with me.

373
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,560
I can see she's gifted

374
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,560
and destined for immortality.

375
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,520
If she helps me tend to the Wine Garden,

376
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,640
I'll personally guide her cultivation.

377
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,600
Send her to the Withered Garden.

378
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,360
A wise decision, Your Divine Highness!

379
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,560
Fine,

380
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,880
the Withered Garden it is.

381
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,960
Envoy Apricot,

382
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,120
you've neglected your duties,

383
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,600
abandoning the weeds to waste away.

384
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,880
Deflected blame,

385
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
causing innocent ones to suffer in your stead.

386
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,440
And you've abused your power.

387
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,240
Did you honestly think

388
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,440
you could hide your involvement

389
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,200
in NCR Matriarch's act?

390
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,440
Apologies, Sir!

391
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,040
Clearly,

392
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,000
stripping you of powers for a few centuries

393
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
hasn't taught you your lesson!

394
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,520
Off to the Phantom Reflector with you!

395
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,720
Sir,

396
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,880
please hear me!

397
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,160
All I've done was with

398
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,600
the palace's best interests at heart!

399
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,960
If that's your idea of serving the palace,

400
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,240
then you're even more blind

401
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,440
to right and wrong.

402
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,680
Take her away!

403
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,120
Your Divine Highness!

404
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,040
Your Divine Highness.

405
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
Spare your pleas on her behalf.

406
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,320
No release until

407
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,360
enlightenment.

408
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes.

409
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,200
Okay.

410
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,840
What's this place?

411
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,320
The Withered Garden.

412
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,880
Flowers of the Floralia Palace

413
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,320
are blessed by Sir Jinxiu

414
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,720
to bloom forever.

415
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,240
But some have damaged,

416
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,000
withered and fading,

417
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,280
need careful tending to bloom again.

418
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
They all end up here.

419
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,440
Why am I here?

420
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,320
Since entering the palace,

421
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,880
you've broken countless rules,

422
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,920
even barged into the banquet.

423
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,520
You should've been banished.

424
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,080
Only Sir Jinxiu's mercy

425
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,040
lets you stay to cultivate here.

426
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,240
But punishment is inevitable.

427
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,680
Until you achieve immortality,

428
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,080
you'll reside here.

429
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,160
White Camellia...

430
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,200
Hongning.

431
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,240
Hongning.

432
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,520
Hongning.

433
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,080
Shaoyao, what brings you here?

434
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,480
Some peonies withered.

435
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,800
I brought them to you.

436
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,600
You're fibbing, I know it.

437
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,800
Out of all flowers there,

438
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,400
peonies bloom the best.

439
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,960
Admit it, you just missed me.

440
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,360
Wait up!

441
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,440
Stop teasing me.

442
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,400
So that deity you mentioned earlier

443
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,920
turns out to be Sir Jinxiu?

444
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,960
But her forehead's always bare,

445
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,080
no Sacred Mark in sight.

446
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Sacred Mark?

447
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,720
That's like an emperor's crown!

448
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,920
Only appears during rituals

449
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,480
or when subduing demons.

450
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,640
You can't see it everyday.

451
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,240
But...

452
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,200
Everyone in

453
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,880
the palace knows it

454
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,560
except you.

455
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,800
Right, right.

456
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,160
There's a silly Hongning

457
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,280
who didn't realize

458
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,920
the Floral Deity and Sir Jinxiu

459
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,120
are the same person.

460
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,520
You're teasing me again.

461
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,760
It's Apricot's fault!

462
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,760
If not for her,

463
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,280
you wouldn't be sent here.

464
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,360
But she's trapped in Phantom Reflector.

465
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,880
Peace at last.

466
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,320
It's okay, Shaoyao.

467
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,960
I actually like it here.

468
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,680
Look.

469
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,120
If I can make these all bloom again,

470
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,000
wouldn't that boost my cultivation?

471
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,840
Besides,

472
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,720
Sir Jinxiu wants me to focus.

473
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,240
I'll prove myself worthy.

474
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,800
You're

475
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,400
such a silly girl.

476
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,880
People take advantage of you.

477
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,920
But with you here,

478
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,240
they won't mess with me.

479
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
Apricot's position reserving,

480
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,920
I've selected 17 fairies

481
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,640
including Tumi, Lanhua with

482
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
potential to become 12 Floral Fairies.

483
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,280
Has Hongning

484
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,160
been sent to the Withered Garden?

485
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,680
Yes.

486
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,280
That red camellia...

487
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,240
Any concerns?

488
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,040
The Garden lacks sunlight and rain.

489
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,120
Harsh conditions for blooming.

490
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,320
But her impulsive nature

491
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,720
might cause trouble

492
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,400
in the Floralia Palace.

493
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,720
Besides,

494
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,640
tending to withered flowers

495
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,040
will help her cultivation.

496
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,640
It's best to

497
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,160
let her stay there for now.

498
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,680
Understood.

499
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,120
And Kunlun—

500
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,160
keep an eye on him.

501
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,960
No more incidents.

502
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,880
Yes, I will.

503
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,040
There.

504
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,600
Just water and sun them regularly,

505
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,280
they'll recover soon.

506
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,200
Thanks, Shaoyao.

507
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,880
You really...

508
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,480
Declaring love publicly

509
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,760
to Sir Jinxiu

510
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,440
will make you

511
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,080
a target, don't you think?

512
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,280
If you love him,

513
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,840
just keep it secret.

514
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,800
Saying it out loud is embarrassing.

515
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,360
Love?

516
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
What's love?

517
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,840
You don't even know what love is,

518
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,520
yet claim to be his consort?

519
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,240
Just wanna repay his kindness.

520
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,880
No, no.

521
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,040
You only marry someone

522
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,880
you truly love.

523
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,720
What's "love" even mean?

524
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,320
It's when

525
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,120
his joys and sorrows

526
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,760
[become indistinguishable]

527
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,120
[from yours.]

528
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,040
[You prioritize him]

529
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,360
even above your own well-being.

530
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,640
Love

531
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,520
means craving his presence.

532
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,520
Missing him terribly apart.

533
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,000
Time flies together,

534
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,320
crawls when separated.

535
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:54,920
Right?

536
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,000
Exactly!

537
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,120
And love

538
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,720
isn't confessed lightly.

539
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Requires absolute certainty,

540
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,880
selfless consideration.

541
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,200
[Anyway.]

542
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,880
[Don't just blurt it out carelessly.]

543
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,160
Once said, you can't take it back.

544
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,520
Then I must truly love Sir Jinxiu.

545
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,520
How do you know all this?

546
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,880
Where did you grow up

547
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,360
in the mortal realm?

548
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,640
Oh, that fabulous place.

549
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,240
Flower-filled, beauty-surrounded.

550
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,200
Watched lovers come and go daily.

551
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,800
Experience

552
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,840
teaches.

553
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,040
Sounds amazing!

554
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,880
What's it called?

555
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,280
Garden of Blossoms.

556
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,920
Garden of Blossoms?

557
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,120
Never heard of it.

558
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,480
[Hongning?]

559
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,280
[Punishment time.]

560
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,480
Coming.

561
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,720
Sir.

562
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,000
I should've believed

563
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,000
you're the Floral Deity.

564
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,840
Making the withered bloom

565
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,960
requires spiritual nourishment.

566
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,320
Awakening plant spirits

567
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,160
is a unique power of the plant clan.

568
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,680
But you're too weak

569
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,960
to master it.

570
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,360
I meditate every day like

571
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Envoy Plum said.

572
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,520
Start with the basic

573
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,120
Spirit Evocation.

574
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,120
Sit.

575
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,720
Plant spirits

576
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,600
flow through your entire being.

577
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,120
Your first task

578
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,040
is awakening your powers.

579
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Sir.

580
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,000
Becoming a deity

581
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,440
allows me to be your consort?

582
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Cultivation is a blessing

583
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,080
in itself.

584
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,080
It has nothing to do

585
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,720
with marriage.

586
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,760
But I love you!

587
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,480
I want to be your consort!

588
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,560
Nonsense!

589
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,800
Do you even know what "love" means?

590
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,480
Of course I do!

591
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,680
Shaoyao explained it to me.

592
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,400
"Love" means

593
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,280
the desire to see you,

594
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,680
feeling joy in your presence,

595
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,680
wanting to be with you forever.

596
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:55,920
Stop.

597
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,640
Deities and pixies

598
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,000
walk different paths.

599
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,280
What?

600
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,320
Why different paths?

601
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,920
You're deity, I'm pixie.

602
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,920
Yet here we are,

603
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,840
sharing this space.

604
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,600
I'm guiding your cultivation.

605
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,840
Pixies are born wicked,

606
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
spreading chaos,

607
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,040
and deserve to die.

608
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,280
Deities associating with them

609
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,760
deserve punishment.

610
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,320
That's not true!

611
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,240
Come to Mt. Baizhou with me

612
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,080
and you'll see.

613
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,680
We're not evil like you think.

614
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,480
My friends there are pixies,

615
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,280
but they're kind and good.

616
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,440
They've done nothing wrong.

617
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,920
"Partial evil brings decade-long frost."

618
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,320
When few err,

619
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,960
must millions freeze?

620
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,800
How dare you!

621
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,640
That is punishment

622
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,240
for mortal sins.

623
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,440
But most mortals

624
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,720
are innocent!

625
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
Your divine justice

626
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,640
shackles blameless mortals

627
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,320
to suffer silently,

628
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,480
while virtuous pixies

629
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,400
bear false accusations!

630
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,360
How dare you question the divine order?

631
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,600
I'm not.

632
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,160
It's just unfair!

633
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,000
You...

634
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,400
I'll cultivate diligently

635
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,000
[to become your consort.]

636
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,960
Oh, you...

637
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,960
Decade-long frost...

638
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,400
When few err,

639
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,080
millions freeze!

640
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,040
True.

641
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,040
What's true?

642
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,240
No, that's not true.

643
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,360
If evil goes unpunished, how can we

644
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,160
deter wickedness?

645
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:29,880
Yeah.

646
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,880
Without punishment,

647
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,200
how do we govern mortals?

648
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:32,920
Exactly.

649
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,200
I should've said that!

650
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,160
You bet!

651
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
But she'd counter.

652
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,440
"Innocents still suffer."

653
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,640
Yet such is divine order!

654
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,960
Right.

655
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
How dare she

656
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,280
questioning the order!

657
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,160
Sir, calm down!

658
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,320
Your voice cracked...

659
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,840
Who ruffled your divine feathers?

660
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,960
None of your business!

661
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,680
Sir...

662
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,480
I know I shouldn't pry,

663
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,880
but it's my job to record this!

664
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,680
Sir!

665
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,880
Sir!

666
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,520
Why'd you freeze me?

667
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,680
Sir!

668
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,520
Why target me?

669
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,720
Sir, let me go!

670
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,160
Wait.

671
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,040
Help.

672
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,800
Sir.

673
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,080
Why are you here?

674
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,800
Should be cultivating,

675
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,400
yet napping instead?

676
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,720
I have been training.

677
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,640
But somehow...

678
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,560
It makes me more exhausted.

679
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,080
Can't even handle basic thunder strikes?

680
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,560
[Tribulation is]

681
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,080
[a thousand times worse.]

682
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,040
Will I get vaporized then?

683
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,080
Basic evasion requires

684
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,520
shape-shifting.

685
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,880
Have a try.

686
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,560
Transform into a Qingxue Tree.

687
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,080
I can't do it

688
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,040
if you watch me.

689
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,640
Why?

690
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,000
[I'm nervous!]

691
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Chant the Serenity Litany.

692
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,680
"Still your heart, curb your desires."

693
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,400
How do you not even know basic

694
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,280
litany?

695
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,680
Fine, I'll turn around.

696
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,400
Hurry up.

697
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,840
Remember -

698
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,440
Magic requires absolute focus.

699
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,880
Concentrate completely

700
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,680
[on your desired form.]

701
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,120
Channel spiritual energy

702
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,440
through your fingertips.

703
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,440
Visualize the Qingxue Tree.

704
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,600
You...

705
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,800
I said focus, didn't I?

706
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,480
Why a peony instead?

707
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,920
Because I was thinking of you.

708
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,800
Sir.

709
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,400
I have a question.

710
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,760
Do you love me?

711
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,280
At the Celestial Floralia,

712
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,040
[you promised if I become a deity,]

713
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,960
you'd take me as your consort.

714
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,560
Don't forget!

715
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,360
Enough nonsense. Train harder.

716
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:56,880
And...

717
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,600
Wipe your face.

718
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,520
[What's happening?]

719
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,320
[Must be palpitations.]

720
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,440
[It can't be…]

721
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,320
[It can't be…]

722
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,920
You...

723
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,160
I said focus!

724
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
Why a peony instead?

725
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,920
Because I was thinking of you.

726
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,280
Do you love me?

727
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,760
[Better get rid of this.]

728
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,480
[Still your heart.]

729
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,360
[Still your heart.]

730
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,000
[Still your heart,]

731
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,280
[curb your desires.]

732
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,840
[Pavilion administrators]

733
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,880
[must maintain]

734
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,160
[exterior positioning]

735
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,000
[for unscheduled]

736
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,320
[Floral Deity inspections.]

737
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,280
[Remember -]

738
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,080
[Magic requires absolute]

739
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,040
[focus.]

740
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,320
[Concentrate completely]

741
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,040
[on your desired form.]

742
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
[Channel spiritual energy]

743
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,880
[through your fingertips.]

744
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,880
[Visualize the Qingxue Tree.]

745
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,400
Oh, no.

746
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,760
Why did I turn into Jinxiu?

747
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,840
What's this?

748
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,040
[He's]

749
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,440
[built different from me.]

750
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,800
[Never mind.]

751
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,720
[Better revert first.]

752
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,720
Stop.

753
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,480
Who's skulking around there?

754
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,400
Sorry...

755
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,240
Sir.

756
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,720
I didn't realize it was you,

757
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,080
my apologies!

758
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,360
[Right, I'm Jinxiu now.]

759
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,360
Sir...

760
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,040
No harm done.

761
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,360
Sir.

762
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,560
The NCR Matriarch

763
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,000
brought edelweiss nectar.

764
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,720
Awaits at your pavilion.

765
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,400
Would you like to meet her?

766
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,160
What was that again?

767
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,200
edelweiss nectar.

768
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,920
Absolutely! Where?

769
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,760
This way.

770
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,560
Let's go!

771
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,520
Hi.

772
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,200
Greetings, Your Highness.

773
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,760
You're stunning!

774
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,000
So beautiful.

775
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,280
You're usually secluded.

776
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,880
Unexpected honor today.

777
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,200
I hope I'm not

778
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,400
disturbing you?

779
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,480
Not at all, not at all.

780
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,800
How could you be?

781
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,800
Did you

782
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,600
bring something for me?

783
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,400
Where is it?

784
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,840
edelweiss nectar.

785
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,760
Here.

786
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,840
Smells amazing!

787
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,320
Exquisite scent.

788
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,960
Try it, go on.

789
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,720
How is it?

790
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,120
It's good.

791
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,600
If you likes this nectar,

792
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
I'll bring more.

793
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,400
Thanks but no.

794
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,240
[It won't be me you're seeing.]

795
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,920
You seem

796
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,720
more animated today.

797
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,240
Right?

798
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,440
I agree!

799
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,800
My face used to be

800
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,720
all stony scowls and rigid lines,

801
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,760
never exactly charming.

802
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,120
This smile suits better,

803
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:55,840
don't you think?

804
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,800
Sir.

805
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,760
The Matriarch's inside.

806
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,440
What's with the stare?

807
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,600
Your eyebrows

808
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,840
are magnificently shaped.

809
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,440
Lean closer.
