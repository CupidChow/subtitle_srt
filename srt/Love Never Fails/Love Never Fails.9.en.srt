[Love Never Fails]
[EP09]

3
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,560
Done yet? I can't feel my feet.

4
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,920
If you move now,

5
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,479
I'll have to start all over again.

6
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,600
Alright, alright,

7
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,479
I'll stay still.

8
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,040
Why is it taking you so long?

9
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,360
You should paint the peach trees next door.

10
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,360
They're in full bloom right now.

11
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,680
Earlier you wouldn't let me paint the tree.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You had to be in the picture.

13
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,560
Now that we're halfway through,

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,600
suddenly you can't keep still?

15
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,440
I had no idea you'd need so much time.

16
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,200
All done.

17
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,640
What do you think?

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,720
The last time I painted

19
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,560
was on my mother's birthday.

20
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,880
I'll never forget how

21
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,079
absolutely amazed she was.

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
I suppose she asked you to keep it private,

23
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,880
away from the other guests, right?

24
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,480
How did you know that?

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,720
And I bet she had it tucked away?

26
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,600
Yeah, exactly.

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,280
Just as I thought.

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,640
Stay still.

29
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,640
So now what, I need to paint you?

30
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,240
Is that such an unpleasant task?

31
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,960
Wait a minute,

32
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,760
I'm trying to figure this out.

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
Are all these steps really necessary

34
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,440
to leave this place?

35
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,880
Saving Shuixian, signing a contract, now painting...

36
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,640
How many steps do we have to go through?

37
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,040
How was I supposed to know

38
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,880
this thing would drag on forever?

39
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,880
Fair point.

40
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,040
Well...

41
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,040
based on my experience

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,600
escaping from the Flora Scroll...

43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,720
What if we just

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,600
torch the whole thing?

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,560
Stop with these wild ideas.

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,360
Carry on with our task.

47
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,480
Alright then.

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,960
The Chus sent their matchmakers again.

49
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,200
Well, why not marry their daughter?

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,399
She's quite the beauty, after all.

51
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,279
But if I marry, everything would change.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,560
No more enjoying

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,520
delicacies together,

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,040
no more spontaneous adventures.

55
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,440
Our casual conversations would end too,

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,120
and you certainly can't stay at my residence.

57
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
Does that mean we must part ways?

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
I've come of age,

59
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,120
yet remain unwed.

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
Marriage is a natural part of life.

61
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,680
The greatest transgression against

62
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,240
one's parents is to leave no heir.

63
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,800
But I'm a divine being.

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,120
Immortals and humans walk different paths.

65
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,040
Let's put aside that divine differences.

66
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,520
There's something I need to ask you.

67
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,680
Go ahead, ask.

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you happy when you're with me?

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,120
Do you miss me

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,680
when we're apart?

71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
When my heart soars or breaks,

72
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,520
does yours follow?

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,000
It does.

74
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,600
Would you risk everything to save me

75
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,520
if I were in danger?

76
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,800
Of course I would.

77
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
Then does your heart race

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,400
when I come this close?

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,040
Stop...

80
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,800
don't come any closer.

81
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,920
You're near enough to... to kiss me.

82
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,080
If your heart beats for me

83
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,840
as mine does for you,

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,840
what's wrong with a kiss?

85
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400
As immortals,

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,080
we can only kiss after marriage.

87
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,560
Well then,

88
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,480
let's get married.

89
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,680
We came to rescue His Divine Highness,

90
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,480
but now we're trapped here ourselves.

91
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,600
Who would've thought this Shuixian Mirage

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,160
would be more formidable than Floral Scroll.

93
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,960
Must we remain trapped in this mirage,

94
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,040
caught in an endless cycle?

95
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,200
Perhaps the key to breaking free

96
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,000
lies within Shuixian's story itself.

97
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,240
I just don't understand.

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,200
Why is His Divine Highness

99
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,840
so determined to save that pixie?

100
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
What's the story behind this Shuixian?

101
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,720
She was once the Floralia Palace.

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,240
I met her when I was little.

103
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,640
What caused her to lose her divine status

104
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,840
and descend as a demon?

105
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,240
She chose to relinquish her divine status.

106
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,000
They say she and Duanfei truly wed,

107
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,240
swearing eternal devotion to each other.

108
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,760
Little did they know,

109
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,800
their union would lead to consequences

110
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,800
far more dire than they could imagine.

111
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,800
What...

112
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,400
what should we do next?

113
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,920
Are you anxious, my lady?

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,920
Not at all...

115
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,920
It's time

116
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,920
for our wedding night, of course.

117
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,159
Everything...

118
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
Feels like a fantasy.

119
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,880
We're about to become husband and wife.

120
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm scared this

121
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,480
might all be just a beautiful dream

122
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,680
that could vanish.

123
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
Do you truly love me?

124
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,400
Absolutely.

125
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
From the very first moment I saw you,

126
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
I knew it was you.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,720
Promise

128
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,760
you'll never forget me.

129
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,200
Have faith, my love.

130
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,320
As long as our hearts

131
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,040
beat as one,

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,160
nothing else matters.

133
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,880
Whoa, this is getting wild!

134
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,159
Were my brother and she...

135
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't even go there!

136
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,040
So...

137
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,320
what should

138
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,920
we do now?

139
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,960
Um...

140
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,640
Bedroom business?

141
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,960
You lousy...

142
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,560
Shut it!

143
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,560
Seriously, what do we do next?

144
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Let me finish.

145
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,760
When Midheaven discovered it,

146
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,120
they dispatched Sir Taiyi, the Punisher

147
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,680
to capture them.

148
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,440
Envoy Daffodil, do you admit to your sins?

149
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,120
I do.

150
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,160
Immortals and mortals stay apart.

151
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,480
I'll accept any divine punishment.

152
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,000
Please spare him.

153
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,640
By falling in love with a mortal,

154
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
you've committed the gravest sin.

155
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,840
You've disgraced all immortals.

156
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,600
Sir Taiyi,

157
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,280
I alone am responsible.

158
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,440
He is innocent in this.

159
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,720
You honorable immortal,

160
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,320
must have been bewitched by him

161
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,400
to commit such a disgraceful act.

162
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
How dare you obstruct divine justice!

163
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,280
I willingly forsake my immortality.

164
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,520
Let me become a demon for all eternity.

165
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,600
[And so,]

166
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,520
[she sacrificed her immortality for love,]

167
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,880
[falling from grace to become a demon.]

168
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,440
[She and Duanfei]

169
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,080
[never met again.]

170
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,680
No wonder this place is

171
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,560
heavy with such resentment.

172
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,320
According to the story,

173
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,840
you should be in the Demotion Pool by now.

174
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,400
Hey, you owe me one!

175
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,480
If she was already a demon,

176
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,120
His Divine Majesty

177
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,880
wouldn't care about her loving a mortal.

178
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,320
So what's with all this resentment?

179
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,520
It's far more complex than it seems.

180
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,440
She was gravely wounded by thunder.

181
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,600
To regain human form through cultivation

182
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,720
would take decades,

183
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,120
if not centuries.

184
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,360
How could Duanfei,

185
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,120
a mere mortal,

186
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,040
wait that long?

187
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,120
Well, time to cross the Bridge of Destiny

188
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,840
and drink memory-erasing brew.

189
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,200
Insolent creature!

190
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,480
What business do you have in here?

191
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,480
Please forgive my intrusion!

192
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,360
I fell in love with a mortal

193
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,200
and was forced to become a demon.

194
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,960
I've only just regained human form.

195
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,520
Now his current life is ending.

196
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,120
I must warn him not to drink memory-erasing brew.

197
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,280
or he won't recognize me in his next life.

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,240
I beg you to grant me this wish.

199
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,480
Please grant me this wish...

200
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,400
Don't feed him the brew.

201
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
The brew...

202
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,360
You are up!

203
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,960
Young man,

204
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,480
this is the memory-erasing brew.

205
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,360
Eat, and all memories will fade away.

206
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,480
Refuse,

207
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,200
and your past life's memories will

208
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
follow you into your next incarnation.

209
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,280
Then let the memories fade away.

210
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,800
I will

211
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,560
take this brew.

212
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
Be certain of your choice.

213
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
This brew will

214
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,080
erase every trace of those you've loved.

215
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,880
A mortal life is fleeting.

216
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,800
One lifetime of love is enough.

217
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,320
We've recreated her entire journey,

218
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,720
but the mirage remains unbroken.

219
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,320
Are you sure this is going to work?

220
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,600
Young man,

221
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,600
this is the memory-erasing brew.

222
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,960
Eat, and all memories will fade away.

223
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,000
Refuse,

224
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,640
and your past life's memories will

225
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,080
follow you into your next incarnation.

226
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,680
What's your choice?

227
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Gratitude,

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,840
but I must decline.

229
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,840
Think carefully.

230
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Without this brew,

231
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,240
the pain will follow you into the next life.

232
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,240
I can bear any pain,

233
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
but what I fear most

234
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,960
is forgetting her.

235
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,920
If anything,

236
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,160
I wish I could remember her forever.

237
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,440
No, you must take it.

238
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,840
Your mortal life spans mere decades,

239
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,760
while I am an immortal

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,160
with eternal life.

241
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,200
To have met you in this life,

242
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,880
to have loved you.

243
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,400
I couldn't ask for more.

244
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,360
I want you to

245
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,240
start your next life

246
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,960
unburdened by these memories,

247
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,720
free to embrace new happiness.

248
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,560
All these years,

249
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,280
and it's Sir JInxiu and the camellia pixie

250
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,800
who finally broke through the mirage.

251
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,720
Shuixian,

252
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,080
you've let selfish desires

253
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,640
and forbidden love cloud your judgment.

254
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
You've defied heaven's law

255
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
and brought harm to countless souls.

256
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,320
What do you have to say in your defense?

257
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,880
What did I do wrong?

258
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
My only regret

259
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,680
is loving him.

260
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,520
I gave up my immortality,

261
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,440
fell to demon status, all for him.

262
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,520
I was willing to spend

263
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,480
decades, centuries, even millennia

264
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,480
cultivating myself.

265
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,000
My agony was

266
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,440
infinitely deeper than his.

267
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,640
Yet he couldn't

268
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,680
even wait mere decades?

269
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,960
What did I do to deserve this?

270
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,040
How could he cast me aside so easily?

271
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,320
You dwell only on your own sacrifices,

272
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,520
forgetting everything he gave up for you.

273
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,680
[When he returned to the mortal realm,]

274
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,240
[you had already reverted]

275
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
[to your original form.]

276
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,080
You once said...

277
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,000
Divine maidens love sunlight.

278
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,240
You said you only drink morning dew.

279
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,520
I've already done everything I could...

280
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,240
[He waited helplessly,]

281
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,240
[not knowing when or if you'd return.]

282
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,920
[You blame him for choosing to forget you]

283
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,920
[to escape his pain.]

284
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
[But do you understand...]

285
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,160
[For mortals,]

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,280
[living with the agony of losing their beloved]

287
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,160
[can drive them]

288
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,560
[to the brink of death.]

289
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,440
Come back to me!

290
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,600
Please...

291
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,680
[Until his last breath,]

292
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,880
[he remained in]

293
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,920
[those wedding garments.]

294
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,840
[He spent his entire life in solitude,]

295
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
[with only your memories for company.]

296
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,200
As an immortal,

297
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,320
surely you should understand his pain.

298
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,640
Your Divine Highness,

299
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,920
have you ever experienced love yourself?

300
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,320
Let go of your obsession.

301
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,640
Free yourself.

302
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,400
He would want you

303
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
to find peace within yourself.

304
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,480
How surprising...

305
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,440
Such words of empathy from you,

306
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,080
who's always stood above mortal emotions.

307
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,360
The choice is yours to make.

308
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,240
She's got quite the spirit...

309
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,760
Dissolving her core means

310
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,360
she'll never take human form again.

311
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,400
What brings you here?

312
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,440
Looking out for you, of course.

313
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,800
Just ensure NCR Matriarch's safety.

314
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
Come, the banquet awaits our attention.

315
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,840
Morning.

316
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,920
Sir Jinxiu,

317
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
do you remember

318
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,840
what you said in the mirage?

319
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,800
Mere mirage, nothing more.

320
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,160
Do you truly mean that?

321
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,840
As you witnessed,

322
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,520
immortals and mortals walk different paths.

323
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,360
No matter how deep their love,

324
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,080
how strong their devotion,

325
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,000
or how vivid their memories,

326
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,720
their union was but a fleeting moment.

327
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,160
All faded away in the end.

328
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,760
Only the divine path remains eternal.

329
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,440
But their love lives on in my memory,

330
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,400
and in yours too.

331
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,840
Every pixie, every flower,

332
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,280
bears witness to their love.

333
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,480
And that love, once witnessed,

334
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,600
becomes eternal.

335
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
After all this,

336
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,440
have you truly learned anything?

337
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,360
Oh,

338
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,320
I have learned that I love you!

339
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,520
I was asking

340
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,040
if you'd grasped any of the divine order.

341
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,160
Divine order...

342
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,840
Not at all!

343
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,000
But I've learned what love truly is.

344
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,320
In that mirage,

345
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,240
Shuixian's heart would race at Duanfei's approach,

346
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,440
and ache

347
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
in his absence.

348
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,440
Her every emotion

349
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,040
danced to the rhythm of his presence.

350
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,520
And that's exactly

351
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,280
how I feel about you.

352
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,160
These feelings,

353
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,120
they're unique to you alone,

354
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,320
not to anyone else.

355
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,920
So now I understand.

356
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,200
This feeling is love.

357
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,280
What about you, Sir Jinxiu?

358
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,920
Um...

359
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,840
Your powers are unmatched.

360
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,120
While I might easily

361
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,760
be deceived by the mirage,

362
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,960
you chose to step into it

363
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,600
without hesitation.

364
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,000
Did you truly become that Duanfei?

365
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,600
Or could it be...

366
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,520
that you

367
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
harbor feelings for me too?

368
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,840
Nonsense.

369
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,360
Your Divine Highness!

370
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,920
Come on!

371
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
We present our humble respects!

372
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
We, the White Camellia Clan

373
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,440
offers our deepest gratitude

374
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,400
for clearing our name and revealing the truth.

375
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,840
I came down

376
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,040
from the Celestial Realm

377
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,160
when news reached us

378
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,960
of your clan's protests against

379
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,960
the divine sentence given to Baicha.

380
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,360
The truth has now come to light.

381
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,200
I will ensure justice is properly served.

382
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,280
Your Divine Highness,

383
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,640
the punishment was meant for me alone.

384
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,840
The others are blameless in this.

385
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,760
They have remained loyal.

386
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,280
I humbly beg you not to let my sins

387
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,760
bring misfortune upon my clan.

388
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,480
The truth has been revealed.

389
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,040
You were indeed victims of

390
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,160
Shuixian's scheme,

391
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,240
for which I bear partial responsibility.

392
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,680
However, Baicha,

393
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
your original offense still stands.

394
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,000
The punishment

395
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,960
preventing your clan's blossoms

396
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,880
for a century must be upheld.

397
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,160
Let this be a lesson in

398
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,080
following the divine order

399
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,760
and deepening your cultivation.

400
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,760
Gratitude, Your Divine Highness!

401
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,080
Hongning played a crucial role

402
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,280
in your rescue.

403
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,560
Your thanks would be well placed with her.

404
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,760
My sweet Hongning, thanks!

405
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,400
Should you ever need help,

406
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,040
our clan will stand firmly behind you.

407
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,240
Oh, please,

408
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,440
it's my pleasure, really!

409
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Thank you, Sir.

410
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,400
Sir.

411
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,600
Come with me.

412
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,400
Let's go.

413
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,560
Hurry up.

414
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,560
Keep pace.

415
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,520
I'm coming.

416
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,680
Wait!

417
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,760
Don't crush it.

418
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,440
Hold on a second.

419
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,440
Faster.

420
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,880
Come on.

421
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,920
This way.

422
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,280
Need another, miss?

423
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,680
No, thanks.

424
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,080
Spent two breaths buying a mask

425
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,400
and he vanished.

426
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
So he left after all.

427
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,160
Got my invite?

428
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,360
I thought it never reached you.

429
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,640
You're fearless,

430
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
sending a Demon invite

431
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,880
straight to Celestial Realm.

432
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,800
It was the only way

433
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,920
to tell you

434
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,200
I wanted to see you.

435
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,640
Where's your Lilybell?

436
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,000
Lilybell?

437
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,920
You said

438
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,640
to use it only in danger.

439
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,720
I'm not in danger.

440
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,840
I just missed you.

441
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,800
Once you become immortal

442
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,760
you'll see me in Heaven.

443
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,600
Becoming immortal is still far off.

444
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,640
No matter how hard I try,

445
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,400
it'll take centuries.

446
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,160
I still have lightning to survive.

447
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,160
Tonight's the Moon Lantern Festival.

448
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,640
Then why did you

449
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,840
call me?

450
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,440
You said saving the

451
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,280
white camellia clan earned me a reward.

452
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,160
What is it?

453
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,360
What reward do you want?

454
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,680
What's that?

455
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,720
I want you to fly lanterns with me.

456
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,600
Come on.

457
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,720
Write your wish on it.

458
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,240
It's local custom.

459
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,040
Whenever mortals shoot fireworks,

460
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,560
the Star Lords must sweep the soot.

461
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,560
When will they drop

462
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,200
that crude hobby?

463
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Sir,

464
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,760
fireworks don't spark

465
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,240
any other thought in you?

466
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,960
They do.

467
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,200
Long ago,

468
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,240
Kunlun stole some rockets from Earth,

469
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,080
lit them

470
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,720
by my bed while I slept.

471
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,200
Guess the nonsense he spouted?

472
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,840
You, stop right there!

473
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,640
Brother,

474
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,920
look, earthly fire!

475
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,440
Feel a taste of mortal life.

476
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,840
Stop right there!

477
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,040
He wrecked the rear slope of Mt. Misty,

478
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,000
and I've yet to settle that score

479
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,840
since he left the Floral Scroll.

480
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,760
Tell me,

481
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,560
do fireworks count as flowers?

482
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,240
Of course not.

483
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,560
I mean,

484
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,880
do they count as falling petals?

485
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,640
Certainly not. Have you lost your sense?

486
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,640
Hongning.

487
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,880
-Jiaobo.
-Hongning.

488
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,720
Ningmeng.

489
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,760
Hongning,

490
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,760
you still haven't let your lantern go?

491
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
What's he doing?

492
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,800
Who are you?

493
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,640
He's your friend?

494
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,400
Looks kinda clueless.

495
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,880
Watch your mouth.

496
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,920
It's his first festival.

497
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,720
Really?

498
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,920
Bro,

499
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,000
you just got your human form, right?

500
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,760
It's easy.

501
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,680
Let me teach you.

502
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,720
Write a wish

503
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,480
on the lantern,

504
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,760
light it,

505
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,760
let it float up.

506
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,880
The gods see it

507
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
and help you out.

508
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,520
They won't.

509
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,800
Never thought

510
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,080
a Mt. Baizhou pixie

511
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,000
would pray to gods.

512
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,720
Seriously?

513
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,840
You don't know a thing?

514
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,720
Where'd you grow up?

515
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
It's our tradition.

516
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,520
Start writing.

517
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,600
I have no wish.

518
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,560
Impossible.

519
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,960
A wish

520
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,960
is the thing

521
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,840
you want most.

522
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,880
May plants thrive, and peace last.

523
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,680
Don't say it aloud!

524
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,920
It's a secret between you and the gods.

525
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,320
Which gods?

526
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:54,960
Well,

527
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,600
the strongest ones.

528
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,240
Say, the Four Star Lords.

529
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
They don't handle this stuff.

530
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,800
North Peak Emperor, Ninth-Heaven Lady,

531
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,080
Day Patrol, Night Patrol, take your pick.

532
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,440
Just write.

533
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,480
Yeah, do it.

534
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,720
Fine.

535
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,520
Look.

536
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,240
Look at this wish.

537
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,600
Wait,

538
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,960
that's a whole essay!

539
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,520
It's divine etiquette.

540
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,720
Ask a favor,

541
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,320
show respect.

542
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,760
Hongning,

543
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,720
your friend

544
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,320
a bit slow?

545
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,600
Hongning, what're you writing?

546
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,040
No peeking.

547
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,080
Why not?

548
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,040
Even the gods

549
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,920
might need a dictionary.

550
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,280
Exactly.

551
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,960
I'll launch mine here.

552
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,880
Good view.

553
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,920
Hongning,

554
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
what did you wish for?

555
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,320
Not telling.

556
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,320
I'm a god.

557
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,440
You can share.

558
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,600
Still no.

559
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,680
Not even with me?

560
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,600
Only the lantern immortals gets to know.

561
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,440
Lantern immortals, huh?

562
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,960
Hongning,

563
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,880
help!

564
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,280
My lantern's stuck!

565
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,040
Coming!

566
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,480
Sir,

567
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,440
are you trying to grant wishes?

568
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,680
But, Sir,

569
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,120
sky lantern wishes are private.

570
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,640
You mustn't peek.

571
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,080
And you are...?

572
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,120
A lantern immortal from Mt. Baizhou.

573
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,080
Lantern immortal?

574
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,080
Those actually exist?

575
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,520
They do,

576
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,320
but I wander and never

577
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,360
took a place in the immortal register,

578
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,480
so you've not heard of me.

579
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,640
Legends say lantern immortals

580
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,480
can make wishes come true?

581
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,480
My power's modest,

582
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,040
yet I help where I can.

583
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,480
Wait.

584
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,000
My own lantern...

585
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:28,800
This one's yours.

586
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,440
You...

587
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,480
Your wish

588
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,240
stays secret with me,

589
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,680
and I'll do my best to fulfill it.

590
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,240
Much obliged.

591
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,440
[Why is someone]

592
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,800
[weaker than I so eager to help?]

593
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,200
[What an odd sort of deity.]

594
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,680
Ningmeng, move to a new spot.

595
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,000
Hongning.

596
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,000
-A different place will work fine.
-Thanks.

597
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Yes, shift over there.

598
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,120
This spot's no good.

599
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,080
Let's try another.

600
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:02,800
Right.

601
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,640
Off we go. Hongning.

602
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,320
We're leaving.

603
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,000
We're off.

604
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,680
I just met the lantern immortal.

605
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,680
You didn't kidnap him again, did you?

606
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,600
Of course not,

607
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,560
but he promised

608
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,440
to make your wish come true.

609
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,400
Really?

610
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,280
Then I can marry you?

611
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,240
So that's your wish.

612
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,040
Actually,

613
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,560
after living

614
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,840
in the mirage,

615
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,760
though life was simple,

616
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,120
I felt

617
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,680
truly happy.

618
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,040
I learned

619
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
the greatest joy is staying with

620
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,280
the one you love.

621
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,840
So,

622
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,160
will you marry me?

623
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,680
Most cultivate for immortality.

624
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,560
All you want is a wedding?

625
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,440
That's all I want.

626
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,520
May the gods

627
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,000
bless me.

628
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,240
I'm going to marry the Floral Deity.

629
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,040
Hongning,

630
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,960
you keep asking about marriage,

631
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,840
so here's my answer.

632
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,199
I gave my word,

633
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,320
and I'll keep it.

634
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,000
When you survive your trials,

635
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,639
when the petals fall,

636
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,840
I'll marry you.

637
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,840
It's a promise.

638
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,400
A promise.

639
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,240
Time's up.

640
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,680
Time for what?

641
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,880
I must attend the Celestial Banquet.

642
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,840
Take me along this time.

643
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,320
I won't wander off.

644
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,280
You swear?

645
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,560
Come.

646
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,360
Stay here.

647
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,680
Remember, don't go near the South Gate.

648
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
I'll come back for you soon.

649
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,160
I swear.

650
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,000
I'll stay right here.

651
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,680
Wait for me.

652
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,840
Come back early.

653
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,560
Please, don't move

654
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,320
He said I mustn't budge.

655
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,480
Kunlun.

656
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,720
Done tattling about my brother to Father?

657
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,080
What are you up to?

658
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,440
What?

659
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,600
Must I work only under your gaze?

660
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,960
I'm warning you,

661
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,600
the banquet starts soon.

662
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
One slip

663
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,160
and...

664
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,840
And you won't get to be Empress.

665
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,480
I'm kidding with you.

666
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,520
But tonight

667
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,400
your wish won't come true.

668
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,200
You...

669
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,040
Sir!

670
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,280
What happened?

671
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,560
The Emperor heard a storm's brewing

672
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,680
over the banquet.

673
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,240
He's furious with Kunlun

674
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,400
and is raging in the hall.

675
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,600
Understood.

676
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,600
Father, Mother.

677
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,280
I've heard

678
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,880
about the camellias.

679
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,480
So the white camellia clan

680
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,680
caused no trouble after all.

681
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,800
Correct.

682
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,920
It was the daffodil pixie.

683
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,400
Jinxiu handles things well.

684
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,840
The mirage is broken.

685
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,880
Good work.

686
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,880
I survived

687
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,680
thanks to Luyao and Kunlun.

688
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,160
Luyao aids Midheaven greatly.

689
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,920
At the banquet

690
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,960
I'll thank the NRC King myself.

691
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Father, what about me?

692
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,360
I worked hard too!

693
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,640
Look at you.

694
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,840
What have you done this time?

695
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,920
The banquet is about to start

696
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,360
and you'd shame me

697
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,720
before all the gods.

698
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,600
Please, calm down.

699
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,480
Kunlun had another purpose.

700
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,480
Besides havoc,

701
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,280
what purpose?

702
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,680
This...

703
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,080
Father,

704
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,800
Kunlun heard mortals

705
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,280
see rainbows as good omens,

706
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,440
so

707
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,000
he plans to unveil one at the banquet

708
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,520
to bless Midheaven.

709
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,920
His idea?

710
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,840
Yes.

711
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,720
Why didn't you say so?

712
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,240
You wouldn't have believed me.

713
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,760
It's your fault,

714
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,720
always shielding him.

715
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,680
No wonder he's so reckless,

716
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,960
never minced his words.

717
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,720
I was wrong.

718
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,000
Well,

719
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,120
Kunlun may have helped Jinxiu,

720
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,440
but his unruly streak

721
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
is dangerous.

722
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,480
He should learn from Jinxiu.

723
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,360
Very well.

724
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,360
Put him back with Wind, Rain,

725
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,080
and Thunder gods to manage weather.

726
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,880
Yes, Father.

727
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,520
Father,

728
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,480
one more matter.

729
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,200
Speak.

730
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,200
About

731
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,760
my marriage.

732
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,480
You've heard?

733
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,400
You'll meet the NCR King.

734
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,960
It's about time.

735
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,440
The formal proposal has arrived.

736
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,720
Prepare to wed Luyao.

737
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,480
Sir.

738
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,320
Sir.

739
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,240
Sir.

740
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,120
Sir.

741
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,440
Sir.

742
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,160
Sir.

743
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,760
Who are they?

744
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,360
You mean them?

745
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,720
Daughters of East Peak Deity.

746
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,240
Why do you know so many women?

747
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,600
Floralia Palace is full of women.

748
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,040
When I become immortal,

749
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,400
can I attend the banquet with you?

750
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,000
Yes.

751
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,760
Then you must take me.

752
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,040
Sir Kunlun.

753
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,320
Sir Kunlun.

754
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,240
I'm telling you...

755
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,240
Move aside.

756
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,480
Listen up.

757
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,160
Place this like so.

758
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:51,840
Yes.

759
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,520
Got it?

760
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,240
Got it.

761
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,880
Just like this.

762
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,400
Exactly as she ordered.

763
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,200
Yes.

764
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:07,800
And that piece goes over there.

765
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,720
Not having much fun

766
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,160
planning the banquet with me, huh?

767
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,960
That's good.

768
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,960
Why does a NCR maiden

769
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,120
runs Midheaven's party anyway?

770
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,360
If the Floral Deity weren't watching,

771
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,280
I'd have skewered you already.

772
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,720
I knew you wanted a fight.

773
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:30,800
Good.

774
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:31,840
Plenty of room here.

775
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:32,760
Come on.

776
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,520
You've ruined enough banquets.

777
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,440
Today I'm guarding you for his Highness.

778
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,520
"His highness" this, "his highness" that,

779
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,040
you're not even engaged yet,

780
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,320
why rush?

781
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,600
NCR's proposal is in.

782
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,080
Once I'm Empress,

783
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,640
I'll tame you.

784
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,440
Fine,

785
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,760
don't regret it later.

786
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,880
Why keep staring at me?

787
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,720
You're too good-looking.

788
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,480
I wish you weren't.

789
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,680
Why?

790
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,760
Because everyone likes you.

791
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,440
And why can't they?

792
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,440
Am I the same as them?

793
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,680
You promised me.

794
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,360
You can't like anyone else.

795
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,760
I'll be your Empress,

796
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,440
cultivate beside you,

797
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,120
and...

798
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,720
All right,

799
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,440
I promise.

800
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,360
No one else.

801
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,920
Then I'll train harder

802
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,440
and ascend sooner.

803
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,080
When I'm back on Mt. Baizhou,

804
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,640
you must watch over me every day,

805
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,040
think of me every day.

806
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,040
Hongning,

807
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,080
what if

808
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,240
someone else becomes my Empress?

809
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,880
Then I'll ignore you.

810
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,360
Sir,

811
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,800
I'll treat you well.

812
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,240
NCR has sent

813
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,680
a formal marriage decree,

814
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,760
and Father wishes it done.

815
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,280
You've agreed to it?
