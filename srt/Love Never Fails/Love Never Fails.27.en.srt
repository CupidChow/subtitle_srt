[Love Never Fails]
[EP27]

3
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,880
My last cook was a disaster.

4
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,320
But this time,

5
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,920
I really looked into it

6
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,080
and realized

7
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,160
cooking

8
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
is actually a real skill!

9
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,480
Frying, steaming, boiling,

10
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,680
they all take technique.

11
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Looks like you've made progress.

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,320
Right?

13
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,160
Try it.

14
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,360
Fun fact,

15
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,000
when I was little, my dad used to

16
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,920
make breakfast for my mom every morning.

17
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,560
And my mom always said

18
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,800
it was delicious.

19
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,240
Likewise,

20
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,440
her response back then

21
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,840
was just like how you looked just now.

22
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,520
What kind of look?

23
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,480
A mix of encouragement… and sympathy.

24
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,840
It's okay.

25
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,280
My dad

26
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,560
got better over time.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,960
I think I can too!

28
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,000
By the way,

29
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,320
I've been at your place for a while,

30
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
but never seen your parents.

31
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,720
They've…

32
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,760
both passed.

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,480
Oh… I'm sorry.

34
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,680
It's alright.

35
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,920
I was

36
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,880
raised by my aunt and uncle.

37
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,040
My aunt's always been super worried

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,960
about me getting married.

39
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,079
Ms Su…

40
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,760
I've spent my life on the battlefield,

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,960
walking the line between life and death.

42
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,240
But I'm a homebody at heart,

43
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,040
just want to cook up love

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,440
for my one and only,

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,080
day after day, like my dad did.

46
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,040
And I know,

47
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,080
that person

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,720
won't be Ms Su.

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,040
Then maybe your aunt and uncle

50
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,680
will try to set you up with someone

51
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,720
from the Yang or Xu family?

52
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,399
That's not

53
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,880
gonna happen.

54
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,000
Muxian,

55
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,520
will you come with me to visit

56
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,480
my aunt and uncle

57
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,000
at the Chancellor's Mansion?

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,760
They're coming!

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,000
Dear.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,320
Greetings, uncle, aunt,

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,280
and all the ladies.

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,680
This is

63
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,040
Muxian.

64
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,240
Greetings, uncle, aunt,

65
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,280
and all the ladies.

66
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,200
Good.

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,320
Muxian is such a beauty!

68
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,040
Come,

69
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,760
let's go in!

70
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,600
Yes, come in

71
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,040
and chat over food.

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,960
You've had a long day.

73
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,280
Come on, Jinxiu,

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
-have a taste.
-Come on!

75
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,560
-Have more.
-Alright.

76
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,760
Muxian,

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,400
we're not sure what you like,

78
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,120
but this is

79
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,000
Jinxiu's favorite:
Spring Bamboo with Mushrooms.

80
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:43,840
[Try it,]

81
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,240
[I cooked it myself!]

82
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,680
See if you like it.

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,360
It's delicious!

84
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,680
No wonder Jinxiu loves it!

85
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,480
[If you like it,]

86
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
[have more!]

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,480
Muxian, just so you know,

88
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,160
Jinxiu is good

89
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
[in every way,]

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,240
[except one,]

91
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,320
[he's never really cared about romance!]

92
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,200
[These past years,]

93
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,280
[we did]

94
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,480
[everything we could!]

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,320
[But now look,]

96
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,200
he's finally met a girl he likes!

97
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,360
Exactly!

98
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,400
If I may,

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,520
we should pick an auspicious date

100
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,480
and get them married fast!

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,520
[Right!]

102
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,240
[That's right!]

103
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,840
[If Muxian should slip away,]

104
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,000
[and Jinxiu]

105
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,760
[stay single forever,]

106
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,560
what should we do then?

107
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,840
Don't jinx it!

108
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,920
Jinxiu is also gifted!

109
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,360
He could talk at one,

110
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,440
recite 300 poems by three!

111
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,480
And he's already the great General

112
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,120
of State Wuzhang at such a young age!

113
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,720
Exactly!

114
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,360
He's truly exceptional!

115
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Here, for our first meeting,

116
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,480
I have a gift for you.

117
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,040
-Aunt…
-This is

118
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,120
part of my dowry.

119
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,200
You seem

120
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
so pure

121
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
and special to me,

122
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,159
I'm sure

123
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,680
it'll look lovely on you!

124
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,400
It's too much, Aunt,

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,160
I can't accept it!

126
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,560
Muxian,

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,880
it's fine,

128
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,840
just take it.

129
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,520
[Take it.]

130
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,760
Thank you, Aunt.

131
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,200
After dinner,

132
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,880
you two will stay

133
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,080
and follow my lead!

134
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,040
-[Yes!]
-Alright.

135
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,160
Stay a few more days!

136
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,720
I really can’t

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,720
get my eyes off her!

138
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,000
Save it!

139
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,000
We just want you to stay longer,

140
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,160
so we can know you better.

141
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,280
My dear,

142
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,880
enough talking.

143
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,680
This is such a joyous day,

144
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,159
let's drink!

145
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,000
Exactly!

146
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,400
Come, let's drink!

147
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,280
Raise your glass

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,320
and drink!

149
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,040
With due respect,

150
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,400
what happened to your parents…

151
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,560
They were killed by a demon

152
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,760
when I was a child.

153
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,920
Though young,

154
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,040
I still remember the scene clearly.

155
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,880
Right before my eyes,

156
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,160
they were torn apart by a demon.

157
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,320
You never thought of revenge?

158
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,920
I was powerless then,

159
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,560
by the time I could fight,

160
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,120
the demon was

161
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,320
long gone.

162
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,680
The moment I came to the Ministry of Law

163
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,000
and became the general,

164
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,480
I swore to protect the state

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,200
and rid the land of demons!

166
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,480
I won't let anyone grow up like me,

167
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,559
parentless

168
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,159
and alone.

169
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,480
If I were you,

170
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,880
I'd scour the ends of the earth

171
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,840
to hunt that demon down.

172
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,080
I once thought the same

173
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,960
and was obsessed with revenge.

174
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,000
I even believed

175
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
all demons were evil.

176
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,640
But the more I encountered,

177
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
I realized

178
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,280
demons are just like humans,

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
some good, some bad.

180
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,840
They're not all wicked.

181
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Still, without revenge,

182
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,080
wouldn't your parents

183
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,040
resent it in the afterlife?

184
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,920
I know you hate evil,

185
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,640
but I often wonder,

186
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,120
would my parents want me

187
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,920
to risk my life

188
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,400
hunting demons?

189
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,360
Or,

190
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,760
would they rather see me

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,720
safe, happy,

192
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,120
and at peace?

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
Well, if it were me,

194
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,800
I'd find my enemy

195
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,840
and settle the score in blood.

196
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,760
Then I promise you this,

197
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,000
if the day comes when you find them,

198
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
I'll fight by your side.

199
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,680
[If I were you,]

200
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,600
[I'd find my enemy]

201
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,880
[and settle the score in blood.]

202
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,920
[Then I promise you this,]

203
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,120
[if the day comes when you find them,]

204
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,520
[I'll fight by your side.]

205
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,640
Still not done staring?

206
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,440
What were you looking at?

207
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,560
You know what?

208
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,600
The first time I saw you,

209
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,160
I loved the smell

210
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,080
on you.

211
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,840
But I just can't remember

212
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
where I smelled it before.

213
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,480
Sir.

214
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,440
What happened?

215
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,880
What did I do to you?

216
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,520
It was me who tried to force you

217
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,040
and tainted you.

218
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,600
There's a demon in your mansion,

219
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,120
and it knows Seduction Arts.

220
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,920
You could had

221
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,080
get yourself killed.

222
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,000
Luckily it was me today,

223
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,480
and I'm safe to you.

224
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,200
But what if one day, it takes my form…

225
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,600
you'd better watch out.

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,320
"Luckily it was you?"

227
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
What if it wasn't me today,

228
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,440
or I hadn't snapped out of it,

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,840
what then?

230
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,200
But you did snap out of it, didn't you?

231
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,120
General!

232
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,400
Why are you up so late?

233
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,600
General!

234
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,080
I found out where Muxian's from!

235
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,720
Shoot!

236
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
She's the daughter of Musong,

237
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,600
a demon hunter from State Qingyue.

238
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
She's trained in hunting demons since little,

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,120
just like what she said.

240
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,880
Alright, I get it.

241
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,560
General!

242
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,640
Why's your face blushed?

243
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Are you feeling sick?

244
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,560
Want me to call the royal doctor?

245
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,960
No need.

246
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
You sure, General?

247
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,840
I said no!

248
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,080
Take care of yourself!

249
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
I said I'm fine!

250
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,920
Eternal youth, no pain, no illness!

251
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,440
Eternal youth, no pain, no illness!

252
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,680
Eternal youth, no pain, no illness!

253
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,760
[Look at those two!]

254
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,920
[Look at him!]

255
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,360
-Young master.
-Young master.

256
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,200
Since when do we host wrestling matches?

257
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,640
Look, why are they fighting?

258
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,240
Can't you talk things out?

259
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,280
Did someone take more money

260
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,280
or did Xiang dump you…

261
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,560
Don't you know who I am?

262
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,440
Stop it!

263
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,480
Master.

264
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,520
You think you can seduce the Master

265
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,600
and move up in the world?

266
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,440
Shameless!

267
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,000
How dare you push me!

268
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,120
[Want a piece of me?]

269
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,800
Master…

270
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,960
[Do you even know who you are?]

271
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,240
Something's off here.

272
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,560
[You think the Master would want you?]

273
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,200
Let's go

274
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,200
find Jinxiu.

275
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,160
Fresh meat,

276
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,680
wanna try some?

277
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,200
Xiang usually dresses plain,

278
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,320
but today,

279
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,840
she covered herself in

280
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,720
pricey stuff,

281
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,920
super weird.

282
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,280
And not just her,

283
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,360
Auntie Second too.

284
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,360
She's a vegetarian,

285
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,040
but now chewing raw meat.

286
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
That's real odd!

287
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,320
We saw two servants brawling,

288
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,760
and nearby, two maids were at it too.

289
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,160
That's nothing.

290
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,120
The weirdest part is…

291
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,000
he jumped in while

292
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,360
breaking it up.

293
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,240
Totally not like him.

294
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,040
I was trying to stop them,

295
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
but I don't know what happened,

296
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,160
I just snapped,

297
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,640
and my hands moved on their own!

298
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,520
Bro,

299
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,600
Master,

300
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,960
is something evil

301
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
lurking in

302
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,480
our mansion?

303
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,440
General!

304
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,280
General,

305
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,040
the guards outside the city said

306
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,240
they found seven dead villagers

307
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,800
last night in the woods.

308
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,800
I have something else to deal with,

309
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,720
if things get worse here,

310
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,680
let me know right away.

311
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,480
Yes.

312
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,080
Take care.

313
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,680
Muxian,

314
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Master and I

315
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,120
will go check on my dad first.

316
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,720
Ms Luyao

317
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,280
will come with me to check on

318
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,520
the others and Auntie Third.

319
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,760
Strange things have been happening here.

320
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,440
What do you think, Ms Luyao?

321
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,440
I've got no clue, honestly.

322
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,080
But a few days ago I passed by and

323
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,680
saw someone sneaking around with a lover.

324
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,440
Didn't expect you were into that,

325
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,840
Muxian.

326
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,040
You're funny.

327
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,720
I just wanted to ask something

328
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,680
that's been bugging me.

329
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,360
What is it?

330
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,000
Probably just some servants

331
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,200
getting a little too frisky.

332
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,520
But some people lost control

333
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,400
and acted totally out of character.

334
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,640
Are you talking about

335
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,160
you and General Jinxiu?

336
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,960
If it's not the Seduction Arts,

337
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,920
I don't know what else it could be.

338
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,320
So where do you think that came from?

339
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
All I know is Nine-Tailed foxes

340
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,480
are known for Seduction Arts.

341
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,280
Muxian,

342
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,560
what are you trying to say?

343
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,120
So you finally admit it

344
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,600
you know I'm a Nine-Tailed fox.

345
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,840
I don't.

346
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,320
In State Wuzhang,

347
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,920
the only one who knew my real identity

348
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,800
is Hongning.

349
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,880
If you say you're human, fine,

350
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,560
if you say you're a demon, fine too.

351
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,240
I'm just a demon hunter,

352
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,960
all I want is the truth.

353
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,080
That's why I came to you.

354
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,120
Since we're the same gender,

355
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,960
I figured it'd be easier to talk.

356
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,440
Didn't mean to stir up so much trouble.

357
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,680
As for Hongning,

358
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,920
I really don't know who that is.

359
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,400
I'm just a cultivating mortal,

360
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,600
I've got no Demonic Aura on me.

361
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,120
Since you

362
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,600
don't know the name Hongning,

363
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,840
then forget it.

364
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,360
I'm just Kunlun's Master, here to help him

365
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,360
out at the Chancellor's Mansion.

366
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,920
Same here, I just came to clear out demons.

367
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,840
Besides, I've got nothing to do with Kunlun.

368
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,760
No need to be on edge.

369
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,200
One more thing,

370
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,080
you sure all this mess here

371
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,320
isn't caused by Seduction Arts?

372
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,200
I'm sure.

373
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,720
Alright then.

374
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,480
Then just keep being Muxian.

375
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,520
General,

376
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,520
these villagers died yesterday.

377
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,000
All found in the woods.

378
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,120
Nothing unusual on their bodies.

379
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,400
What's going on?

380
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,320
Before the stick's burnt,

381
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,720
they were already infected by dark energy.

382
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,160
Why are you here?

383
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm worried.

384
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,520
You worried about me?

385
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,520
What happened to them?

386
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,160
All of them

387
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,040
were killed by demons.

388
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,040
Speak,

389
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,440
what really happened?

390
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,520
Everything was fine before,

391
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,800
why did you suddenly start fighting?

392
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,000
And you, Xiang!

393
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,520
That jewelry looks pricey,

394
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,640
but it's all fake!

395
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,200
Why wear it today out of the blue?

396
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,560
Are you okay, Mom?

397
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm fine.

398
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,480
What are you all doing?

399
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,760
Guards!

400
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,160
Take them all out!

401
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,880
Quick!

402
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,840
Lock them all up!

403
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,280
[Lend a hand!]

404
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,040
Auntie Second,

405
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,880
why are you here?

406
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,360
It's not safe right now,

407
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,400
please go back,

408
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,600
be careful and don't get hurt.

409
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
I… I just came to see you,

410
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,840
you're carrying quite the burden, aren't you?

411
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,480
Why are you saying this?

412
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,400
Kunlun,

413
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
come a little closer,

414
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,880
let me get a good look at you.

415
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,640
Alright.

416
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,280
Kunlun!

417
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,280
Auntie Second!

418
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,840
Kunlun!

419
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,360
Master, what's happening?

420
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,440
Kunlun, are you alright?

421
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,760
[What's going on?]

422
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,480
I'm fine.

423
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,640
My dear!

424
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,240
Mom?

425
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,120
Someone!

426
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:53,920
Mom!

427
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,960
[What's wrong, Mom?]

428
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,320
[Wake up, Mom!]

429
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,000
[Mom!]

430
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,840
[Wake up!]

431
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,560
[Where are the other bodies?]

432
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,560
[Did their families]

433
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,880
[already take the bodies]

434
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,880
[back?]

435
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,200
[Why is this one still here?]

436
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,720
[What's that?]

437
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,440
Dance.

438
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,760
Come on, keep dancing!

439
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,040
Run!

440
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,800
Help!

441
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,800
Open the door!

442
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,680
Open it!

443
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,240
Open it, now!

444
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,440
Please, open it!

445
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,600
You're back.

446
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,200
Why would you risk coming here?

447
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,040
Obviously, to check on

448
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,520
how your

449
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,880
big revenge plan's going.

450
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,280
You're hesitating.

451
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,240
You're overthinking.

452
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,720
Don't forget

453
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,680
what you went through

454
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,600
to come back to life.

455
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,120
Hongning,

456
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,200
every inch of your flesh

457
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,320
came from tearing apart

458
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,640
your old self as a red camellia,

459
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,600
mixing it with Golden Lotus Dew,

460
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,160
and grinding through blood and pain

461
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
every single day!

462
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,400
You're here for revenge,

463
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,360
you hate him

464
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
for killing your parents

465
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,320
and Ningmeng himself!

466
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,000
Enough!

467
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,840
I don't need you

468
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,320
to keep bringing up

469
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,880
the pain I went through!

470
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,000
I remember the score better than you!

471
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,000
I'll kill him myself,

472
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,560
and his whole family,

473
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,600
just to let him feel my pain.

474
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,920
So you really don't love him anymore?

475
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,720
Wasn't this all just an excuse?

476
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,480
No.

477
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
You used the Kylin Grass I gave you

478
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,680
to save him.

479
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,440
You don't want him dead.

480
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
I saw my parents die in the fire

481
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,280
with my own eyes.

482
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,760
I watched

483
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,360
he had heavenly soldiers behind him,

484
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
standing above us tiny mortals.

485
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,320
If the gods are unfair,

486
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,760
we'll tear it all down!

487
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,240
General!

488
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,120
General,

489
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Wang Hu's still alive!

490
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,680
Six of the supposedly dead bodies

491
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,600
have disappeared.

492
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,600
Not sure if they, like Wang Hu,

493
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,440
just faked their deaths.

494
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,600
We've sent people to track them.

495
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,960
Check the neighbor,

496
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,400
see if similar things happened nearby.

497
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,200
Got it.

498
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,920
General!

499
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,680
Take the General. I'll handle this.

500
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,280
Alright.

501
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:18,960
Be careful.

502
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,640
What's going on?

503
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,520
We're

504
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
taking over this one.

505
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,240
You dare take people

506
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,360
from General Jinxiu?

507
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,480
We got order from Prince Xian,

508
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,600
even the General

509
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,640
can't stop it.

510
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,200
Sorry, take him!

511
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,480
[What's wrong with my eyes?]

512
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,400
[You're here for revenge,]

513
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,280
[you hate him]

514
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,640
[for killing your parents]

515
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,680
[and Ningmeng himself!]

516
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,000
[This Camellia Hairpin]

517
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,160
[can turn into a sword,]

518
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,400
[it might save your life someday.]

519
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,200
[Sir,]

520
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,280
[why are you so good to me?]

521
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,320
[Not in this life.]

522
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,680
[I'll stay by your side, always.]

523
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,920
[I won't break my word again.]

524
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,960
You've always been there for me?

525
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,200
You don't want to?

526
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,840
I do.

527
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,320
I'm very happy.

528
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
[About last time,]

529
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,240
[that was my fault.]

530
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,600
[Didn't expect]

531
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,040
I'd fall for it so easily

532
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,440
and lose myself.

533
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,040
Let's not bring that up again.

534
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,320
Okay,

535
00:33:59,320 --> 00:33:59,920
I won't.

536
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,920
It's just…

537
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,400
just that

538
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,000
I still have one question.

539
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,199
Rest up now.

540
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,239
If I don't ask now,

541
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,120
I might

542
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,080
never heal.

543
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,440
How do I

544
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,920
compare to him?

545
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,800
Who?

546
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,719
[Sir.]

547
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,199
That Sir…

548
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,960
do I look like him?

549
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,320
You're not him.

550
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,360
He didn't treat you well?

551
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,320
Or he just didn't love you?

552
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,000
It's none of your business.

553
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,199
I don't care who he is,

554
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,080
or what went on between you two,

555
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,320
but he hurt you so badly,

556
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,160
don't think about him anymore.

557
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,080
I said it has nothing to do with you.

558
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,320
I may not have met you early

559
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,600
like he did.

560
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,280
But just meeting you at all

561
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,600
is enough for me.

562
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,480
Of all people,

563
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,160
why compare yourself to him?

564
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,360
Drink your medicine.

565
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,640
This isn't

566
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,840
your fault.

567
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,200
Don't hold it in,

568
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,520
just cry if you want.

569
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,880
I know

570
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,000
Auntie Second always cared about you,

571
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,120
so you have to pull yourself together

572
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,640
and give her the closure she deserves.

573
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,240
Remember when I was little,

574
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,480
I caught a cold and

575
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,800
had a fever all night.

576
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,520
Snow shut down the city, no doctors around.

577
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,080
It was Auntie Second

578
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,160
who stayed up all night

579
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,400
and took care of me.

580
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,360
So you think

581
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,880
it's my fault for hurting her?

582
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,400
No, Master!

583
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,080
That's not what I meant!

584
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,800
I know you did it to protect me.

585
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,160
Since you know it,

586
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,800
you should also know

587
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,120
Auntie Second never meant to hurt you.

588
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,840
Right.

589
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,040
She'd never want to hurt me.

590
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,400
Now look up and see

591
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,960
what the Chancellor's Mansion has become!

592
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,400
The Master's fallen ill,

593
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,000
Ma'am cries every day!

594
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,400
Kunlun,

595
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,080
now they only have you

596
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
to lean on!

597
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
Dad's fallen ill?

598
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,800
Yes.

599
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Hundreds here are on edge,

600
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,160
unable to face the day!

601
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,560
They need me.

602
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,320
They're all counting on you,

603
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
stop running

604
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,960
and step up.

605
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,280
Even if it's just for me.

606
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,680
Alright.

607
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
I get it, Master.

608
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,560
This is my responsibility.

609
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,120
I'll find out the truth.

610
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,480
I believe in you.

611
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,280
Stop fighting!

612
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,200
You're the reason Ma'am Second got hurt!

613
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:05,680
Stop it!

614
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,400
Stop it!

615
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,760
It's your fault the Lord got sick!

616
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,600
-How's that my fault?
-Stop it!

617
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,640
Everyone calm down!

618
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,040
[Stop fighting!]

619
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,720
Butler!

620
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,480
Go on!

621
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,120
Why stop now?

622
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,680
Come on,

623
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,160
do it!

624
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,960
If no one's fighting anymore,

625
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,840
let me say a few words.

626
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,360
Butler!

627
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,200
Young Master.

628
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,040
We all know

629
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,120
strange things happened,

630
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,280
the whole house in a mess.

631
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,640
[Pass this down:]

632
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,760
[starting today,]

633
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,840
not a word about this leaves the mansion!

634
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,240
Or

635
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,720
you'll get the rod!

636
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,320
Anyone hurt in recent chaos

637
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,240
gets free care,

638
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,560
just rest up.

639
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,240
But everyone

640
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,680
must report to the butler,

641
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,520
anything odd that happens.

642
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,400
Big or small,

643
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,640
jot it down

644
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,560
and show me.

645
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,000
If someone comes asking about my Dad,

646
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,400
say he's sick

647
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,360
and not seeing anyone.

648
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,680
Any questions?

649
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
If you still don't feel safe,

650
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,360
or want to leave the mansion,

651
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,920
I won't stop you.

652
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,760
Head to accounting anytime,

653
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,440
take your money and go.

654
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
But once you leave,

655
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,160
you're no longer part of this family.

656
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,680
Got it?

657
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
-Understood.
-Yes.

658
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,200
[Bizarre ways, defies all reason.]

659
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,800
[Something seems to be]

660
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,360
[fueling their greed.]

661
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,040
[Also, Wang Hu's body]

662
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,360
[was sent back to Prince Xian's Mansion.]

663
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,080
[So why was he out causing trouble on street?]

664
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
[Lately, I feel]

665
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,680
[heavier every day.]

666
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,520
[Demons are spreading through the city,]

667
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,960
[so many people have died.]

668
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,880
[Feels like]

669
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,480
[there's some unseen force]

670
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,840
[controlling them.]

671
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,240
General, you called for me?

672
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,840
Come with me to Prince Xian's Mansion.

673
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,640
I'll get the horses ready.
