[Love Never Fails]
[EP35]

3
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,039
Why aren't you off

4
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
handling the divine punishment?

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,080
Father!

6
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,520
Father,

7
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
I grew up in Celestial Realm,

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,440
repeating your lessons,

9
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,720
watching every step of mine.

10
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,240
Until this trial

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,960
I never truly grasped

12
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,000
what you,

13
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
Mother,

14
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,040
and Kunlun

15
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,720
mean to me.

16
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,600
Muxian

17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,760
is the woman I love.

18
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,840
I beg you,

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,079
please approve

20
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,960
our marriage.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,480
In ten‑thousand years as Monarch

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,640
I've never held a family feast.

23
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,040
Know why?

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,040
It softens the will.

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,160
Now,

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,800
I allowed one

27
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,680
this time from pity,

28
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,880
not indulgence.

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,120
You've been back long enough,

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,320
yet you are still

31
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,200
narrow‑sighted.

32
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,120
Blind to the bigger picture.

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,320
Do you think

34
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,440
the Emperor Star's trial

35
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,800
is to teach you

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,480
worldly romance?

37
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,600
No.

38
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,640
It shows you

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,880
the world's chaos,

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,920
and that order

41
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,560
and fairness

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,640
are the only constants.

43
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,560
Father,

44
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,840
all I want

45
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,720
is to stand beside the one I love,

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,520
never to slack off.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
You are not qualified.

48
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Sir.

49
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,120
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,520
Perhaps,

51
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,240
in His Majesty's eyes,

52
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,440
I'm still unfit

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,920
to be your Empress.

54
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
I'm just

55
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
the punisher now;

56
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
even so,

57
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,080
eyes follow you.

58
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,200
If I took the throne,

59
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,120
you would become the target of many.

60
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
If some battles can't be dodged,

61
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,840
let's face them together.

62
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,960
Will you truly stay?

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,440
Would I

64
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,240
be here otherwise?

65
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,920
Come here.

66
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,240
The Celestial Floralia's over.

67
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,320
You're the new Floral Deity.

68
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
Train harder.

69
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,000
Strengthen your powers.

70
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,280
I'll be your help.

71
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,360
Focus.

72
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
Only then can I

73
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,240
pass power into you.

74
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,280
But you're wounded.

75
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
I don't want you to strain.

76
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,640
Listen.

77
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,480
I cultivate faster,

78
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,040
and dual practice

79
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,920
boosts us both.

80
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,040
Dual practice?

81
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,000
They say it accelerates cultivation.

82
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,240
Let's do it.

83
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,560
Do you know...

84
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,080
It's born of love.

85
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,880
I owe you

86
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,240
my life,

87
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
and now I love you too.

88
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,600
[Why does his energy]

89
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,440
[feel blocked,]

90
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,880
[as if sealed?]

91
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,320
[Could this be the Soul‑Binding Litany]

92
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
[the Sage spoke of?]

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,880
[And how is it linked to that bracelet...]

94
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

95
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
You've kept

96
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
the Withered Garden in fine order.

97
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
Just doing my job.

98
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,760
Do you know,

99
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,240
in Celestial Realm,

100
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,280
everything must

101
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,920
be flawless?

102
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,600
So why leave

103
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,800
a Withered Garden?

104
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,600
Trials are harsh,

105
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,160
ascension harsher.

106
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,720
I thought

107
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,559
it spared broken flowers

108
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,320
a last breath.

109
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,039
Broken is broken.

110
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,280
No life left to save.

111
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,280
I kept this garden

112
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,760
as a warning.

113
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,720
A reminder to myself.

114
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,280
Show mercy,

115
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,720
and all becomes ruin.

116
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,240
I

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,880
never knew

118
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
this garden's story.

119
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,800
Of course you didn't.

120
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
No one does.

121
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,440
Ten thousand

122
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
years ago,

123
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,320
it became like this.

124
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,080
It was once a fairy's home,

125
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,000
a remarkable one.

126
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,320
Now

127
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,800
even her name

128
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,200
is forgotten.

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,760
[Could this]

130
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
[link to Jinxiu?]

131
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,760
If I may,

132
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,160
where is

133
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,640
she now?

134
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,280
Dead.

135
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,440
Sacrificed for the three realms

136
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,680
to end

137
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,120
an unforgivable mistake.

138
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,320
Your Majesty,

139
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,480
what's this?

140
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,480
Well,

141
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,960
I chose once ten millenniums ago;

142
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,920
I won't let

143
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,520
that error return.

144
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,280
I don't understand.

145
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,400
Camellia pixie!

146
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,800
So you knew it all along.

147
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,280
He prizes you

148
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,280
above life.

149
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,120
Of course I knew.

150
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,240
I forged Jinxiu for ages,

151
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,960
yet

152
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,960
he's still soft.

153
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,320
He's a total disappointment.

154
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,320
Today proves you can't stay.

155
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,680
Let this garden

156
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,760
be your grave.

157
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,360
Consider it my mercy

158
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,720
to you both.

159
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,240
You want to kill me.

160
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,080
What mercy is that?

161
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,960
You preach order

162
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,480
and justice.

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,760
This life,

164
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,560
I rose by merit.

165
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Why kill me?

166
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,080
You shattered Celestial Realm's order.

167
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,080
That's

168
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,240
reason enough.

169
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,000
It was you!

170
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,240
You cast Soul‑Binding Litany on Jinxiu,

171
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,240
and Soul-locking Bracelet on me, through him.

172
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,200
You hurt your own son!

173
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,520
He is not my son!

174
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,800
If he weren't the Emperor Star,

175
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,240
he'd be ash

176
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,720
in Kylin Lair!

177
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,800
Jinxiu,

178
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,960
Stay away from him!

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,680
Jinxiu!

180
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,160
Don't go.

181
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,480
He's lying.

182
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,080
He's hurting you.

183
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,160
Everything he does

184
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,920
is an act.

185
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:14,960
Father!

186
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,680
Father!

187
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,760
Why stand by?

188
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
Seize her!

189
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,200
Kunlun!

190
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,600
Kunlun, move!

191
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,400
Hongning!

192
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,200
This is the woman

193
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
you long to marry?

194
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,880
All of this

195
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,720
began with you!

196
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,960
Kill me, then.

197
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,520
It all

198
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
started with me.

199
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,760
Silence.

200
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,400
She snuck in and attacked the Monarch.

201
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,440
Her sin is unforgivable.

202
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
By my decree,

203
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,080
hand this camellia pixie

204
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,040
to the Punisher:

205
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,640
rip out her core,

206
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,840
smash her soul.

207
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,760
Mother,

208
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,200
let's take Father back

209
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,560
for treatment first.

210
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,520
No.

211
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
I'll watch the Celestial Commander

212
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,520
punish this fiend myself.

213
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,400
What are you waiting for?

214
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,360
If you won't kill her,

215
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,960
I'll bury Floralia Palace

216
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,200
with her!

217
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,720
Sir,

218
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
can't swing the blade?

219
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,760
I

220
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,080
slayed your father.

221
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,320
Do it.

222
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,560
Why?

223
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,040
Why did you do it?

224
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,800
If you hate me,

225
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,840
kill me.

226
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,240
Sir,

227
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,680
from now on,

228
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,400
we owe each other nothing.

229
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,640
Are you deaf?

230
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Kill her!

231
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,040
Now!

232
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,040
[Sir,]

233
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,400
[farewell.]

234
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,920
Brother,

235
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,640
do you even grasp

236
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,240
the price of letting her go?

237
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,240
This isn't

238
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,520
just a lightning sentence.

239
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,440
Keep shielding her

240
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,160
and you'll lose

241
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,119
your own life.

242
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,599
If I don't protect her,

243
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,920
no one

244
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,440
will.

245
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,520
She locked her own heart

246
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
for her evil purpose.

247
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,920
How can you still not see it?

248
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,720
She'd never

249
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,520
put on a Heart Seal by choice.

250
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,080
She must have a reason.

251
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,080
Reason?

252
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,400
What reason could she have?

253
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,920
She's a camellia pixie

254
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,760
with nerves of steel.

255
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,320
What can't she do?

256
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,200
You saw it.

257
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,000
She hurt Father with demonic energy.

258
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
What else is she hiding?

259
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,720
Without the forbidden spell you cast

260
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,680
to descend her,

261
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,360
you wouldn't even see that seal.

262
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,600
Brother,

263
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,160
she's not the Hongning we knew.

264
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,440
She's using you.

265
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,240
That's not who she is.

266
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,840
Fine.

267
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,120
Then tell me this:

268
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,800
how the seal

269
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,320
pierced her heart

270
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,800
if it wasn't her doing?

271
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,280
If she truly loves you,

272
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,440
why not stand

273
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,960
beside you openly?

274
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,520
Why use

275
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,320
a seal to get close to you?

276
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,040
Don't tell me

277
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,640
you felt nothing.

278
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,080
I know exactly

279
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,400
who Hongning is,

280
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,000
and so do you.

281
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,800
Sir Kunlun,

282
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,880
His Majesty was already

283
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,280
drained from seclusion.

284
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,560
Demon King's power tore his core.

285
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,160
We're patching his spirit,

286
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,160
but that's only a stopgap.

287
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,320
How bad?

288
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,560
Let me have a look.

289
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,520
No need to see, Mother.

290
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,800
You're shaken enough.

291
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,200
No need for more shock.

292
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,440
Hongning's strike

293
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,720
shattered Father's core.

294
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,600
Only his millennium body

295
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,240
keeps him alive.

296
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,120
The healers

297
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,000
flooded him with power.

298
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,600
He's stable for now.

299
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,520
How could that wretch

300
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,920
wield such force?

301
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,960
She absorbed vast demon energy

302
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,680
back in State Wuzhang.

303
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,280
So you knew she was Hongning all along?

304
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,160
Your brother's

305
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
bewitched,

306
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,960
and you let it happen!

307
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,800
What were you thinking?

308
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,200
What should we do now?

309
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,400
I've frozen

310
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,840
Father's body,

311
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,360
but her power

312
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
keeps gnawing

313
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,160
at his spirit.

314
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,440
If it breaks through...

315
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,440
he'll be gone.

316
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,080
You're saying

317
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,120
he could vanish at any moment?

318
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,760
Yes.

319
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,440
He would never imagine,

320
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,760
all his pride,

321
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,760
and his obsession with divine law,

322
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,920
were ended up

323
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,160
by a camellia pixie.

324
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,440
Where is Jinxiu?

325
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,240
My brother

326
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,760
knelt for punishment the moment

327
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,720
you and Father came back.

328
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,800
You still call him brother?

329
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,360
Think a

330
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,000
half‑hearted scolding

331
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,360
fixes his sin?

332
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,080
Ridiculous!

333
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,360
Is Father holding on?

334
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,520
For now, the healer's holding his spirit.

335
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,600
But her power

336
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,640
keeps attacking

337
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,680
his spirit.

338
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,520
If his spirit gives way,

339
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,400
I'm afraid...

340
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,960
I've let everyone down, haven't I?

341
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,200
Brother,

342
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,200
you've always been our pride.

343
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,320
To me,

344
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
you'll always be.

345
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,680
Whatever trouble I stir,

346
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,160
you carry me through.

347
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,240
If I hadn't

348
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,800
dragged Hongning up here,

349
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
none of this

350
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,480
would have happened.

351
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:48,920
Brother,

352
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,680
do you remember

353
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,760
when we were kids

354
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,440
and I

355
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,480
nearly died?

356
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,760
How could I not remember?

357
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,160
The Demotion Pool. I took you there.

358
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,360
You recall taking me,

359
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,640
forget I

360
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,480
begged for days

361
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,880
before you agreed.

362
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,520
Kunlun.

363
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,760
Kunlun.

364
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,840
You promised,

365
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,680
no mischief.

366
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,800
Relax!

367
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,960
Live a little.

368
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,520
Isn't that exhausting?

369
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,280
You said just to look,

370
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,440
not to go in.

371
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,400
It's too dangerous.

372
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,240
Come back!

373
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,880
Father's off at Kylin Lair.

374
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,400
He won't be back soon.

375
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,120
So why not have a little fun?

376
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,040
How about this:

377
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,760
catch me

378
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,880
if you want me home.

379
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,480
Kunlun!

380
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,640
Kunlun!

381
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,960
It's too dangerous!

382
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,800
Scare tactics again?

383
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,240
It's just a pool.

384
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,800
Do you know, that pool

385
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,120
strips all power.

386
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,920
Fall in

387
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,200
and you're dust.

388
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,040
Brother,

389
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,320
what would you do

390
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,400
if I had fallen?

391
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
What could I do?

392
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,800
I'd have jumped in after you.

393
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,440
And if you fell too,

394
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,800
I'll dive after you.

395
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,480
Think of how sad

396
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
Father and Mother would be

397
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,320
if we both vanished.

398
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,680
Brother.

399
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,760
Brother.

400
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,800
Listen, Kunlun,

401
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,520
we both should stay safe...

402
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,680
[You're always]

403
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,280
[ready to]

404
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,000
[risk your life]

405
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,040
for others,

406
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,400
yet now you shut

407
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,120
everyone out

408
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,240
when it's you in danger.

409
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,920
Celestial Realm's duty rests on me.

410
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,800
That's how it must be.

411
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,720
And that

412
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,520
lone‑wolf act

413
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,400
is what landed us here.

414
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,360
Everything Hongning did

415
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,480
were her own choices.

416
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,720
This was

417
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,480
all set in motion,

418
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,720
a trap

419
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,520
from the start.

420
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,040
She drew close to you,

421
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,200
won your trust,

422
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,560
and returned to Celestial Realm with you.

423
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,880
It was all her scheme.

424
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,600
Brother,

425
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,240
it's never your fault.

426
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,400
If you erred at all,

427
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,480
it was

428
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,200
your love to her

429
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,120
blinded you.

430
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,960
Her hate

431
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,920
began with me.

432
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,280
If I'd noticed sooner,

433
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,840
explained to her

434
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,160
and begged forgiveness...

435
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,760
Please,

436
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,560
don't flog yourself.

437
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,800
If that's true,

438
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,680
I'm guilty too.

439
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,120
I knew she was Hongning

440
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,840
and kept quiet.

441
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,480
None of this

442
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,960
is on you.

443
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,520
Brother.

444
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,160
Kunlun,

445
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
Mother always

446
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,560
favored you.

447
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,680
That's why

448
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,000
you acted

449
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,560
carefree and uninhibited,

450
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,880
but really,

451
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,560
you did it for me.

452
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,880
So I could be the heir.

453
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,040
In truth, your skills

454
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,040
and your power

455
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,200
are no less than mine.

456
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,520
I know it.

457
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,600
You'd make

458
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,640
a better Monarch.

459
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,440
Do you

460
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,480
hear yourself?

461
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,160
Promise me

462
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,800
you'll look after Father

463
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,720
and Mother.

464
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,480
Celestial Realm's future

465
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,680
is yours now.

466
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,800
Sir.

467
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,120
Sir.

468
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,320
Sir!

469
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,400
Mother.

470
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,680
You've got some nerve.

471
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,400
Mother,

472
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
Father's life hangs by a thread.

473
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,160
I'm worried about him.

474
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,200
I know

475
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,640
it's all because of me.

476
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,080
It's too late now

477
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,080
and I'm ready to trade my divine bones

478
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,440
for his safety.

479
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,120
What did you say?

480
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,760
Father's spirit

481
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,080
is corrupted

482
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,720
by demonic force.

483
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,360
This method may not work

484
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,200
but it will save his life.

485
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,400
Trade away your divine bones,

486
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,440
and you'll be no different from a mortal.

487
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,000
Do that,

488
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,120
and you'll lose your god power,

489
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,840
even the right to inherit the throne.

490
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,800
My sins

491
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,360
stripped me of that right already.

492
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,520
I know

493
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,000
this all began

494
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,200
because of me.

495
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,600
But as his son,

496
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,920
I owe him my duty.

497
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,760
I can't think of

498
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,960
any other way.

499
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,600
Afterward

500
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,400
I'll exile

501
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,120
myself below.

502
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,720
Please let me.

503
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,520
Mother,

504
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,840
another peony bloom

505
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,280
opened on my true form.

506
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,520
Would you like to see?

507
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,680
Celestial Commander's true form

508
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,320
naturally has

509
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,440
81 golden blooms.

510
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,440
This one bloomed so soon after the last.

511
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,520
We just admired the last one.

512
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,120
I'll pass this time.

513
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,800
Okay.

514
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,160
Rest well, Mother.

515
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,600
Your Majesty,

516
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,280
Sir Kunlun

517
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,760
has mastered puppet magic.

518
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,640
Truly?

519
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,960
Take me to him.

520
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,960
Mother.

521
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,840
Wait here.

522
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,000
When I return,

523
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,400
we'll view the new bloom together.

524
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,920
Yes, Mother.

525
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,360
Right now,

526
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,520
giving Father my divine bones

527
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,640
is the only cure.

528
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,000
Mother, you know me.

529
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,160
So please indulge me this time,

530
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,720
just this once.

531
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,920
Mother,

532
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,080
you're back.

533
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,480
Why are you still here?

534
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,200
You said

535
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,400
you'd see Kunlun first,

536
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,840
then my new peony bloom,

537
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,640
so I waited.

538
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,640
You're from the Flora Clan.

539
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,760
Blooming is normal.

540
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,560
Must I come

541
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,920
every time one of your

542
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,440
81 petals opens?

543
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,400
Mother,

544
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,080
this gold petal

545
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,800
is different.

546
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,680
It's just 81 petals.

547
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,000
Different how?

548
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,800
Mother,

549
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,960
it opened

550
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,840
while I pictured

551
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,040
your face.

552
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,400
A peony is a peony.

553
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,520
What's it to me?

554
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,880
Rise.

555
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,320
Not unless

556
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,239
you agree.

557
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,520
In ten thousand years

558
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,360
I've asked you for nothing else.

559
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,080
Please, Mother.

560
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,159
Get up.

561
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,960
You said

562
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,200
you never asked me for anything.

563
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,320
But you're wrong.

564
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,840
At 500,

565
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,680
when your first golden bloom appeared,

566
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,840
you begged me.

567
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,160
Yes,

568
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,000
yet

569
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,960
you never came.

570
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,920
Jinxiu,

571
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,600
I always favored Kunlun

572
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,840
and was strict with you.

573
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,320
I tried to control it,

574
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,280
but it wasn't hidden.

575
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,960
Have you ever

576
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
wondered why?

577
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,320
Because I'm the elder son,

578
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,680
I bear expectations.

579
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,880
So Mother disciplined me strictly.

580
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,200
Do you really

581
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,800
believe that?

582
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,120
I

583
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,120
have to.

584
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,400
If you're displeased,

585
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,960
I must try harder.

586
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,880
So, since I was little,

587
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,040
I've always

588
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,720
worked harder

589
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,520
than Kunlun.

590
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,520
I thought

591
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,000
if I excelled at everything...

592
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,720
perhaps

593
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,360
you'd love me just a bit more.

594
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,440
You've never fallen short.

595
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,240
You did better than Father,

596
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,600
Kunlun,

597
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,880
any god

598
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,960
of your age.

599
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,240
But it changes nothing.

600
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,880
No matter how hard

601
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,760
you try,

602
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,800
it won't lessen

603
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,040
my hatred for you.

604
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,560
Jinxiu,

605
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,760
you know,

606
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,280
I hate you.

607
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,400
The more you try,

608
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,600
the more I'm torn.

609
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,680
You are so innocent,

610
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
yet I despise you.

611
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,160
You bear

612
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,480
this coldness

613
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,280
because...

614
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,760
you're not

615
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,680
my flesh and blood.

616
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,120
You've sensed it,

617
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,280
haven't you?

618
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,400
Whatever my birth,

619
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,360
I owe you ten millennia of care.

620
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,560
I

621
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,440
cannot forget that.

622
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,200
Today,

623
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,120
I proved your

624
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,480
thousand-year doubt.

625
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,520
I should've known.

626
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,920
Your refusal to fight

627
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,880
wasn't virtue.

628
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,680
It was fear of the truth.

629
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,960
Fine,

630
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
I consent your request.

631
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,040
Thank you, Mother.

632
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,440
No thanks needed.

633
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
I agreed

634
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,160
for one reason:

635
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
to dispel you from Celestial Realm.

636
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,480
Mother,

637
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,920
I have one more favor to ask.

638
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,840
Speak.

639
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,080
Please,

640
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
spare Hongning's life.

641
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,080
You heard all that?

642
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,280
You don't look surprised.

643
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,800
Though I'm unremarkable,

644
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,720
but we're close.

645
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,880
I sensed it.

646
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,640
You're good at hiding it.

647
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,520
Mother,

648
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,360
we may not share the same blood,

649
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,520
but we've been brothers for so long.

650
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,160
That bond is real.

651
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,880
Please, don't do this to him.

652
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,120
What,

653
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,440
you think

654
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm cruel to him?

655
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
If I said no,

656
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,160
you'd know I'm lying.

657
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,160
Everything you did was for me.

658
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,520
Mother, you may well ask me:

659
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,240
in all three realms,

660
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,280
who has least right to call you cruel?

661
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,880
The answer, of course, is me.

662
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:00,960
Yet, Mother,

663
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,600
have you ever considered my feelings?

664
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,440
Did you ever ask me

665
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,160
whether any of this is what I wanted?

666
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,720
Well,

667
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,040
too late for that.

668
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,800
If you hadn't feigned ignorance,

669
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,120
and taken

670
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,480
responsibility sooner,

671
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,320
none of this

672
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,880
would've happened.

673
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,400
Now,

674
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,880
words are useless.

675
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,880
Since everything is beyond saving,

676
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,280
as the Celestial Realm's Punisher,

677
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,160
carve out Jinxiu's divine bones.

678
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,120
What?

679
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,920
Afterall,

680
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,200
you're his brother.

681
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,160
Ease the pain

682
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,560
if you can.

683
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,480
It may be

684
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,080
all you have left to give.

685
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,480
The decision is yours.
