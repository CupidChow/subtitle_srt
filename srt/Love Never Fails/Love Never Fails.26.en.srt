[Love Never Fails]
[EP26]

3
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,160
Are you really

4
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,880
gonna marry me?

5
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,360
Marry you?

6
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
Why would I do that?

7
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,000
Then why did you

8
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,560
pay for my freedom just now?

9
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,520
Because you said the Matriarch wasn't real.

10
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,680
I only did that

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,600
to stand up for her.

12
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,440
Why else

13
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,759
would I waste money like that?

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,880
What's up?

15
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,400
Keep going.

16
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,560
With this attitude,

17
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,960
I can't let you walk away.

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,200
You're a demon?

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,160
Listen,

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,240
even if you force me to stay,

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,120
you'll never have my heart.

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,880
My heart belongs to the Matriarch.

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,720
I'm warning you,

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,480
don't try to force me.

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,240
It won't work.

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,560
Love can't be forced.

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,600
Are there

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,400
really people as full

29
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,079
of themselves as you?

30
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,040
What?

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,120
If I weren't saving his life,

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,360
I wouldn't waste

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,720
a word on you.

34
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,320
Matriarch, save me!

35
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,920
Help...

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,120
Matriarch

37
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,840
is here?

38
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,680
Still daydreaming?

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,800
Oh.

40
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,720
Yeah, right.

41
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,200
You really answered my prayer.

42
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,200
Who are you?

43
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Someone you can't afford to mess with.

44
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,360
Exactly!

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,280
Get out of my way!

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,760
You wanna

47
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
die with him?

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,520
Honestly, you don't

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
need to fight over me.

50
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,320
C'mon, you don't stand a chance.

51
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,480
She's the only one I want.

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,120
My eyes are fine now?

53
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,920
Kneel.

54
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,320
Ask me to be your master.

55
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,959
No? I'm leaving.

56
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,600
Matriarch,

57
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,720
take me as your disciple.

58
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,080
Demons have been active lately.

59
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,040
Thought you might be interested.

60
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,680
If you're feeling better,

61
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
we can go out for a walk.

62
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,800
The dishes...

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,880
What do you think?

64
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,120
Quite unique.

65
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,720
Who made them?

66
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,120
Don't you know the answer?

67
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,800
Do you cook

68
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,200
for others often?

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,320
If I did,

70
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,960
the dishes wouldn't look so unique.

71
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,920
[I didn't see you in the room]

72
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,440
and figured you'd be out here.

73
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,280
You made

74
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,960
quite a scene yesterday.

75
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,960
Jinxiu,

76
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,960
I came back safe, didn't I?

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,040
All thanks to my master

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,920
showing up in time.

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
In Chancellor's Mansion, I already

80
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,080
heard you took down a raccoon demon.

81
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,760
That's impressive.

82
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,640
Then let me introduce everyone properly.

83
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,240
This is

84
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,159
Jinxiu, my brother.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,040
And my sister-in-law, Muxian.

86
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,240
This is my master,

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,520
the Matriarch, Luyao.

88
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,159
Muxian?

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,280
Pleased to meet you.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,280
I've heard a lot about you.

91
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,760
You truly

92
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,400
live up to your reputation.

93
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,960
Of course she does.

94
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,560
This is the Matriarch

95
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,360
I've been dreaming of.

96
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,280
Of course she's stunning.

97
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,480
What Matriarch?

98
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,080
Don't listen to his nonsense.

99
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm just mortal.

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,840
How can I compare with the Matriarch?

101
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,560
But Muxian, you're like

102
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,800
the camellia in this garden.

103
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,880
How so?

104
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,480
Fiery red, bold, and reckless.

105
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,960
I wouldn't dare to be reckless.

106
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm just a demon hunter.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,080
And I just came here.

108
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,960
There's still so much

109
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,440
I need to learn from you.

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,880
I heard you caught

111
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,320
a thousand-year peach demon.

112
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,600
I'd love to spar with you.

113
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,320
Muxian is still recovering.

114
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,240
Perhaps next time.

115
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
That's right.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,560
Master,

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,560
aren't you going to teach me

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,520
spells and how to spot demons?

119
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,720
Let's do this now.

120
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,640
If I run into another

121
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,760
demon like last night,

122
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,080
my reputation will be ruined.

123
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,680
Seriously, what you're good for?

124
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,720
Come with me.

125
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,840
Goodbye.

126
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,280
General, do you know that girl?

127
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,160
No.

128
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,000
Just someone Kunlun likes.

129
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,200
Kunlun was attacked last night?

130
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,440
By a raccoon demon.

131
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,280
Strange thing is,

132
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,760
she'd been living quietly

133
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,640
at the Spring Blossom Pavilion.

134
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Then she suddenly snapped.

135
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,240
No idea how Kunlun provoked her.

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,760
Shall we go out?

137
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,640
Master, have some tea.

138

['cause the state]

141

[May I ask what calamity is it?]

146
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,320
[Fate cannot be revealed.]

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080

[before Jinxiu does.]

153

[Yes, Ma'am.]

154
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,360
Master, please.

155
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,120
Master,

156
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,520
why are you

157
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,000
staring at that butcher?

158
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,080
If you're craving meat,

159
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,520
I'll take you to Babaili Beef Roast...

160
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,200
Do you see anything strange

161
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,080
about him?

162
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,640
Master,

163
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,400
so this is your type?

164
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
I, uh...

165
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
I guess I could be that too.

166
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,120
Stop joking.

167
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,720
Watch his knife work.

168
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,120
Every strike is a killing blow.

169
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,280
Isn't that just how butchers chop meat?

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,560
Is that so?

171
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,040
What else would it be?

172
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,240
I've looked into it.

173
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,920
There's only one well.

174
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,520
Everyone who

175
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,720
drinks from it has suddenly fallen ill.

176
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,720
Guess

177
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,600
who lives closest to that well?

178
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
The butcher?

179
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,640
Smart. You got it.

180
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,120
I found

181
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,800
the well water smells off.

182
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,280
That butcher must've

183
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,280
cursed it.

184
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,760
Master,

185
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,560
aren't you overthinking this?

186
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,360
Kunlun,

187
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
listen carefully.

188
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,760
Wuzhang is on the brink

189
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,880
of a disaster.

190
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,640
You have to grow up soon.

191
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,200
Master,

192
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,400
are you worrying too much lately?

193
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,200
As the Prime Minister's son,

194
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,840
you must care for the state and people.

195
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,360
You mustn't slack off.

196
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,160
Wait,

197
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
what does

198
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,040
this disaster

199
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,040
have to do with a butcher?

200
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,840
Listen.

201
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,240
That demon

202
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,720
is playing a long game.

203
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,120
The butcher

204
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,760
is related to food and public health.

205
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
If he keeps this up,

206
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,920
the whole city will fall ill.

207
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,840
When illness spreads,

208
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,320
chaos follow.

209
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,280
After that...

210
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,680
The state will fall into chaos.

211
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,680
Then the warlords will

212
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,760
raise their armies

213
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,640
and fight each other

214
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,680
for the throne.

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,520
Master,

216
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,440
the state will be doomed.

217
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,600
Kunlun...

218
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,520
Master...

219
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,920
So, you finally get it now?

220
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,480
Yes, Master.

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,120
Why is

222
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,040
the Pavilion shut down?

223
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,000
Kunlun got attacked there,

224
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,000
so it's sealed for now.

225
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,320
Welcome.

226
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,360
Please take a look.

227
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,160
What do you like? I'll buy it for you.

228
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,600
Nothing.

229
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,160
Well then,

230
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,480
I'll buy all for you.

231
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,560
[Since I'm your master,]

232
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,800
[then from now on,]

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,080
[you must listen to me.]

234
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,520
[I want you]

235
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,120
[to care about what you want]

236
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,640
[and follow your heart.]

237
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,800
[Look, which rouge do you like?]

238
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,880
[If you don't pick one,]

239
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,200
[I'll just buy them all.]

240
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,600
[This one.]

241
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
I said I don't want anything.

242
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,320
Why are you angry, Muxian?

243
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,600
If you don't like these,

244
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,480
just tell me

245
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,560
what you like.

246
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,040
It must be nice to have the power

247
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,160
to get whatever you want.

248
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,040
But we're different.

249
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,720
Tell me,

250
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,880
should people follow their heart

251
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,320
or defy fate and

252
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,760
cultivate to be immortal?

253
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,480
I never cared for immortality.

254
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,800
But I think

255
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,000
even mortals

256
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,120
can't always follow their hearts.

257
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
So you'll choose the people

258
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,560
in the city.

259
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,360
When faced with gain and loss,

260
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,080
you can always make your choice.

261
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,520
What are you talking about?

262
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,800
We're just shopping.

263
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,360
Why drag in such grand talk?

264
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,120
If sacrificing the people of Wuzhang

265
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,840
can save the rest of the world,

266
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,840
will you do that?

267
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,320
What's this really about?

268
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,080
It's for you.

269
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,960
Core of a thousand-year serpent demon.

270
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
You got hurt for collecting

271
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,880
cores for me?

272
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,000
It's nothing.

273
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,680
Congrats, you finally stay

274
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,280
in the General's Manor.

275
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,640
This is just the beginning.

276
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,840
We're one step closer

277
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,840
to our goal.

278
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
But Jinxiu is cunning

279
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,400
and cautious.

280
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
I'm worried about you.

281
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,080
I gave up my form and melted bones.

282
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,840
I survive

283
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,360
by consuming demon cores.

284
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,640
There's no next life

285
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,760
for me.

286
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,160
I'll be careful.

287
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,120
I know

288
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,400
this goes against who you are.

289
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,680
But that blood debt...

290
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,200
I'll never forget it.

291
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,800
You won't waver?

292
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,360
[It hurts too much.]

293
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,400
[Dad!]

294
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,560
[Mom!]

295
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,520
[Dad!]

296
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,200
[Dad!]

297
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,880
[Mom!]

298
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,360
[From now on,]

299
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,480
[we're just enemies.]

300
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,280
He killed my parents

301
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,720
and my best friend.

302
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,240
I will

303
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,440
make him pay every debt.

304
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,720
Hongning,

305
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,280
remember,

306
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,880
no matter what,

307
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,280
I'm always on your side.

308
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,640
I blame myself for not being strong enough

309
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,960
to help you face grievances.

310
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,600
I'll make everyone

311
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,840
who hurt me that day pay the price.

312
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,880
Even Yaotian?

313
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Yes.

314
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,480
But you...

315
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,960
You brought me back

316
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
and risked yourself for these cores.

317
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,800
Thanks, Baicha.

318
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
I dragged you into this mess.

319
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,640
You're my friend,

320
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,440
and I'd do anything for you.

321
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,640
Stay alert in Wuzhang.

322
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,840
Prince Xian is up to something.

323
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,680
If he and Jinxiu join forces,

324
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,680
you won't stand a chance.

325
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,160
Don't worry.

326
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,000
I'll be careful.

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,680
Then I gotta go now.

328
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,320
[Jinxiu,]

329
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,040
[I said]

330
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,520
[I'd find you]

331
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,640
[and kill you myself.]

332
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,720
[Muxian gets]

333
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,200
[angry suddenly.]

334
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,240
[I'd better stay out of her sight for now.]

335
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,720
What are you doing?

336
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,560
Hey, what's going on?

337
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,600
Just in time.

338
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,200
Give this to Muxian.

339
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,240
What's that supposed to mean?

340
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,880
You think

341
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,120
I can't get a gift for a girl myself?

342
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,040
Give it to Muxian for me.

343
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,480
Did you two argue?

344
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,640
Shut up.

345
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,800
Never thought I'd see you like this.

346
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,160
A young master running errands.

347
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,200
What a life.

348
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,920
Muxian!

349
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,560
Muxian...

350
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,720
What are you doing here?

351
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,080
Why can't I be here?

352
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,360
Or

353
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,160
are you expecting someone else?

354
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,320
Jinxiu asked me to give you this.

355
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,800
Why didn't he come himself?

356
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
How should I know?

357
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,480
Anyway I'm innocent.

358
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:47,960
But

359
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
I have to tell you this,

360
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,920
he rarely falls for anyone.

361
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,280
And he's clueless about what to do.

362
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,960
Please be patient.

363
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,050
[This room was]

364
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,120
[prepared especially for the Matriarch.]

365
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,600
Can't believe

366
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,880
you'd actually stay here.

367
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,360
Prepared?

368
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,320
To be honest,

369
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,920
I've liked, no,

370
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,880
admired you since I was a child.

371
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,240
Since when actually?

372
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,160
Ever since I can remember.

373
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,280
The first time I dreamed of you.

374
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,840
How many times do I have to tell you?

375
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,160
I'm not the Matriarch.

376
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,200
Stop calling me that.

377
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,160
Alright, alright.

378
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,960
I won't do it.

379
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,160
Then,

380
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,160
I'll just call you Master.

381
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,840
Take that down.

382
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,000
Now.

383
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,160
Yes.

384
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,320
I can understand.

385
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,600
It seems a bit narcissistic

386
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,040
for you to worship yourself.

387
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,800
I was wrong, Master.

388
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,640
I won't say anything like that again.

389
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,040
I'm going to rest.

390
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,560
You can go now.

391
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,520
Yes.

392
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,320
Wait.

393
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,480
Keep an eye

394
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,320
on what Jinxiu will do next few days.

395
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,440
Learn from him.

396
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,120
What else could he do?

397
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,520
All he does is

398
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
train and work.

399
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,280
Just do it.

400
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,480
Yes.

401
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,920
Then leave.

402
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,040
I'm leaving?

403
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,160
For real?

404
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,200
Get out.

405
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,320
Wasn't she in the room just now?

406
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,120
I must have mistaken

407
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,840
someone else for the Matriarch.

408
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

409
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,400
After all these years,

410
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,120
you finally show up.

411
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,000
Where have you been?

412
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,680
Your Highness,

413
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,360
I descended to the mortal realm,

414
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,920
my memories were sealed.

415
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,800
I only regained them recently.

416
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Now, I'm staying at Kunlun's manor.

417
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,760
Good.

418
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,880
You must do your best

419
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,120
to support Kunlun

420
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,840
and light up the Emperor Star first.

421
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,160
Yes, Your Highness.

422
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,120
I'll do everything I can.

423
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,040
Any news of Jinxiu?

424
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
In this life,

425
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,640
he is Kunlun's cousin

426
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,640
and now the General of Ministry of Law.

427
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,120
I've investigated.

428
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,920
He's been hunting demons

429
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,320
and has been more

430
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,600
well-regarded than Kunlun.

431
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,240
But rest assured, Your Highness.

432
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,880
I'll guide Sir Kunlun

433
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,720
to achieve greater merits,

434
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,840
surpass Jinxiu,

435
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,640
and light up the star first.

436
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
All these years,

437
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,400
Sky Fox has been searching for you.

438
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,160
Take care.

439
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Thanks for the reminding.

440
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,760
What is she doing in there all day

441
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,120
with a sulking face?

442
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,880
Are you okay?

443
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,600
I... didn't mean to shoot you.

444
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,360
Are you alright?

445
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,840
Thanks.

446
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,360
Jinxiu.

447
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,680
I swear it's just an accident.

448
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,240
Look

449
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,640
at this embroidery.

450
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,840
- Isn't it gorgeous?
- Yeah, it is.

451
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,760
But don't you think

452
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,840
something is missing?

453
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,320
If we added some beads,

454
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,600
it'd be shinier.

455
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,640
Let's ask the tailor

456
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,840
to fix it later.

457
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,960
Master told me to watch Jinxiu.

458
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,320
Was she asking me to

459
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,200
watch him bicker with Muxian?

460
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,440
What's that supposed mean?

461
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,880
[Kunlun!]

462
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,120
[Kunlun!]

463
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,760
You've got good taste.

464
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,000
How is this dress?

465
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,360
Looks great.

466
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,840
Kunlun,

467
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,280
what about this one?

468
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,600
Very pretty.

469
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,720
You've got a good eye.

470
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,840
Could Master

471
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,800
be hinting at something?

472
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,160
[Even Kunlun says it looks good.]

473
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,120
Maybe she wants to be with me,

474
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,760
but she's too shy to say it.

475
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
So she's using Jinxiu and Muxian

476
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,640
as an example.

477
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,200
But that doesn't make sense.

478
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,800
Jinxiu is so hopeless.

479
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,240
He can't even get along with Muxian.

480
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,120
Isn't this a

481
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,520
bad sign for me and Master?

482
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,200
I want to be with her forever.

483
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,160
No,

484
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
I can't just stand by and watch.

485
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,120
I've got to find a chance

486
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,320
and fix things between those two.

487
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,600
Help them smooth things over.

488
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,920
Otherwise, it'll ruin my chances with Master.

489
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,600
Kunlun!

490
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,440
Kunlun!

491
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,000
Look at these.

492
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,080
They'd be perfect

493
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,760
for you and that girl you brought back.

494
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,680
Well,

495
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
you're of marrying age now.

496
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,560
I've prepared plenty of things for you.

497
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,800
Right!

498
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,920
This is the one!

499
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,280
If you like it,

500
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,600
I'll send it to Luyao now.

501
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,720
- Good.
- Auntie.

502
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,760
Have you prepared

503
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,720
clothes for Muxian and Jinxiu?

504
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,920
Of course we did.

505
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,840
Unlike you men,

506
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,440
we're not that careless.

507
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,600
This set is

508
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,640
for Jinxiu and Muxian.

509
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,520
Bring it over.

510
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,560
- Hurry up.
- Let me see.

511
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
What do you think?

512
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,160
Good.

513
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,400
Perfect.

514
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,280
Xiang.

515
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,640
Xiang.

516
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,960
Yes?

517
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,760
Deliver these clothes to them.

518
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,920
Facing Jinxiu,

519
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,040
tell him that

520
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,880
Muxian picked it out

521
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,280
just for him.

522
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,800
Facing Muxian,

523
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,280
remember to tell her

524
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,160
Jinxiu had it

525
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,240
prepared for their outing.

526
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,880
Got it?

527
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,680
Yes.

528
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,920
Remember to tell them these.

529
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,480
Kunlun...

530
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,880
Well, then,

531
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,840
I'll be off now.

532
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,160
[I crushed every petal of my true form]

533
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,640
[to forge this body.]

534
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,680
[This is against the rules.]

535
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,880
[This fragile shell of Muxian]

536
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,800
[could vanish]

537
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,160
[any moment.]

538
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,200
[Before that happens,]

539
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,600
[there are things]

540
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,960
[I need to finish.]

541
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,800
General!

542
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,880
Muxian?

543
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,800
Why didn't you

544
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
send me the sword yourself?

545
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,480
I thought

546
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,040
you didn't want to see me.

547
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,000
Then you're in front of me now.

548
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,040
Did you think I'll

549
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,040
just leave you be?

550
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,000
Would you?

551
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,200
No.

552
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,000
You once asked me

553
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,040
whether we

554
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,480
should follow our hearts.

555
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,080
I said

556
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,600
we couldn't

557
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,760
always follow our hearts.

558
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,680
But right now, I'm here

559
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,880
to tell you that

560
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,320
when it comes to you,

561
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,240
I am following my heart.

562
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,680
That has never changed.

563
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,280
Feelings can be true

564
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,600
or lies.

565
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,720
Which are yours?

566
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,120
I've made

567
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
my feelings clear.

568
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,240
Do you believe me?

569
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,440
Yes.

570
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,680
Then what are your feelings for me?

571
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,560
Desire, anger, love, hate,

572
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,800
which one of them?

573
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,200
Thank you for the sword.

574
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,360
You haven't answered my question.

575
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,960
All of them.

576
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,360
Does that scare you?

577
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,200
All?

578
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
No need to answer me now.

579
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,120
I'll give you time to think.

580
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,600
Muxian invites you for a walk tonight.

581
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,840
She's picked this herself.

582
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
She asked you to send me this?

583
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,480
Yes.

584
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,480
[So she's finally moved by me?]

585
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,000
General invites you out for a walk tonight.

586
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,960
He has this prepared for you.

587
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,720
[What is he scheming this time?]

588
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,640
This outfit...

589
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,800
It's nice.

590
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,000
Really?

591
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,360
You look good in anything.

592
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,040
So you're just like any other man

593
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,360
and only care about appearances.

594
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,120
It's human nature to love beauty.

595
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm no different from other men.

596
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
Human nature?

597
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,640
Did I say something wrong?

598
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,560
How about another shot?

599
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,480
Excuse me,

600
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,000
how do you charge for this?

601
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,480
One coin

602
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,040
per arrow.

603
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,360
How about this,

604
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,320
80 coins

605
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,800
for 100 shots?

606
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,640
Sure thing.

607
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:46,960
Here you go.

608
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,120
Thank you.

609
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,080
Please give me ten arrows.

610
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,600
Just watch what I can do.

611
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,560
General, what are you doing?

612
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,960
Teaching you archery.

613
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,080
No need.

614
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,160
I can handle it myself.

615
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,560
[She's incredible!]

616
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,840
[What a shot!]

617
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,520
[That's surprising.]

618
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,560
[Brilliant!]

619
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,320
Miss,

620
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,000
here.

621
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,520
[That's insanely accurate!]

622
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
[She never misses!]

623
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,720
You really are full

624
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,640
of surprises.

625
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,320
[So amazing.]

626
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,000
Your turn.

627
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,240
May I borrow your hairpin?

628
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,840
[Nice one!]

629
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,840
[Spectacular!]

630
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,320
[Wonderful!]

631
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,800
Thank you.

632
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,719
You win.

633
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,199
Wait, Jinxiu,

634
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,360
aren't we just

635
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,719
here to have fun?

636
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,199
But you...

637
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,880
You made me look bad.

638
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,120
Care to make it more challenging?

639
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
No, we're good.

640
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,600
I'm done.

641
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,640
Jinxiu,

642
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,320
let's go play dice.

643
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
I can't beat you in archery,

644
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,960
but dice is my game.

645
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,120
Gambling?

646
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,080
That's illegal. We can't do that.

647
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,000
Fine, no gambling.

648
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,840
No dice.

649
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,600
I heard

650
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,880
there's a fortune teller nearby.

651
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,960
He's famous

652
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,560
for being accurate.

653
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,520
He's honored as

654
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,880
the Living Immortal.

655
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,520
Just a con artist.

656
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,880
I heard he's good

657
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,360
at predicting romantic relationships.

658
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,320
If you're not interested, it's fine.

659
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,640
Where is he? Lead the way.

660
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,200
Okay. I'll take you to him.

661
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,040
Let's go.

662
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,560
You two are a perfect match.

663
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

664
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,240
Thanks.

665
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

666
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,840
how about a little matchmaking reading?

667
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
We'll go first.

668
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,520
You look quite familiar.

669
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,000
Didn't expect it really was you.

670
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,440
I'm just earning some wine money.

671
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,240
Please show me your hand.

672
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,920
Which one?

673
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,720
This one.

674
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,000
Right hand?

675
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,880
Let me see.

676
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,600
Your...

677
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,560
Well, no rush.

678
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,840
Please draw one.

679
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,760
And you.

680
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,280
Love is predestined?

681
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,800
Master!

682
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,200
Great!

683
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,760
I knew that

684
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,760
you're a pro.

685
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,680
Jinxiu, I told you.

686
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,520
The Matriarch

687
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,200
and I are made for each other.

688
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,440
Look!

689
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,440
Love and fate are hard to predict.

690
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,760
What's that supposed to mean?

691
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,960
It's a divine secret.

692
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,080
I can't reveal it to you.

693
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,800
I don't care about the crap.

694
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,760
Just tell me how to fix this.

695
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,200
Eighty taels of gold.

696
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,720
Any less and it won't work.

697
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,480
You must wear them all times.

698
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,800
80 taels?

699
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,280
That's absurd!

700
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,000
For two red strings?

701
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,400
It's worth it.

702
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,760
Jinxiu,

703
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,000
is it those blind dates

704
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,040
arranged for you

705
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,720
that ruin

706
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,080
your marriage?

707
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,720
Blind dates?

708
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,360
Yeah. Magistrate Su's daughter

709
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,560
likes him a lot.

710
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,920
What Magistrate...

711
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,360
Why bother with fortune readings?

712
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,240
Go marry the magistrate's daughter.

713
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,000
No, I...

714
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,200
I...

715
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,800
I don't even know her!

716
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,760
Mind your own business!

717
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,600
[Muxian!]

718
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,920
[Muxian!]

719
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Did I say anything wrong?

720
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,960
Come back anytime.

721
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,840
[I'll come see you next time!]

722
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,480
Take care.

723
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,000
Where are they?

724
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,000
They got lost.

725
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,160
Or did you

726
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
send them off?

727
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,320
Muxian,

728
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,880
what do you love most about this world?

729
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,160
What about you?

730
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,800
I love fireworks.

731
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,840
Why?

732
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,800
They say

733
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,440
flowers are most beautiful in full bloom.

734
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,160
But whenever I see fireworks scatter,

735
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,480
it reminds me of falling petals.

736
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,560
Fireworks and falling petals

737
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,400
are what I find

738
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
most beautiful.

739
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,840
[When the flowers fall,]

740
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,720
[I will marry you.]

741
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,960
[Deal?]

742
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,920
Why

743
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,360
do these fireworks

744
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,480
make me feel sad?

745
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,560
Do you have sorrow in your heart?

746
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,160
I did.

747
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,240
What happened?

748
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,560
Aren't you asking a bit too much?

749
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,320
I just want to know you better.
