[Love Never Fails]
[EP18]

3
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,800
Hongning, Bailing, Lujiu...

4
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,120
All three are missing.

5
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,990
When were they

6
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,130
last seen?

7
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,930
I saw them head to the back mountain.

8
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,130
Haven't seen them since.

9
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,730
I checked the whole back mountain.

10
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,810
No sign of them.

11
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,050
It's way past curfew,

12
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,450
they're still not back.

13
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,690
I wonder

14
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,570
how Lujiu is doing.

15
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,170
Worrying won't fix anything.

16
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,290
Even Lujiu

17
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,610
couldn't handle that demon.

18
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,650
You'd just get in the way.

19
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,250
Let's make a plan first.

20
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,290
You've got a point.

21
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,610
I've set up protective barriers here.

22
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,370
Even a powerful demon

23
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,930
couldn't break through easily.

24
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,210
Tonight

25
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,650
we'll take a rest here.

26
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,730
Everyone says you can always

27
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,770
stay calm in a crisis

28
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,770
and deal with

29
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,690
evil monsters.

30
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,490
You really live up to the hype!

31
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,970
I slew demons

32
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,890
during my travels.

33
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,290
They lack moral codes,

34
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,770
born wild by nature.

35
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,690
One misstep,

36
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,330
they stray from the path,

37
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,410
committing wicked deeds.

38
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,570
As a cultivator,

39
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,410
I must stop them.

40
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,090
That's why

41
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,810
I don't get why Cangwu Academy

42
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,290
admit pixie disciples.

43
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,850
It should

44
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,329
set a good example

45
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,370
for all cultivators.

46
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,050
Yet ignoring

47
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:30,970
the natural divide

48
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,530
between humans and demons,

49
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,770
it allows pixies

50
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,610
to practice cultivation.

51
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,090
Wait,

52
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,490
why can't pixies do that?

53
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,730
Actually, all can.

54
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,170
Pixies, spirits,

55
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,250
mortals and immortals...

56
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,930
But pixies'

57
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,650
wild instincts

58
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,450
make most turn bad.

59
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,530
The Academy breaks rules

60
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,130
by teaching them.

61
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,410
Why do you talk like that?

62
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,610
It's so off-putting!

63
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,290
Pixies aren't born evil!

64
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,690
That's just bias.

65
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,250
I grew up around pixies.

66
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,010
I've dealt with many,

67
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,010
and plenty are kind-hearted.

68
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,529
Please tell me,

69
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,250
have you had the pixie-sensing ability

70
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,930
since childhood?

71
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:25,850
Yeah.

72
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,770
Never failed?

73
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,330
Not once by now.

74
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,130
My apologies.

75
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,730
I forgot you grew up among pixies.

76
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,130
I've been narrow-minded.

77
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,409
Your fight against evil

78
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,409
is truly admirable.

79
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,250
But while mortals fear pixies,

80
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,490
pixies too fear mortals.

81
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,330
So there's not much difference.

82
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,170
You still haven't told me

83
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,810
why you argued with Master.

84
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,050
We didn't argue.

85
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,810
You know,

86
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,330
he always beats around the bush,

87
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,890
acting hot and cold sometimes.

88
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,170
I'm pretty sure

89
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,890
he's the immortal I met as a kid.

90
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,090
But he keeps denying it.

91
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,650
He seems

92
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,210
all warm and kind,

93
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,490
but turns frosty

94
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,210
the moment you get close.

95
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,730
Finally, someone gets it!

96
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,490
I only dare drop hints about him—

97
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,450
never say it outright.

98
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,490
Isn't he

99
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,290
like a brick wall?

100
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,650
Bottles up every thought,

101
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,930
makes us play guessing games—

102
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,250
cold as an iceberg, right?

103
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,530
Bailing...

104
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,890
He's always been kind to you.

105
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,730
How can you trash-talk him?

106
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,170
How could you?

107
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,130
What?

108
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,890
Are you for real?

109
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,690
I was just…

110
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,330
agreeing with you!

111
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,850
I can make judgments.

112
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,890
But your words...

113
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,409
did make me furious!

114
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,010
Fine!

115
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,250
Fine, fine!

116
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:56,970
Okay!

117
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,530
My bad.

118
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,370
I shouldn't have said that.

119
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,490
Happy now?

120
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,650
Fine.

121
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,610
Wonder how Lujiu

122
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,010
is doing though.

123
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,730
Relax.

124
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,810
He's cunning.

125
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,130
He'll save his own hide.

126
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,130
That's stereotyping.

127
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,850
Lujiu is actually genuine.

128
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,450
Got an idea!

129
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,090
See? He's fine.

130
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,050
What's this?

131
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,409
This is Life Smoke.

132
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,090
It can track souls.

133
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,370
See these three blazing branches?

134
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,650
Flames this strong mean

135
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,450
he's alive and kicking!

136
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,610
Why not use this earlier?

137
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:54,890
I...

138
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:55,930
I just...

139
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,330
don't get to use charms much!

140
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,130
Enough worrying.

141
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,810
Can we finally get some sleep?

142
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,490
Master!

143
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,330
How's going?

144
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,530
Any updates?

145
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:43,850
Not yet.

146
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,090
Secure the Academy.

147
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,770
I'll search for them.

148
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,730
But your injuries…

149
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,570
Manageable.

150
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,610
If they return,

151
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,570
notify me immediately.

152
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,210
Understood.

153
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,410
Be careful, Master.

154
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,170
[What's wrong?]

155
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,330
[What's going on?]

156
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,730
[They are missing!]

157
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,410
[What?]

158
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,690
[They're gone?]

159
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:20,770
[Search everywhere!]

160
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,650
[Check over there!]

161
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,450
[They're missing!]

162
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,250
What's happening here?

163
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,250
Some are missing.

164
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,370
Master ordered a full search.

165
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,170
Who's missing?

166
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,850
Lujiu,

167
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:28,730
Bailing,

168
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,450
and Hongning.

169
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,170
[Nothing here.]

170
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,410
[Hello?]

171
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,370
By the Floral Deity's power,

172
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,930
summon the Floral Spirit.

173
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,490
[No trace of Hongning,]

174
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,930
[Bailing,]

175
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,610
[or Lujiu.]

176
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,850
Where are you going?

177
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,730
I'll join you.

178
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,650
This is my responsibility.

179
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,730
Stay calm.

180
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,090
I'll handle it.

181
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,130
Don't overthink.

182
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,890
I'm here for Lujiu and Bailing.

183
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,090
Don't slow me down.

184
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:43,690
Excuse me,

185
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,890
how far is Cangwu Academy?

186
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,850
There's a Dragon Abyss ahead.

187
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,170
Circle around it,

188
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,650
take the mountain path upward,

189
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,570
and you'll arrive.

190
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,170
Thanks.

191
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:55,810
Wait.

192
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,490
You seem like a traveler.

193
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,610
That abyss houses

194
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,450
a demonic dragon!

195
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,730
Don't take shortcuts

196
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,930
through it,

197
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,570
make sure to go around!

198
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,650
Demon?

199
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,690
Remember to stay cautious

200
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,050
around strangers.

201
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,850
Don't naively

202
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,370
trust everyone's good.

203
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,330
Demon!

204
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,730
Help!

205
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,650
Why not kill him?

206
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,650
Too messy.

207
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,490
Oh,

208
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,170
do you known that

209
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,250
the camellia pixie became mortal?

210
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,730
She's forgotten you completely.

211
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,130
I'll make her remember.

212
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,890
Remember how to activate

213
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:03,970
the Demon-Binding Curse?

214
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,170
Of course I do.

215
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,610
Vanquish demons,

216
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,130
purge evil spirits—

217
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,530
by Divine Decree.

218
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:20,810
I'm sorry!

219
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,130
Let me help you!

220
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,290
You got the curse right,

221
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,410
but stop aiming at me!

222
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,770
I'm technically demon-kind too!

223
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,490
Sorry! My bad!

224
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,170
Guys,

225
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,570
the demon miasma's cleared.

226
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,330
Time to move out.

227
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,050
Come on!

228
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,330
Hurry up!

229
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,690
Since I'm helping your search,

230
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,730
do you two

231
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,210
have any leads to share?

232
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,170
Last night I heard

233
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,370
you mention

234
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,650
"Lujiu"?

235
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:52,810
Right.

236
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,210
He's fox clan.

237
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:54,930
Fox?

238
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,410
Does he wield Spiritual Flame?

239
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,730
How'd you know?

240
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,170
On my way here,

241
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,450
I saw a scorched stone tablet.

242
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,410
Could that be

243
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,130
a clue left

244
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,410
by Lujiu?

245
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,130
Where's the tablet?

246
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,290
What's carved on it?

247
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,330
"To Dragon Abyss".

248
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,010
Dragon Abyss?

249
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,330
Where's that?

250
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,370
That's a place

251
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,410
every Cangwu disciple knows.

252
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,170
This path leads to Dragon Abyss.

253
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,170
The trip's treacherous.

254
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,610
I'll go alone.

255
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,690
Please search the right path.

256
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,770
If nothing's found,

257
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,130
regroup at the academy.

258
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:41,770
Understood.

259
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,690
Take care.

260
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,250
The demonic aura here's so dense.

261
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,690
It feels amazing.

262
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,250
Baicha,

263
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,810
you've been staring forever.

264
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,890
What exactly are you looking at?

265
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,930
I was figuring out where to enter.

266
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,490
Enter?

267
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,930
Are you insane?

268
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,490
Didn't you hear that?

269
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,250
A demonic dragon lurks below!

270
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,570
This place traps the dragon

271
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,370
'cause below lies a forbidden zone—

272
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,410
the Yin Spring,

273
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,130
requiring demonic force to balance it.

274
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,690
What's the Yin Spring?

275
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,450
Waters that awaken

276
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,810
memories of past lives.

277
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,210
You want her to remember you?

278
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,090
Enough talk.

279
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,370
Follow me down.

280
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,250
But...

281
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,090
I... eh...

282
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,050
I'll just stay here.

283
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,690
I'd rather...

284
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,130
Baicha!

285
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,290
No!

286
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:48,810
Ma'am,

287
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,130
if Lujiu's truly trapped in Dragon Abyss,

288
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,090
this is way beyond

289
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,170
what we can handle.

290
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,890
I'm gonna take her back.

291
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:55,970
We should report to Master.

292
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,490
I'm not leaving!

293
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,770
Stop being stubborn!

294
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,450
If even Lujiu couldn't

295
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,650
handle that dragon,

296
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,290
we'd just be

297
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,450
snack-sized offerings for it!

298
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,050
My pixie-sensing ability

299
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,650
might help.

300
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,450
Besides,

301
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,290
taking me back would

302
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,530
slow you down.

303
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,410
I haven't mastered sword flight yet.

304
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,450
Let Hongning stay.

305
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,930
With me here,

306
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,210
she'll be safe.

307
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,170
Exactly, Bailing.

308
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,810
No worries.

309
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,250
I'll be fine.

310
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,290
Then be careful.

311
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,850
Make sure to stay safe.

312
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,770
If you get hurt,

313
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,570
Master won't let...

314
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,370
Got it.

315
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,890
Take care.

316
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,290
Let's go.

317
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,050
Your Majesty,

318
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,690
here are the restored ancient scrolls.

319
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,210
In antiquity,

320
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,010
Kylin, Phoenix, and Celestial Serpent

321
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,770
each governed a realm,

322
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,330
maintaining cosmic harmony.

323
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,610
Kylin symbolizes auspicious omens.

324
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,970
Your Majesty,

325
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,090
after years of research,

326
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,490
I confirm Kylin's

327
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,130
ancient role as a blessing.

328
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,970
Mortals still craft ornaments

329
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,450
in its likeness.

330
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,450
Were you present during antiquity?

331
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,210
If anything wrong,

332
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,050
please correct me.

333
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,250
Never mind.

334
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,490
How are Jinxiu and Kunlun doing?

335
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:32,890
All good.

336
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,170
Totally.

337
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,810
Though recently,

338
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,410
Sir Kunlun accidentally

339
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,050
shattered Your Majesty's temple

340
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,530
while battling demons.

341
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,690
But no major fallout.

342
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,890
No worries.

343
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,530
The temple caretaker

344
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,490
was mistaken for a demon

345
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,250
and required my intervention.

346
00:16:59,410 --> 00:16:59,930
Drop it.

347
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,050
Forget Kunlun.

348
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,930
His antics tire me.

349
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,290
Update me on Jinxiu.

350
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:07,770
The Celestial Commander?

351
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,170
Forgive my candor...

352
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,730
Since descending to the mortal realm,

353
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,890
he's a junior immortal now.

354
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,490
Embracing mortal habits

355
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,609
is necessary.

356
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,490
But he's

357
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,810
still picky as ever.

358
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,450
He barely eats a thing,

359
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,050
wasting to

360
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,530
skin and bones!

361
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,730
There's more!

362
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,609
He…

363
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,569
You're unusually informed.

364
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,530
I…

365
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,330
I shared drinks with Mt. Cangwu's

366
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,410
local deity a few days back.

367
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,810
Got a bit chatty.

368
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,090
Weren't you tasked with

369
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,250
compiling the chronicles?

370
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,610
I did!

371
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,090
I swear!

372
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,410
But the local deity

373
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:46,850
sent...

374
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,810
Enough.

375
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,210
Your concern is noted,

376
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,130
but

377
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,370
interfere not with their tribulations.

378
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:55,890
Understood.

379
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:56,970
Leave me.

380
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,250
[Do you realize what your actions]

381
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,810
[will cost Jinxiu?]

382
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,130
[You must protect him.]

383
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,410
[With the immortal-demon war looming,]

384
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,450
[how can I?]

385
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,850
[He's protected by the Kylin Covenant!]

386
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,570
[Kylin only protects]

387
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,930
[those of pure celestial blood!]

388
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,370
[Jinxiu must survive!]

389
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:36,810
[This demonic dragon's]

390
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,250
[way tougher than expected.]

391
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,610
[Even lost that toad pixie.]

392
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,610
[I must]

393
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,530
[find Hongning fast.]

394
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,250
[In my weakened state,]

395
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,410
[direct confrontation's unwise.]

396
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,250
Hongning,

397
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,010
ever wonder why

398
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,810
you have this

399
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,170
pixie-sensing gift?

400
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,810
I was born with it.

401
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,490
As a kid, I communicated

402
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,810
with cats and dogs,

403
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,090
freaking everyone out.

404
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,370
Later, I learned

405
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,010
only I could see their true forms.

406
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,650
This ability

407
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,930
might be heaven's gift.

408
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,770
Gift?

409
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,450
Yes.

410
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,010
And with it comes duty

411
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,690
to wield it wisely.

412
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,730
I don't follow.

413
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,130
In centuries of demon-slaying,

414
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,090
I've eliminated

415
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,530
mere hundreds.

416
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,450
If I had your ability,

417
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,050
I could

418
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,370
purge all pixies and demons

419
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,970
from this world!

420
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,170
Ma'am,

421
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,770
to eliminate evil,

422
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,650
you need to base your actions

423
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,850
on what they've done,

424
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,770
not their origins.

425
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,090
Killing pixies or demons

426
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,410
indiscriminately

427
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,250
is blind slaughter.

428
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,570
Ridiculous!

429
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,770
You're human,

430
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,130
yet defend pixies and demons.

431
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,650
Besides, you're hanging around

432
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,730
those pixie disciples.

433
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,930
Cangwu Academy grooms

434
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,810
fine "role models"!

435
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,530
Your Master

436
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,730
is nothing special.

437
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,690
Don't talk about him like that.

438
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,530
We advocate inclusiveness,

439
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,010
unlike you who are narrow-minded.

440
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,370
Do you know

441
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,810
why I travel around

442
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,210
and hunt demons?

443
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,650
How would I know?

444
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,490
For as long as I can remember,

445
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,530
I've kept having the same dream.

446
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,890
In my dream,

447
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,330
I'm exhausted, covered in blood,

448
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,650
in battles with demons.

449
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,450
I kill every one I see,

450
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,970
but there's no end.

451
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:54,890
I think

452
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,890
that's the path Heaven shows me.

453
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,010
Is it really a sign?

454
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,370
Hongning,

455
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,530
sometimes the world

456
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,170
you see in dreams is the only real one.

457
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,690
In my dream,

458
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,530
no matter how many I slay,

459
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,250
I never feel free.

460
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,330
Whenever I feel tired and wanna stop,

461
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,970
there is a voice asking me about

462
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,370
my background,

463
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,930
goals,

464
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,330
and destination.

465
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,050
I need to

466
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,050
ask you something.

467
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,730
Go ahead.

468
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,610
Lujiu's trapped by you, right?

469
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,370
What did you just say?

470
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,730
There's no stele at all.

471
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,410
You tricked me into coming here.

472
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,570
So all your obedience just now

473
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,090
was just an act.

474
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,050
Then tell me,

475
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,850
why do you think I brought you here?

476
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,930
You wanted to confirm something.

477
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,490
I'll just give you the answer.

478
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,930
You're a demon, not an immortal.

479
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:07,690
Shut up!

480
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:08,890
Don't think

481
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,210
I won't deal with you just 'cause

482
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,290
you're from Cangwu Academy.

483
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,450
But that's the truth.

484
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,810
I knew what you were

485
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,970
the moment I saw you.

486
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,810
You're the demon that rabbit spirit

487
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,570
was talking about.

488
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,610
[A demon!]

489
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,210
[Over there!]

490
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,170
No!

491
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,010
I'm not a demon!

492
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:27,930
You...

493
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,410
You side with demons

494
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,490
and defend them.

495
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,410
I'm just a mortal girl.

496
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,370
Don't you think you sound ridiculous?

497
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,130
You really think you can wait

498
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,770
for your master to save you?

499
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,170
I'll capture you now.

500
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,050
And kill Bailing then.

501
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,290
You...

502
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,690
What can you get from catching me?

503
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,050
You gonna rip out my eyes

504
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,410
so you can see what you really are?

505
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,730
Maybe to others

506
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,850
you're a fairy from the North Sea,

507
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,370
but to me,

508
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,690
you're just a self-deceiving demon

509
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,930
that can't tell right from wrong.

510
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,090
Enough! Shut up!

511
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,130
Master.

512
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,330
I thought

513
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,570
I was hallucinating.

514
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,450
It's really you.

515
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:29,970
Where are we?

516
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,890
This is the Dragon Abyss.

517
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,050
You've gone for so long.

518
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,290
What happened?

519
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,050
Long story.

520
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,690
We heard Lujiu was being held here,

521
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,050
so we followed the trail.

522
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,690
We then ran into Master Dongxuan.

523
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,370
Where's Bailing?

524
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,250
He went back to Cangwu to find you.

525
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,250
This is the Sorrow Devouring Tree.

526
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,010
It feeds on pain,

527
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,290
drains your spirit,

528
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,290
and lures you into eating its fruit.

529
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,690
Once you do, you become part of it.

530
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,690
No, it's the Mind Bending Sound.

531
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,530
Don't listen to it!

532
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,050
Recite the Serenity Litany.

533
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,850
Serenity Litany?

534
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,170
Still your heart, curb your desires.

535
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,090
Master!

536
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,490
Are you okay?

537
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,050
Recite the litany too.

538
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,530
Still your heart, curb your desires.

539
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,290
Master!

540
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,050
As long as I eat the fruit,

541
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,970
I can finally

542
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,690
be free from the endless pain.

543
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,490
I don't know

544
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,730
how to face the pain anymore.

545
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,690
Master,

546
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,290
don't run from it.

547
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,810
The only way out

548
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,330
is to face it.

549
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,490
Master!

550
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,370
You're awake?

551
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,650
This place is dangerous.

552
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,730
The Tree won't give up

553
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,010
until it feeds on our pain.

554
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:45,930
We need to leave now.

555
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,010
Let's go.

556
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:47,610
Go.

557
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,730
What are you doing here?

558
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,050
I should be asking you that.

559
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,530
Hongning and I were looking for Lujiu.

560
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,250
There are some leads.

561
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,410
I planned to return to report.

562
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,610
But I felt something was off on the way,

563
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,210
so I came back for Hongning.

564
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,490
But she's missing too.

565
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,370
Don't tell me

566
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,690
you're here for Lujiu too?

567
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,770
Don't waste my time.

568
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,730
Tell me,

569
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,210
what exactly is going on between you two?

570
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,490
This is what you care about

571
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,370
right now?

572
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,530
Don't walk away from me!

573
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,410
What's your relationship with Lujiu?

574
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,730
Answer me.

575
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,970
C'mon.

576
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,210
You filthy demon,

577
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,530
get out now!

578
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,290
Hold on!

579
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:56,930
He's not a demon.

580
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,170
Then what is he?

581
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,410
My shadow.

582
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,490
Shadow?

583
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,170
Qijing,

584
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,210
are you okay?

585
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,450
Don't ever leave me again.

586
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,890
Are you done yet?

587
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,690
Tell me, who the hell are you?

588
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,130
Shadow? Seriously?

589
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:25,970
Under the sunlight,

590
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,090
prove it to me.

591
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:27,770
Show me.

592
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:29,570
Come on.

593
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,410
Where is the shadow?

594
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,050
You're hurt.

595
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,050
It's not safe to show yourself.

596
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,450
Stay hidden for now.

597
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,370
Don't worry.

598
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,610
He won't hurt me.

599
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,930
That's impossible.

600
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,610
Wait.

601
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,010
Shadows don't have bodies.

602
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,370
They can't cultivate.

603
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,050
With 1,000 years of immortal power,

604
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,690
a shadow can take form.

605
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,090
1,000 years?

606
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,770
Are you actually an immortal?

607
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:14,890
10,000 years ago,

608
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,170
the Celestial Realm

609
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,810
created the Infernal Scroll

610
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,290
to imprison the evil dragon

611
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,690
in this abyss.

612
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:27,770
Master,

613
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,610
you won't admit

614
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,850
you're the immortal I met as a child

615
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,250
'cause that memory still hurts?

616
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,010
Let's get out of here first.

617
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,250
So are we in the scroll now?

618
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:42,890
The dragon

619
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,890
refused to

620
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,050
the abyss.

621
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,570
And no one could subdue it.

622
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:48,970
So it

623
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,290
went into the pool created by the scroll.

624
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,290
That's where we are now.

625
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:54,850
I see.

626
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,650
That Mind Bending Sound

627
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,450
clearly got inside your head.

628
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,450
And you didn't know the Serenity Litany.

629
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,530
How were you fine?

630
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,290
Maybe because

631
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,170
I don't have painful memories.

632
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,330
You don't have?

633
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,650
I did.

634
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,650
But those painful memories

635
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,170
can turn into happy ones

636
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,130
thanks to the people around me.

637
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,730
Is that

638
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,450
achievable?

639
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,530
Of course.

640
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,650
As an immortal,

641
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,410
you should know better than me.

642
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,330
We'll all encounter

643
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,970
many difficulties.

644
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,730
But if we hold on to faith,

645
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,610
they'll definitely

646
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,210
turn out well.

647
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:34,930
It's the only way

648
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,250
not to be consumed by pain.

649
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,090
Let's go.

650
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,450
Can you stop staring at me?

651
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,090
I've never seen a fairy before.

652
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,610
Are you really an immortal?

653
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,410
So what if I am?

654
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,890
Then you came to the mortal world to...

655
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,170
What do you know?

656
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,170
To fall

657
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,810
in love with me.

658
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:23,650
Shut up.

659
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:27,890
Well...

660
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,050
Fairy lady,

661
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:30,970
there might've been

662
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,730
a misunderstanding between us.

663
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,730
When you go back, don't hold it against me.

664
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,170
You tormented

665
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,970
and humiliated me.

666
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,090
All will come back as divine punishment.

667
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:05,970
Be careful.

668
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,170
My joy is gone.

669
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,490
I lost it.

670
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:15,770
Is it

671
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,970
the key to this gate?

672
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,610
My joy is gone.

673
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,970
I lost it.

674
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,610
It's okay. No worries.

675
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,930
If you lost your joy,

676
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,490
I'll give you mine.

677
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,090
Could you let us through?

678
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:43,690
Hongning,

679
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,610
are you alright?

680
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:47,810
I'm fine, Master.

681
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:48,850
Just get through the gate.

682
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:49,810
Make a funny face

683
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,450
like I did.

684
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:52,570
Nonsense.

685
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,130
Master,

686
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,170
is there...

687
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,210
anything that makes you happy?

688
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,370
Just

689
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,970
share.

690
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,330
In the Three Realms,

691
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,210
nothing or no one

692
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,130
has ever made you happy?

693
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,570
My joy is gone.

694
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,410
I lost it.

695
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,650
You're the child I once was.

696
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:32,570
How rude.

697
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,650
I'm the Floral Deity of Celestial Realm.

698
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,970
After all these years,

699
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,090
I'm reduced to a low-ranked immortal.

700
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,570
Did you drive

701
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,290
Father and Mother mad?

702
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,170
Such arrogance

703
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,610
for someone so young.

704
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,010
After so many years,

705
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,930
you've become weak.

706
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,970
Only the weak

707
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,810
judge others at will.

708
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,930
This is self-reflection,

709
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,290
not judging others.

710
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,090
Now you admit you're me.

711
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,930
When I grew up,

712
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,730
did Mother ever go see

713
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,450
the golden peony bloom?

714
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,130
When it first bloomed,

715
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,010
all I wanted was for her to see it.

716
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,610
I waited from early morning till night.

717
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,610
She said she'd go

718
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,770
another time.

719
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,610
But at the second, the third,

720
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,530
and even the 17th blooming,

721
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,850
she never showed up once.

722
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,250
When I got older,

723
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,929
did she ever go see?

724
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,530
[Sir, congratulations.]

725
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,090
[The 81st golden peony has bloomed.]

726
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:36,969
[And you've]

727
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,090
[ascended as Floral Deity.]

728
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,530
[- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.]

729
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,290
[Has Mother...]

730
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,330
[A few days ago,]

731
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,170
[I told Her Royal Highness about this.]

732
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,090
[But she's been busy overseeing]

733
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,449
[Sir Kunlun's cultivation,]

734
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,770
[so she got delayed.]

735
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,330
[I'm sure she'll]

736
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,370
[be here soon.]

737
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,570
Of course she did.

738
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,210
She often came to see the golden peonies.

739
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,490
When the 81st bloomed,

740
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,170
she even arrived early

741
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,570
to celebrate

742
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,130
my ascension.

743
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,290
I knew it.

744
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,250
Everyone said she loved me more

745
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,490
and was stricter with Kunlun.

746
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,370
But I always felt

747
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,170
she didn't truly care about me.

748
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,010
Guess I was just being petty.

749
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,210
I misunderstood her.

750
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,690
You must listen to

751
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,010
Father and Master.

752
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,370
Fulfill your duty as the Celestial Commander.

753
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,090
But I still can't let you through.

754
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,170
That's not your happiest moment.

755
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,210
Master,

756
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,570
all this time,

757
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,930
you've never come across

758
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,690
anything that made you feel

759
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,170
happy or at ease?

760
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,970
I remember a long time ago,

761
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,010
a camellia pixie

762
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,050
accidentally went to

763
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,250
the Floralia Palace in the Celestial Realm.

764
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,490
She wanted to drink wine,

765
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,650
but she couldn't hold her liquor.

766
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,330
One time

767
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,330
she got drunk and

768
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,010
turned back into a camellia.

769
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,370
A fairy walking by

770
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,130
thought she's tea

771
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,490
and brewed.

772
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,010
When immortals sipped the tea,

773
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,290
she popped out

774
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,970
of the teacup with a splash.

775
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,690
Later,

776
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,370
she stumbled into the Floral Scroll.

777
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,690
To get out, she was supposed to

778
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,770
count every petal.

779
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,290
But she

780
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,450
just burned

781
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,970
all the flowers.

782
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,130
[So Master pushed me away]

783
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,410
[because of that camellia pixie?]

784
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,650
And once,

785
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,570
she learnt etiquette in the Floralia Palace

786
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,690
and drew her eyebrows.

787
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,410
Then,

788
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,610
she drew one

789
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,450
higher and thicker

790
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,210
than the other.

791
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:14,930
Master,

792
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:15,770
it's fine now.

793
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,850
But this mechanism

794
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,210
is quite interesting.

795
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,170
How so?

796
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,050
It seems to

797
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,410
want you

798
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,250
to feel happy.

799
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:35,730
Exactly.

800
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,690
But

801
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:38,810
I didn't expect

802
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,210
what makes you happy

803
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,450
to be such a simple thing.

804
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,650
No wonder you planted a

805
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,210
red camellia tree in your backyard

806
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,410
and take such good care of it.

807
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,530
Master,

808
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,170
are those

809
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,090
that truly make you happy?

810
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:02,930
Let's go.

811
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:29,890
Hongning?

812
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:31,330
Hongning?

813
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,210
Where am I?

814
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:43,690
Master?

815
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,250
Master?

816
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:37,530
Master.

817
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:38,410
Master!

818
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,210
Don't... call me that!

819
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,530
I don't even know you.

820
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:42,730
Master,

821
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,610
I've waited so long.

822
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,930
You finally came for me.

823
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,490
Who are you?

824
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,690
I don't even know you.

825
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:52,930
Stop following me!

826
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:54,970
Master,

827
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,290
I'm the Black Serpent.

828
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:00,930
Master,

829
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,570
you've forgotten me?

830
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,850
I still remember your scent.

831
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:12,210
Stop!

832
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,290
You are my master.

833
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,130
Come on, let's go home.

834
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,130
Home? What home?

835
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:17,930
Master,

836
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,730
I'm your Black Serpent.

837
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,210
You...

838
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,370
Don't cry.

839
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,570
You really don't remember me?

840
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:26,850
I...

841
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,090
It's all right

842
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,610
even if you forgot everything

843
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,610
about me.

844
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,810
This is the Memory Spring.

845
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,210
Drink some,

846
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,210
and you'll remember everything.

847
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,130
You already ate the fruit of pain

848
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,330
and passed through the gate.

849
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,050
So only happy memories remain.

850
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,010
But if you drink the water,

851
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,810
every memory

852
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,090
will return.

853
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:50,690
Then you can take me

854
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,210
and Green Serpent home.

855
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:15,890
Hongning!

856
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:27,650
Are you all right?

857
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,410
[Master!]

858
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:53,770
[Master!]

859
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,530
[Remember to drink the water!]

860
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,530
Why do you call her Master?

861
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,690
My master

862
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,490
is the ruler of our clan.

863
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,610
She's the Demon King.

864
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,490
I've waited

865
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,370
so long for her return.

866
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:31,490
Master,

867
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,970
I was starting to forget the past.

868
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:38,810
[Hongning]

869
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,490
[is the Demon King?]
