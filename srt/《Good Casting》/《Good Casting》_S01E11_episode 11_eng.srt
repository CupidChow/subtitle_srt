1
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:39,650


2
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,250
Wait a minute.

3
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,450
This needs to be recycled so it must be separated.

4
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,050
I'm sure I left it here.

5
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,450
I even checked it last night.

6
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,250
That secretary didn't have it. Who was it?

7
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,350
What kind of bastard was it?!

8
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,950
Who are you?!

9
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,450
Am I not I amazing?

10
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,850
What is this?

11
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,050
What? Why?

12
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,050
Why is it blank?

13
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,450
Check it meticulously. There could be something hidden.

14
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,450
That bastard, Division Director Tak.

15
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,050
He just toyed with us.

16
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,450
I don't understand.

17
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,050
There's no reason to hide a blank ledger so carefully.

18
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,450
I'm sure there something in it.

19
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,650
What bullshit is there?

20
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,850
I'm going to kill that Division Director Tak and Executive Director Myeong.

21
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,850
I'm going to completely...

22
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,650
Hold on.

23
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,650
I don't think it was written with a regular pen.

24
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,950
Pen?

25
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,850
That's right. There was an ink pen.

26
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,050
I need a lighter.

27
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,850
I thought you quit?

28
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,150
Just in case there's a situation.

29
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,250
I was prepared, meticulously, like a pro.

30
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,950
What is he saying?

31
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,650
Wait. Wait. Don't you think burning this would be going too far?

32
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,250
If you use cobalt chloride ink, you can't see the writing.

33
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,150
But when you shine a flame and raise the temperature,

34
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,850
- I see it. 
 - Whoa.

35
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,850
- You're seriously... 
 - Oh!

36
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,450
Ye Eun!

37
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,850
I gave it to her. I did.

38
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,550
 Just tell me what your teammates are doing. 

39
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,250
 Agent Baek... 

40
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,650
 will be... 

41
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,550
 stealing the ledger tomorrow. 

42
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,250
 When the ledger is in your hands, bring it over. 

43
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,350
 Do whatever it takes. 

44
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,450
 Top Secret - Code Name 'Good Casting' 

45
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,850
 Good Casting  

46
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,050
  Episode 11  

47
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,550
You did well.

48
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,650
It's just an operation.

49
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,950
Don't let your emotions take you over.

50
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,450
What did I do?

51
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,950
You feel sorry for Yoon Seok Ho.

52
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,450
Am I an AI?

53
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,450
Some people may be able to control their emotions like they cut radish with a knife but that's not the case for normal people.

54
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,450
And Seok Ho... He trusted me,

55
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,050
but I used that to my advantage.

56
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,250
What's worse is that I can't even say sorry and must disappear once the operation is over.

57
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,650
Don't you know that's your share of burden?

58
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,650
I'll take care of my own emotions,

59
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,750
so mind your own business.

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,550
 Il Gwang HiTech 

61
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,150
You're here. CEO.

62
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,950
What happened to your hand?

63
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,850
I got a slight cut.

64
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,050
I'm fine though.

65
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,050
It doesn't look like a slight cut.

66
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,450
Slight...

67
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,450
Yesterday, did you...

68
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,050
Good morning, CEO.

69
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,050
Wait a minute. What's wrong with your face?

70
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,650
I fell while drinking.

71
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,550
Follow me in.

72
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,450
What happened?

73
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,750
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,250
I wasn't able to bring Executive Director Myeong's ledger.

75
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,850
Was I asking about the ledger?

76
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,850
What happened for you to get that injury on your face?

77
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,150
Actually, I wasn't the only one in Executive Director Myeong's office.

78
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,850
Another person? Who?

79
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,250
I don't know.

80
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,250
Her face was covered so I couldn't see.

81
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,850
Did you two get caught together?

82
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,650
I also don't know.

83
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,680
It's still a relief that you didn't get too hurt.

84
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,650
I mean, you can't even fight...

85
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,030
  He wasn't an average fighter... 

86
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,450
  If he could go against you, he's not just average.  

87
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,350
 He must be a great master. 

88
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,650
 As soon as Ye Eun gains access to the NIS Security Network,  

89
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,750
 take a look at the CCTVs near Executive Director Myeong's office. 

90
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,050
Didn't you leave work early yesterday?

91
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,250
How did you get hurt?

92
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,950
I also fell while drinking.

93
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,050
You must be careful of (soju) bombs.

94
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,650
You should stick with one drink. If you start mixing drinks, you'll find yourself

95
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,250
thinking that the floor is the ceiling and the ceiling is the floor.

96
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,250
Exactly. Exactly.

97
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,850
We also must careful whenever we fall.

98
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,350
But still, in alcohol, bombs taste the best.

99
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,650
You sure know how to drink.

100
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,650
Of course. You should buy me a drink.

101
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,450
Something delicious. A mixed drink.

102
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,650
Okay! When I get my paycheck next month, I'll call the security team and we can go all out!

103
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,350
Sounds great!

104
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,250
It's me. Look up Secretary Byeon.

105
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,450
Secretary Byeon isn't on the mission list. Why do you want me to look him up?

106
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,650
Stop talking and look him up soon. Don't tell anyone.

107
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,150
You're dead if you tell anyone.

108
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,750
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

109
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,650
It's me. I need a background check.

110
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,250
Her name is Baek Jang Mi. It could be an alias.

111
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,050
I'll send you her personal details so be quick. Yeah,

112
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,450
Oh my goodness.

113
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,650
What a surprise.

114
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,250
Go first.

115
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,150
Should I?

116
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,550
Wait.

117
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,850
You got hurt while drinking?

118
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,950
Yes.

119
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,150
While you're on your way, leave this on my desk.

120
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,150
Yes.

121
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,450
 As expected. I was right. 

122
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,550
 I'm certain. 

123
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,710
What is this? You've been doing that since a while back. Why are you taking peeks?

124
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,650
Do you think I'm peeking at you because I have nothing better to peek at?

125
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,650
I also have a preference.

126
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,250
I'll respect your preference so just tell me what it is.

127
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,760
Honestly...

128
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,050
I have some personal things to do this afternoon so I think I'll have to leave early.

129
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,850
Do as you wish.

130
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,580
 What happened for you to get that injury on your face? 

131
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,400
 Actually, I wasn't the only one in Executive Director Myeong's office. 

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,890
 I should rather report it to the NIS. 

133
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,260
 Who knows. She could be an industrial spy. 

134
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,480
Yes.

135
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,900
 So, where's the ledger? 

136
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,180
I have it.

137
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,610
 Bring it right now. 

138
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,570
My teammates might suspect me for keeping it myself.

139
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,470
So I don't have it with me right now.

140
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,410
 You don't want to stay with your daughter? 

141
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,940
I know where it is, though.

142
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,150
 I will give you an hour. 

143
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,890
It's impossible to bring the ledger in an hour!

144
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,850
 You didn't forget your promise, right? 

145
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,900
 There won't be another chance after tonight. 

146
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,540
 Ssak Ssak Clean 

147
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm bringing it right now.

148
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,460
You are sure there was no one on your tail?

149
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,950
Yes, sir, I'm sure there was no one.

150
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,110
Good work. I thought I was sweeping the yard to kill the bugs,

151
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,410
but I picked up some coins I didn't expect to find.

152
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,440
- What is it?
 - Before I leave, I wanted to give you a proper goodbye.

153
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,240
You can go now.

154
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,150
Wait a second. We need to talk, don't we?

155
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,200
What are you doing?

156
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,940
When I went to the disciplinary committee, the atmosphere seemed so desolate.

157
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,550
I'm afraid you will be lonely by yourself, so I'm sending this guy with you.

158
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,840
Are you nuts, you punk?

159
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,680
You are the one who's nuts.

160
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,430
 What should I do now? 

161
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,380
 I'm so worried So Hee might be in danger, 

162
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,920
 but I can't betray our team. 

163
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,510
 Who else knows that you live with So Hee? 

164
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:31,990
 I haven't kept in touch with my family, so only the teammates know about it. 

165
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,600
 Contact him and spill our team's information. 

166
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,590
 What if you get in trouble? 

167
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,440
 We should track these people and find them, shouldn't we? 

168
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,120
Take him.

169
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,750
How could you do this?

170
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,660
For something like this.

171
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,330
To get this mere ledger, you disbanded our team?

172
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,710
I should've just gotten rid of all you trash.

173
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,370
I should've thrown you away a long time ago.

174
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,990
I pitied you. I felt bad for you.

175
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,880
So I kept you out of humanity, but you dare to stab me in the back?

176
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,420
Do you think you can complete your mission just because you got rid of me?

177
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,180
Do you think making me the bad person and locking me up will solve everything?

178
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,430
You're being pathetic. Let's just leave.

179
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:40,740
How dare you touch me? I'm not someone who you little dimwits can arrest.

180
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,100
Leave. Go now! Get lost!

181
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,090
What do you mean, get lost, you son of a b***h.

182
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,240
Let go of me. Let me go! Let me go.

183
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,210
What are you doing? Hold her tightly.

184
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,540
Let me go. Let go!

185
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,480
How much money did you make, you jackass!

186
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,920
While you were sticking money into your belly, I almost ended up getting unemployment benefits.

187
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,590
Unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits, darn it, you SOB.

188
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:14,220
Darn it. What are you looking at?

189
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,890
I can't believe that the director was the traitor.

190
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,450
How could he blackmail me using So Hee?

191
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:41,390
Ah, I'm pissed. Don't we have something stronger than this?

192
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,570
What's more problematic is that he might not be the only one behind this.

193
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,810
He won't tell us readily, right? Ever?

194
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:06,850
We should dig in till the end. Let's see how far we can reach.

195
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,800
Just confess of your own will.

196
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,530
You were caught red-handed. Don't make a fool of yourself with stupid excuses.

197
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,200
I told you already. I just made a move after a tip by an anonymous informant.

198
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,400
So, are you saying you never blackmailed Im Ye Eun?

199
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
Why?

200
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:46,880
You must have found nothing after going through everything, from my office ceiling to my car seats?

201
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,930
How are you going to jail me without any evidence?

202
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,510
Right. This was something I didn't even want to think about.

203
00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:00,880
That there is a traitor within our own community. After we caught you, I still couldn't believe it.

204
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,330
But, seeing how shameless and brazen you are,

205
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,800
I have reasonable doubt that you could be Michael after all.

206
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,810
Or perhaps you just want to believe that I'm Michael.

207
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,400
Do you have evidence that I kidnapped So Hee and blackmailed Im Ye Eun?

208
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,870
Is there any evidence in Executive Director Myeong's account book that I got dirty money?

209
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,120
Talk to me when you have evidence! Don't you dare to just feel me out!

210
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,430
Okay. I will bring evidence.

211
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,830
Right. You told me once.

212
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:47,780
An illegal investigation based on reasonable doubt is legal.

213
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,760
Yes, Teacher, hello. I apologize I haven't visited you yet.

214
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,790
Pardon? No way.

215
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:11,570
I gave Joo Hyeon the money to make a payment last week.

216
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,910
Yes, yes.

217
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,340
I see. Yes.

218
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,870
Yes, bye.

219
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,990
What happened? Did he tell you anything?

220
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,350
Of course not.

221
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,660
That bastard, seriously...

222
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,100
What are you going to do?

223
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,560
That crazy bastard.

224
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,450
How dare he use a daughter to blackmail a mother?

225
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,770
He's not human!

226
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,400
First, we need to steal that video from Division Director Tak.

227
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,800
And then we can think about catching Michael or putting Director Seo in jail.

228
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,030
Everything will be fine once we have that video in our hands.

229
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,000
Darn it.

230
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,650
Nothing stood out from our investigation on Baek Jang Mi.

231
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,250
Are you sure?

232
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,850
Yes, unless she deleted records.

233
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,250
What do you mean?

234
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,650
Typically, Korean citizens in their 20s

235
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,050
would have at least one record, but she's  too clean.

236
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,750
That might not be the case.

237
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,450
What else could it be?

238
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,850
If this identity isn't real, she may not have existed in the first place.

239
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,650
  Name (in Korean): Baek Jang Mi  

240
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,650
  I put the dietary supplements that your fans sent in the fridge.  

241
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,050
  Be sure to eat them.  

242
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:14,050
  The porridge could've spoiled so be sure to heat it up before you eat it.  

243
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,950
  You know how to use the induction cooktop, right?  

244
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,450
  I made you the spicy pork that you like,  

245
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,050
  so don't skip meals  

246
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,450
  and be sure to eat.  

247
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,650
Did I ask you to prepare me food?

248
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,050
Who said I was hungry!

249
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,350
As if I would starve to death without you.

250
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,250
Who is she to pity me?

251
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,250
Darn her! She's just an intern who could get fired after bending over backwards for her job.

252
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,550
Who does she think I am?

253
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,350
  You're a strong and brave person.  

254
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,450
  You have all these people who are cheering you on.  

255
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,440
  I'm also waiting for you for you to get back on your feet.  

256
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:17,050
♫   Should we go on a short vacation? Should we take a walk in the park?   ♫

257
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:22,250
♫   I'm happy thinking of what we should do   ♫

258
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:27,250
♫   I picked out a pretty outfit and put on a no-makeup look   ♫ 
      

259
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,050
♫  Thinking of how else  ♫

260
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,850
♫  I can look good for you  ♫

261
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,450
It's because of the fine dust

262
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,750
and my dry eye syndrome.

263
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,550
Damn all this fine dust.

264
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,050
Please go away,

265
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,250
you stupid fine dust!

266
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,650
  Personal Records  

267
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,050
  Cellphone number: 010-398-5515 / Fax number: - /  Yeonji Apartment Building 105 #502, Gangseo District, Seoul  

268
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,550
Let's follow her.

269
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,950
  NIS 
 National Intelligence Service Korea  

270
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,050
It worked.

271
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,650
  Date range: 2016  

272
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,950
  Investigation on the failure to capture the corporate spy Michael and death of an agent.  

273
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,950
  Agent Kwon Min Seok was killed during the mission.  

274
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:30,950
  - It is true that Kwon Min Seok discovered Michael at the garage entrance first and was shot by Michael.   
   - After Kwon Min Seok was shot, Baek Chan Mi went after Michael instead of providing first aid to Kwon Min Seok. 

275
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,650
Team Leader Baek Chan Mi?

276
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,650
 Did you act as some kind of whistleblower? 

277
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,050
 Just like three years ago? 

278
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:01,350
 Record of Statement 

279
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,050

281

289
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,650
 Record of Statement 

290
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:59,050
Because Baek Chan Mi was about to be exposed as a traitor,

291
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,050
she threw Kwon Min Seok at Michael like prey

292
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,250
and left by herself.

293
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,150
What else would explain why Michael shot Kwon Min Seok, who was in disguise,

294
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,050
instead of Team Leader Baek?

295
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:17,650
It's because both Michael and Baek Chan Mi were in on it.

296
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,450
I can't believe it.

297
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,650
How could Sunbae Chan Mi...

298
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,650
Why?

299
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,350
  1. Target: Michael Lee (alias) / 2. Identity: International Corporate Spy / 3. Age: Mid-to-late 40s / 4. Gender: Presumed to be male / 5. Korean American  

300
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,250
  File on Yoon Seok Ho  

301
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,350
  Personal Details  

302
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,550
- Baek Chan Mi. 
 - Yes?

303
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,350
I don't know if I should say it's good to see you again,

304
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,980
or if I should be angry about why you deceived me.

305
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,240
Why aren't you saying anything?

306
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,290
You don't even have an excuse?

307
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,650
You know I'm not good at coming up with excuses.

308
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,250
You can't come up with an excuse,

309
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,350
but you can lie unbelievably well.

310
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,790
You just don't want to come up with any excuses.

311
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,380
Why did you lie, though?

312
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,010
Baek Jang Mi, twenty-nine years old, graduated from Yeonseo International University.

313
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,560
Why would you lie about that?

314
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,420
Seok Ho...

315
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,500
If you're going to lie again, just don't say anything.

316
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,560
I'm sorry.

317
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,110
I had a circumstance.

318
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,100
Circumstance? What kind of circumstance was it

319
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:18,150
that made you lie about your name, age, and even your identity and get hired as my secretary?

320
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,900
You were planning on lying until the end, weren't you?

321
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,180
I didn't know it was you at first, either.

322
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,300
You came in not knowing it was me and then you found out.

323
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,610
So you were slightly sorry?

324
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,760
Or, knowing that I still missed you, you thought this was for the best?

325
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,660
Let's calm down first.

326
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,960
Are you an industrial spy?

327
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,960
It's nothing like that.

328
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,320
No. The more I think about it, I think I'm right. It's the only explanation.

329
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,190
I said it's nothing like that!

330
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,180
You think you have the right to yell at me right now?

331
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,050
You're not giving me any time to apologize.

332
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,980
Is this the right attitude of someone who's asking for forgiveness?

333
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,800
You're leaving? You're just going to walk away right now?

334
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,190
Hold on, you've had plenty of chances to tell me.

335
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,000
Why didn't you say anything until after you got caught?

336
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,720
Or were you planning on not saying anything at all?

337
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,620
Were you...planning on leaving without saying anything to me like before?

338
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,440
I felt sorry...

339
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,800
because I was able to move on and live well, but you weren't able to!

340
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,300
Your father's passing and you getting divorced,

341
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:39,400
I didn't want to hurt you more on top of all your pain.

342
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,640
But I found out too late

343
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:56,860
that ultimately, I will be the one who causes you the most pain.

346
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,900
Where were you? Why aren't you saying anything?

347
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,460
Why? Stop!

348
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,010
What is this? Hm?

349
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,590
 Christmas Concert 

350
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,830
Where did you get the money to buy this?

351
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:27,540
How did you buy something this expensive?

352
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,480
I bought it with money that Dad gave me.

353
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,780
I already asked him.

354
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,160
You used the money for your lessons, didn't you?

355
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,410
Whether I used that money or not,

356
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,760
whether I go to prep or not, what does it matter to you?

357
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,130
You never paid attention to me before, so why are you suddenly making a big deal?!

358
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,380
How could you say I've never paid attention to you!

359
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,630
What class am I in? What's my class number?

360
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:05,260
Last week, I asked you to sign my report card, but you just left it on the table and left, didn't you.

361
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,510
That's...That's because I've been so busy with work—

362
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,410
Mom, you are really funny.

363
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,190
Just do what you've always been doing!

364
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,990
You think I don't know?

365
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,130
What do you know?

366
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:26,600
I know you've been hanging out with the wrong crowd, putting on makeup and getting into fights!

367
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,270
How could you look at me so defiantly?

368
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:35,370
Oh! Hold on! Let's not do that.

369
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,820
- How dare you look at your mom shamelessly?! 
 - This isn't right.

You no longer have to come into work.

387
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,280
Is this the CEO's decision?

388
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,940
Why are you curious?

389
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,570
Did you know?

390
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,910
The CEO laughed for the first time in three years after you joined.

391
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,940
It's regretful that you pretended all this time knowing the truth.

Later. Later.

Are you out of your mind?!

398
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,250
Why didn't you bring back the contract that needed to be signed by Kang Woo Won?

399
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:32,210
Did she just blow me off?

 Answer: Yes, I am Seo Gook Hwan.  

410
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,820
Is... this true?

411
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,810
What do you want to know?

412
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:08,360
Do you want to know the facts or the truth?

413
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,770
Sunbae...

414
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:17,630
Did you really kill Kwon Min Seok?

415
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,380
I killed him.

416
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,400
You already knew?

417
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,990
You knew Im Ye Eun and Kwon Min Seok were dating, and that he's So Hee's father?

418
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,640
I only learned it recently, too.

419
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,100
You should've told Chan Mi as soon as you found out!

420
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,310
This is between them! It's nothing we should get in the middle of.

421
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,320
Do you not know Chan Mi's current situation?

422
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,960
I feel so bad and worried that I can't watch anymore.

423
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,220
But what should I do?

424
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,500
If I could, I would take the heat myself.

425
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,370
What...

426
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,870
What did you say?

427
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:16,760
I... killed him.

428
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,740
So... Sunbae,

429
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:30,640
you caused Oppa's death?

430
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,680
I know you well, Sunbae.

431
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,300
I know what kind of person you are, yet you're telling me to believe your lie?

432
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,610
Believe it. He died because of me.

433
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,460
Why are you being like this?

434
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,160
Don't do this, Sunbae. Don't do this to me.

435
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,040
Do you want to know the truth about my betrayal?

436
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,970
If I deny it, will you believe me?

437
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:06,400
You probably read this in the testimony, but I disobeyed orders

438
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,300
and acted with arrogance which got Min Seok killed.

439
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,260
This is all true.

440
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,570
Please stop.

441
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,650
It wasn't enough for me to put my teammates in danger—

442
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,860
Stop, please.

443
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,520
I lost the killer like a dumbass.

444
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,910
This is the truth.

445
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,600
Do you want to know anything else?

446
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,460
Please stop, I said.

447
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,340
I can give it back to you now.

448
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:02,000
I was planning on giving this to you earlier, but I decided to wait until we caught the killer.

449
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,530
To be honest, having to hand you this myself,

450
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,630
I didn't feel brave enough.

451
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,550
I never slept with peace of mind while wearing this,

452
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:30,340
so I thought taking it off would make me feel lighter and relieved.

453
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:36,190
But I can't explain why my heart still feels heavy.

454
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:39,940
You made it hard for me to hate you.

455
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:44,200
How is this fair?

456
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,640
What should I do? What do you want me to do?

457
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,410
I'm sorry.

458
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,480
I am really sorry.

♫  All the nights I dreamed of you  ♫

460
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:49,600
♫  And the mornings I shed ecstatic tears  ♫

461
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,340
♫  Went by like the wind,  ♫

462
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,780
♫  And those days become myself  ♫

463
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,380
♫  Once every moment has piled up one upon another  ♫

464
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:12,040
♫  And the fallen leaves have landed, 
When comes the time I try to walk again  ♫

465
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:18,880
♫  I hope I can smile beautifully.  ♫

466
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:29,520
♫  That snowy afternoon  ♫

467
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,500
♫  And that evening sunset,  ♫

468
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,450
♫  In every corner of my chest  ♫

469
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:43,280
♫  I kept them densely enclosed.  ♫

470
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,510
♫  The day I suffered from being left alone  ♫

471
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,130
 You should be careful.  
♫  And that day I writhed in my dreams  ♫

472
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,310
 A woman should not have any scars on her body. 
 ♫  And that day I writhed in my dreams  ♫

473
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:59,370
♫  They go by, same as always  ♫

474
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:04,170
♫  And those days remain  ♫

475
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,380
♫  in me  ♫

476
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,930
Why did you do that?

477
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,850
Why?

478
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,140
Why did you die instead of Sunbae Chan Mi?

479
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,810
You knew I was waiting for you.

480
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:16,670
Our So Hee... you knew she would miss her dad.

481
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,840
How could you do that?

482
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:34,280
Do you know how happy I was that day after I received your text?

483
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,630
How much...

484
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,880
How long I was waiting

485
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,450
for you to come.

486
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,250
Just waiting.

487
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:54,430
I didn't know that would be your last text message to me,

488
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:57,430
and I didn't even get to respond.

489
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,420
If I'd known,

490
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,640
if I'd known, I would've texted you back right away.

491
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:13,500
What do I do now?

492
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,280
I know Sunbae Chan Mi is innocent,

493
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,130
but I can't keep myself from hating her.

494
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,670
It's all because of you.

495
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,570
It's because of you, Oppa.

496
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,740
Why don't you answer your phone these days? Making me all worried.

497
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:49,760
You don't have to worry about me. Is there nothing you can worry about that you're worrying about me?

498
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,050
Where are you?

499
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,000
The shooting range.

500
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,510
Don't lie to me, I was just there.

501
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,700
I'm telling the truth. I'm at a shooting range.

502
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,150
One hundred bullets.

503
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:07,460
It'll be hard to shoot all one hundred bullets in one go.

504
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,410
Ah jeez!

505
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:49,370
Why are you hanging out in someone else's neighborhood? Making me not want to enjoy my drinks.

506
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,510
How much is it?

507
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,320
We'll pay together.

508
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,030
What are you doing? Why are you buying my drinks?

509
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:06,560
I'm not buying yours, I'm buying mine.

510
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,060
Here.

511
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:21,390
You can't say, "I called it. Serves you right."

512
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,080
"I knew this would happen."

513
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,950
And one more. "What are you going to do now?"

514
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:31,410
How are you able to read me so well?

515
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,690
If you're not clever, you might as well become a mind reader.

516
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:39,870
You know that with one squid leg, I can cut your artery and make you bleed a river?

517
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,490
That's a really scary squid.

518
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,460
I'll allow three seconds

519
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,280
for you to pity me.

520
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,190
No one has the right to look at you with pity.

521
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:03,380
If I have to point something out, it's you getting tunnel-vision

522
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:08,970
that leads to you living with avoidable resentment and accusations.

523
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,310
I do slightly pity you about that.

524
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,230
You've matured. You even know how to comfort someone.

525
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,840
It's not that I've matured but I've gotten wiser.

526
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:27,210
A bit too late... How pathetic.

527
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,800
What about Ye Eun?

528
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,070
What about Yoon Seok Ho?

529
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,810
It's fine as long as you don't have feelings for him.

530
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:25,300
  Seongam-ro, 13th Street  

531
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:31,690
CEO Yoon hasn't approved Baek Chan Mi's suspension yet?

532
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:38,510
Does he still have lingering feelings for her even after she deceived him?

533
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:46,280
Or could it be that he really loves her?

534
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:56,530
This is starting to get a bit tiring.

535
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,520
It's me. Let's meet up for tea?

536
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:16,410
Of course I'll head over to you.

537
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,110
Right to your office, Executive Director Myeong.

538
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,130
Pack it up and send it to Executive Director Myeong's office.

539
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,830
Certainly.

540
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:51,570
 Did you really leave again without saying goodbye? 

541
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:04,010
  I'm sorry for leaving without saying goodbye. Good luck prepping for the SAT and I hope you get accepted into a university... 

542
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,890
♫   The words I want to say the most and the words that come from deep down   ♫

543
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:26,960
♫   Are the words "I miss you"   ♫

544
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,070
♫   The words I really want to hear are the words “I love you”   ♫

545
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:37,710
♫   But I'm worried that they may come out too easily   ♫

546
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:43,010
♫   I can’t hide this heart it's already out   ♫

547
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:48,030
♫   Will it seem too much? Will I look easy?   ♫

548
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:50,470
♫   But I can’t wait   ♫

549
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:55,750
- Let's go.
 ♫   So should I confess first?   ♫

550
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:02,780
♫   Let’s love, let’s love   ♫

551
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,650
♫   Sweetly and deeply   ♫

552
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:07,990
- Could you stop here for a moment? 
 ♫   Let’s love  ♫

553
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:16,290
♫   With the world's most precious you    ♫

554
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:21,160
I'm not sure if I have feelings for him or not.

555
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,650
If you're not sure then you don't.

556
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,450
Let's go.

557
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:32,140
What if I do?

558
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,240
Hey, you...

559
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:47,670
Let's go.

560
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:52,670
I called it.

561
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:55,090
Serves you right. I knew this would happen.

562
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:58,140
What are you going to do now? What's your plan?

563
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,940
I warned you to not say any of those things!

564
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,360
You deserve to hear all this, idiot!

565
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,150
Go, get out of my sight.

566
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:08,840
You can't even control your emotions after getting off the case. You get out of my sight!

567
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,690
Do you have any right to say that to me?

568
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:22,910
Yeah, I do, because it's me.

569
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:26,800
I know best that when you fall in love, you don't see anything else and you'd even risk your life for that person!

570
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,330
Knowing that, you left me?

571
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:31,880
I left you because of that.

572
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,090
Because when I was with you, I was just some idiot

573
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:39,460
who stood in the way of the great Baek Chan Mi.

574
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,840
Wear this since it's snowing.

575
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,980
I would never wear something that smells of pathetic, single man!

576
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,210
  Restricted Number  

577
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,470
You got Executive Director Myeong's ledger?

578
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:41,470
You promise you have the video on Michael?

579
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:44,900
I guess you'll only find out once you come here.

580
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,350
Make sure there's no one else.

581
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,350
You too.

582
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:16,680


583
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,640
  Epilogue  

584
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,610
It's good to blow off stress by playing games when you're depressed.

585
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:34,170
I get more stressed out from not shooting well.

586
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,620
I'll help you!

587
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,720
You've never even held a gun.

588
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,530
Hello.

589
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,940
What happened to the doll that was up there yesterday?

590
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:53,420
Oh, that? Someone came in and won it before.

591
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:54,450
Who?

592
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,770
Some lady!

593
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,020
Let's just go.

594
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,210
How is that possible?

595
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,150
Come on, let's just go—

596
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,910
My CEO tried for many years to win that

597
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,620
and you're saying someone came in and won it within few hours?

598
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:13,430
And it was a woman?

599
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:16,380
Do you know how much the CEO wanted that doll?

600
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,520
Just stop!

601
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,290
I just thought that your mood would lighten up once you won the doll,

602
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,840
which is why I brought you here but the doll isn't here.

603
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,080
I feel even worse because of you so stop!

604
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:38,430
CEO, who do you think is the lady that won the doll? I'm so curious.

605
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,760
STOP, YOU DUMBASS, JUST STOP.

606
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,880
EVERYONE JUST STOP. PLEASE STOP.

607
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,970
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE IT A REST?

608
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:47,920
LEAVE ME ALONE!

609
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,840
CEO.
