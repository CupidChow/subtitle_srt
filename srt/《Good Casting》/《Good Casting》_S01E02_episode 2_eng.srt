 Episode 2 

2
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,110
 3 years ago 

3
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,120
 Agent Kwon Mi Seok dropped his gun while chasing the culprit, 
 

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,650
and the culprit happened to shoot him, is what you're claiming.

5
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,820
At this point, since an agent died trying to arrest the criminal,

6
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,940
you nearly killed yourself chasing him, even shot with your weapon, and yet lost him?

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,690
Maybe you didn't lose him.

8
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,780
Didn't you let him go?

9
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,070
Listen. Your fingerprints were on Agent Kwon Min Seok's gun.

10
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,510
Didn't you confiscate it, kill him, and then allow the criminal to escape?

11
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,140
 Are you going to continue to keep your mouth shut? 

12
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,140
 Shall I go through even all your relatives' accounts? 

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,510


14
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,960
Look.

15
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,700
 Ms. Baek Chan Mi. Baek Chan Mi? 

16
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,340
Yes?

17
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,610
 Present day 

18
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,340
 II Gwang HiTech On-Site Interview 

19
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,090
Ms. Baek Chan Mi, what did you do for three years?

20
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,990
 During the three-month suspension, I lived like a corpse. 

21
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,930
I spent time reflecting on myself.

22
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,960
 Once I resumed my position, I realized what I must do. 

23
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,780
Additionally, I set a plan for my future.

24
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,220
 While being sent from team to team for two years, 

25
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,660
I strengthened my resolve and reassessed my goal

26
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,370
 to finally catch Michael myself. ..

27
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,590
And now, I am standing here.

28
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,610
 II Gwang HighTech 

29
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,060
  Whatever it is, we clean it all up all spiffy and spotless, for you!  

30
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,660
Didn't you plump up her resume?

31
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,020
She said that she'd get it in her way.

32
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,710
Hey. Her specialty is to be completely brash!

33
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,880
 Didn't you fear...  a break in your career?

34
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,290
I believe the problem is with those who look down on career-break women.

35
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,630
Meanwhile, the government made child support shitty.

36
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,050
When the women once again pushed into society start to enter the workforce,

37
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,110
why do they just sit on their hands looking into space?

38
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,730
Inconsistent actions and words. It is the reality of the Republic of Korea.

39
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,960
Why do you all not have anything to say?

40
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,180
Shouldn't a large corporation like II Gwang Group

41
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,860
be an example for the advancement of our country and people

42
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,960
by having a forward-thinking policy for career-interrupted women?

43
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,600
If you hire me, I will become your example.

Ms. Im Jeong Eun?

47
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,470
Yes?

48
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,610
Ms. Im Jeong Eun, your self-introduction, please?

49
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm... Well...

50
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,640
We made sure you'll get in, so relax. Don't get intimidated.

51
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,570
I will help II Gwang Group to create an eco-friendly semiconductor.

52
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,320
I'm determined and ready. My name is Im Ye...

53
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,050
No... I'm Im Jung Eun.

My name is Kim Mi Seon.

No, it's Ki Mi Seon, like when you get age spots on your face... Ki Mi Seon.

58
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,110
Ah.

59
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,570
 Ki Mi Seon 

60
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,420
Ki Mi Seon, how old are you?

61
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,030
I'm 27 years old. I was born in the year of goat 
 (T/N: according to chinese zodiac) 

62
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,440
You see, nowadays I've been studying really hard to get a job.

63
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,510
That gave me a lot of stress. That's why I look old for my age.

64
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,800
But contrary to how I look, I have really got stamina.

65
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,920
I have frozen shoulders.

66
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,110
I'm okay.

67
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,230
   

68
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,890

We'll have to go with plan B.

Let's start plan B.

 If you fail the interview again, we won't be able to help. 

74
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,020
 So make sure you do a good job. 

75
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,710
Do your thing. And mind your own business.

76
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,110
That's my motto.

77
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,090
I always tell people you've got to know your place.

78
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,510
Leave your personal feelings out of your work, why don't we?

79
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,220
We secretaries all want to work with a good boss,

80
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,270
A boss who can't be professional at work is, substandard.

81
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,990
Stop showing off already!

82
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,140
In the almost 10 years of collaboration with employees and executive staff...

83
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,000
Has that thing gone crazy?

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,730
Especially from my specialist knowledge as a boss...

85
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,550
Is that someone you know, sir?

86
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,000
Did I ever tell you? A long time ago, I experienced

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,070
my heart being pierced so hard by my first love that there was absolutely nothing I could do.

88
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:05,760
Gosh, no wonder. Is that why you broke countless women's hearts all the—

89
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,960
Your first love really must've been someone outstanding.

90
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,730
 ...meistern. (German) 

91
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,730
She looked just like her. She was beautiful.

92
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,190
 15 years ago 

93
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,420
 First, let's think of the expression. When thinking of a place where you used to live... 

94
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,660
The situation I'm thinking of is when you've gone out for the first time in a while or...

95
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,490
 Excuse me. 

96
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,110
 Excuse me. 

97
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,300
 Do you happen to have a pen? I didn't bring any. 

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,920
 Thank you. 

99
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,450
 You must like dolls. 

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,760
 Excuse me, do you maybe have another pen? 

101
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,830
 This one won't write. 

102
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,170
 Thanks.

English Academy

104
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,140
 Do you happen to have a pen in another color? 

105
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,160
 Writing in red is a bit...
(Red is used to write deceased's name on a memorial tablet; writing a  name in red is a deathwish.) 

106
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,200
I didn't know. I hadn't thought so.

107
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,110
Things I hadn't done in a long time.

108
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,380
In other words, I hung out with someone.

109
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,310
Someone I associate with normally.

110
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,090
For example, we will go shopping.

111
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,650
It's not that you went shopping for the first time in a while, but when you went and...

112
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,580
Just use it!!!

113
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,950
 That's the end of today's class. 

114
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,070
 Good effort, everyone. 

115
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,620
 Oh the pen! The pen! 

116
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,430
 Excuse me! Your pen! 

117
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,680
 - Your pen!
 - Hey. I think the academy lecture isn't suitable for me. 

118
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,510
 So I'll just study with a private tutor as planned. 

119
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,940
 Anyway, thank you for looking into it for me. Yep. 

120
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,870
 I'll contact you again. Okay, bye. 

121
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,250
 Hey, your pen. Hey, wait, your pen... 

122
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,060
 I guess then I'll just keep it. 

123
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,630

 When meeting a substandard superior,

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,310
 I think it the role of a true secretary is 

136
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,860
 to assist them in becoming proper humans.

What should we do? I think our back up plan is also a complete failure.

140
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,730
She’s doing that on purpose, isn’t she? She wants me to hear it.

141
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,480
Why would Sunbae Baek do that? Did she get pissed at you for something?

Also, we are going to catch the industrial spy, Michael whom the I.D.B (Industrial Defense Bureau) repeatedly lost.

161
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,930
- What about the progress? 
 - According to the information collected by Team 3, the deal will range over three phases in total.

162
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,970
That will be our data backup method.

163
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,960
I predict when the Western Sea explosion incident occurred, the first phase was finished.

164
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,630
- And what we will stop is phase two. 
 - What about the information relating to the second transaction?

165
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,960
The completion date for phase two is one month later.

166
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,660
There's a strong probability that the second transfer will be made before then.

167
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,660
Within that time frame, we will infiltrate Il Gwang HiTech to find out the location, the date, and the transaction party, then block them.

168
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,270
Who are we marking as our target?

169
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,770
You do it, you! Why don’t you do it?

170
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,990
If I were the team leader, we'd have already been briefed long before now and started our mission.

171
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,400
Regardless, who are we keeping our eyes on?

172
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,920
Three people in total.

173
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,750
Three to three. Great.

174
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,070
First, CEO Yoon Seok Ho.

175
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,960
He’s the official heir of Il Gwang HiTech.

176
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,470
Yoon Seok Ho?

177
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,290
After being posted abroad, it's been a year that he's held the CEO position. A total newbie, you know.

178
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,430
 Thanks for coming. 

179
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,660
The true power in Il Gwang HiTech is Managing Director Myeong Gye Cheol.

180
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,120
The board of directors is completely in his grip.

181
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,530
 Welcome. 

182
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,230
 Congratulations on your appointment. 

183
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,070
Executive Director Myeong’s right-hand man is Division Director Tak Sang Gi. He does everything as an underling does.

184
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,300
He’s the one that we must pay attention to, remember.

185
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,290
Executive Director Myeong or something. He’s a completely old toothless tiger.

186
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,930
What is the true extent of his prowess that he overshadows the blue blood heir?

187
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,030
He’s as wise as a snake, so he never leaves any paper trail.

188
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:16,010
He only uses an unregistered phone and a web cloud, even going so far as only using the corporate email account managed by his executive assistant.

189
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,110
He doesn't have a personal email.

190
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,480
It short, he doesn’t have his own “shadow."

191
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,610
As much as he has to hide, digging it out will be even more amusing.

192
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,260
It will be a jackpot.

193
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,620
According to our informant, CEO Yoon's party actively interacts with Taiwan.

194
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,600
He has a high frequency of unofficial business trips to Taiwan. What do you think?

195
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,520
- It’s a bit stinky (suspicious), no?
 - It wafts pungently.

196
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,950
The more needlessly high quality the visuals are of a person,

197
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,500
the stinkier s/he usually is.

198
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,920
Between CEO Yoon and MD Myeong,

199
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,030
is wedged this guy.

200
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,210
Isn’t that the celebrity, Kang Woo Won?

201
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,410
You all must be really familiar with him. He’s the most famous Kpop celeb, Kang Woo Won.

202
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,850
He is very popular in East Asia, especially in China and Taiwan.

203
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:12,710
He flies to Taiwan at least twice a month. So, he’d be optimal for smuggling a new release.

204
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,740
CEO Yoon, MD Myeong, and Kang Woo Won.

205
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,650
- There must be someone related to Michael. 
 - Or one of them could be Michael.

206
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,280
Baek Chan Mi closely monitors Yoon Seok Ho. Im Ye Eun tails Kang Woo Won.

207
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,890
- What about me then? 
 - You don’t even do well with everything planned out for you. Just do the supporting job.

208
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,430
When you say the supporting job... you mean CCTV (surveillance)?

209
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,960
- Where are you going to install a CCTV?
 - You can tell immediately it must be the lab.

210
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,210
You need a code to enter the lab. Since it gets reset every morning,

211
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,780
you have to go to CEO Yoon’s office to set the code.

212
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,640
To access CEO Yoon’s office requires Face ID and ID card. A two-factor system.

213
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,900
No, no. It can’t be me.

214
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,410
Baek Chan Mi goes to CEO Yoon’s office. Hwang Mi Soon goes to the lab. Dismissed!

215
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,500
- Why me?
 - Why me? If it fails, I will be entirely at fault.

216
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,560
It will be completed by tomorrow.

217
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,610
- On our first day at work? 
 - On our first day?

218
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,750
What are you talking about? Deranged. That doesn’t make sense.

219
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,480
You beserk psycho. Go die.

220
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,650
Taipei

221
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,470
Chinese food is too greasy.

222
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,660
Do they soak the feed in oil before feeding them?

223
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,980
This tenderloin is completely jiggly with fat!

224
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,250
Hey, bring the bag right now. Quickly fast!

225
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,330
After eating, I always get sick.

226
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,350
There are way too many artificial flavor enhancers.

227
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,030
The money. I will pay you when the alpha test is over, you got it?

228
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,470
Do you understand? Got it?

229
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,420
Take out the digestive aid medication.

230
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,650
What are you doing? Are you nuts?

231
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,810
What are you?

232
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,590
In Korea, it’s table manners not to touch someone while eating.

233
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,720
The remaining balance has been cleared.

234
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,810
 $10M has been deposited to your account. Please contact us if this transaction is unfamiliar. 

235
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,340
Since the first phase is finished, we should soon move to phase two.

236
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,250
It’s too tight of a schedule for development.

237
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,240
We haven’t even done the presentation on our first technology. Backing up the top-secret second technology data is too—

238
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,560
It is risky.

239
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,580
If we get caught, we all have to step down from our positions.

240
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,820
Thank you for your understanding.

241
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,350
Who installed you in that position?

242
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,140
Do you think that for these many years, there wasn't a single person by my side who has betrayed me?

243
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,700
It’s simple.

244
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,140
If you snip those who aren't grateful in the bud from the get-go, you won't have any later complications.

245
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,690
I will proceed with the second technology data backup right away.

246
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,800
I will proceed with the second technology data backup right away.

247
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,200
So, it will be done before the end of this winter.

248
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,400
Found my stake. Can you hear me well?

249
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,710
I’ve entered the scene, too.

250
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,010
It’s been a while. Shall I make some moves then?

251
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,880
Look here, Ma’am. What are you doing right now?

252
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,120
Where do you think you are going? This ajumma really is something.

253
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,580
Oh my.

254
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,650
I haven't seen your face before. Which vendor again? Ssak Ssak?

255
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,040
Did you not hear to not go beyond that line by reception?

256
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,930
I understand. I will go. Right?

257
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,460
You can't run into Mr. CEO while wiping all over here and there. Hurry and move.

258
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,510
- No, I— 
 - What do you mean, no. Go already!

259
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,680
This punk!

260
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,530
I have a child as old as you.

261
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,030
Ma’am, you want to get fired?

262
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,200
No.

263
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,840
I think you do.

264
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,730
I’m on my way.

265
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,970
- Are you sure?
 - Yes.

266
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,260
Let’s go.

267
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,620
- If you do that, you will get laid off.
 - Which way?

268
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,820
- You go that way.
 - Alright, alright.

269
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,030
Let me escort you there.

270
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,440
- Oh, thank you.
 - You do?

271
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,430
You are very kind.

272
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,540
Well, it's good that you know.

273
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,470
 Wiretap 

274
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,360
 Wiretap 

275
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,060
Hey, there.

276
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,970
Are you here for fun?

277
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:40,110
Slacking off on your first day. Follow me.

278
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,340
I think Im Ye Eun’s wiretap is broken.

279
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,390
Give up on the sideline. Focus on the center force.

280
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,500
Sunbae Baek is a true legendary agent.

281
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,240
There won’t be any problem for sure.

282
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,780
Ah really...

283
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,990
By all appearances, you are quite full in your years.

284
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,960
I heard you were hired through special experienced employee recruitment. How old are you?

285
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,530
 How cute. So you’ve even prepared a welcoming party? 

286
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,330
Twenty.

287
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,360
Nine.

288
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,310
I can speak informally since you are younger than me, can’t I?

289
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,260
  They start with a strong first punch.  

290
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,330
Of course.

291
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,650
I wonder who’s your connection, that you can bee-line to the CEO’s office as your first assignment?

292
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,070
I’m curious.

293
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,840
Tell us honestly.

294
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,970
Which high-person is backing you?

295
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,270
Ah. So you all do have someone

296
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,240
backing you.

297
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,520
I can't believe this.

298
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,670
It's already widely known that you're a backdoor hire you know?

299
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,510
How dare you play dumb so brazenly?

300
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,390
 Baek Chan Mi, look. Let’s not needlessly ruin the mission. 

301
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,390
 Lower your temper. Lower it. Step back! 

302
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,120
Connections?

303
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,840
When I was in my youth, I had done some high altitude high opening (HAHO).

304
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,990
Would you like me to show you a preview?

305
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,450
Hey, hey. Let go of me. Let go!

306
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,690
- Stay still.
 - Let me go.

307
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,970
Why are you doing this to me?

308
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,660
Jeong Eun, is the current situation flow chart for Kang Woo Won's advertisers still not ready?

309
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,640
No. It’s finished!

310
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,400
 What a pose. Good, good! 

311
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,620
It’s great. More wind, please! A little more!

312
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,690
The wind should be dynamic! Great!

313
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,290
It’s awesome.

314
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,480
Great, great pose.

315
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,610
Shall we show off your chocolate abs this time?

316
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,780
Show us!

317
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,940
Abs are coming. Abs!

318
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,430
Great abs. Great chocolate. One more time.

319
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,200
Great, great!

320
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,490
Close-ups now. Great biceps.

321
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,560
Your back muscles now. Men are all about back muscles. Let’s go!

322
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,540
It’s freezing.

323
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,740
Oh, my. They are angry (well-defined).

324
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,610
One more time. You look great!

325
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,430
It’s freezing. Let’s stop.

326
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,330
I’m freakin’ freezing.

327
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,040
Can’t we set a good date for these photo shoots? Please!

328
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,010
It’s a Southeast Asian magazine. It'll be difficult if your winter wear ends up in vogue.

329
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,490
Wow, amazing.

330
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,990
Look at my goosebumps. It’s too darn cold.

331
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,130
Il Gwang contacted us for an ads renewal. What should we do?

332
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,500
I told you to forget about our weak past.

333
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:32,600
It’s me. The hottest celeb, Kang Woo Won. What exactly are you so scared of?

334
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,700
I’m worried that we might lose the ads while playing hard to get.

335
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,240
We can lose then. Keep your chest up and man up. Just push them through.

336
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,940
You are serious, right? I’m going to tell the fee for contract renewal is tripled.

337
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,770
Tell them they should be grateful that we didn't ask for quadruple.

338
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,660
Is Kang Woo Won in his right mind?

339
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,820
His career was on the verge of death,

340
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,350
but with the mindset "cheap goods are like crumbling bijiddeok" (things bought cheaply are of low quality),

341
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,590
we barely put him on life support by modeling for rice cookers

342
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,980
and made him a hot celeb.

343
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,300
What? He wants it tripled?

344
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,890
There is not even the slimmest margin for negotiation.

345
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,100
We must succeed in this renewal.

346
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,730
Kang Woo Won’s new drama, because of Writer Kim Yoo Ri, so many places are dying to place their products for advertisement.

347
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,060
If it exceeds our budget, our higher-ups will not approve it anyway.

348
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,180
Is there any way we can succeed by only doubling the offer?

349
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,220
Team Leader.

350
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,980
I’m sorry but I need to get off work.

351
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,940
- What?
 - What are you saying on your first day at work?

352
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,780
Stop with that nonsense and go mix us some coffee.

353
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,330
Yes, Ma’am.

354
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,260
- So Hee, bye-bye.
 - So Hee, bye-bye.

355
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,040
Yes.

356
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,220
Yes.

357
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,590
I’m sorry, Teacher.

358
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:58,030
I was going to leave as soon as possible.

359
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:02,980
I’m so sorry. As soon as I wrap up—

360
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,380
Chief. I’m in a hurry.

361
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,290
Shooting Star Childcare

362
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,440
Swiftly Clean

363
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,780
I’ve arrived, Chief.

364
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,320
What are you doing not bringing the kid?

365
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,480
- Me?
 - Then, shall I?

366
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,240
Hey, Newbie.

367
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,480
What do you think?

368
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,450
- Excuse me? 
- You should have a gist of what's going on.

369
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,260
I’m in the process of wrapping my head around and figuring out my role.

370
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,140
Forget it. Leave.

371
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,260
I mean, it’s important to have a long meeting like this, but

372
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,120
is it too late for us to go meet Mr. Kang Woo Won and persuade him?

373
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,370
If we have to make this contract work, then

374
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,630
it seems like the quickest way would be to do

375
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,820
it in person, you know.

376
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,870
Is that so? Then, you should go meet him.

377
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,180
Pardon?

378
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,240
M-M-Me?

379
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,180
You just said so. The time spent chitchatting here in the office would be put better to use by going to persuade him.

380
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,440
Why? You can’t do it?

381
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,350
Chief. How can a newbie entice Kang Woo Won?

382
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,850
She can’t even season coffee properly.

383
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,660
What are you doing? Tell them this instant that you’d do it!

384
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,920
I can’t do it!

385
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,900
You had thought

386
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,110
I would say I couldn't, right?

387
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,460
I will take responsibility and persuade him.

388
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:10,410
 Mom! Mom! 

389
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,000
Chief. I think she pooped.

390
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,030
- What are you doing not changing her diaper?
 - You want me to change her diaper?

391
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,140
- I’ve never done it before.
 - You think I have?

392
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,820
I really can’t do it.

393
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,590
Chief.

394
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,180
- Get rid of it. 
 - Throw it where?

395
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,650
Roll, roll it.

396
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,990
Mom!

397
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,250
- Oh, man.. 
 - Are you rolling up kimbap?

398
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,200
- It’s because I’m doing it for the first time.
 - Mom!

399
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,790
Mom!

400
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,740
Hey, Chief. What should I do?

401
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,820
- What now?
 - We don’t have a new diaper.

402
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,780
What crap are you saying?

403
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,890
Have you reached Hwang Mi Soon and Baek Chan Mi?

404
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,980
I’m driving right now.

405
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,390
I’m taking care of this child, you punk!

406
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,960
Why does she keep crying? Right, right. Do something!
  - Your call cannot be connected... 

407
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,480
I am making a call!

408
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,410
 Team Leader Ddong (Crap) 

409
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,380
Yes, dear customer?

410
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,410
You want to get an estimate for an insurance covering actual medical expenses?

411
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,250
Of course.

412
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,810
- What did you say, Sunbae?
 - Here, here. Hand it over.

413
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,160
How long has it been since I got off work? What standby? You want to die?

414
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,670
Janitors get off work at 3 pm. You want me to be on standby forever or what?

415
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:09,540
Hey, Hwang Mi Soon. How can you go off work without reporting?

416
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,240
It’s not like you are going to pay me for overtime.

417
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,510
I’m busy. Bye.

418
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,440
Hey! Hey!

419
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,040
Yeah. There, there.

420
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:36,030
With the same hand that you touched your foot—

421
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,780
Look, look, look! Look at him!

422
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,230
With that dirty hand! How can you put food in your mouth?

423
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,420
Stop it! Did you rub your hand in chili pepper? Why are your blows so spicy (strong and painful)?

424
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,410
Oh my, please! Seriously!

425
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,820
I should break your wrist or something.

426
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,230
When are you becoming a human? Huh? When?

427
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:07,630
- I’m home.
 - Oh, Soo Hyeon. You should have dinner. I made cheonggukjang.

428
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,140
J-Joo Hyeon?

429
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,240
Joo Hyeon?

430
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,680
Nam Joo Hyeon.

431
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,860
Nam Joo Hyeon, I said have din—

432
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,730
Come out and have dinner, you brat!

433
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,180
Hey, aren’t you getting off work? You should leave. Mr. CEO is not in the office anyway.

434
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,650
I have some work to do. You can go first.

435
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:00,760
It’s strange. What work is there if the CEO hasn't even come to work yet?

436
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,970
 Why are this kid's words chopped in half (half-speech is informal speech)? 

437
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,250
I should figure out my role and tasks before Mr. CEO comes to work.

438
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,990
My position is a newly hired experienced employee, you know.

439
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,850
Sure, then. Good work.

440
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,880
Il Gwang HiTech

441
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,170
Take care.

442
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,550
 To infiltrate CEO Yoon’s office, you’d need a security card. 

443
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,570
 Secure that first. 

444
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,770
I left my employee ID card.

445
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:40,510
 CEO Yoon has one, but the Chief Executive Assistant Byeon should have one as well. 

446
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,130
What are you doing there?

447
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,170
Your employee ID card.

448
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:31,740
It seems like you left it, so I was going to bring it to you. How'd you know? You're just in time.

449
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,350
Nice catch!

450
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,780
You are good at catching. Wow.

451
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,540
Baek Chan Mi

452
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,200
should have secured the security card with no problem, right?

453
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,590
Don’t worry, Team Leader.

454
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,640
There won’t be a problem with Im Ye Eun either.

455
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,300
Yeah.

456
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,810
Look at the camera. Great. Follow the camera with your eyes. Great. Great.

457
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,770
You look cool.

458
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,560
You're truly the man, a man.

459
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,710
Put your hands in your pockets. Look in this direction.

460
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,110
Look at the camera. Think. “I’m a superstar.”

461
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:31,280
You know, there is a reason why I’m called

462
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,620
the queen of negotiation and persuasion.

463
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,790
 The first one is obviously, trust. 

464
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:43,100
 Making myself look appealing by targeting what he likes 

465
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,010
 is the most essential of essential strategy. 

466
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,970
 Kang Woo Won’s favorite snacks 

467
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,980
Organic. Natural. Healthy things.

468
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,130
 Kang Woo Won’s allergy 

469
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,780
Peanut and nut allergy.

470
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,810
 Number Two. 

471
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,040
Vibes. Mood.

472
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,690
 You know, they say that love gets more intense on a battlefield. 

473
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,760
 Why do you think so? 

474
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,420
 If you are swayed by the vibes, you even stand surety for your neighbor’s dog. 

475
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,540
The last one is the most important one.

476
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,160
More important than your speaking skills,

477
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,810
 that is... 

478
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,930
What’s this?

479
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,310
Close your eyes!

480
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,290
You need luck. Luck, you know.

481
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:28,280
Right. I need to do the dishes, right.

482
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,470
I need to turn this off.

483
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,280
- What’s that?
 - It looks like a naked man.

484
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,000
Hey! Where are you right now?

485
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,780
What are you?

486
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,320
Are you a sasaeng (obsessed and intrusive fan), a spy, or are you crazy?

487
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,470
I’m so sorry. I’m...

488
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:57,460
- Il—
 - You were working? You forced the superstar, Kang Woo Won to do a strip show!

489
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:01,840
Try to make excuses if you have a mouth.

490
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,680
Even if I had ten mouths, I'd have not a word to validate my actions.

491
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,100
I’m just here, Mr. Kang Woo Won, to m—

492
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,850
- You think I’m easy. Do I look easy? 
 - I was going to meet you and...

493
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,970
Do you want me to show you how “not easy” I am?

494
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:21,460
- No, no. I’m here for a re—
 - You think it’s funny?

495
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,990
- Renewal...
 - You think it’s funny?

496
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,880
Just... I’ll take my leave now.

497
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,620
Where are you going?

498
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,100
You saw me naked, and now you're going to just shamelessly exit the situation?

499
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,280
Since it ‘s turned out like this—

500
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,890
Right. You are now showing me your true intention.

501
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,050
Tell me, what are you? What's your identity?

502
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:51,880
From the Marketing and Promotion department from Il Gwang HiTech, I’m here to talk about renewing our contract!

503
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,060
Go tell them. I want my contract fee quadrupled.

504
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,300
Four-fold.

505
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,410
 Taxi 

506
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,570
 What about the security card? 

507
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,560
Of course, I have it. I need to return it before he returns to work in the morning.

508
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,070
CEO Yoon comes to work at 7 am. We are going to start before then.

509
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,050
Be sure to get some deep shuteye.

510
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,500
Good work—

511
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,770
  You have until tomorrow to entirely scour CEO Yoon's computer and bring me the content.  

512
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:02,700
  We only just infiltrated. It is too dangerous to start the operation before they can be acclimated to the site.  

513
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,670
  We sent them there to do something dangerous.  

514
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,670
Succeeding at dangerous tasks is our work.

515
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,830
Why are you acting like an amateur?

516
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:17,140
  The team leader has authority for commanding on-site operations, so please trust me with this.  

517
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,930
  This isn't like you. Don't uselessly mix emotions with your work.  

518
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:26,730
  Do you want to let the past hold you back and end up over the hill?  

519
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,700
When you shoot,

520
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:43,600
no matter how good your hand is, if you don't properly support it from below,

521
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,720
it's a bust.

522
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,750
Didn't I clearly tell you that

523
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,860
you are to place the USB on my desk by this evening?

524
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,360
I told you, Sir.

525
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,900
It wasn't an operation that could be completed in only one day.

526
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:04,880
What's the use for me grunting through it all, when the ones below misstep and waste it all!

527
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,360
We will do our utmost to finish it within today.

528
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,370
Stop saying such obvious things and get to work! Now!

529
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,160
Clean up here and return that.

531
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,250
Yes. We will put an end to it soon.

00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,580
Don't worry.

 Why can't I view the case files when I am the person in charge of the case?  

542
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,710
  I told you to keep quiet and wait for your notice of suspension.  

543
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,310
  Why do you keep rummaging through a case that's over!  

544
00:45:54,310 --> 00:46:00,380
  A team member died because of me! I'll keep digging until the end.  

545
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,980
  Until I catch that guy.

 The pieces of evidence I showed you last time are all there is.  

555
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,670
  The mobile phone that fell here. That cell phone wasn't there.  

556
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:56,990
  Mobile phone?  

557
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:59,540
  But wasn't this dropped by an agent during the operation?  

558
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,850
  Who uses a 2G phone that doesn't even have internet access?  

559
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,720
  Right, it's not like it's a burner phone.  

560
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,900

00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:45,330
Baek Chan Mi penetrates in Yoon Seok Ho's office and uses the computer to lift the admittance restrictions for the lab. 
   Step 1. Chan Mi hacks the lab security.  

565
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:48,010
Mi Soon enters the lab. 
   Step 2. Mi Soon installs a surveillance camera in the lab.  

566
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,880
You get back out within ten minutes of installing the camera in the director's office.

567
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,470
You have to finish everything within twenty minutes. All of you, enter now. 
   Mission clear!

  Il Gwang HiTech Research Center  

569
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,170
  Entering the lab. Complete.  

570
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,240
  Do you see well?  

571
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,620
It should go well, don't you think?

572
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,180
Focus on doing your work properly.

573
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,490
Every second in the field counts. Don't waste time on needless things and focus your eyes sharply.

574
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,150
Don't lose even one second.

575
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,980
  Okay, you see it? Tell me in an easy and quick way  

576
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,310
how to undo it.

577
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:41,260
Take the thing that Agent Im gave you, and pull out the red wire.

578
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,600
  Instead of plugging it on the GND wire next to the FPCB circuit board, you plug it in the TD wire.  

579
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,200
You should explain in a way that's intelligible!

580
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,130
I can understand that much.

581
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,900
Alright.

582
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:11,740
Is it not done yet?

00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:33,260
CEO Yoon is heading toward the elevator. Are you still far from done? You need to hurry!

586
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,800
Yes, Manager. I'm in the bathroom right now.

587
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,530
Why don't you come quickly?

588

I'm in the middle of doing my business.

589
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,750
Why didn't you report right away about Kang Woo Won's meeting yesterday?

590
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:59,330
We've got a team emergency, so stop it and come running here right now!

591
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,290
Yes, I will go right away!

592

 Yoon 

593
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,070
There's a security lock on the computer.

594
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,690
I think we'll have to withdraw.

595
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:20,330
Hold the elevator for just three minutes, please.

596
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,550
What's this?

597
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,090
What's going on?

  Yoon - Unlock password success.  

602
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,630
It worked.

603
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,990
It worked.

604
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,750
Thanks.

605
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,590
What was that?

606
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:32,190
I'm asking what that was.

607
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,630
- You didn't see it? 
 - See what?

608
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,860
I'm the idiot for asking.

609
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,890
What happens. What if Sunbae Baek Chan Mi gets caught?

00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:45,340
It's been a while, let's do some warm-ups.

624
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,450
Hwang Mi Soon, please take good care of the rest.

625
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:53,880
What about Chan Mi? Is she still unable to get out?

626
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,400
From what I see, it's a stolen base.

627
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,770
She acts like she's the smartest one around,

628
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:04,310
but she always makes a blunder at the decisive moment.

629
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,970
Oh? Who...

630
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,850
You've been working overnight again? Look at the shadows under your eyes.

631
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:18,650
Don't work so hard. Overtime doesn't pay that much.

632
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,180
- Did you take out insurance? 
 - Insurance?

633
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,730
Yes, thank you.

634
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,560
I see. Good work.

635
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,760
After all, Chan Mi only has to be smart on the surface

636
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,360
for her to get dumped by a monkfish like Team Leader Dong.

637
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,100
Mi Soon, let's only focus on our work.

638
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:51,670
  What is it? You're a monkfish, one who's no different from water being soaked in water and alcohol being soaked in alcohol (idiom meaning someone who is wishy-washy). 

639
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,010
♫   I'll be watching you  ♫

Card

641
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:36,210
You hide somewhere it can't be seen and connect it to the wifi.

642
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,480
The world changed for the better.

643
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,820
No need for a cable, you can just stick it wirelessly.

644
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,690
It's amazing.

645
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,120
What's wrong with this?

646
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:55,840
T-Team Leader. How come Chief Ok is coming now?

647
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,640
What?

648
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,120
  The communication cannot be established. Please renew your attempt. 

649
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,660
I'm going crazy.

650
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:19,930
Come on, catch the signal, catch it, catch it.

651
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,240
- Hello, Chief. 
 -  Get back to your work, get back to your work.

652
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,040
Chief, Chief just a minute! This is the thing you asked for yesterday.

653
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,140
  Il Gwang Research Center Chief Ok Cheol  

654
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,150
What was that?

655
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:18,190
Come on, move!

656
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:22,330
Please stop pushing, please.

657
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:02,510


658
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:11,090
  Epilogue  

659
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:19,590
  Ten years prior  

660
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:24,120
♫  Hail (hail) What's the matter with your  ♫

661
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,760
♫  head, yeah, yeah  ♫

662
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,640
♫  Hail (hail)  ♫

663
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,250
What is it about, suddenly?

664
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,790
Let's have coffee first, we'll talk later.

665
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,930
I came in the middle of an operation. I have to go back soon.

666
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:42,240
♫  Hail (hail) What's the matter with your head  ♫

667
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,370
Can't we talk without the gun?

668
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,580
Come and get

669
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:49,280
The knife and the fork, too.

670
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,640
♫  Hail, with it, baby 
 'Cause you're fine
And you're mine, and you   ♫

671
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,340
What is it, exactly?

672
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,970
We... uh..

673
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:04,110
♫  Come and get your love  ♫

674
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,610
♫  Come and get your love  ♫

675
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:10,100
Thank you.

676
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,410
"We" what?

677
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:15,160
Let's talk after drinking these first.

678
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,500
What is it? Is there something wrong?

679
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,680
What's the matter with you feel right

680
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,680
♫  Don't you feel right baby  ♫

681
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,640
♫  Yeah. Oh Yeah.  ♫

682
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,730
Actually ...

683
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,640
♫  'Cause you're fine And you're mine,  ♫

684
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,510
Say it.

685
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:38,760
It's not— It's nothing at all.

686
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,560
I was getting ideas because the mood seemed so serious.

687
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:45,130
I thought you were going to say we should break up.

688
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:48,940
What's with your expression?

689
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,530
That... that is...

690
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,680
I thought it over for a long time, and—

691
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,970
Think about it some more before talking.

692
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,510
No, I thought enough about it.

693
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:08,110
So? Your conclusion?

694
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:10,170
L-Let's break up.

695
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:33,070
So in the end, that's what comes out for your mouth!

696
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:35,880
Just last month you paid fines for destruction of property, remember?

697
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,390
You said you're in the middle of an operation.

698
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:46,080
When I call you, you hang up, your face is cold,

699
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:49,350
we didn't even meet during break, you suddenly go radio silent.

700
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:53,850
And when you avoided me at work, I thought maybe,

701
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:59,220
just maybe if you found another girl or lost feelings, you're just a backstabbing jerk.

702
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:03,460
Yeah. I'm a son of a bitch.

703
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:08,270
Make this clear. You're the one who dumped me.

704
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,280
I'm not the one who dumped you.

705
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,720
Yeah. It's 100% my fault.

706
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:19,380
You know, right? How I treat people who do wrong.

707
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,920
Of course, I know.

708
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,030
I'll give you three seconds. Disappear.

709
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:29,240
I can't promise anything after that. Three, two, one!!

710
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,360
Are you not going to disappear?

711
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,170
  Good Casting - Preview  

712
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,550
  Mi Soon, still not out?   

713
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:51,400
  My arms and legs are numb.  

714
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,840
  Find Hwang Mi Soon. Now.  

715
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,370
 Is anyone there? 

716
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,460
 I found her location. 

717
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:58,240
  - Tell them to enter. 
 - Okay, we're doing it.   

718
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,700
  Find the reboot button and press it, please.  

719
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,490
 -  The red button, please!   
 - What is this?

720
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:03,880
  It's suspicious. I think she took a picture of me back then.  

721
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,810
 Should we eat together? 

722
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:08,630
  Division Director Tak Sang Gi. Why does he have the exact designer brand scarf as Michael?  

723
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,120
  Try to get into Division Director Tak's office.  

724
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,330
 But are you actually 29 years old? 

725
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:12,980
  Your name is Baek Jang Mi, too. Are you sure?  

726
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:13,980
 Yes, it is. 

727
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,110
  Secretary Baek Jang Mi was an NIS agent.  

728
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:19,000
 But I don't put people I can't trust next to me.
