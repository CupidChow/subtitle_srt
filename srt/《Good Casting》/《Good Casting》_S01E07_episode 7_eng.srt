1
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,650


2
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,850
Be careful not to touch the detonator. From the left, one, two...

3
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,650
Disconnect the third power supply.

4
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,150
- Step back. 
 - N-No but.

5
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,650
You're him, aren't you? You're Michael, right?

6
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,850
It's good.

7
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,450
Good. Good.

8
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,250
We verified the item. Will it be some other dude again, for the third transaction?

9
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,050
No. No. I will personally be doing the third transaction.

10
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,850
- That's good. 
 - Good? 
 - Yes.

11
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,850
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

12
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,150
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

13
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,950
Bye. bye.

14
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,350
It's finally over.

15
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,650
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

16
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,250
What is this? What's wrong with this?

17
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,050
There must be another bomb.

18
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,250
What?

19
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,850
Agh. Just kill me, please.

20
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,250
Get it off.

21
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,550
  I love you.  

22
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,200
  I love you.  

23
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,350
I can't let you go on your own even if I die.

24
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,850
No!

25
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,050
You should have removed it earlier.

26
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,750
You should've done it over there!

27
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,250
Slowly, slowly.

28
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,650
Let's run there.

29
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,650
Move out of the way, all of you!

30
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,250
Get away!

31
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,050
 The person you are trying to call... 

32
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,950
 The person you are trying to call... 

33
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:19,850
  This is a congratulatory hiring gift. It's kind of like a bribe for you to stay for a long time.  

34
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,050
Top Secret - Code Name 'Good Casting'

35
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,450
Good Casting

36
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,750
 Episode 7  
 Why are you already here? You should finish getting your IV.

37
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,650
Where is Im Ye Eun? Why don't I see her?

38
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,450
Im Ye Eun?

39
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,250
Did something happen to her?

40
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,150
Is this the time you should be worried about me?

41
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,450
I seriously...

42
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:08,850
thought something bad happened to you. Do you know how scared I was?

43
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,250
Why are you getting angry?

44
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,050
I don't know.

45
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,650
Next time, just don't get hurt again. Please.

46
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,650
I did wrong.

47
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,050
Of course, you did something wrong.

48
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,650
Hey. If we have casualties during an operation,

49
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,250
our Team Leader Dong will have to suffer so much, spending the night on writing a report.

50
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,050
The doctor said

51
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,050
that it's a minor fracture so you should be able to take the cast off in two to three weeks.

52
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,450
Just tolerate it for a bit.

53
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,450
  Congratulations. Commemorative cast for your return to the field.  

54
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,450
What about Pi Cheol Woong?

55
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,650
  National Intelligence Service's Protected Ward  

56
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,450
That guy, Pi Cheol Woong, had a seizure as soon as he regained consciousness and caused a commotion.

57
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,250
It's expected of him.

58
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,050
He almost walked the road into the afterlife with an explosive vest on.

59
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,250
He's more feeble-minded than he looks. He only fell asleep barely a moment ago, after being given a sedative.

60
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,050
Those people,

61
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:16,050
as if using others as delivery boxes wasn't enough, they even plant bombs on them.

62
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,650
They must have planned to even kill all of us.

63
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,650
By the way, we even lost the chip to them. What should we do now?

64
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,450
What else can we do? We should repay them with exactly what we got.

65
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,050
What are you, you moron?!

66
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,850
You said you would catch Michael or whatever, and that you'd definitely stop the leak of our technology.

67
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,750
I approved your case because you acted as if the whole country would collapse if I didn't support you!

68
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,250
The culprit became a corpse. The only witness lost his mind.

69
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,450
We can't even confirm whether the second part of the technology passed over to them or not!

70
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,850
If Division Director Tak hadn't suddenly intercepted the operation...

71
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,850
Don't use Division Director Tak as an excuse.

72
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,450
It's your job to determine his movement patterns and prepare from them not only a second or third plan,

73
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,050
but all the way to a fourth plan!

74
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,450
No matter how I think of it, someone must have leaked information from inside.

75
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,230
What got leaked?

76
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,050
Our side found out that Pi Cheol Woong was leaving the country only two hours before,

77
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,150
but that Division Director Tak jerk was already on board the plane!

78
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,250
If we analyze Division Director Tak's itinerary before he boarded the plane,

79
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,850
I'm sure we'll find something.

80
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:48,650
That's right. Something hasn't felt right ever since Baek Chan Mi joined the operation.

81
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,050
What are you talking about?

82
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,550
What is it?

83
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,050
You said it yourself. That it seems like there is a mole.

84
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,250
That's just speculation. Agent Baek Chan Mi is definitely not it.

85
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,250
Is there any rule saying that someone who already betrayed once can't do it again?

86
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,050
It's all my shortcoming.

87
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,420
I will take all responsibility for this event.

88
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,950
Start by getting rid of that foul-smelling corpse. It stinks.

89
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,220
What are you doing, won't you buzz off?

90
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,650
The director was really furious.

91
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:38,350
The director is usually quiet and Team Leader Dong isn't one to stir things up. How come he's been in there for over ten minutes already?

92
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,050
We're not entirely sure yet that Yoon Seok Ho is innocent.

93
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,250
I know it. He's not it.

94
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,250
What do you know?

95
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,150
Yoon Seok Ho. I said he's not the type to do so.

96
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,450
If I think carefully, there is more than one thing that's weird about you these days.

97
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,350
Spill. You two have something special, right?

98
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,650
We do.

99
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,450
We're a field agent and her inspection target. What else do you need?

100
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,850
I... If Kang Woo Won is removed from the list of suspects,

101
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,250
I think it would be better for me to stop being in charge of him...

102
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,050
You said you'd investigate him, but isn't it that you're scheming to date him?

103
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,450
For goodness sakes! Have you ever seen me doing vain stuff while on the job?

104
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,950
Give it to me!

105
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,050
Oh ho. Seeing how you fidget, there really must be something there.

106
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,050
Why would there be something?

107
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,050
We only have Pi Cheol Woong.

108
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,000
But his condition isn't normal so getting testimony will be difficult for the time being.

109
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,340
Are there any ideas on how to grill Executive Director Myeong and Chief Ok into giving information?

110
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,520
I also really want to grill, fry and roast them,

111
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,420
but you know, right? I have two people at home for whom I have to cook, already.

112
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,030
I'm leaving now.

113
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,250
Everyone worked hard.

114
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,630
Hwang Mi Soon. Hey!

115
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,480
Just go. Go.

116
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,380
I said go.

117
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,110
Sunbae? Why aren't you leaving?

118
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,580
Staying here and doing something useful like watching this punk

119
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,380
is more productive than going home and watching useless TV.

120
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,130
No matter how many times I watched it, there was nothing much.

121
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,190
Isn't that weird?

122
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,310
The fact that someone stole the technology means that it was leaked from inside the research center.

123
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,520
The fact that Chief Ok, who's the main key figure, isn't acting abnormally...

124
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,090
Isn't that more abnormal?

125
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:58,080
Sunbae. You should part with your workaholic tendency now, and see a guy who is useless to your mission instead.

126
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,830
I'm popular.

127
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,120
I have so many blind date requests that they are too much to deal with.

128
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,330
Aish. Why do you keep bobbing your head?

129
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,150
Um?

130
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,320
  Johann Strauss: Act 2 Voices of Spring, Waltz 

131
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,860
It doesn't even suit you. Why classical music?

132
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,740
I told you it was garbage disposal day yesterday.

133
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,990
I told you so many times to not forget to take out the garbage.

134
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,360
I said it so many times that I just...

135
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,710
Seriously. Without me, you would be a pig.

136
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,670
Just live as a pig.

137
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,730
What's the use of living as a human?

138
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,040
  Good Dew Soju  

139
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,310
Why suddenly soju?

140
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,970
Did you drink soju?

141
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,760
I asked you if you drank soju!

142
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,740
Don't you know I only drink beer?

143
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,790
Didn't you drink somaek (beer and soju mixed)?

144
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,870
You know that I can't drink bombs (another word for somaek).

145
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,940
Cigarette ash?

146
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,060
  Report Card  

147
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,550
She doesn't study like I tell her to, but she...

148
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,600
It's not right for me to rip someone else's son's face.

149
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,010
  Oh Yeah. Awesome  

150
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,810
What is this?

151
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,140
  Ointment  

152
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,830
 You got a text! 

153
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,170
Honey! You got a message!

154
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,830
 You got a text! 

155
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,450
I said you got a message!

156
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,590
 You got a text! 

157
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,930
Seriously. Does this ajumma not have ears?

158
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,590
  Notification of automatic termination of international roaming service.  

159
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,780
What is this? Roaming?

160
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,670
Is Mother-in-law doing well?

161
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,970
Ah. It's always the same. She makes a fuss about being in pain and after a few days—

162
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,520
I told you to not drink it like this.

163
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,980
I should call her.

164
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,490
For what?

165
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,710
What? I can't call her?

166
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,520
I mean... I'm worried that if you call that country old folkster,  she'll just feign being ill again.

167
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,430
Don't go calling her for no reason.

168
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,820
Did Joo Yeon come home early?

169
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,030
Well... I think she came right after her extra classes at the institute.

170
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,990
  Il Gwang HiTech  

171
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,640
How did you injure your arm?

172
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,030
While doing some personal business during the weekend, I got slightly hurt.

173
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,660
I don't think it's slightly.

174
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,600
I'll make sure it doesn't affect my work.

175
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,970
- What did you do during the weekend? 
 - Why do you want to know?

176
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,160
I mean, you come back hurt after each weekend.

177
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,990
Do you perhaps do something like kickboxing?

178
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,900
No way.

179
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,910
Or do you have a dangerous hobby?

180
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,310
I'm not the type to enjoy life-risking hobbies.

181
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:28,710
You don't hang out with dangerous people, do you?

182
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:41,470
Everyone around me is so normal that it's boring.

183
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,690
- Then I should have taken you with me. 
 - I'm sorry?

184
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,640
Things are always chaotic for several months after you get hired, while you try to get adjusted.

185
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,770
I thought I would be cursed at for being a mean boss if I dragged you on a business trip during the weekend.

186
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,540
I told you to take a break but you come back injured.

187
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,790
I should have just brought you with me.

188
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,960
I was also worried because Secretary Byeon is the type to go harsh on people.

189
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,660
What do you mean?

190
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,760
I mean... I was worried you would quit.

191
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,990
Well, seeing you have come to work makes me feel relieved.

192
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,700
Other than you getting hurt.

193
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,370
Don't get hurt again. It's worrying.

194
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,540
  November 3, 2019  

195
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,220
  November 3, 2019  

196
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,510
  15 years ago  

197
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,660
  Please go back.  

198
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,790
  Just give me a minute. I'll leave once I see his face. 

199
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,970
  After the termination of your contract, private meetings  

200
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,850
  are not allowed. I'm sure you have signed that oath. 

201
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,540
  I'm meeting him as a brother-like friend. 

202
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,650
 Not as my student.  

203
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,940
  That is all the more reason why you can't come in.  

204
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,810
  Go back.  

205
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,920
♫  You’re doing well, right?   ♫

206
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,900
  Seok Ho    
 ♫  Today feels cozy as spring  ♫

207
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,810
♫   I look back on that day   ♫

208
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:33,310
♫   And softly close my eyes   ♫

209
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,180
I'll take my leave.

210
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,970
Who is that?

211
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,500
You hired a woman?

212
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,740
What's the occasion?

213
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,360
You may meet them outside, but you never let a woman in your office.

214
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,090
If you came to meddle because you have too much free time, just drink your tea and leave. I'm busy.

215
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,810
Can I not even interfere this much? Considering our relationship?

216
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,200
I'll just consider it heard.

217
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,520
The tea doesn't taste great. My mouth feels dry, too.

218
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,780
The secretary must not be taking proper care of your pantry.

219
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,860
Why? The tea served in Executive Director Myeong's office must be extraordinarily good.

220
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,750
I heard he had gone to Henan for a business trip a couple of days ago.

221
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,710
Looks like he must have given you really high quality tea.

222
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,600
I am a shareholder of this company.

223
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,660
It's a given that I get along well with the influential people.

224
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,620
You're the CEO, but you're acting so narrow-minded.

225
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,240
Department Head, for some reason, a female guest has come.

226
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,940
Madam must have come in.

227
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,310
Madam?

228
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,370
Why are you so surprised?

229
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,650
I mean... she's so pretty.

230
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,260
I agree. She sure is pretty.

231
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,640
  Seok Ho got married? 

232
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,420
 I guess he is at an age where he could have gotten married early and have two or three kids. 

233
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,630
Should I say ex-Madam? They are divorced right now.

234
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,410
 Why didn't I see that in the report? 

235
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,570
Put this in a vase, and go put it in his office.

236
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,510
But the CEO doesn't like this type of flower.

237
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,520
You know what flower he likes? How long have you known him?

238
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:59,310
Would you know better than the Madam, who is his ex-wife by law, or me, who worked for him for eight years? Would you?

239
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,170
Of course not. I'll place it there.

240
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,630
Go.

241
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,700
Father will soon announce he is coming forward as a candidate.

242
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,580
Why are you telling me that?

243
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:26,000
Don't you know how good I am at preparing for things?

244
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:32,180
I know very well. You're someone who wrote a premarital contract before we even met in person.

245
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:37,340
That's better than being like you, an heir who had no plans or preparations for anything,

246
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,850
and just casually got married to someone because his family pestered him about it.

247
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,230
I don't need the full plan, just get to the point.

248
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,690
I'm finding this boring to listen to.

249
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,710
I'm telling you to prepare your slush funds in advance. It's difficult to make them all at once.

250
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:10,330
It's also a problem when a person is too consistent. Someone needs to change when it's time to change to become human.

251
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,550
What's wrong? Ever since we first saw each other and got married,

252
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:20,400
I've always had eyes only for you, consistently.

253
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,640
Consistently. That's right. Since you only look at my money.

254
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,460
I sure like how you are so consistently honest.

255
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,800
I'll look forward to how long you can last.

256
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,640
It's very awkward. I've never seen a woman in here.

257
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,890
  Niece~ You haven't forgotten about Saturday's meeting, right?  

258
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,930
  Make sure that you keep your promise that you won't bother me until the company project is over.  

259
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,740

  The ramen here is delicious.

  Then I'll get dumplings and—   

267
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,720
 -  Please give me rice cake ramen. 
 - Yes.

  Last time I saw her, she looked healthy.

  I'm sure she'll get better soon. She's going to get better.

  Oh, it's here.

  You don't eat green onions?  

276
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:37,320
  Fresh green onions are a bit spicy so I don't really like them.  

277
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,340

  No matter how I think of it, someone must have leaked information from inside.  

289
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:25,130
  Our side found out that Pi Cheol Woong was leaving the country only two hours before, but that Division Director Tak jerk was already on board the plane!  

290
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,280
 If we analyze Division Director Tak's itinerary before he boarded the plane, I'm sure we'll find something.   

291
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,030
  I have information that Pi Cheol Woong will be boarding a plane that leaves in two hours.

Yes.

Just like that! Nice.

00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:01,220
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go. Loaded base, come on.

I trust you, okay? Come on...

303
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,660
Ah! What is this? What are you doing? Get this away from me!

304
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,410
I saw some huge garbage, so I wanted to vacuum it.

305

But the garbage is too big, it won't get sucked in.

T-Take it off. Argh!

307
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,430
Oh! I got a call. What perfect timing.

308
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,480
Jeez, why is that woman so strong?

00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,220
Hello?

310
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,650
What bullshit are you talking about? Why should I clock in during the weekend? Did you have a morning drink?

311
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,040
Overtime pay?

312
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,090
You know it's double the pay on weekends, right, Team Leader?

313
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,100
Oh of course.

314
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,850
Team Leader! I can't get in contact with Sunbae Chan Mi.

315
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,410
She probably spent the night drinking and is now sleeping; she's not answering on purpose.

316
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,940
Keep calling until her battery runs out.

317
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,580
What do you mean by where am I? I'm in Nonhyeon-dong, of course.

318
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:07,310
Good question. Why do you think I came here on a weekend morning?

319
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,420
I must have come here because Royal Hotel is in Nonhyeon-dong.

320
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:16,290
Aunt. I told you I'm too busy for this these days.

321
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,350
What do you mean by send a picture?

322
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,500
I told you I really wore a skirt.

323
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,250
Of course, I did my makeup.

324
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,930
Did you think I would have come out without taking the sleep out of my eyes?

325
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,490
Whatever. I'm hanging up. Okay.

326
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,680
You're having expectations again. At this rate, I might

327
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,750
get hit by a bomb and lose my mind.

328
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,990
♫  I know you feel this beat  ♫

329
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:22,050
♫  If you know, don't be shy   ♫

330
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,560
♫  Don't  cry, it's all a thing of the past  ♫

331
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:35,390
Since it's the weekend, I don't have anyone to look after my child, what should I do?

332
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,990
You need to swallow that. Do you know how much effort I put into cooking for you?

333
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,220
Yes. What hotel did you say in Nonhyeon-dong?

334
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,530
Royal Hotel?

335
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,790
Yes. I know.

336
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,320
  Ssak Ssak Clean  

337
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,110
Chief Ok has arrived.

338
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,480
At Il Gwang?

339
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,900
Yes.

340
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:25,070
Il Gwang is the best corporation in this country. That's quite impressive.

341
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,900
You are even more outstanding, Ms. Chan Mi.

342
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,060
You are so passionate about your work, to the point that your arm got injured.

343
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,290
Here you go.

344
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,780
Your knife skills

345
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,660
are really good.

346
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,180
My knife skills are basic. I'm better at cooking.

347
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,700
I'll cook for you, myself, next time. Chopped steak so it's easy to eat.

348
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,400
Next time?

349
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,980
 That's right. There are more than thirty subsidiary companies of Il Gwang.  

350
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,620
 What does it matter? 

351
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,400
But what kind of work did you say you do?

352
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,550
I... just work at a normal company

353
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,490
as a foreign affair—

354
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,440
So you work in the foreign business? 
   Team Leader Dung  

355
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,150
It's something similar.

356
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,860
  Team Leader Dung  

357
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,310
Give me a moment.

358
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:46,130
Due to a very urgent situation, the customer isn't able to pick up the phone.

359
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:50,800
If you call again, she might just simply turn off her phone.

360
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,650
- Goodbye. See you tomorrow. 
 - Hey. Hey.

361
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,140
Baek Chan Mi!

362
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,050
- It was a J.S. 
 - A J.S.?

363
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,830
A rude jinsang (sourpuss jerk).

364
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:25,660
What are you doing, Hwang Mi Soon? Aren't you going in?

365
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,420
Going in.

366
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:34,010
♫ Shall I go help the customers?  ♫

367
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,700
What's wrong with this?

368
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,210
  Why are you here, Unni?  

369
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,270
  And what are you doing here?  

370
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,000
  Are you...  

371
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,670
  Are you...  

372
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,760
She... She... Why is she there?

373
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,710
Chan Mi. Where do you want to go for the second round?

374
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,350
Let's have the second round later.

375
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,980
I'm sorry but an urgent matter came up.

376
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,050
You bastard!

377
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,190
- Don't leave. 
 -  What are you doing? Let go of me.

378
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,310
We are already over. Go back.

379
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,110
We dated for seven years.

380
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,050
We broke up not long ago and you're already

381
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,660
meeting another girl?!

382
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,360
Didn't you say you loved me? That I was the only one!

383
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,650
- What a bastard. 
 - Do something about this, please.

384
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,040
Do you see this? I'll proudly meet someone else and live well.

385
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,700
So stop it. Leave!

386
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,460
You two should talk alone. Alone.

387
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,760
Leave. Please leave!

388
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,650
- Oh, Jo In Sung? 
 - Jo In Sung?

389
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,450
What is going—

390
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,340
What just happened there?

391
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,040
Jo In Sung?

392
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,210
What is this? Where did they go?

393
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,440
Where did they go?

394
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,160
I really wanted this to go well.

395
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,720
I really must have no luck with men.

396
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,470
I'm sorry.

397
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,710
Where did they go?

398
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,680
Underneath?

399
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,510
Oppa!

400
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,800
What should I do?

401
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,250
Are you okay? Are you okay?

402
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,780
Come back to your senses.

403
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:31,370
You ignored my call, neglected the operation, and brushed aside orders. You're doing very well.

404
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,250
Did you see everything?

405
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,690
From romance to suspense and twist.

406
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,050
You had fun admiring this masterpiece of a scene that could outshine an Avengers film, didn't you?

407
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,560
Rather than romance, it was more like a ridiculous soap opera.

408
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,900
Don't you know? Ridiculous dramas are the trend.

409
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,500
Careful of the stairs.

410
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,540
Oppa, are you okay?

411
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,450
Why did you do that?

412
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,290
Chief Ok postponed his order and is waiting on a customer.

413
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,770
- Hey newbie.
 - Yes.

414
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,780
- Want to try the new menu? 
 - New menu?

415
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,930
Sure! Why not?

416
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,160
How come? This looks so good.

417
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,090
Very good. Very good.

418
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:48,440
  Michael: We got exposed to the NIS. I'll contact you later.  

419
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,180
Oh. Chief Ok is moving.

420
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,630
What is this? Dammit.

421
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,520
Oh my god. Oh my god, how come—

422
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,540
  Hwang Mi Soon, get out quickly. 

423
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,080
Go out now? Why?

424
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,760
We are waiting outside so hurry up.

425
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,950
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

426
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,250
Why aren't you coming out?

427
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,950
- Oh wait. Sorry. 
 - What the?

428
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,740
I'm sorry!

429
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,390
Hey. Follow them.

430
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,200
  Ssak Ssak Clean  

431
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,370
She's coming. She's coming!

432
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,100
Hurry!

433
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,820
Hurry!

434
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,790
Unni! Get on!

435
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,380
Why didn't you get me earlier?

436
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,140
- Hurry. 
 - Goodness, really.

437
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,710
Get going.

438
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,980
Team Leader!

439
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,400
- Team Leader. 
 - Stop.

440
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,210
Why are you so late?

441
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm sorry. The taxi went the wrong way.

442
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,480
- Move it. 
 - Yes.

443
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,700
You should have let the first customer take their ride.

444
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,910
I'm sorry.

445
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,670
Ahjusshi, can you turn the air conditioner to high?

446
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,380
Yes, I will.

447
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,820
Oh, there they are. What are you doing? We're losing them, stick close!

448
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,000
I also want to go faster. Ugh.

449
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,300
I'm sorry. I couldn't find anyone to take care of her so suddenly.

450
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,780
But it seems like Chief Ok is going toward the research center, though.

451
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,480
What is this dude doing?

452
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:56,260
  Michael: We got exposed to the NIS. I'll contact you later.  

453
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,010
Ajusshi. Can you speed up?

454
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,420
I have to stay under the speed limit.

455
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,930
I told you to speed up!

456
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,810
Oh oh.

457
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,700
What's wrong with them?

458
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,010
Ajusshi. To the right. You have to go to the research center!

459
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,220
He's been going round and round all this time only to go to the research lab?

460
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,530
He's caught on to us following him.

461
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,460
If he had any sense, it would've been in the coffee shop.

462
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,600
Yeah.

463
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,520
Sure, it's not like I wasn't at fault.

464
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,570
But if only Mi Soon came out a bit earlier, would we have failed?

465
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,250
What are you saying?

466
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:49,300
I'm the only one that was on time. What nonsense are you spouting.

467
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,950
I also tried to come quickly, but Team Leader called so last minute.

468
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,720
- Exactly. 
 - Exactly.

469
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,660
So in the end, it's all my fault.

470
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,380
If you're going to be like this, just quit!

471
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,140
Stop the car!

472
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,970
I'm not expecting some kind of extraordinary teamwork.

473
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,400
I'm not even expecting the same skills as before.

474
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,480
Still, you guys should do the bare minimum! Bare minimum!

475
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,410
I'm sorry.

476
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:51,170
We can just go take Chief Ok's phone and get Michael's number.

477
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,250
If you can, then go ahead and try!

478
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,130
You think I can't do it? Because I can't do the bare minimum?

479
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,510
Because I'm doing less than the minimum?

480
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:03,930
Wait. If we take Chief Ok's phone and get Michael's number, it's really over.

481
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,390
It's easy to say. How are you going to get Chief Ok's phone?

482
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:11,060
We can just take it secretly. It'll probably take less than three seconds.

483
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:16,230
Sunbae. Ever since the third round of developments started, he won't come out of the research center.

484
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,590
Today is probably the first time in a week that he came out.

485
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,220
Then we can just go into the research center.

486
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,920
If we infiltrate using a security system error again, they might find it suspicious.

487
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,530
That's right. The one who was watching us with fire in his eyes, you know? His glare was no joke.

488
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,010
Really?

489
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:39,580
But thanks to our efforts last time, at least we found a path to sneak in.

490
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:47,870
Wait... You aren't talking about that place, right?

491
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,980
  Hello?  

492
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,590
  if you could bend upwards just a little bit more.  

493
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,550
I'm not doing it. I said it.

494
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,350
I'm never doing it. I'm not doing it.

495
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,180
I'm not doing it.

496
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,200
I'm not doing it.

497
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,770
Why me?

498
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,450
You said we should do it.

499
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,620
You were the first one to say we should go in.

500
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,440
  Congratulations. Commemorative cast for your return to the field.  

501
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,540
Why does it always have to be me in these situations, of all times?

502
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,520
Why? Why? Why! Why is it me?

503
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,440
Why are you guys doing this to me?

504
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,920
Why me? Why?

505
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,820
I'm not doing it. I'm leaving.

506
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,020
Drive.

507
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,360
Sunbae.

508
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,720
It might help if you wear compression stockings.

509
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,820
If you aren't going in my stead, get them away from me.

510
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,180
I will be watching from the outside. Be careful.

511
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,770
If something happens, use blue code—

512
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:10,530
If you aren't going in my stead, shut up.

513
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,620
It's a blindspot for surveillance cameras, so it's safe.

514
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,940
The security is also less tight there since it's the parking lot area.

515
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,640
If you're not going over in my stead,

516
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,340
- go away. 
 - Okay.

517
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,330
I'll go away.

518
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,340
To the side.

519
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,990
Unni. Be careful.

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,410
She got over. Get ready.

541
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,180
Yes.

542
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,590
I... I can't believe I came back over here.

543
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,740
  Il Gwang Research Lab Chief Ok Cheol 

544
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,580
What is this? Ugh.

545
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,810
I'm going to die first of some lung disease.

546
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:00,260
  Il Gwang Research Center Chief Ok Cheol  

547
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,860
  It could be dangerous.  

548
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:14,500
 If we all die together, at least we won't be lonely. 

549
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,560
That scared me.

550
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,230
Why did he scream?

551
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,890
Chief! Are you okay? Are you okay?

552
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,780
- O-O-Over there. 
 - O-Over there.

553
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,300
- Over t-t-there. 
 - U-U-Up?

554
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,540
- Th-There's something. 
 - U-Up there?

555
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,310
I'm sorry but nothing's there.

556
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,160
Nothing?

557
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,470
Yes. Look.

558
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,670
There's nothing at all.

559
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,780
There, it's there!

560
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,110
It's there. It's over there!

561
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,370
Because of m-me.

562
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:08,840
Th-The one I killed...

563
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,620
Chief. You should rest a bit.

564
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,090
No. No.

565
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,200
No...

566
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,050
  Install  

567
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,830
  Ready  

568
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,020
  Start  

569
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,250
Chief, are you okay?

570
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:14,930
I'm sorry about before.

571
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:19,120
Don't be. I thought you had been scared by the research center's big-headed ghost.

572
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,280
A ghost?

573
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,760
You didn't know? This used to be a mental hospital before it became our research center.

574
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,980
Not at all. I didn't know.

575
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,520
At first glance, it looks like a hospital building.

576
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,180
It's white and square.

577
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:39,210
It's said there were so many patients the hospital forcefully restrained.

578
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,040
  Warning 0% -  Administrator Privileges...

  Warning 1% -  Administrator Privileges...  

580
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,660
Why are you doing this to me?

581
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,390
Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on.

582
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:57,960
Hurry up. Hurry up.

583
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,510
That's right. Let's go. Let's go.

584
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,670
Let's go.

585
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,340
But there must have been a fire in the hospital, they said.

586
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:10,450
Those many people were stuck, couldn't get out, and all died.

587
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,300
There was a patient that they found at the hospital entrance afterward,

588
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:18,530
but the person was found dead like this, with their head stuck in the window

589
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,460
That's the big-headed ghost?

590
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:31,930
That definitely... wasn't the face of a human.

00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,150
Almost.

594
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,140

00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:00,860
Come on. Just come in, Chief.

598
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,770
Look. No one is there.

599
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,490
Right?

600
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:11,900
It's all the worker's imagination. Where in the world do ghosts exist?

601
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,480
- I'm leaving to do my work. 
 - Hey.

602

Hey.

Hey!

609
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,550
This is killing me.

610
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,000
What the? Oh dammit.

611
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,990
What's this, seriously.

612
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:49,750
Chief! Chief!

613
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,880
- What's wrong with him since before? 
 - Send help here, someone passed out.

614
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,520
Seriously.

615
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,730
What is this?

616
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:08,980
What's wrong with your face?

617
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,590
Why? What?

618
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:13,300
- What is this? 
 - Do I have something?

619
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,530
Are you sure nothing happened?

620
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,340
Of course.

621
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:20,870
I was so sneaky not even a ghost would've known I was there.

622
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:22,020
  Active phone  

623
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,910
I got ahold of Chief Ok's phone.

624
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:28,140
Now we just have to find Michael's phone number.

625
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,500
  Michael  

626
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,080
What? Did you already find it?

It's saved on speed dial number zero.

628
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,330
Michael. It's this, right?

629
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,730
Extreme stress and fatigue can deteriorate the body and cause people

630
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:58,130
to faint, so you don't have to worry too much.

631
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:03,610
I thought that might have happened because of me. Thank you.

632
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:10,220
  Michael  

633
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,010
The phone is turned on. Try finding its location.

634
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:21,840
Find the location of the phone number I just sent you. As fast as possible.

♫   Think about it, we have only one life ♫

643

♫   One where we can get everything we want in one shot ♫

644
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,400
♫   Do you perhaps know about perception?  ♫

645
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:03,050
♫   The perception that’s about sense / Choose a world where you only need that ♫

  Epilogue  

648
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,620
I didn't eat much for dinner earlier...

649
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:44,150
It became all grubby.

650
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,000
A-Are you okay? Your neck. Neck.

651
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,080
Did you just hit me?

652
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:09,210
N-N-No. I was going to organize the documents.

653
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:11,890
N-No, I just c-c-came here and you

654
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,640
y-you were d-dozing off here s-so I,

655
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,180
I-I-I was going to h-help you.

656
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:21,600
So-so why did you stay until late? You should have just gone home

657
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,300
to rest comfortably. Oh Gosh.

658
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:29,920
♫   It's a red light for the foolish boy, a red ocean   ♫

659
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,380
♫   Maybe it's because I fell for her at first sight   ♫

660
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:39,080
♫   She gives me a blue light, a blue ocean just for me  ♫

661
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,350
♫   Not just anyone can love her   ♫

662
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,330
  Good Casting  

663
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:45,200
 Could Chief Ok have noticed the CCTV in his office? 

664
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,090
 Find more information on Baek Chan Mi's route. Unofficially. 

665
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:51,100
  Who should we catch first? Ding dong deng, here. 

666
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:51,880
 Who sent you? 

667
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,390
  Kang Woo Won's memories haven't returned, have they? 

668
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:55,090
 I don't know. 

669
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:57,860
 I'll drive. I'm pretty good. 

670
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,310
 - Don't make sharp turns! 
 - Did you just speak casually to me? 

671
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,070
 Look forward. (speaking casually) 

672
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:04,310
  - Your father passed away? 
 - I still don't understand why he went to Busan three years ago. 

673
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:05,450
 You have to teach me how to use the rice cooker. 

674
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:08,940
 Are you joking with me right now? We can't be like this today. 

675
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,630
 Baek Chan Mi isn't ordinary. If we get caught, 

676
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,970
 take care of her quietly. 

677
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:16,620
♫   Red backpack   ♫
