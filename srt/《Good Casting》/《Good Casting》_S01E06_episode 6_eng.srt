00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,180
 Episode 6 

2
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,720
We're already here?

3
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,920
What. What's wrong?

4
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,090
I can't open my eyes.

5
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,830
I said I can't open my eyes!

6
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,140
Oh my Jesus.

7
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,570
Did you perhaps consume peanuts?

8
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,310
Don't you know that I can't even touch them because of my peanut allergy?

9
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,790
Didn't you eat pistachios?

10
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,560
Exactly. I ate pistachios but not peanuts.

11
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,910
From now on, just hold my hands and follow me.

12
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,170
  Taipei International Airport 

13
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,840
 ...informs you that Flight 02222 is delayed. 

14
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,820
They would've gotten away with it if I hadn't stepped in, you know.

15
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,910
I will do the interrogation when we arrive.

16
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,650
It isn't a matter you can decide.

17
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,850
You aren't the team leader, I am.

18
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,890
Before you talk about our ranks, you should talk about our skills first.

19
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,450
You haven't been promoted all this time because you always take the safest steps.

20
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,790
So what if you have amazing skills?

21
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,050
You can't even control your emotions and let them get into your actual performance.

22
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,070
- Verrückt! (German for crazy, insane)
 - You just swore at me, didn't you!

23
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,830
I guess you didn't only get older since you have some sense.

24
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,780
Don't fool around.

25
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,680
 The flight to Incheon will now begin boarding. 

26
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,480
Flight to Incheon?

27
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,170
Kang Woo Won did not 
 Taipei International Airport VIP Lounge 

28
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,180
purposely consume peanuts.

29
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,590
Yes, I should have been more careful

30
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,270
since pistachios are part of the nut family.

31
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm in charge of the event. It's all my fault.

32
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,000
Return to Korea immediately

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,550
and come see me.

34
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,440
Got it, Assistant Manager. Once I get back to Korea, I'll contact you—

35
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,840
- Water. 
 - Water.

36
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,500
What is this? It's not the French natural spring water I usually drink!

37
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,490
They don't have the water you usually drink over here.

38
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,820
It's because you look for it within this teeny tiny space.

39
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,140
In this large airport that serves tens of thousands of people.

40
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,950
Do you really think they wouldn't have the French natural spring water I drink?

41
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,060
So you're telling me to search this entire airport—

42
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,180
I'm telling you to search for it.

43
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,710
I can see you.

44
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,760
Of course. It's not easy to walk away from my face.

45
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,720
But, pay up if you plan on staring for more than three seconds.

46
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,080
My portrait rights are expensive, you know.

47
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,540
If she's poor, she should at least know her place.

48
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,200
Oh, this feels good.

49
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,030
Oh, this is really refreshing.

50
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,880
I love this.

51
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,590
  If you received the money, you should do your part.  

52
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,230
  Find the item.  

53
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,290
  It's been said that Pi Cheol Woong will be boarding a plane  

54
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,260
  that takes off in two hours.  

55
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,660
  You're him, aren't you? Michael?  

56
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,790
Shit.

57
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,750
  Seoul  

58
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,600
  Ssak Ssak Cleaning (Swiftly Clean)  

59
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,180
- Let's go. 
 - Alright.

60
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,370
Chief, where are we going?

61
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,560
The place I mentioned to you before. Go to that place.

62
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,970
- We are not returning to our base?
 - Just go.

63
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,400
Okay.

64
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,450
  Director Seo  

65
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,400
 The person you are trying to call... 

66
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,140
Find out how things are going in Taipei.

67
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,960
Hey, Team Dong. I'm not going to wear uniforms from now on, alright?

68
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,920
This is just...

69
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,440
I have to squeeze my body into these clothes. You call these clothes?

70
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,610
How about losing some weight?

71
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,430
It's my style. What are you talking about?

72
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,900
What is this? Did you get hurt? Let me see.

73
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,430
It's nothing. I'm fine.

74
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,450
What do you mean by you're fine? You got hurt by Division Director Tak, right? Let me see.

75
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,850
I should've checked the shoulder first.

76
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,730
- Let me see. 
 - I'm fine.

77
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,840
Did you check if Ye Eun arrived safely?

78
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,580
Hey!

79
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,660
Walk slowly! Slowly. Seriously.

80
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,880
I'm not the one going.

81
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,400
What?

82
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,200
What do you mean? Where are you going after abandoning me?

83
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,070
That's not it.

84
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,350
My hands are sweating a lot.

85
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,190
See what happens if you let go for even a second.

86
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,320
For a person with so much suspicion and even more fear,

87
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,230
how could you go to an overseas schedule without a manager, and just me?

88
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,360
That is why this kind of unavoidable incident happens.

89
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,470
Traveling with many people is annoying and I don't like people from my agency.

90
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,940
He always thinks about himself.

91
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,430
Trying to give me hard times by any means.

92
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,370
They don't like me.

93
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,930
They love the money-making Kang Woo Won,

94
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,290
but hate the human Kang Woo Won.

95
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,830
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

96
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,730
Where are you? You're so dead.

97
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,480
Come over here. Come here!

98
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,660
You're dead.

99
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,580
They may hate you, but they have their reasons.

100
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,910
Just wait until I recover my vision. I won't let this slide.

101
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,810
Prepare yourself.

102
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,250
Awesome. It's Kang Woo Won.

103
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,700
- He's at the Incheon airport!
- #KangWooWonattheairport

104
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,810
 - Who's the girl next to him?
 - Wonnie in a maskTT
 - Returned home out of nowhere? 

105
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,950
  He's back!  

106
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,980
How did they know and come in?

107
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,250
Ah this is driving me nuts.

108
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,240
  I love you, Kang Woo Won!  

109
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:22,860
♫   And I will always love you   ♫

110
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,400
♫   I will always   ♫

111
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,560
Make sure to stay by my side.

112
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,740
One, two, three.

113
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:44,820
♫   I will always love  you   ♫

114
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,790
♫   I will always love  you   ♫

115
00:11:52,780 --> 00:12:01,030
♫   I I will love  you   ♫

116
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,000
  National Security Guard House  

117
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,870
What is this phone?

118
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,110
What is this? Untie this.

119
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,040
Untie this!

120
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,430
It seems like words aren't enough.

121
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,960
Moo Hyeok, bring it over.

122
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,710
Alright.

123
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,180
Oh, this is quite heavy.

124
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,710
Why did you bring that?

125
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,450
That's for later, so put it away.

126
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,120
Okay.

127
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,000
  Hazardous Material 
 Handle With Care  

128
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,260
You haven't seen liquid nitrogen before?

129
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,950
This is really neat and clean.

130
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,650
No one likes to see blood these days. No ripping off fingernails or cutting off toes.

131
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,520
As you know, we hate dirty things.

132
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,000
That's right. You will really like this.

133
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,350
Seriously.

134
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,560
Look closely.

135
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,790
Isn't this neat?

136
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,980
Why are you doing this to me?

137
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,050
This gas is -196 degrees Celsius. Just coming into contact with it will kill you.

138
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,730
Why are we talking about death and not getting started?

139
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,650
Excuse me. You are not putting my hand in there for real, are you?

140
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,880
That can't happen.

141
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,070
Is the hammer ready?

142
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,480
Yes. Here's the hammer.

143
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,770
Give me a minute. Let's talk.

144
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,660
That's just a few seconds.

145
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,230
You will need at least five minutes to crush it to pieces.

146
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,050
My hand...

147
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,300
She's right. Do it again.

148
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,730
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Give me time to think.

149
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,630
Wang Kai!

150
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,260
Who?

151
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,550
- Wang Kai. 
 - Wang Kai?

152
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,510
Who is Wang Kai? You should explain it in order.

153
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,830
I-I was told to give the item

154
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:01,810
to Wang Kai in T-Taipei.

155
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,880
What about this?

156
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,380
When I arrived, I was told that Wang Kai would contact me through this phone.

157
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,260
Exactly. Who gave you this phone?

158
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,880
I don't know who it was.

159
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,550
I really don't know.

160
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,750
I think it's true.

161
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,120
Hey. You make sure to flush that dry ice in the toilet.

162
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,520
Dry ice. Dry ice?

163
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,970
You will burn your hand. Be careful.

164
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,070
- Is it good?
 -  My Mom is ET  is my favorite flavor.

165
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,590
How can this be? It's frozen solid. I can't stop.

166
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,250
- Let me have a bite. 
 - Here you go.

167
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,340
Tastes good, right?

168
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,770
- Should I give you some? 
 - I don't want to eat it.

169
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,650
Nah, I know you do.

170
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,430
Poor thing.

171
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,990
Are you out of your mind?

172
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,710
My stamina has gone down due to the 10-hour round-trip flights.

173
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,720
I also had an allergic reaction to peanuts due to the unskilled person in charge

174
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,870
and my eyes are super swollen to the point I can't see.

175
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,520
And now, you are leaving this top celeb Kang Woo Won in this state by himself?

176
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,020
It must be too much for you to be alone without me, right?

177
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,540
What are you talking about? Of course, I will be fine.

178
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,030
- Are you sure? 
 - Of course.

179
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,260
Then, can I really leave?

180
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,420
I told you. Having you next to me is troublesome, bothersome, and annoying.

181
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,830
Your existence really hurts my head.

182
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,250
Yeah. Your existence was like that from the start.

183
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,300
Then, I guess I am like fine dust.

184
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
That's such an accurate representation.

185
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,330
You're not just fine dust, but really bad fine dust.

186
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:45,090
If I didn't have you, I wouldn't have any problems. Obviously.

187
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,220
If you need anything, give me a call.

188
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,010
The French natural spring water that you drink

189
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,530
is under the sofa.

190
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,890
The snacks that the Italian chef made

191
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,730
are on the table.

192
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,630
The air filtration system is on. The hygrometer and the humidifier are also...

193
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,420
Just leave.

194
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,250
I'm really going.

195
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,300
You're still here?

196
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,980
She really left because I told her to.

197
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,230
Did you leave?

198
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,800
Hello?

199
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,440
She left.

200
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,170
Why can't I open my eyes?

201
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,460
Alright. Thankfully, we found the item.

202
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,950
Let's find Wang Kai's location with this chip.

203
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,330
Through Wang Kai, we are going to get the seller and the broker, Michael at the same time.

204
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,410
Simple, right?

205
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,280
Simple, my butt.

206
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,500
Wang Kai is in Taiwan. How are we going to make him come all the way to Korea?

207
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,800
I think there is no need to call him. He will just come.

208
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,270
Oh, wow. The GPS is so tiny.

209
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,420
The newly released ones are even smaller.

210
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,790
Dammit. What's up with ours?

211
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,040
If a GPS can track whereabouts, that's all that matters.

212
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,130
Is that important? Is this the time to pick on that?

213
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,690
But would Wang Kai really

214
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,050
come to Korea just because the item is here?

215
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,720
It's worth several hundred million won.

216
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,850
Then he'll come. He'll come immediately.

217
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:48,000
We'll keep it safe until Wang Kai contacts us. Until then, stay in your spots.

218
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,610
That's it. Everyone worked hard.

219
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,130
Let's go.

220
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,920
- Yes, honey? 
 - Is something wrong?

221
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,750
- Yeah. I just got here. 
 - Of course, I escorted him well.

222
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,330
- There is rice in the rice cooker and soup in the pot. 
 - I was going to call you once we arrived.

223
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,640
- What do you mean there is nothing to eat? 
 - I thought it would be rude to call during the weekend.

224
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,260
- Am I your chef? 
 - Kang Woo Won can work

225
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,650
- Shut up! Bye! 
 - once he recovers.

226
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,640
Hello?

227
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:28,710
  Aunt  

228
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:40,160
Sunbae, your aunt called because you aren't picking up.

229
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,370
Hurry and pick up the call.

230
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,320
When did you get here?

231
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,550
It wasn't easy, right?

232
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,440
I'm sorry.

233
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,780
I'm looking for a nanny.

234
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,520
When did you change her diaper?

235
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,170
I'm not sure. I changed it earlier.

236
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,210
Was it in the morning? I could have done in in the afternoon.

237
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,210
Hey, So Hee. Let mommy change your diaper.

238
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:33,000
You didn't give her a hard time because I wasn't with you right?

239
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,300
You are the one who has to go out into the field.

240
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,810
You are here babysitting her on weekends. I'm really sorry.

241
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,560
If you're sorry, make sure you succeed in the operation.

242
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,070
For my golden weekend and rest days to be worthwhile,

243
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,190
Michael should be caught.

244
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,650
Does Michael even exist?

245
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,330
What do you mean?

246
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,880
So many people tried to catch him for several years.

247
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,420
We are not even close to catching him,

248
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,850
and no one has met him. It makes me feel a bit...

249
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,560
What do you mean no one has seen Michael?

250
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,890
Was it three years ago? When an agent died on a mission at the Busan harbor,

251
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,750
Sunbae Baek—

252
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,930
Did someone die?

253
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,400
I should leave now. If you went all the way to Taiwan, you must be tired by now.

254
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,160
Why is my body aching as if I were the one who went there?

255
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,230
By the way, do you know how to view those documents that are only available to higher ranks?

256
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,160
You'll have to get to that higher rank. Or you could ask someone in those positions.

257
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,330
Trying something impossible could give you a headache, you know.

258
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,100
Take a rest.

259
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,990
Sunbae, take a taxi on your way home.

260
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,480
It's fine. I'm leaving.

261
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,630
I've started gardening as a hobby, but

262
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,570
these guys are making trouble.

263
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,880
Tsk.

264
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,530
That's pesticide and this is rice husk vinegar. 
  (pyroligneous acid from charred rice husks) 

265
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,630
To pests, burnt smells are like poison, you see.

266
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,820
  Pesticide and Rice Husk Vinegar  

267
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,280
They are all going into my belly. I shouldn't use pesticides.

268
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,200
People like worm-eaten farm goods for being organic, you know.

269
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,600
I don't care if worms take a bite or two.

270
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,520
That's how they survive. I should let it slide.

271
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,240
But... They put their hands on my food.

272
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,900
Eradicating these right from the beginning is how you maintain things well-kept.

273
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,580
What do I do? I kill worms before they reproduce.

274
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,500
Take your hands off of everything. Leave, without taking even a grain of dust with you.

275
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,650
Yes, this is Chief Ok.

276
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,920
From now on, you'll have to move in person.

277
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,960
Yes. Don't worry, Sir.

278
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,790
I will wrap it up perfectly, so you wouldn't notice the absence of Division Director Tak.

279
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,650
Yes!

280
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,900
Yes!

281
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,780
Division Director Tak has been appointed to Malaysia.

282
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,810
- Out of nowhere? 
 - Yes.

283
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,500
Executive Director Myeong must have decided to cut off that tail.

284
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,040
I don't think so. Division Director Tak isn't someone he can abandon that easily.

285
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,980
He took care of everything for Executive Director Myeong, from trivial to dirty jobs, like a right-hand man.

286
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,870
By the way, I told you to look into something.

287
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,290
Right. The branch manager in Malaysia says

288
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:19,140
that Division Director Tak returned to Korea as soon as he flew into Taipei.

289
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,940
Then...  Division Director Tak being thrown out is definitely related to that.

290
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,170
It could mean that something has gone wrong.

291
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,960
Would this be in our favor or not?

292
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,490
Oh gosh.

293
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,490
Hey.

294
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,990
It's alright, alright.

295
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,800
It must be in our favor. You know, a turtle is a good omen in China.

296
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,030
One is missing.

297
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,990
I gave it to someone as a gift.

298
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,400
- What about me? 
- It was one I cherished.

299
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,590
What are you going to do if it's a bad signal?

300
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,980
I should step up.

301
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,580
Not from underwater like this, but by going up to the surface.

302
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,810
Must you absolutely do that?

303
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,290
I'm so worried something bad might happen to you just like it did for Chairman Yoon.

304
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,190
Exactly. That's why I should do it.

305
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,260
For the sake of my father.

306
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,860
What are you doing here?

307
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,380
I don't think there's any way it could be the case,

308
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,730
but that doll looks so familiar, somehow.

309
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,240
By chance, this doll...

310
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,980
Never mind.

311
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:23,250
He doesn't even give me one. He couldn't have given one to a newbie who's just started working here.

312
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:28,580
No. That can't be. That shouldn't be. What am I saying?

313
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,720
 Later. When I see you next time, 

314
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,280
 I will return this to you. 

315
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,830
  I love you. I love you. 

316
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,520
Excuse me, Mr. CEO.

317
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:16,660
I'm sorry but I think I'll have to leave work now because there is something important going on tonight.

318
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,410
Sure. You can go.

319
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,100
Thank you.

320
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,740
Wait. It's not anything bad, is it?

321
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,110
Pardon?

322
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,740
I mean, you said it's something important. So I'm worried.

323
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,280
It's a personal matter.

324
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,270
I see. You can go now.

 Good luck preparing for the SAT, and I hope you get accepted into university.

♫   The day I suffered from being left alone   ♫

♫  And that day I writhed in my dreams  ♫

♫  And those days remain in me  ♫

365
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,160
The chip password, as expected, used a multimodal method.  (authentication based on multiple biometric indicators) 

366
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,540
- Multimodal?
 - It's a multimodal biometric recognition device.

367
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:46,530
It's the most advanced security system on the market.

368
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,470
And the biometric key is obviously Pi Cheol Woong's.

369
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:54,440
But, it is set so that the locations of the persons with the biometric key and the chip are shared.

370
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,410
In other words, if Pi Cheol Woong and the microchip are more than 10 meters apart for more than an hour,

371
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,950
all the saved data get deleted.

372
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,600
So, are you saying we can't get a copy?

373
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,800
The data will probably get deleted if we attempt to make a copy.

374
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,890
He used a person as a box that he can get rid of after thoroughly using it up.

375
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:17,250
Do you think he was planning to kill him after the business?

376
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,310
After all, people throw out the box first thing when they receive a gift.

377
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,200
Keep your eyes on it 24/7.

378
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,220
- Do you think he will call?
 - In one or two days.

379
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,020
That soon?

380
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,810
The value of stolen items decreases as time goes on. It would be a huge loss to them if the business gets postponed.

381
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,770
Perhaps, could Wang Kai be Michael?

382
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,210
We will know when we catch him.

Hm?

385
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,690
Right.

386
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:30,320
  Kang Woo Won left the country to attend the new product launching event of the electronic rice cooker company he currently models for,  

387
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,890
 but here you see him coming back hurriedly due to a sudden illness. 

388
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:39,290
 Even though the view of his face is blocked, we can tell at a glance he has lost some weight.  
    

389
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:45,170
 Right. Mr. Kang Woo Won returned home earlier than originally planned to receive treatment. 

390
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,230
 But as Mr. Woo Won's airport photos got spread through Social Media,  

391
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,390
  a large group of fans gathered at the airport to get a glimpse of him.  

392
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,030
Wow, that woman.

393
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,900
She's something.

394
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,220
- You must be having fun there.
 - It's amazing.

395
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,980
What is amazing?

396
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,710
She is trying so hard to get you out of there. 
  "Who is the woman protecting Kang Woo Won?" - just  PR staff, agency asks not to overinterpret  

397
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,130
Her face is all crumpled like this.

398
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,080
Biggest humiliation ever.

399
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,240
Yeah, it must be so funny. Right?

400
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:28,220
Why do I keep tearing up?

401
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,430
She's hurling her whole body out there to get your celeb out of there, and yet, you find it funny?

402
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,710
No, it's not funny at all.

403
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:41,480
It's rather touching. Darn it! Darn it!!

404
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,870
Hey, I'm crying because I'm touched.

405
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,510
Don't ever laugh in front of me. It's annoying.

406
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,280
If I don't laugh, what do I do? Do I do this then?

407
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,810
I'm neither crying nor laughing.

408
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,800
Just don't make any facial expressions!

409
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,150
Manager and Director are the same.

410
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,720
Hey, I have a naturally smiley face.

411
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,090
Whenever I cry, I cry with smiley eyes. Woo Won, look.

412
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,130
Hey, come on, Woo Won.

413
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,980
 Chinatown  

414
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,520
Are you alright?

415
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,940
Can't be better.

416
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,830
I'm worried that the NIS might have trodden on our tail.

417
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,970
NIS?

418
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,320
They might suspect us, without any solid evidence, just their conviction.

419
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,060
If something goes wrong...

420
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,870
I don't care. What about Wang Kai's side?

421
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,510
I heard they arrived at the airport.

422
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,460
Oh, already?

423
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,230
Let's see.

424
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,650
Wow. It's very well-made.

425
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,670
This is our chance.

426
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:29,350
Our chance to get rid of the NIS punks all at once.

427
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,490
We are in Korea, not in Taiwan. Do you think it will be possible?

428
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:39,820
It's better we are in Korea. The Korean laws are in favor of criminals, you know.

429
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,730
This time...

430
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,550
I will make a move myself.

431
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,860
- It might be risky. 
- If we all die together,

432
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,030
- I won't be lonely. 
- I will take the items.

433
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,590
We have to do this right.

434
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:06,120
Then, Executive Director Myeong would not look for that stupid Division Director Tak ever again.

435
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,530
Darn.

436
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,290
It would've been the best if he had been found dead then.

437
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,170
Call that bastard right now.

438
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,170
Whoa.

439
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,420
W-Wang Kai!

440
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,750
What shall I do? Oh, man.

441
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,120
Chief, Chief!

442
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,040
We got a call. Wang Kai, Wang Kai.

443
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,320
You dare to make me come to Korea? Our items are safe, right?

444
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,800
Of course. There is no problem.

445
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,090
I'd like to meet you at the Incheon Harbor.

446
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,130
I decide where we meet. Tonight, 10 o'clock.

447
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:12,130
At the Paju distribution center 11-3.

448
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,280
Ten o'clock tonight. At the Paju distribution center depot.

449
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,400
Them making the first move makes me feel uneasy.

450
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,610
When did we ever work based on the levels of danger?

451
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,430
We're leaving  right away, so gather everyone.

452
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,190
You are going to report it to Director Seo, aren't you?

453
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:38,250
I think you should definitely request a supporting force this time.

454
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,960
A supporting team?

455
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,280
You returned to Korea without reporting to me.

456
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,650
Now you barge in and ask for what? A supporting force?

457
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:55,090
- Please approve this. 
- You think you got this task because you guys are so great?

458
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,030
You're running around, not knowing your place and forgetting your status.

459
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:02,180
- I will make sure we wrap this up this time.
 - What if you can't do it?

460
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,730
Are you going to quit?

461
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,650
You don't have guts. How dare you talk about wrapping up?

462
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:13,200
- We don't have time.
 - I'll make it clear.

463
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,770
You have full responsibility for this task.

464
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:39,520
As you know, Wang Kai is the one who is supposed to do do the item transaction with Pi Cheol Woong.

465
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,870
He's a new face. We don't have any information.

466
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,510
In short, any strategies will be meaningless

467
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,180
and we can't determine his threat level.

468
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,590
The transaction will take its place at the Paju distribution center. Pi Cheol Woong will go in himself with the watch.

469
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,050
As a leading team, Baek Chan Mi and Hwang Mi Soon will closely follow Pi Cheol Woong, secretively.

470
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,060
The back-up team and the supporting force will wait outside the building.

471
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,700
When the leading team gives the signal, the entire team barges in and wipes them out.

472
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,910
We are here.

473
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,500
Well, then.

474
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,470
I'll go, too.

475
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,880
Why don't you wait here today?

476
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,620
Let me go, too.

477
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,480
Even I'm lacking, I want to be of help.

478
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,760
Today's mission is dangerous, so you can't.

479
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,360
You are not coming?

480
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,780
I don't care even if it's dangerous. That is the nature of our work.

481
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,850
Even though it's not acknowledged by anyone, someone has to do the job.

482
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,320
I can do it, too.

483
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,570
 I can do it. I will do it. 

484
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,060
 No, you can't. It's dangerous. 

485
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,430
 Go with the second plan. 

486
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,740
 That's what we do. Dangerous things. 

487
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,650
 Even though it's not acknowledged by anyone, someone has to do it. 

488
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,600
 You said you have something important going on after the mission tonight. 

489
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,700
 I must do it for that. I don't want to feel ashamed. 

490
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,970
 Anyhow, you are making a fuss even when I leave you out for your sake. 

491
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,640
 I have something to tell you after the mission. 

492
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,010
 You've finally written a resignation letter? 

493
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:39,380
 If I write a resignation letter, it would mean you are cutting off your own right arm, Team Leader. 

494
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,330
 Who says you are my right arm? 

495
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,820
 Then your left arm. 

496
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,790
 That's the nature of our work. 

497
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:55,000
 Even though it's not acknowledged by anyone, someone has to do it. 

498
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,450
 I can do it, too. 

499
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,150
I've practiced the moves you taught me every single day.

500
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:10,300
I've been going to the range whenever I have time, not missing one opportunity.

501
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,900
Like you said, I can take care of myself.

502
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:33,100
Here. Just in case.

503
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,270
Yes, Team Leader.

504
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,850
I will carry it.

505
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,860
Please understand her. Chan Mi is extra sensitive before a mission.

506
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,450
The more dangerous a mission is, the higher level of stress she feels.

507
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:05,380
This is all about a spinster's hysteria. I feel bad.

508
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,230
Now that this started, let's finish this cleanly.

509
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,130
I've come this far. I'll stop at nothing.

510
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,910
You know that you can't do anything since we have a recording of your confession.

511
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:38,750
It's not like we got the recording behind your back, so it's a hundred percent effective legally. Keep that in mind.

512
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,570
Don't you even think about fleeing.

513
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:47,290
Compared to being dragged to China and caught by the Public Security Bureau, getting a humane trial in Korea is better for you.

514
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:51,910
But... Would they at least flinch a bit because the NIS is here?

515
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,250
They are merciless bastards, you know.

516
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,960
We aren't doing this to scare them.

517
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,830
We have to diligently wipe out those trashy scumbags who sell their conscience for a few cents.

518
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:04,900
Then, the most basic peace will be maintained.

519
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,040
Be careful.

520
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,960
Preparations are complete. Start moving.

521
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,010
 The safety of team members should come first. 

522
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,710
 Until I give a signal, don't you ever shoot. 

523
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,210
 Once again, 

524
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,930
 without an order, shooting is not allowed. 

525
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,640
The item?

526
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,020
It's on my wrist.

527
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,850
The item has been checked!

528
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,280
Transaction complete. Step in now.

529
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,840
Sunbae.

530
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,210
Freeze!

531
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,510
I will cover five of them. You take the rest.

532
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,200
Five?

533
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,620
The rest? I have more though.

534
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,630
D-Don't come closer!

535
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:23,950
Save me. Save me, please.

536
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,000
No one come in.

537
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,980
What's going on?

538
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,440
  C4 Explosive   
  07:14 

539
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:43,840
If any of you moves a single step.

540
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,620
You know, right?

541
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,670
There's a bomb.

542
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,510
Call the EOD team immediately. Hurry! 
  (EOD: Explosive Ordonance Disposal) 

543
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:02,190
If it's the EOD team... a bomb?

544
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,360
This is driving me crazy!

545
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,910
S-Save me.

546
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:21,870
Put all your weapons down.

547
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,890
 Why do you have two guns? 

548
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:11,170
 Just in case. It's Team Leader Dong's. 

549
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,950
Can you hear me well?

550
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:39,440
 The bomb will explode if you follow our cars. 

551
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,510
And if you do as much as try to come inside, it will explode.

552
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,280
Don't move.

553
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,220
Let them go.

554
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,230
Request license plate tracking.

555
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,880
It's for tracking a vehicle, please.

556
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,080
It's urgent. Hurry!

557
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,280
- Do you have them? 
 - Right here.

558
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,880
- Why is there no information?
 - It must be under fake registration.

559
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,120
There is no record of the vehicle.

560
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:58,060
It's going to explode in one hour anyway. I forgot to tell you.

561
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:09,760
I guess you don't have any intention to let it explode now.

562
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,280
Neutralize the bomb first.

563
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,400
You can't abandon me and leave.

564
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,950
If you move, the bomb will explode. Stay still.

565
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,540
Hold your respiration. Would you be able to deactivate this?

566
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,460
During training, I only touched a small bomb.

567
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,660
Not something this big.

568
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,220
Tell me what to do.

569
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:56,940
Turning the power off is the most certain way, but it could be dangerous. If you touch a wrong line—

570
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,800
You don't need to say that.

571
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,880
Okay.

572
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,620
Let's shut down the control device first.

573
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,920
You don't care even if you die?

574
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,760
If the bomb explodes, we are going to die anyway.

575
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,160
The control device.

576
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,990
Usually, it's red.

577
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,590
What are you doing? He said it's red.

578
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:37,070
Wait a minute.

579
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:43,070
I don't think the person who built this would have made the control device this complicated.

580
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,680
W-Wait.

581
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,370
You are not cutting off the red line?

582
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:12,130
What are you doing? Are you a color blind?

583
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:14,640
He said it's red! Red, red!

584
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,850
Red! Red, red!

585
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,410
Think about it again. Are you sure?

586
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,700
Think it over.

587
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,470
Think again.

588
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,000
It's okay. It's okay. It can happen.

589
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,860
Be careful not to touch the detonator. From the left, one, two...

590
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:35,210
Disconnect the third power supply.

591
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,940
  Perfect  

592
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:06,420
Can't you hurry up? Don't you know all of the data will be gone in an hour?

593
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:10,820
What is he saying?

594
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,420
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

595
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,750
Step back.

596
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,650
No.

597
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:47,210
You're him, aren't you? You're Michael, right?

598
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:57,870
Don't tell me you really thought this was the end.

599
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,940
What is this? What's wrong with this?

600
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,460
There must be another bomb.

601
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,410
What?

602
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,740
I'm going crazy, seriously. What is this?

603
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,860
Get out immediately. Hurry!

604
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,080
Get away!

605
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,610
  Epilogue  

606
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:17,000
  15 years ago  

607
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,210
  Teacher, do you know why first loves don't come true?  

608
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:26,400
  They say it's because we don't know how much we have to love.  

609
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,590
  But someone's love for another, how can we quantify it?  

610
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:34,220
  We can't even see it  

611
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:38,940
  The moment love is calculated, no,  it's no longer love.  

612
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:44,810
  Even if you love me like zero, I can love you as much as hundred. 

613
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:49,570
  No. One thousand? That's not enough.  

614
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:53,250
  Three thousand. I'll love you as much as three thousand.  

615
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:55,710
As much as three thousand.

616
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:03,460
♫  Oh, can't you see you belong to me.  ♫

617
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:11,010
♫  How my poor heart aches with every step you take.   ♫

618

♫   That girl's red backpack   ♫

619
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,940
♫   looks really heavy. I want to hold it.   ♫

620

♫   That girl's red backpack   ♫

621
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:49,080
♫   looks really cozy. I also want to be hugged in her arms.   ♫

622
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,530
♫   Not just anyone can know her charms   ♫

623
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:57,980
♫   It's a red light for the foolish boy, a red ocean   ♫

624
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:01,640
      
 ♫   Maybe it's because I fell for her at first sight   ♫

625
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:07,470
♫   She gives me a blue light, a blue ocean just for me  ♫

♫   Not just anyone can love her. This girl of mine  ♫

627
