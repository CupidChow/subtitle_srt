00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,750
 Episode 5 

2
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,620


3
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,350
- What is it? 
 - Here!

4
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,150
- Team Leader. 
- What happened?

5
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,950
How did this happen?

6
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,950
Team Leader got hurt.

7
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,350
Bae Moo Hyeok. Stay right next to Team Leader Dong.

8
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,350
Chan Mi! Chan Mi!

9
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,150
- Keep pressure on the wound, and call the ambulance. Hurry!
 - Yes

10
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,550
Chan Mi!

11
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,250
Team Leader! Wake up!

12
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,950
Hey! Stop right there! Hey Ajumma! That's mine!

13
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,550
Baek Chan Mi! Baek Chan Mi!

14
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,350
Hey, you drive.

15
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,650
Ajumma! My motorcycle!

16
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,060
68 GA 3877

17
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,780
Great Wall of China

18
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,950
She's there, right there!

19
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,950
Right? Step on it.

20
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,250
- Yes, that's right. 
 - Step on it some more! Please!

21
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,970
Ssak Ssak Clean

22
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,650
Jeez, her temper is going to cost her her legs.

23
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,550
Can't you go any faster?

24
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,950
Pass that car! Step on the gas!

25
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,550
Okay.

26
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,550
Oh oh, she's making a turn. Turn, turn!

27
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,950
Make a U-turn.

28
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,350
We can't make a U-turn here.

29
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,250
Then turn around. Turn around right now.

30
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,250
What are you doing? You're really something!

31
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,750
Ah. You're driving me crazy.

32
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,550
Get out. I'll do it. Get out, quick.

33
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,150
- Get off. 
 - I got it. I got it.

34
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,050
I'm seriously going crazy.

35
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,490
Ssak Ssak Clean

36
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,030
Under construction

37
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,760
Safety First!

38
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,070
68 GA 3877

39
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,250
Where did they go?

40
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,350
Oh, they're coming over there. Right there.

41
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,150
- Stop them. 
 - What?

42
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,950
Veer sharp!

43
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,050
What are they doing? What?

44
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,950
Come out. Come out!

45
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,950
Sunbaenim!

46
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,150
Chan Mi! Chan Mi!

47
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,950
Chan Mi! Are you okay?

48
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,650
What is going to happen to Team Leader?

49
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,450
What are you doing? Let's just stay until the IV is done.

50
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,550
How can I relax and just lie here in good fortune when she's acting like this?

51
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,350
He even got shot because of me.

52
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,450
I'm so sorry that I don't know what to do with myself.

53
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,150
Hey. To this extent, it's not even a gunshot wound.

54
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,350
In Gwanghwamun Plaza. Uh. Who was that again?

55
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,550
Nitovenihajo.

56
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,350
Right. N-Ni... The shot I got from that Nitoass or Nitwit whatever, it went right through my shin.

57
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,150
Wow. I thought I was going to die.

58
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,990
Why do you keep crying?

59
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,350
What happened to that punk?

60
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,350
Are you okay?

61
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,250
What did the doctor say?

62
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,650
The bullet didn't penetrate. Thankfully, it just slightly grazed him.

63
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,950
I asked what happened to the girl?

64
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,950
Why are you asking?

65
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,750
Of course, she got caught.

66
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,550
Chan Mi and Mi Soon, go back to the headquarters and work on her.

67
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,150
Im Ye Eun, you stick to Kang Woo Won.

68
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,150
Watch over him until he wakes up.

69
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,450
Alright.

70
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,750
Look into Division Director Tak's unofficial schedule, please.

71
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,550
She's just putting up a strong front.

72
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,350
She's actually quite clumsy. Don't cry, kiddo.

73
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,150
Oh lord.

74
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,850
 Baspo Ointment (Bacitracin) 

75
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,880
  You should be careful. If a woman's body is marred, she isn't as pretty. 

76
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,580
Did you get hurt?

77
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
It's nothing much.

78
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,360
 Top Secret - Code Name 'Good Casting' 

79
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,620
 Good Casting 

80
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,360
Yes, I understand.

81
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,290
Goo Tae Rim is definitely related to the 2nd transaction.

82
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,540
Kang Woo Won's agency said something different.

83
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,880
They said it's a sasaeng fan.
  (obsessive fan who invades privacy of public figures)  

84
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,300
Why would a sasaeng fan kidnap our agent?

85
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,870
Exactly. Why did you guys sneak into someone else's house and end up like this?

86
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,070
Since when did we start reporting every single thing during the operation?

87
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,790
Kang Woo Won's company said they would block the press, so hand the case over to the police. And take your hands off.

88
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,420
Then why did she shoot me?

89
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,970
You said the bullet just grazed you! You didn't even get shot!

90
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,280
Since when did we consider that a gunshot accident?

91
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,790
I will not release a criminal who was caught red-handed before the detention time was over.

92
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,810
Within that time using every tactic, I will ensure she confesses.

93
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,190
You sure are coming off strong.

94
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,090
Believe in your teammate and wait.

95
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,990
We just need to figure out what the watch means. Just the watch.

96
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,300
We will start investigating the culprit immediately.

97
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,840
You know that we don't have time right?

98
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,670
We must have your help if we want Hwang Mi Soon to open the culprit's mouth quickly.

99
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,460
She said she was searching

100
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,730
for an item.

101
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,670
An item?

102
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,060
 When stealing someone's item, you must have at least put your neck on the line. 

103
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,790
  Right?  

104
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,030
The watch.

105
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:54,680
It seems even slashing with a knife wasn't enough so you used a gun.

106
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,600
What should we do? You really made a mistake.

107
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,080
What are you talking about?

108
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,050
The person you were trying to catch, was Pi Cheol Woong.

109
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,650
The person you kidnapped was Kang Woo Won.

110
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,670
Even if their heights and body figures may be similar, how could you get this face mixed up with this one?

111
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,070
I really can't understand this.

112
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,890
Don't you think you should get glasses or something?

113
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,560
I mean, because your vision is so bad

114
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,050
that you lost the person you were looking for; as well as the item.

115
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,750
Don't try to fool me. I know you guys smuggled it out.

116
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,580
We did?

117
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,990
I guess you still don't know.

118
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,610
Right? You're just prodding around because you don't know.

119
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,120
I'll give you ten seconds. Tell me what it is.

120
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,100
One. Two.

121
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,960
Three.

122
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,680
Four. Five,  six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

123
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,990
No!

124
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,450
A microchip. There's a microchip inside.

125
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,140
A microchip?

126
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,790
Oh, really? Something like that is inside?

127
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,770
Oh. I didn't know. It could've been a disaster.

128
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,800
So to clear things up, there were two watches.

129
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,730
The one Kang Woo Won was wearing was a real watch,

130
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,240
while the other one was fake with a microchip in it.

131
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,990
  Preparations for the item are complete.  

132
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:46,050
The result is that Pi Cheol Woong ran off with your chip and the watch you were looking for.

133
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,130
That's why you tried to kidnap Pi Cheol Woong.

134
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,940
Let it go. Let it go.

135
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,800
Forget it, forget it. It's not there.

136
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:19,320
Ma'am. Don't you want to know where the guy squirreled away the microchip?

137
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,040
Geez. How embarrassing.

138
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,130
Do you think we couldn't catch Division Director Tak, or didn't catch Division Director Tak?

139
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,670
Okay. All the evidence has been secured.

140
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,290
Is Baek Chan Mi over there?

141
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,550
You knew me?

142
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,770
Baek Chan Mi.

143
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,900
Do you think I couldn't catch you or didn't catch you?

144
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,710
  Taesan University Hospital  

145
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,800
No unauthorized access

146
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,380
I'm Kang Woo Won's agency president.

147
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,200
Oh my gosh.

148
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,950
What happened? Why did our Kang Woo Won suddenly faint?

149
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,240
Just why? Who did this?

150
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,160
- Who the hell was it? 
 - You see...

151
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,150
Starting tomorrow, it's not like you have only one or two things to attend.

152
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,270
What am I supposed to do if you're here like this?

153
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,210
It shouldn't be too serious, right? He should be able to get up and walk around?

154
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,100
No, he doesn't even have to walk.

155
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,320
You just need to breathe.

156
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,330
At least his nose seems fine.

157
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,630
Wait. Since he has a concussion, I think it'd be difficult for him to engage in activi—

158
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,830
What concussion? He cracks walnuts open with his forehead.

159
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,760
He has events and fan meetings. His schedule is completely fully packed!

160
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,070
Do you know how much money that is?

161
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,710
Doctor, Doctor. His doctor in charge...

162
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,310
Hurry up and wake up already, Mr. Kang Woo Won.

163
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,630
I told you to get rid of a bug but you brought me garbage instead.

164
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,790
I have committed a capital crime.

165
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,510
Have you ever seen me give second chances?

166
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,950
That's why I get rid of them as they come.

167
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,110
Dogs or humans, if you take care of them for too long, it only makes your heart weaker when you get rid of them.

168
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,300
If you received money, you should complete the balance.

169
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,940
Find the item.

170
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,910
It's me. Long time no talk. Let's eat out sometime.

171
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,820
I'll do as you say.

172
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,430
I'll meet the Executive Director Myeong, if you wish.

173
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,020
If you want me to cut him off, I will do so immediately.

174
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,520
The choice is yours because I believe in you, Director.

175
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,180
But, why do you need CEO Yoon Seok Ho's computer files?

176
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:50,160
We searched through the files, but there wasn't anything suspicious.

177
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,220
Do you know what the opposite of suspicion is?

178
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,160
It's not trust.

179
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,890
It's knowing the full truth.

180
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,110
I think you were suspicious for no reason.

181
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,800
The person named Baek Chan Mi that you requested an investigation on.

182
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,470
I looked into her, but after she immigrated with her family,

183
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,040
there are no records of them ever coming back.

184
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,240
I see.

185
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,020
But why did you suddenly ask about that person's whereabouts?

186
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,950
I asked, just in case.

187
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,340
She looks like Secretary Baek and they even have similar names,

188
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,990
but I'm pretty sure she's a different person.

189
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,760
I knew she had left the country, but I was just wondering if she was back.

190
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,130
If she hasn't come back yet, doesn't that mean she has no plans of coming back?

191
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,790
By now, she could've married a foreigner and had kids.

192
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,360
This is a timeless truth:

193
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,500
Even if you run into your first love later in life,

194
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,450
it's just a waste of emotio—

195
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,650
Those memories are just... great, right?

196
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,950
Memories.

197
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,550
  15 years ago 

198
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,750
Turn off the music before I throw a pen at you, and sit down before you get hit.

199
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,950
Really? Throw it at me.

200
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,250
I'll give you three seconds.

201
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,950
Just throw as much as you want. I'll dodge all of them.

202
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,350
Three. Two. One.

203
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,950
I almost got hit! Really!

204
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,150
But you didn't.

205
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,350
What is this?

206
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,750
There's a tear. There's a tear. My finger can go through it.

207
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,350
It was already ripped.

208
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,150
Already ripped?

209
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,250
How can it be ripped by a pen?

210
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,150
Pssh. You're overreacting.

211
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,350
Take it off.

212
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,950
W-Why all of a sudden —

213
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,750
- Take it off. 
 - How dare you.

214
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,950
Come on.

215
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,750
Wh-What?

216
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,350
You even know how to do this?

217
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,350
I may not look like it, but I know how to sew.

218
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,750
Just you wait. I'll fix it up, so no one can tell.

219
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,550
It's all done.

220
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,750
Wow. This is just.

221
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,150
Do you like it?

222
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,550
How did you...

223
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,450
What?

224
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,350
What is rose of sharon (mugunghwa, Korea's national flower)? How am I supposed to walk around with this?

225
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,350
I did this because I care about you.

226
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,350
Re-return this to how it was before quickly.

227
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,550
How can I walk around with this mugunghwa?

228
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,550
Why? It looks good. It suits you perfectly well.

229
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,150
What do you mean it suits me well? I can't wear this.

230
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,750
So why would you play music during class?

231
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,950
How was I supposed to know you were going to put a rose of sharon like this?

232
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,350
Don't you dare take it off.

233
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,150
Wear it.

234
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,550
It suits you. It's nice.

235
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,050
You can't buy this anywhere even with loads of money.

236
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,250
- Sir? 
 - Huh?

237
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,450
- Aren't you leaving? 
 - Yes.

238
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,950
I'll be leaving then.

239
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,650
Did you wake up?

240
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,450
How are you? Are you feeling okay?

241
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,950
Give me a minute. I'll call the doctors.

242
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,550
Pi Cheol Woong.

243
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,350
Where did Pi Cheol Woong go? Why are you here?

244
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,350
What?

245
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,950
Why are you here? Where's my manager?

246
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,250
Kang Woo Won.

247
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,400
Where am I?

248
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,950
You don't remember at all how you fainted?

249
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,550
No. Why am I here?

250
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,150
What are you doing? Go and call my manager.

251
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,550
At least one week of memories must have disappeared.

252
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,150
Is it a-a-amnesia?

253
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:12,550
Sometimes, a concussion can cause temporary amnesia.

254
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,550
I'm going to ride in my car, so bring it over.

255
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,550
Why is my car under maintenance?

256
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,550
His memories won't come back? Forever?

257
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,350
We will take a few tests

258
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,050
and do a prognosis on him.

259
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:32,950
Patients usually feel stressed upon having amnesia, so he might become very sad emotional—

260
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,450
What are you doing? Why aren't you bring me my clothes?

261
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,550
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.

262
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,150
Yeah. We'll look through all the CCTVs of the crime scene as well.

263
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:53,250
Kang Woo Won's memories can return so keep a close watch on him.

264
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,950
Pi Cheol Woong can come into contact, so be careful.

265
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,350
Okay.

266
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,150
Stop it. Leave me alone.

267
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,550
We went through so much

268
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,650
because of that thieving bastard. Let's just say it was a way of ridding bad luck.

269
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,350
You should be glad the petty thief only took a watch. Isn't that right?

270
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:16,850
You would've truly gone over the hill if that Il Gwang HiTech female employee weren't there.

271
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,590
It was worth a hundred million won.

272
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:28,250
You didn't forget that you have an Il Gwang organized fan meeting tomorrow in Taiwan, right?

273
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,550
So, in the one week of memories that I lost,

274
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:34,350
I hired her as part of my staff from the advertising team?

275
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,150
Is that it?

276
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,750
Did that happen?

277
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:47,150
If you look at this, this is your own signature.

278
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,850
You see it, right?

279
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,150
Find out personally with the related staff at Il Gwang.

280
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,150
Sure. Alright.

281
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,150
Why does it look like this?

282
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,850
  Advertisement Model Contract  

283
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,550
That's...

284
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,050
  I checked that you didn't take any pictures, so let's get rid of the contract.  

285
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,650
Mr. Kang Woo won's dog.

286
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,950
Poppy ripped it remember?

287
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,950
Don't you remember?

288
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,220
That's what happened, right?

289
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,350
I checked

290
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,150
and you personally made an adjustment to the contract to make

291
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,950
Im Jeong Eun the advertising company's employee in charge. They even have a call log.

292
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,250
  The employee in charge will be Im Jeong Eun. I'm hanging up.  

293
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,350
So Hee, do you want to ride on this Oppa's back?

294
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,050
- No? What about the airplane? Superman? 
 - Mommy!

295
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:08,150
You don't want anything? I'm seriously going out of my mind.

296
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,550
Sunbae. Can you really sleep well in this situation?

297
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,550
I've been awake the entire night.

298
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,150
Shut up and make the child be quiet.

299
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,350
Seriously.

300
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,750
Got it, got it.

301
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:30,050
- Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
- Mom, mom

302
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,150
Everything's alright, okay?

303
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,950
Ye Eun is gutsier than I thought.

304
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,250
She even had a child alone.

305
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,350
Your room is the best, isn't it?

306
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,150
They kind of look alike.

307
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,850
- Mommy's here! 
  - So Hee! 

308
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,950
Here she is.

309
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,350
I'm sorry. You must have suffered a lot because of me.

310
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,550
What do you mean suffer? Just a little bit. Your kid is so calm.

311
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:27,350
What do you mean, calm? She's so fussy. Who does she take after?

312
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,750
Her mom couldn't be more feminine.

313
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,750
She must resemble her father. I looked and they are carbon copies.

314
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,350
Moo Hyeok, have you met So Hee's dad?

315
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,350
Yes. There's a picture in the master room.

316
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,950
You're hungry, right? I'll quickly prepare a meal.

317
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,150
It's fine.

318
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,050
How could we make you cook, after you spent the night running around on a case?

319
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,750
I'm not your mother-in-law or anything.

320
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,150
What are you doing? Let's go.

321
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,750
I ate a few things here and there, so I'm okay. See you tomorrow.

322
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,950
You worked hard.

323
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,750
  No matter how I see it, Min Seok's death seems suspicious.  

324
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,850
  Didn't he die during the operation?  

325
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:42,150
  I overheard the higher-ups talking about it.  

326
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,750
 All of Min Seok's team members are being thoroughly audited.  

327
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,350
 What are you talking about?  

328
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,950
 It means there is something extremely friggin fishy. 

329
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,680
  I will definitely find out.  

330
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,140
  If you died an unfair death,  

331
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,460
  I will reveal it no matter what.  

332
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,400
Mom are you crying?

333
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,690
I'm not crying.

334
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,880
It's okay. Mommy isn't crying.

335
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,560
Im Ye Eun is awesome.

336
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,400
She didn't get married but has a child.

337
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:48,000
- What are you so curious about? 
 - Seeing as how there is no one to take care of her child, does she have any family members?

338
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,780
Maybe she cut off all contact from them.

339
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,380
What do you think her story is?

340
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,960
Among the agents, it'll be hard to find someone without a story.

341
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,040
Don't you have any kind of story, Sunbae? I can stay up all night and listen to it.

342
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,970
Go home.

343
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,110
Come on, Sunbae. We should chat a bit longer over a glass of soju.

344
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,130
Where are you going?

345
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,140
Fish someone out for me.

346
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,790
From then and now, you have not changed.

347
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:36,800
But you know, I am no longer a minion that does after-service like in the past.

348
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,600
I've already in a not small amount in your trunk.

349
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,410
You would know I don't act for just a bit of money.

350
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,410
Are you aiming for the position of chief?

351
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,330
Do you think I would be satisfied with just that?

352
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,800
Do you think I'll just stop at Il Gwang HiTech's Executive Director?

353
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,800
The higher you go, the more you will need my money.

354
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,540
I don't trust promises I cannot see.

355
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,540
It's been a while.

356
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,770
Has it been three years now?

357
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,480
Secure everything starting from the front of the airport to all the gates so Pi Cheol Woong can't escape.

358
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,110
If he leaves the country with the microchip, it will prose a problem.

359
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,270
We should catch him before he causes a problem.

360
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,750
I spread Pi Cheol Woong's picture and posted public notices.

361
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,190
- Stick close to the communications team and report to me in realtime. 
 - Okay.

362
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,010
I'll contact you if anything looking anything close to Pi Cheol Woong appears.

363
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,190
Did you send the alert to airport security?

364
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,070
Send it.

365
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,790
Immigration

366
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,980
Please take your hat off.

367
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,990
Asiana 
Wang Jinung

368
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,620
- We've found him! 
 - Can you project it to the monitor?

369
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,340
Rewind once more.

370
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,730
Stop. Please zoom in right there.

371
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,200
CU

372
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,570
  Ticket Identified
04 Oct 2019 20:58
Seoul/ICN Taiwan/TAI  

373
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:27,390
We've found Pi Cheol Woong's location. His flight is Air Taiwan, at 20:58.

374
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,240
If we go after him immediately, I might just be able to catch him.

375
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,810
Have you figured out the routes of Division Director Tak?

376
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,550
We don't have to do much unofficial stuff to dig for Division Director Tak.

377
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,370
He suddenly has a business trip to Taiwan.

378
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:44,140
I think they are both planning to meet in Taipei.

379
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,430
For now, both of you should wait on standby.

380
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,140
NIS

381
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,800
Why? Until when?

382
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,720
What are you talking about? The investigation isn't even over, yet it's being transferred to the police?

383
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,750
- They said there's no clear evidence that it's related to their plans. 
 - She was caught on site.

384
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,520
- What more evidence do you need?
 - Excuse me, Seonbae-nim

385
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,960
I fingerprinted the gun, but only Team Leader's fingerprints were the only ones found.

386
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,440
What?

387
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,810
  Your fingerprint was found on agent Kwon Min Seok's gun.  

388
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,030
  Didn't you confiscate it, kill him, and then let the criminal escape?  

389
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,620
Overall, the person that was kidnapped acquired amnesia,

390
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,040
so we are in a situation where we don't even have a witness.

391
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,230
  An agent died trying to catch a criminal,  

392
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,100
  yet you lost him despite running after him like crazy and using your gun.  

393
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,230
  Did you really just lose him,  

394
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,280
  or did you let him go?  

395
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,620
  The only witness passed away so there is no way to confirm this.  

396
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,640
Damn it.

397
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,980
Hey. Baek Chan Mi.

398
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,550
Did you call for the transfer, director?

399
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,780
I was wondering why you were so quiet.

400
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,250
You wouldn't be Baek Chan Mi if you didn't bust in, kicking down the door.

401
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,290
Please take back the decision.

402
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:25,480
- If I was going to take it back, I wouldn't have ordered it. 
 - Director!

403
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,800
She's the most important witness

404
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,680
to this operation.

405
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,190
To add on to it,

406
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,050
she is the only strand of hope to finding Michael.

407
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:48,560
If we catch Michael, we can neatly tie up the Il Gwang HiTech Technology leak mission.

408
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,910
It was also the case back then.

409
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:56,240
 If we catch Michael, we can wrap up the Unikson Technology leakage mission for sure. 

410
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,990
  Just die, you bastard!  

411
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,630
But how did that end, again?

412
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,270
Why did you

413
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,270
add me to this operation?

414
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,570
Do you know the difference between humans and animals?

415
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,100
Intelligence?

416
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,250
Emotion?

417
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,620
Rationality? Not at all.

418
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,170
It's the ability to reflect.

419
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,090
That's what humans do.

420
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,540
It's time for you to come out of the past.

421
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,710
Live for tomorrow.

422
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,850
Look towards the future, okay?

423
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,230
Pi Cheol Woong's location has been determined.

424
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,270
You found Pi Cheol Woong?

425
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,350
One day.

426
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,210
No. Just give me 20 hours.

427
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,820
I will find Pi Cheol Woong by then.

428
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,330
You want me to go on a business trip right now?

429
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:17,510
Kang Woo Won's drama, 'My Lover, Mrs. Kim', was quite the hit in Southeast Asia.

430
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:22,970
We've invested so much money into recontracting with Kang Woo Won. We need to show it when he has high popularity

431
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,530
to reap some benefits, no?

432
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:31,990
Excuse me. To go along with this so abruptly is a bit...

433
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,940
It was originally a pre-scheduled event,

434
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:40,320
although your business trip was decided because Kang Woo Won requested it.

435
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,400
If you don't have anything else to say, go on.

436
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,790
Why launch rice cookers in Taiwan?

437
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,030
Jeong Eun, you're good at Chinese, right?

438
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,310
I am? Since when?

439
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:07,600
Your resumé states that you're HSK Level 5 and ranked the highest in Chinese conversational skills.

440
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:13,170
 I've already filled out all your forms, so don't be too worried. 

441
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,090
Kang Woo Won won't be bringing another translator so you will be doing it.

442
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,860
What?

443
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,960
You didn't get hurt, right? Are you okay?

444
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,750
Yes.

445
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,680
I'm okay.

446
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,840
Can't you be careful? Don't you know this bag costs more than your annual salary?

447
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,180
You almost got it scratched.

448
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,880
The stairs are so steep.

449
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,090
Hold it, then.

450
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,350
There are wheels on it, but you want me to hold it instead of pulling it?

451
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,080
Look. There are wheels there, but there's also a handle on the side.

452
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,870
Why do you think? It's for you to hold it. Like this.

453
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Ugh.

454
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,760
What are you doing?

455
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,320
I loaded all the bags in the trunk.

456
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,820
Not that, you're ruining the seats!

457
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,770
An Italian craftsman made this with cow leather that was left to age for 10 years.

458
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,860
I even covered it with a blanket so that fine dust particles wouldn't get into it. Do you think you should sit here?

459
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,890
If that's the case,

460
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,040
should I move to the back?

461
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,000
The back seat is also—

462
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,070
Go by taxi.

463
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,630
Taxi?

464
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,380
As an exception, I'll let you ride the deluxe taxi.

465
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,790
If you come late and make me unload the bags, you're really dead to me.

466
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,340
Get out quickly!

467
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,690
Aish. Seriously.

468
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:57,330
I think I know why Pi Cheol Woong ran away.

469
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,990
  Swiftly Clean  

470
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,480
For the first time in a long time, shall we fly?

471
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,740
It would be nice to get a good rest for three days and two nights.

472
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,350
Hey! Are you going there to play?

473
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,570
Slacking off. What about the motion sickness pills?

474
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,780
It's my first aid kit.

475
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,010
I'm sorry.

476
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:55,930
I even gave him double the fare, but there was so much traffic.

477
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,080
You're such a dunce.

478
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,980
  My daughter's voice?  

479
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,080
Oppa! He's so handsome that I don't know what to do!

480
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,400
  My daughter's voice?  

481
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,580
Hello, welcome aboard.

482
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,270
Hello, welcome aboard Air Taiwan.

483
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,960
We wish you a pleasant flight.

484
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,950
Pleased to see you. Welcome aboard Air Taiwan.

485
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,970
Welcome.

486
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,970
Wow.

487
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,360
- What are you doing? 
 - Sorry?

488
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,670
Do you think you qualify for a first-class seat at 15,000,000 won  (≈ $15,000) ?

489
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,640
Then, where do I...

490
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,500
Try to comprehend where you belong.

491
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,100
Where might be the place you should be?

492
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,210
- Business? 
 - Business?

493
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,930
No business.

494
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:52,700
Be on standby in economy, and come within ten seconds if I call you.

495
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,440
Okay?

496
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,410
O-Okay.

497
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:05,050
Oh my goodness. Are you okay?

498
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,400
I'm alright.

499
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,110
- Are you really okay? 
 - Yes, I am all right.

500
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,310
  Wireless Earphone  

501
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,480
Hey.

502
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,680
How did you know it was me?

503
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,410
I would have to be stupid to not know.

504
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:13,030
Be it then or now, your disguises have always been horrible.

505
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:27,610
Everyone stay in your stations and report in as soon as you spot Pi Cheol Woong.

506
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,010
 Hello, all passengers.  

507
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:38,390
 We welcome you aboard Air Taiwan.  

508
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,430
 Our staff will prioritize your safety. 

509
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:44,700
No matter how hard I search business class, Pi Cheol Woong isn't here.

510
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,450
  Please make sure that all electronic devices, such as laptops,   

511
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:50,700
  are stored safely in the overhead compartment.  

512
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,910
Here you go.

513
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:58,250
I am your fan, Mr. Kang Woo Won.

514
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,950
Ah.

515
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:05,260
I'm sorry but can I have just one picture?

516
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,930
Right here.

517
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,580
Hey! I told you to keep the flies off me.

518
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,320
Hurry over here in ten seconds.

519
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,030
She's so bad.

520
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,410
There's a fly?

521
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,080
It left just now.

522
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,510
While you're here, give me my headphones.

523
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,680
- Headphones? 
 - Yeah.

524
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:51,160
And can you bring me my cardigan? This blanket is too dirty.

525
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,710
Slipper.

526
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,530
  Pistachio cookie handmade from whole wheat  

527
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,190
  Kang Woo Won's allergies  

528
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,660
  Ah, peanut allergy...  

529
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,030
He can't possibly...

530
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:28,080
He probably didn't eat the pistachio cookie, right?

531
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,110
Pi Cheol Woong is definitely not in first-class either.

532
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:50,890
Then he's in economy class. I'll search for him

533
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,940
 Dear passengers. The plane will be taking off soon. 

534
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,370
 Please fasten your seat belts. 

535
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:11,100
 Including the restrooms.. 

536
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,890
Darn.

537
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:40,210
It seems like you have a lot of stress since you are here.

538
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,870
Tell me about it.

539
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,300
I think coming here brings you more stress, actually.

540
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,270
Attendees list for the Semicon event?

541
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:59,910
It's suspicious that Division Director Tak would suddenly attend the Semicon seminar.

542
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,780
What's even weirder is this. Take a look.

543
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,120
He's flying into Taipei but flying out from Kaohsiung.

544
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:14,200
That means right after Director Ok moved up the second development planning, Division Director Tak is flying into Kaohsiung while pretending to be going to Taipei.

545
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,250
That means the Semicon event isn't his goal. He has something else up his sleeve.

546
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,170
You can't even hit one?

547
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,190
This looks easy right? Even if you get 1 in 100 tries, it's considered good.

548
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,530
Oh, 1/100?

549
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:37,640
There's the factory manager who was fired when Director Myeong planted his own people in South-East Asia, you know.

550
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,830
- The branch manager in Malaysia? 
- Put him on  Division Director's tail

551
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:47,190
to find out who he is meeting and what he is doing. After all, even if we can't entrap him, we might at least smell something fishy.

552
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,780
Hey. Hey. That.

553
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,580
After ₩250,000 ($250) worth of shots, you've hit one.

554
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:02,070
If I just spend twice more, I might hit the bullseye. Right?

555
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,960
He should just buy the prize. Is it broken?

556
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,140
There's nothing wrong with it. It's not even broken.

557
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,690
 Passengers, the seat belt sign has been turned off.  

558
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:49,650
  However, we recommend that you remain seated in case of sudden movements due to turbulence.  

559
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:28,230
  I have information that Pi Cheol Woong will be aboard a plane that takes off in two hours.  

560
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,790
Division Director Tak is inside the airplane.

561
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,190
What is this? Don't tell me...

562
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,200
Did the signal cut off?

563
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:17,250
He's not in Lane A. Check Lane B.

564
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,950
Can you hear me?

565
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,230
 Passengers, our plane will reach Taipei soon. 

566
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:49,860
 For the safety of all passengers, please return to your seats.   
 - Come on, come on, connect, quick!

567
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,920
 The plane will be landing soon. 

568
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:57,370
 Please return your tray to its proper position and fasten your seat belts.  

569
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,980
Division Director Tak is in here.

570
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,710
Passenger, could you please take a seat.

571
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:47,500
What's wrong?

572
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:51,710
I need to use the bathroom.

573
00:55:56,450 --> 00:56:00,990
Sir, please take a seat. You must take a seat.

574
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,530
Take care of the flight attendants for me.

575
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,120
Okay.

576
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,660
Sir, please return to your seat.

577
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,360
- It's an emergency. 
 - Please use the restroom once we have landed.

578
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,190
- I really need to go. 
 - I will escort you to your seat.

579
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:19,540
- I'm telling you I'm about to go, you moron! 
 - Sir. Sir!

580
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,810
Sir, you must return to your seat.

581
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,750
I know, but it's really an emergency. I'm in a hurry, in a hurry.

582
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,010
I request your cooperation.

583
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,670
- I'm telling you I'm in a hurry! 
 - Sir!

584
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:30,830
You knew my identity. Why did you pretend not to know?

585
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,530
You're him, aren't you? Michael?

586
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,190
Don't you hear something weird going on inside?

587
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:09,470
- They're just taking care of their business. 
 - I think I should check.

588
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:12,780
- Why are you checking on them doing their own business? 
 - No, but—

589
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:20,310
Wow, it only took one shot?

590
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:24,680
- You're very talented. 
 - I've never actually done it before.

591
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,980
Are you all right, Mister? Why are you lying here?

592
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,400
Just go on your way.

593
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:09,480
Once you take this and get a good nap, you'll feel so refreshed afterward.

594
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,600
I've got the item.

595
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,260
  Epilogue  

596
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,420
Yes, CEO.

597
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:35,400
That is, uhm, can I perhaps ask you a personal favor?

598
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,080
P-Personal favor?

599
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,040
Tell me anything.

600
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,300
Yes, that is...

601
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,370
Do you have a needle?

602
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:48,560
A needle?

603
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,670
Oh, goodness.

604
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,280
You didn't have to do it yourself.

605
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,340
No. It's nothing.

606
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,120
You see, I'm

607
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:02,390
- quite good at sewing. 
 - I see.

608
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:07,200
I knew someone who was very good at it, too.

609
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:12,940
Did I ever tell you that you look very much like someone I knew?

610
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,730
There are many people in this world who look alike, after all.

611
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:22,190
That's true. But I really thought you were the same person.

612
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:24,960
But your ages and names were different.

613
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,860
So I wondered if you were a twin.

614
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:32,430
If it's someone you knew in the past,

615
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,530
don't you think they must have changed a lot by now?

616
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:40,550
That's right. Since it was 15 years ago, she's probably about 38 years old now.

617
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,460
She must have gotten married and had kids by now.

618
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:49,730
I'm not sure. Just because a woman is thirty-eight,

619
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:52,470
well, I don't think it is given

620
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:56,060
that she should be married and have kids.

621
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,210
Oh no. No. I didn't mean it that way.

622
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:02,220
She was quite popular and never stopped dating people, that's why.

623
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,780
Are you saying her dating life was complicated?

624
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,450
But why are you getting angry?

625
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:17,810
I'm uncomfortable that you are talking about that person while she isn't present.

626
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:20,480
That could be the case.

627
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,600
I mean truthfully,

628
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,490
I thought you entered our company by lying about your age and name and you—

629
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:32,140
Why. Why. What happened?

630
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:36,810
Oh. Blood. Are you okay? Wait, wait a second.

631
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:40,500
- I'm okay. 
 - Ah, we have bandaids.

632
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,550
Then. I will

633
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:07,970
- l-l-leave now. 
 - Oh, sure. Oh my. Thank you.

634
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:15,650
Of course. There's no way we could meet again after 15 years.

635
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,210
  Good Casting 

636
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,800
 Just grab my hand and follow me. 

637
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,230
 - Water. 
 - Words aren't enough, is it? 

638
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:36,450
 Aaah! 

639
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,140
 I'm going to need you to move in-person from now on.  

640
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,110
 We'll catch Wang Kai with this chip. 

641
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:43,260
 - What are you going to do?
 - I should make a move from the surface. 

642
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,530
 Even if I didn't have you, I wouldn't encounter any problems. 

643
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,210
 - I'm really leaving. 
 - You're still here? 

644
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:51,750
 - I shall get off of work now. 
 - It's not like you have bad news, is it? I'm worried. 

645
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:55,050
 The deal is going to be made at the Paju Logistics Warehouse. We are going to attack right away and wipe them out. 

646
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,770
 - The items are confirmed.
 - The deal has been made. Step in now. 

647
01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:00,090
 Freeze!
