  Episode 3  

2
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,090


3
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,620
Come on, move, please!

4
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,710
Please stop pushing, please.

5
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,820
  Please renew your attempt. The cellular signal is weak. 

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,020
Chief, Chief just a minute! This is the thing you asked for yesterday.

7
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,960
- What? 
 - This.

8
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,500
  Il Gwang Research Center - Director Ok Cheol  

9
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,910
  Director  

10
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,680
What was that?

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,700
Come on, please, open. Come on!

12
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,360
 Il Gwang HiTech 

13
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,560
 Il Gwang HiTech 

14
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,120
  Il Gwang Research Center - Director Ok Cheol  

15
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,430
What are you doing, sir?

16
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,510
My head hurts.

17
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,050
This bookcase must be broken, it won't budge at all.

18
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,740
Wow.

19
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,320
It's so cold.

20
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,360
I'll check it out. Please sign off on this here.

21
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,270
  Here is a song is for the girl who stole my heart.   
      

22
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,250
  The title is "The red backpack". 

23
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,370
♪ That girl's red backpack ♪

24
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,980

47
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,310
Ah right! It looks like Executive Director Myeong is going to announce something big today.

48
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,540
At seven this morning, he called all the board members for a breakfast meeting.

49
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,760
Well, he was probably trying to butter them up before the board meeting.

50
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,780
We'll be late to the meeting. Let's go to the meeting.

51
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,590
Let's go and fling a ton of salt on it.
 (Superstition - People fling salt to ward off bad spirits.) 

52
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,860
Yessir!

53
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,260
This really doesn't suit my taste.

54
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,210
Having dried persimmons being plucked, one by one, after being slowly and aptly withered by winds

55
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,940
cannot be matched.

56
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,900
We need to take this opportunity to suck Chairman Yoon's bloodline dry.

57
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,660
He needs to be so utterly obliterated that he can not even take a footstep.

58
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,330
That way they don't take a foolhardy action as installing a greenhorn such as Yoon Seok Ho as CEO.

59
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,850
We are constantly keeping an eye on CEO Yoon.

60
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,880
He wouldn't even let so much as an ant near his office,

61
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,650
but I heard he took in a female assistant?

62
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,740
I will evaluate the situation.

63
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,060
Director Ok will soon deliver the second piece of the materials.

64
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,740
Do just as you have always done.

65
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,480
You know, right? Do the transaction swiftly, and make sure there won't be any backbiting.

66
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,640
So that you can savor it in its most ripened state,

67
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,880
I will be sure to collect on it.

68
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,020
We need to pluck it before the spring wind comes in order to relish its true taste.

69
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,070
  Agent B - Hwang Mi Soon  

70
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,590
Is Mi Soon still not out?

71
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,180
No. What's taking her so long?

72
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,540
Dammit, "the world changed for the better," my foot.

73
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,700
Ah really, had we used a wired device,

74
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,150
it would have been all done much earlier.

75
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,160
My arms and legs are numb. Ouch.

76
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,630
Dammit, where is it? Where is it?

77
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,540
Get it. Get it, get it.

78
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,220
Dammit, go get it.

84
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,130
Oh!

85
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,180
Try turning up the volume of the earphone.

86
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,950
  Have we arrived?  

87
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,400
 Yes, it's the red house.  

88
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,870
  - Oh, your house is pretty. 
 - Yes.  

89
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,160
 Oh, here.  

90
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,530
  Thank you.  

91
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,220
  Go in.  

92
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,890
  That guy looking like a sea squirt, is he your new boyfriend, Teacher?  

93
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,770
  He's not a sea squirt but a medical student.  

94
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,670
  He's going to major in dermatology, so he can just get dermabrasion and it'll be fine.  

95
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,370
  Wow. It hasn't even been that long since you broke up with that sea cucumber looking guy— 

96
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,290
That 7th-place batter has been completely out and the season is long over.

97
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,450
  Can you stop putting your nose in someone else's private life while bringing up seafood?  

98
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,980
  How can I not meddle?  

99
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,720
  I am someone who will soon become your boyfriend!  

100
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,140
  Get into university first,  

101
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,520
  and if you haven't had a change of heart when your (adult) ID has been issued and is dry, then come see me.  

102
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,090
  When that time comes, you'll probably be the one saying you don't want me even if I'm chasing after you.  

103
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,920
  But it doesn't matter to me even if you're forty, Teacher.  

104
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,210
  Am I crazy?  

105
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,210
  Being single at forty would already be depressing enough  

106
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,240
 for me not to go after an old tutoring student.  

107
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,310
  Why is she getting angry?  

108
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,930
  Let's go together!  

109
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,230
  Wait for me. Your bag, your bag.  

110
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,120
  Here.  

111
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,920
  Where are we going?  

112
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,210
  If you cut classes and waited here the whole time, you probably didn't get any dinner.   

113
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,280
  What do you want to eat?  

114
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,620
  Rice cake ramyeon!  

115
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,810
  You leave aside mandu ramyeon, seafood ramyeon, black bean ramyeon, for rice cake ramyeon again?  

116
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,130
  When I get into something, I only stay fixed on it.  

117
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,720
  It would have been even tastier if you were the one making it. Right?  

118
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,400
  No, but be honest.  

119
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,200
  Is that person from earlier really your boyfriend?  

120
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,800
  Whether it is or not, it's none of your concern.  

121
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,000
  But to be honest, I think the octopus head from last time suited you a bit better.  

122
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,400
  He failed the judicial entrance exam.  

123
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,200
  Don't tell me you broke up for that reason?  

124
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,600
I'm not the one who dumped him. That huge ego was really something.

125
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,200
What do you mean huge ego.

126
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,820
  Baek Chan Mi. Baek Chan Mi! 

127
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,700
Is something wrong?

128
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,560
Can you please leave me alone for a second?

129
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,390
First, take the USB with you and get out.

130
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,700
USB...

131
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,600
  Top Secret -  Code name 'Good Casting'  

132
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,700
  Good Casting  

133
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,050
Were you constipated?

134
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,600
When was it that I called you, yet you appear fifteen minutes later?

135
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,400
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,800
Actually, I do have bad constipation.

137
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,000
Well if it's not coming out anyway, in the future you can stay home and take care of it.

138
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,800
Yes. Next time, I will make sure to take care of it at home—

139
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Constipation is not the issue right now!

140
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,200
What exactly did you do when you met Kang Woo Won yesterday?

141
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,200
  You dare to force superstar Kang Woo Won into doing a strip show!  

142
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,900
  Go and tell them that the contract renewal fee is four times the amount.  

143
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,600
  Four times.  

144
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
If you had caused trouble, why didn't you report on it right away?

145
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Jeong Eun, are you a spy?

146
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Sorry?

147
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,200
If you don't have the skills, you shouldn't even try to do it all from the start!

148
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,400
Your baseless confidence really rocks!

149
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,600
Anyway, you have to brace for when Team Leader comes back from working offsite.

150
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,400
Before that at the very least photocopy this properly.

151
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,000
Am I going overboard?

152
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,400
We have 600 million won in support funds from the government

153
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,800
of which, how much are our company's research funds?

154
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,600
Fifteen hundred billion won. Wow.

155
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,400
For a project that costs over 200 billion won, the reports are closed and even the research outcomes are kept secret.

156
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,000
Are you conducting some kind of covert nuclear missile testing?

157
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,800
When he was alive, the chairman entrusted full power over the research lab to me.

158
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,200
It is a truth everyone present here knows.

159
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
CEO Yoon having just come back from a posting abroad, you must not know well about the Korean situation.

160
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Indeed. Had I known that the reporting hierarchy was so opaque,

161
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,800
I would have come back earlier to take care of it.

162
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,900
The late Chairman Yoon also wished for that.

163
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Why are you talking about my father here?

164
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,400
For a dinner that has been laid out for you on a silver platter,

165
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,800
to criticize it is easy.

166
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Because the Chairman knew this,

167
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,200
he gave more support and power over the research lab.

168
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,600
And it's thanks to it that our company could grow to its current size.

169
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
And it's thanks to that,

170
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,200
that in an unprecedented manner, a former chief of research like you, Executive Director Myeong,

171
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,600
is sitting in that position.

172
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Do you know how much the company's stock index increased

173
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,600
after I pushed for the development of the lithography technology?

174
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,300
Fivefold.

175
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,400
Estimated profit was no less than 4.7 trillion won   (≈ $4.7 billion) .

176
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Since you are the leading contributor in increasing the company's market value,

177
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,600
you can use the money earned as you please. Is that what you're saying?

178
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,100
I am telling you to show at least a minimum of respect.

179
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Since you are speaking openly, I'll also say things openly and comfortably.

180
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,200
From now on, every report on the NAND Flash research

181
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,000
has to go through the approval of the CEO, without exception,

182
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,040
Executive Director Myeong.

183
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,660
What power would a mere executive like me have?

184
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,400
If you say so,

185
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,830
we'll have to, after all.

186
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,530
  Top Secret_2nd Research Materials Results - Backup in progress  

187
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,000
 Backup Complete 

188
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,910
 Il Gwang Labs 

189
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,600
C-C-Caught it! Got it!

190
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
Got it.

191
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,800
Stay put. Stay put.

192
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,200
It worked! Team Leader, Chief Ok's surveillance camera has been turned on.

193
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
There isn't much movement on his side, is there?

194
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,100
No, it's calm.

195
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,300
Mi Soon must have gotten out alright, then.

196
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,800
Chief Ok got in touch with us just now.

197
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,700
He says the goods are ready.

198
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,400
He is good at doing what he's told. The problem is that I just cannot like this rat-like guy.

199
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,100
What was the name of the secretary that CEO Yoon recently picked?

200
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,800
Are you talking about the new secretary, Baek Jang Mi?

201
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,600
A new actor at this time?

202
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Something doesn't sit right. It's fishy.

203
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,200
I will dig into her background.

204
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
Dig in deep.

205
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,400
You never know, we might find a precious pearl in the mud (diamond in the rough).

206
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,000
  I love you. I love you.  

207
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,100
What are you doing over there?

208
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,000
Hello.

209
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,600
I am Baek Jang Mi, the experienced secretary who has been newly appointed to the position.

210
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,000
Ms. Baek Jang Mi.

211
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,100
Are you all right?

212
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,200
It's nothing.

213
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,800
I dropped the pill somewhere.

214
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,000
It doesn't look like it's nothing.

215
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,090
Wait a minute.

216
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,300
This.

217
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,600
I will go prepare a new tonic.

218
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,200
No, it's fine. Nothing will happen just because I don't take that pill once.

219
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,400
- Take a seat. 
 - Pardon?

220
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,000
Take a seat.

221
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,100
Do you know why I picked you, Ms. Baek Jang Mi?

222
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,400
I don't remember seeing you at the interview last time, though?

223
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,000
I had a meeting outside, so I watched it in my car through the monitor.

224
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,800
 When meeting a substandard superior, 

225
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,000
 I think the role of a true secretary is to assist them in becoming a proper human.  

226
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,400
  It's already widely known that you've parachuted in through connections, you know?  

227
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
You have quite an unusual special skill.

228
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
  Special skill: Throwing  

229
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Are you good at throwing?

230
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,200
Broadly speaking, I do throw pretty well.

231
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,400
Broadly speaking, what do you throw well?

232
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,600
This and that, all kind of things.

233
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,200
Are you really twenty-nine years old?

234
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,000
And your name is Baek Jang Mi too, you're sure of that?

235
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,200
Yes. It is right.

236
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,800
  Don't tell me he recognized me?  

237
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,000
That's a relief. I was wondering, just in case.

238
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,200
  What does that mean?  

239
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,600
  What relief? Is he relieved I'm not Baek Chan Mi?  

240
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
You must have worked for many superiors who were less than human?

241
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,470
Ah, that was not something directed to you—

242
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,060
It must be a relief that you now met a superior who is a decent human.

243
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,770
I don't care much if you make mistakes and can't handle things well.

244
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:47,040
You're human, after all. However,  I don't put people I cannot trust by my side.

245
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,130
- I will keep that in mind. 
 - You should.

246
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,510
Since I am very humane, after all,

247
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,590
I can overlook things once.

248
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,300
Uhm, it's the weekend tomorrow, so what are you doing? Should we have a meal together?

249
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,070
I would have something planned even if I didn't, but I actually really do.

250
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,150
Then should we have tea after your appointment? I'll go to you.

251
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,280
If the prospective marriage date feels nice, I'll go on the second round. You can always follow along.

252
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,410
Since we're going to do this operation together anyway,

253
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,920
what about

254
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,690
we become comfortable with each other now?

255
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,910
The worst moment in my life

256
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,000
was when I did night overtime for the first time since I had started working,

257
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,180
and ate the food a trashy seonbae offered to buy for me.

258
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,460
Because he had much more seniority, I was nervous and got sudden indigestion. And that damn sunbae, of all things,

259
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,100
pricked my hand to help me, and I happened to fall for him.

260
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,240
Since I was a newbie in society, I was too naive.

261
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,970
I was.

262
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,410
  You have until tomorrow to entirely scour CEO Yoon's computer and bring me the content.  

263
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,020
  What's the use for me to try hard all by myself,  

264
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,680
  when the one below misses the ball and ruins it all!  

265
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,630
Why is it always me doing these crappy things?

266
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,870
It's tiring me to death.

267
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,020
There's no end to these damn things.

268
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,760
Ow, my knees.

269
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,860
I can do it.

270
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,360
As long as my head passes through, it's half a success.

271
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,610
I can do this. Come on!

272
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,810
Here we go.

273
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,320
What's going on with this?

274
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,160
Why can't I get out?

275
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,870
Don't tell me...

276
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,290
Am I stuck?

277
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,060
Do you hear me?

278
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,420
I got stuck.

279
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,360
I'm telling you I got stuck inside the vent.

280
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,240
Hello? H-Hello?

281
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,830
Can you hear me? Hello?

282
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,360
Hello? Oh my!

283
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,520
Oh no no no no no!

284
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,270
Hello?

285
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,330
Hello? Is there no one here?

286
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,810
Is anyone here?

287
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,820
Director Ok isn't doing anything in particular.

288
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,380
I'm wondering if we might have picked the wrong route to tap.

289
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,800
Or he could have already taken the materials out.

290
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,380
- Then what should we do? 
 - What do you think? We have to stop him before the transaction.

291
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,560
Here. It's been lifted off of CEO Yoon's computer. Make a copy as fast as possible.

292
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,440
Without reporting to the director?

293
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,140
- That's why I'm telling you to do it fast! I have to bring it to him. 
 - Yes.

294
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,570
Why did the others keep us totally in the dark? Huh?

295
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,760
Even if they're getting off work, they should report beforehand.

296
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,470
There has been absolutely zero contact from Noona Hwang since she got into the ventilation system.

297
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,750
You haven't checked on her all this time?

298
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,700
Sunbae Hwang?

299
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,710
It's weird. It seems like something has happened.

300
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,990
Find Hwang Mi Soon. Now.

301
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,970
You haven't forgotten about me, have you?

302
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,800
Kids.

303
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,380
I'm still here.

304
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,760
Hey newborn!

305
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,810
Where did you find this?

306
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,490
No matter how much I rummaged through, there was nothing in the security team. So I broke into the central security center.

307
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:10,440
The last time we were in contact with Sunbae Mi Soon was at 9:56, right?

308
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,200
It's around 340 meters from Chief Ok's office to the ventilator grate.

309
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,830
The fastest pace she can move in the ventilation system is  0.5 kilometers per hour.

310
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,130
If she moved at her fastest speed from the moment she installed the surveillance camera,

311
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,310
she should have arrived at the connecting passage at 10:34.

312
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:33,140
Since the connection passageway's height is forty inches at most...

313
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,110
She got stuck there.

314
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,070
After everyone leaves from the research center at 6 pm,

315
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,780
there's a system that discharges sterilization gas every hour.

316
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,450
But it is right around that time, so we have to take her out as soon as possible.

317
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,650
It must be around there.

318
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,670
We found Hwang Mi Soon's location.

319
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,640
Okay! I'm going next!

320
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,030
 System Locked 

321
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,520
- It's not working? 
 - What's going on with this?

322
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,900
Wait a second
  PIN 

323
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,780
It's ADIS research headquarters. You'll have to come urgently because of an error in the security system.

324
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,220
Yes. We'll depart right now. Yes.

325
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,540
Tell them to go in.

326
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,450
Yes, understood.

327
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,610
You requested an inspection at the headquarters because of a digital security error, right?

328
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,070
I didn't know there were females employees in the digital security team.

329
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,710
When did you do the latest security system update, by chance?

330
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,140
That is, I think it was last weekend.

331
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,400
Face authentication systems use a method where infrared dots are projected to obtain a pattern, so each time the laser sensor scans, it also stores every micro-change.

332
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,830
Thus, it is specified that when the access increases by twenty percent, you have to make sure to check the server's capacity.

333
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,660
You haven't done that?

334
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,190
Ah well.

335
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,000
Even when we didn't verify, there wasn't any problem before.

336
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,690
If there is an issue like the one now, and the dot projector becomes damaged because of repeated errors in the flood illuminator,

337
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,760
you must have been told that it would cost at least ten million won just to replace it.

338
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,330
Then, please confirm it.

339
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,700
Please verify it.

340
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:05,480
I'm sending you in because it seems like you would find your way better than me, but be careful.

341
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,710
Just in case. When it gets to 6 pm, please find the reboot button and press it.

342
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,570
- With that, the gas will be aired out. 
 - Six pm, the reboot button.

343
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,530
- It's a red button. 
 - Red button.

344
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,440
Six pm, reboot, red.

345
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,820
Sunbae!

346
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,330
  The red button.  

347
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,850
What's this!

348
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,890
Sunbae!

349
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,420
What do I do?

350
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:26,820
Where should I press?

351
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,500
Try to take a wild guess

352
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,080
Ding, dong, deng.

353
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,180
Shit. This one?

354
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,060
- Sunbae. 
 - Is no one here?

355
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,440
Hello?

356
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,610
- Hello?  
 - Sunbae?

357
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,510
Is someone there?

358
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,470
- Is it you, Sunbae? 
 - Yes, it is.

359
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,320
- I— 
 - Oh, Sunbae!

360
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,160
Please, get me out of this, quick.

361
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,220
You were stuck in there? Sunbae.

362
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,440
- Take me out. 
 - Wait just a little bit.

363
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,380
I'll quickly—

364
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,750
- Sunbae. 
 - Yes?

365
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,740
I'm sorry,

366
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,000
but if you could bend upward just a little bit more.

367
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,560
That is, it's not easy to change position. Wait a bit.

368
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,320
Ah, wait.

369
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,440
This is the facility maintenance team, right? I think there are bugs crawling in the ventilation system.

370
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,340
Isn't it the time to diffuse the pest prevention gas?

371
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,500
Pull, pull. Pull.

372
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,160
Hang on!

373
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:04,360
  Diffusion of the pest prevention gas. Diffusion of the pest prevention gas.  

374
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,050
  For the hygiene of the research center, pest prevention gas is being diffused.  

375
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:12,670
  There will be noise for approximately five minutes. Please excuse the disruption.  

376
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,520
Ah, I feel much better,

377
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,230
Is there anywhere on me that's broken?

378
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,440
You seem fine as far as I can tell.

379
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,190
Will you be able to try getting out again?

380
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,840
Yes...

381
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,740
-Wh-What is it?! 
-C-C-Cramps!

382
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,670
Wh-Where?

383
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,840
Not there. My leg!

384
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,070
Leg! Leg!

385
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,280
What's that smoke over there?

386
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,480
Doesn't it smell like some kind of insecticide?

387
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,950
- Gas!!
 - Hurry! Over there!

388
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,210
Quickly! Quickly! I hate getting gassed!

389
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,740
Quickly! Quickly!

390
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,590
Is there a problem there?

391
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,330
No. Everything is fine!

392
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,090
Uh, okay.

393
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,020
Let's go.

394
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,760
Wait there! Wait up!

395
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,340
I pressed the Reboot button by mistake.

396
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,650
- I'll check it later. 
 - Okay. Huh?

397
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,670
Wait a moment!

398
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,580
What is she doing?

399
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,930
Are you okay??

400
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:15,630
I got them a half-size bigger and this one keeps coming off when I run.

401
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,830
What do you think you're–!

402
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,370
Can you call someone right now?

403
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,970
I think it was broken. Let's go inside.

404
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,510
The system is back to normal.

405
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,500
The system is back to normal.

406
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,890
I'll be off now.

407
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,410
  Complete Clean  

408
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,250
Here.

409
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,350
Why a tracking device?

410
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,440
From now on, wear this even when you go use the restroom.

411
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,140
Yes, sir. We'll stick to it.

412
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,570
If you press the button here for more than three seconds during an emergency, it'll be a code blue.

413
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,580
My emergency

414
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,950
is the fact that I'm stuck out here way past dinner time,

415
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,210
this very moment.

416
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,190
Can you eat dinner after taking in all that gas, unni?

417
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,190
I already let out all the ga–

418
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,430
What?

419
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,150
What?

420
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,420
Stop it! Stop! Let go!

421
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,460
Sparklingly Swift Clean

422
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,410
  NIS Director Seo Gook Hwan 

423
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,360
Why does he still use this stuff?

424
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,300
Ah, yes. Yes.

425
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,380
What's going on with this?

426
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,330
Ouch it stings!

427
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,820
Alright.

428
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,670
 Made in China 

429
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,130
The preparation of the goods is complete.

430
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,010
Good job. Finish the delivery properly, without any mishap.

431
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,530
The delivery will start soon. Be ready.

432
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,400
 If they keep up for just a little longer, 

433
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,230
 I think it'll be good... 

434
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,270
Well, I don't care.

435
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,940
Ah, I'm dying.

436
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:44,300
Ah, it aches. Everywhere in my body hurts.

437
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,670
It's really bad.

438
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,290
Ugh.

439
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:58,820
Wow!

440
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,070
We just threw out all the recycling.

441
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,570
What are you going to do if it attracts flies?

442
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,230
Aigoo, we can just throw it away next week.

443
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:11,210
That's right! Home Run! Home Run! Home Run! Run, run!

444
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,230
Run, run, run!

445
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,840
Hey! We hit that run, base hit and we got to 3rd base!!

446
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:22,830
Did you forget that I told you I would be busy for a few months because I have to build up my performance?

447
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:26,810
Outside I work until my back breaks, at home I work until my back bends.

448
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,170
Have some conscience, will you?!

449
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,810
All you do is meet up with ajummas to drink tea and chat.

450
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:38,360
You get contracts just smiling at them. I would pay to have a job where you play to earn money.

451
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,810
Are you done talking?

452
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,260
Honey, what's the matter? Honey?

453
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,920
Playing with the Korean Alphabet

454
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,030
We dug thorugh CEO Yoon's computer.

455
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:08,030
I heard that those that can keep up with you as a programmer in the NIS are few and far between.

456
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,340
How long will it take to analyze the data?

457
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,230
  USB Access 

458
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,480
 NIS 

459
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,740
No matter how much I look, there's nothing much.

460
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,580
 Let's get married as soon as this job is done. 

461
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,030
 I'll confidently meet your parents and introduce myself 

462
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,960
 and tell our chief as well. 

463
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:54,390
 I thought you wanted to keep it a secret until the mission was completed. 

464
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,840
 I don't want to be a burden to you, Oppa.  

465
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,780
 Promise? 

466
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,990
No matter how much I mull it over, you're suspicious.

467
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,810
- Who? 
- The day before yesterday...

468
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,820
that female employee from Il Gwang HiTech who busted up the photo set.

469
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:33,720
I thought you threatened her that you wouldn't budge unless they paid four times the contract fee.

470
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,110
I thought about it and I think she took my picture that day.

471
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,200
What's the big deal with her taking a photo?

472
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,690
I mean a picture of me in the nude.

473
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,530
Are you sure it was shot?

474
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,420
I'm asking you, Hyung, to find out because I'm not sure!

475
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,480
Am I a member of the NIS? How should I find out? Should I ask her to her face?

476
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,170
If you do, do you think she'll just admit to having taken my picture?

477
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:00,510
If she took a picture, she would have already taken action!

478
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,720
That's why you won't get anywhere, Hyung.

479
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,970
Does the world seem beautiful to you because you eat and sleep comfortably under (because of) me? Yeah?

480
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:11,710
Do you know how many trashy people out there manipulate and steal from others for their own gain?

481
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:18,560
I mean, how would a laborer like you who slaves away to the bone, day and night for a lifetime know?

482
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,560
I know. Star Kang!

483
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,840
Hyung has some business tomorrow and your schedule is clear.

484
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,950
Can I take just one day off?

485
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,400
Are you kidding?

486
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,690
What about my salad? What about Ppoppi's food?

487
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,640
What about cleaning my shoes?

488
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,360
Who's going to do all those things?

489
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,600
Ugh, so truly frustrating...

490
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,360
Yes, it's me.

491
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,340
 Go get the item from 7-49 by 9:30 tonight.  

492
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,640
 Wang Kai will contact you when you arrive in Taiwan. 

493
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,240
  You just have to meet him and give him the item.  

494
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,350
If I just give the item to this Wang Kai person

495
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,740
is my job complete?

496
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,990
  If you deliver it with no mistakes.  

497
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:10,780
Then, when can I expect the money you promised?

498
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,330
 Jung-gu 

499
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,970
7-49...
  Taeneung, Hagye, Madeul

00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,650
Suraksan Station.

501
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,440
  Suraksan Station

00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:28,600
 4 Noil Elementary School Noil Middle School 

503
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,400
 Number 7 line 

504
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,210
  We've left the item in the delivery box.  

505
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,590
  Watch carefully until the delivery is in motion. 

506
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,500
 Il Gwang HiTech  

507
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,980
 Il Gwang HiTech

00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,780
 Complete Clean 

509
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,540
 I think Director Ok already smuggled out the goods.  

510
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,950
That fuc–

511
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,430
 I think Chief Ok already moved the item.  

512
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:28,180
 You mean I worked like a dog to install the camera in his room for nothing? 

513
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:33,940
 But I don't think he could have taken care of something that costs many hundred billion won so quickly. 

514
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,600
 We should be able to get some circumstantial evidence if we look into HQ Director Tak. 

515
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,290
  We have to stop him before he does the deal.  

516
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,670
- Mr. CEO. 
-Is this your lunch?

517
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:02,810
It seemed like your off-site job was taking a while, so 
I was waiting. I'm sorry.

518
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,190
Oh, yes. Off-site.

519
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,200
Uh... This is for you.

520
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,190
Huh?

521
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:14,700
It's a congratulatory hiring gift. Like a bribe for you to stay for a long time.

522
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,530
Uh... Shall we eat together?

523
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,730
I met Kang Woo Won and tried to persuade him, but...

524
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,170
What did you do to persuade him

525
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,910
that made the contract fee fluff up from three times to four times the original fee.

526
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:04,210
There was a very small and insignificant problem.

527
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,150
A problem.

528
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,390
Can it be resolved?

529
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:11,710
Of course! It can be resolved!

530
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,750
I think...?

531
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,490
Then solve it.

532
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,020
Me?

533
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,770
I'm just getting back from a meeting with Kang Woo Won.

534
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:24,780
Kang Woo Won said that this ad contract

535
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,080
will be discussed with you.

536
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,020
Wh-Why?

537
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,290
It must be because of the very small

538
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:37,040
and insignificant problem that only you can solve, Jeong Eun.

539
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,160
Okay. I'll meet Kang Woo Won and try to resolve this no matter what and—

540
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,980
If you can't, it's the end.

541
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,780
- End. 
- The End.

542
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,300
You know?

543
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:15,790
- Good work on finishing up the second phase of research. 
 - Thank you.

544
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,000
HQ Director Tak will do the rest,

545
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,470
so put all your energy into phase 3 of the research.

546
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,280
Yes, sir.

547
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,810
When will the item be delivered?

548
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,530
The day after tomorrow there's an event in Taiwan.

549
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,030
An Il Gwang Kukbab stone product release with Hallyu Star Kang Woo Won?

550
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:38,160
We're thinking of making contact with the buyer during the Taiwan event and delivering the item.

551
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,250
There shouldn't be any problems, right?

552
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,580
As soon as the item is delivered, I will go to Kaoshiung to receive the payout.

553
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,070
Go ahead and take the promised incentive once the balance is collected.

554
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,540
Thank you, Executive Director.

555
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:53,780
If phase three is completed without any problems, some few billion KRW won't be an issue.

556
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,840
Did you have something more to say?

557
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,530
No, sir.

558
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,860
I will get going now.

559
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,780
Why don't we eat together since you've come to headquarters?

560
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,020
If I want to meet the deadline for the third phase of research

561
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,960
I have to get back to the lab.

562
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,660
What! What! What?!

563
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,350
Why are you greeting me without even knowing me?

564
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:40,510
I develop, distribute, and do all the hard work.

565
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:44,410
What's the point of all these things? Some other rando bastard takes all the money.

566
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:47,860
You fucking little son of a...

567
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,430
Deputy Director~ Working hard.

568
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:56,390
Don't mention it. I don't do much.

569
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,160
You do all the hard work, Director Tak.

570
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,340
As long as you know.

571
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,460
You must have prepared all these knowing this is the day I come here.

572
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,030
It's so obvious a real feast was prepared.

573
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:25,130
When you come, Mr. CEO, of course, we'll have a special meal.

574
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:28,680
But we really didn't know. Right?

575
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,490
Of course!

576
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,260
Ah right, you like fish cakes, don't you?

577
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,110
Have a lot.

578
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:37,080
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

579
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,590
- Eat well. 
 - Thank you.

580
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,220
Division Director Tak, hello.

581
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,690
  Division Director Tak Sang Gi.   

582
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:48,400
  Managing Director Myeong’s right-hand man is Director Tak Sang Gi. He does everything an underling does. 

583
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,120
  He’s the one that we must pay attention to, remember.  
    

584
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,160
You should have asked me to do it for you.

585
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,000
No, take a seat.

586
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,270
Everything is self-service here. I just took yours as I was getting mine.

587
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,720
Don't mind me and eat comfortably.

588
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,370
Thank you for the food.

589
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,030
You're welcome.

590
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:23,180
On the Wednesday of the first and third week of every month, I have lunch in the company cafeteria.

591
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,640
I had no idea the CEO would also use the cafeteria.

592
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,590
I come every now and then, sometimes to have a late-night snack, as well.

593
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:35,000
The ajumma in the kitchen makes really delicious tteokramyeon (ricecake ramen).

594
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,010
What is it? Does it seem like a façade?

595
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:48,560
CEOs need to look dignified and stern to be cool. Right?

596
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,300
It isn't so.

597
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,750
Seeing you looking out for the employees' welfare is great.

598
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:59,890
If we have to work overnight next time, let's come here to get some tteokramyun together.

599
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,880
  Tteokramyun.  

600
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,090
  You leave aside mandu ramyeon, seafood ramyeon, black bean ramyeon, for tteokramyun again?  

601
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:11,120
  When I get into something, I only stay fixed on it.  

602
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:21,420
I'll join you on your table.

603
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:32,170
Wow. I haven't eaten in the cafeteria in a long time, so it tastes really great like honey.

604
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,470
  Michael!  

605
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:52,410
 The laws, my butt. Just die, you bastard! 

606
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,760
 Armenia 2019 new product 

607
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,660
  Armenia scarf 2019 new product  

608
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,550
  Why does Division Director Tak have the exact same brand scarf as Michael?  

609
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,610
  Try getting into Planning and Development division  Division Director Tak's office right now.  

610
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:44,420
I was curious because I heard that you had hired a new secretary, Mr. CEO. I ran into you.

611
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:52,920
Let's get up if you're done with your meal.

612
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,590
- Sorry? 
 - I feel like I'm going to get indigestion if I eat any more.

613
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:58,370
I don't really have an appetite, either. Let's go.

614
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:38,100
If you come this late, what am I supposed to do?

615
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,650
I thought you wouldn't come and got freaking scared.

616
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,150
What about the documents?

617
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,270
Give the money first. This instant.

618
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,260
  Name: Baek Chan Mi 

619
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:05,540
The little rat is so cute.  (in Chinese) 

620
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,970
  Name: Baek Chan Mi, Affiliation: Industrial Security Team 3 

621
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,590
Yes, it's me. You said you caught it?

622
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:21,030
Yes, Secretary Baek Jang Mi's real name is Baek Chan Mi.

623
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:24,920
It's interesting. Keep going.

624
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,340
What happened to your hand?

625
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,270
I hurt it by accident.

626
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:49,700
You should be careful. If a woman's body gets marred, she is less pretty.

627
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:56,950
Here are the band-aids and the ointment you asked for.

628
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:01,770
Put this on before the scar becomes infected.

629
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,140
Go.

630
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,030
Let's go.

631
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:46,390
  Identification card - Baek Jang Mi  

632
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,500
You must be in a hurry.

633
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,430
You even stopped in the midst of your meal.

634
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:02,180
Because a guest came to find me in my office without making an appointment.

635
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,220
  Division Director Tak will arrive within three minutes.  

636
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:22,980
What kind of premonition did she get again, all of a sudden?

637
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,740
 Ki Mi Seon 

638
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,680
  Secretary Baek Jang Mi was an NIS agent.  

639
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,760
  Real name, Baek Chan Mi. Age, thirty-eight years old.  

640
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:06,380
  Assigned to the NIS Industrial Security team three. Relieved from duty three years ago after failing in the apprehension of Michael. 

641
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:11,610
  Agent Gwon Min Seok, who was her immediate subordinate at the time, died then.  

642
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:25,260


643
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:30,440
♫  Let's Love  Let's love  ♫

644
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:35,730
♫  Sweetly together and intensely  ♫

645
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:44,070
♫   Let's love with the most precious in the world, you  ♫

646
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:46,300
 Completely Clean 

647
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,630
  Epilogue  

648
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:54,660
- Did your encounter with CEO Yoon go well? 
 - What?

649
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,270
Hey, how is it to see him in-person?

650
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:58,230
- Aren't his visuals amazing? 
 - Well, yeah.

651
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:05,780
That is, uhm. You know how we have to report on people we have a personal history with when on an operation?

652
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,740
Yes, why? Did you meet someone you know?

653
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:11,040
- That is— 
 - Ah, really.

654
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,620
If I had gotten assigned to CEO Yoon, I would have just seduced him.

655
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,560
Did you inhale gas?

656
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,490
You think I wouldn't be able to?

657
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:25,420
No matter what, I was the successful Catherine Hwang in the good old days. Don't you know?

658
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,060
What about your husband?

659
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,590
I'm just saying it, just saying it.

660
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:32,850
I'm stuck in the corridors, the toilets and the lobby day-in/day-out.

661
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:35,980
We should be happy to feast our eyes on a beautiful man if put next to us.

662
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:41,060
It would have been better if I had got in as CEO Yoon's secretary, instead.

663
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,820
Look, even she's interested. You're interested too, right?

664
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,360
That's not it.

665
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:49,410
No matter how I see it, there's no way that Kang Woo Won would be the culprit.

666
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:54,060
He isn't someone who can have the complex thoughts necessary to commit a crime.

667
01:01:54,060 --> 01:02:00,350
Then what? Are you saying that because Yoon Seok Ho is clever, he is culprit material?

668
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,600
That's not it, but he does have the highest likelihood.

669
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:09,330
Hey, when you monitor someone you already pointed out as the culprit, whatever they do will seem suspicious and problematic. Don't you know that?

670
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:12,910
Look at you, why are you taking out your seriousness all of a sudden?

671
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:19,820
No, I mean. Kang Woo Won could also be the culprit, is what I'm saying.

672
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:25,370
One is with a successful hallyu star, the other with a rich and handsome CEO.

673
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:29,110
You two are complaining about your stomach being full (still complaining although being blessed)

674
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:32,110
- What were you going to say earlier? 
 - What?

675
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,090
I-I-It's nothing.

676
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,550
Weren't you going to say something important?

677
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:41,080
- About how during an operation— 
 - Hey, could you get Kang Woo Won's autograph?

678
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,680
Joo Hyeon seems to really like him.

679
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,950
I'll try asking him.

680
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:49,570
Really? Wait, where can I find a piece of paper. Paper.

681
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:57,200
  Good Casting - Preview  

682
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,620
She is the teacher who'll teach you the CSAT foreign language section

683
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,500
  Let's work well together, Yoon Seok Ho.  

684
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,960
  When you get into Kang Woo Won's house, secure the surveillance cameras.  

685
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,820
  She is exactly the type I hate.  

686
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,520
  Division Director Tak might be Michael.   
    

687
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,650
  Sweep every single bit of evidence we can use.   
    

688
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,390
  Five minutes will be more than enough. Let's go.  

689
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,570
  - Please go back. 
 - Me?   

690
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:14,980
  Go catch her right away, before she runs off.  

691
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,400
  Block all exits!  

692
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,050
  Baek Chan Mi, Hwang Mi Soon. Get out quick! Hey! 

693
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:24,030
  If Michael is in there, I'm going to take him down no matter what.  

694
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:26,440
♫  Go choose  ♫

695
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,660
  Today, you guys!  

696
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,800
  You're all dead.
