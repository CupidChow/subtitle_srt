1
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,650
Let me catch the guy who killed Pi Cheol Woong... and then I'll leave the operation.

2
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,410
That's not what you promised in the beginning. 
    

3
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,450
  An internal traitor?  

4
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,050
  I got a  report that we are moldy deep inside.   
      

5
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,050
  I'll make you join the operation to help you in catching Michael,  

6
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,750
  but I need you  

7
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,850
  to dig out the mold that has grown inside.  

8
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,050
  Can you do it?  

9
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,050
  I'll do it.  

10
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,850
You'll be okay with not catching Michael yourself?

11
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,450
Until now, I was so intent on catching Michael

12
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,650
that I was forgetting this one thing.

13
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,250
You were forgetting...

14
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,650
Is it important enough to break our promise?

15
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,050
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,850
I don't know what it is, but you must have found the mold.

17
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,650
And if we discover Michael's identity,

18
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,450
then we're halfway to accomplishing the mission.

19
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,850
Go ahead.

20
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,250
Let me know when and where to meet you.

21
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,550
If you plan on bringing any backup or weapons,

22
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,250
you know the deal is off, right?

23
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,050
Don't worry. I'm going empty-handed.

24
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,650
I like your attitude.

25
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,650
No wonder I liked you from the start.

26
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,250
Stop saying nonsense and just let me know when.

27
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:17,250


28
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,850
  Sunbae Baek Chan Mi  

29
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,050
  I disobeyed the order   

30
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,950
  and acted arrogant, which got Min Seok killed.  

31
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,050
  Enough.  

32
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,250
  It wasn't enough for me to put my teammates in danger—  

33
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,450
  Please stop.  

34
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,250
  I lost the killer  

35
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,250
  like a dumbass. This is the truth.  

36
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,250
  Messages  

37
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,250
  There is one voicemail left by "Sunbae Baek Chan Mi."  

38
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,650
 You have a voice message.  

39
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,150
  I'm calling because there's something I need to give you.  

40
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,650
  I was nervous about what I'd say if you picked up the phone,  

41
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,250
  but then it led to voicemail  

42
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,750
  and my heart sank.  

43
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,850
  It was the same three years ago.  

44
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,150
  I went to the house Min Seok used to live in and rang the bell,  

45
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,050
  but then I worried that someone would actually come out  

46
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,750
  and got really nervous.   
    

47
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,850
Who is it?

48
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,250
Kwon Min Seok...

49
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,650
We just moved here.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,710
  When another person came out,  

51
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,450
  it felt like even the chance to apologize disappeared  

52
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,650
  and I felt dreadful.  

53
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,650
  When the person I was supposed to meet three years ago  

54
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,850
  turned out to be you,  

55
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,850
  I felt the same dread.  

56
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,650
  I still haven't caught the person who killed Min Seok,  

57
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,050
  so I worry that  

58
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,650
  I'm putting you in danger like Min Seok.  

59
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,650
  I'm going to make sure nothing like that happens again.  

60
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,350
  Never again...  

61
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,050
  The thing I was going to give you, I'll leave it by Min Seok.  

62
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,650
I was going to come to visit you once I caught Michael,

63
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,750
but I came just in case this is the last chance.

64
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,850
If I were to leave without saying goodbye,

65
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,950
that would be too shameless of me.

66
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,150
I can't promise you that I'll come by again,

67
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,450
but I will definitely catch your killer.

68
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,850
If I die, I'll make sure he dies with me.

69
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,650
I promise you.

70
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,650
Something horrible is happening!

71
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,750
Sunbae Chan Mi... Sunbae Chan Mi, by herself...

72
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,550
  Episode 12  

73
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,850
Track Baek Chan Mi's car right now. I think she went to meet with Division Director Tak by herself.

74
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,850
Sunbae Baek went in alone with the ledger?

75
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,850
Wait, you gave her the ledger?!

76
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,250
She came to me abruptly demanding I give it to her,

77
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,250
what could I do? But good thing she only took the copy.

78
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,850
So where is she now?

79
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,350
  Just a second.  

80
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,850
Sunbae Chan Mi is crossing the Yeongjong Bridge.

81
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,850
It seems like she's going to meet Division Director Tak on his yacht.

82
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,850
Yacht?

83
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,050
  Hamyeong High School  

84
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,110
What is it?

85
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,320
I'll head over there right away, so send me the location.

86
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,450
Shit.

87
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,250
I got Sunbae Baek's final location!

88
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,250
Yeongjong Marina?

89
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,250
Where is that?

90
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,350
It's where the yacht is docked.

91
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,750
Why is this so slow though?

92
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,050
What's happening?

93
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,850
What is this?!

94
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,050
Who are you?!

95
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,550
Hey

96
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,850
I think Sunbae Ye Eun's lapotop was being hacked!

97
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,850
What... What did you say? Who hacked her?!

98
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,050
I've been trying to delete the virus, so I haven't found out yet—

99
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,550
Hurry up and find the son of a bitch!

100
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,550
  Top Secret - Code Name 'Good Casting'  

101
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,650
  Good Casting  

102
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,450
  Yeongjong Marina  

103
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,450
I'm not some thug who makes a copy and takes the original,

104
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,250
so don't worry. This is the only one, the original.

105
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,450
- Be careful, it's smeared with oil so it'll catch on fire very easily. 
 - What?

106
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,250
You dare to double-cross me?! Do you want to die?

107
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,750
Go to hell!

108
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,950
He kicked the bucket.

109
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,050
You.

110
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,380
Who are you?

111
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,250
You really don't know who I am?

112
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,050
Gosh, come on.

113
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,070
You saw it?

114
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,370
So you saw it.

115
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,260
Don't move!

116
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,550
Aish, damn.

117
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,480
If you move, I'll shoot.

118
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,110
Throw it away. Throw it, I said!

119
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,360
Seems like you practiced shooting a lot.

120
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,370
You didn't have time to read a book to your kid,

121
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,260
but had plenty of time to shoot guns, huh?

122
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,800
I can shoot well.

123
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,490
I said it very clearly: do not move.

124
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,820
 Ssak Ssak Cleaning 

125
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,720
You're probably not going to be able to shoot me.

126
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,790
Ah, I can just shoot you first!

127
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,180
No!

128
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,830
No!

129
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,340
Sunbae...

130
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,340
Help me.

131
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,610
Help me. Is nobody there?!

132
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,370
What should I do?

133
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,940
It's dangerous.

134
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,920
Why did you come?

135
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,280
Please don't speak. You're hurt.

136
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,310
Chan Mi!

137
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,320
Someone's been shot. Hurry to the yacht dock!

138
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,150
This is why I told you to never act alone.

139
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,420
Why did you do it?!!

140
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,450
Hm? What did you say?

141
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,560
Why are you like this? Why are you like this?!

142
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,090
Why are you like this? Chan Mi, no.

143
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,680
Pull yourself together.

144
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,290
Chan Mi, pull yourself together!

145
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,810
When is the ambulance coming?!

146
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,900
- Sunbae, wake up. 
 - Chan Mi, no.

147
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,860
Sunbae, open your eyes!

148
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,120
Oh... What should I do?

149
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,880
Chan Mi, pull yourself together! No...

150
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,120
What should I do now?

151
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,070
Bravo! Let's go!

152
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,270
We're transferring a patient with abdominal penetration.

153
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,140
She's experiencing low blood pressure shock due to excessive bleeding,

154
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,110
has lost consciousness, and we suspect damage to a large vessel.

155
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,820
You're strong-willed, Chan Mi.

156
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,800
You can make it.

157
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,140
You will make it.

158
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,390
What is wrong?

159
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,230
What's wrong with this? Do something!

160
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,890
Yes, I will.

161
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,100
Chan Mi! Please come back to your senses.

162
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,600
You can hear my voice, right?! Chan Mi!! Chan Mi!!

163
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,660
Please do something please! Chan Mi!!

164
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,800
Wake up!

165
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,970
Chan Mi!

166
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,980
Open your eyes!

167
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,160
 Tae San University Hospital 

168
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,110
 Surgery in Progress 

169
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,960
So you didn't manage

170
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,510
to see the culprit's face at all?

171
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,370
The distance would have been less than ten meters.

172
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,790
Does it make any sense that you don't even know what jerk shot the gun? Does it?!

173
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,340
It would've been her first time holding a gun on the field.

174
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,430
Would she have been in the right mind to differentiate between who's who?

175
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,320
In a situation where her colleague's life is on the line?

176
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,050
Yes.

177
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:56,190
If Sunbae Baek's surgery isn't over yet, it must mean she made it past critical state, right?

178
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,460
What happened to what I told you to look into?

179
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,280
I think Chief Ok is the person who hacked  Sunbae Ye Eun's laptop.

180
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,130
Judging by how the hacking tool was installed the same day as when we hacked Chief Ok's phone,

181
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,540
it seems Chief Ok had already put a reverse hack in place.

182
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,110
We don't know what else might come out, so search the house thoroughly.

183
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,650
Don't leave So Hee's side no matter what.

184
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,390
Division Director Tak is dead and Baek Chan Mi is on her death bed?

185
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,850
Yes.

186
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,740
What are the chances of Baek Chan Mi surviving?

187
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,640
According to the medical staff, that seems unlikely.

188
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,160
Okay, we've got another chance.

189
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,860
- Give me your phone.
- Pardon?

190
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,030
Ah, yes.

191
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,350
It's me.

192
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,040
I didn't know if we could talk on the phone.

193
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,940
You're really making me baffled in a lot of ways.

194
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,130
Please help me.

195
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,010
I didn't know we were close enough to make personal requests of each other.

196
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,640
 How can you say such a hurtful thing? 

197
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,470
As we started as a give-and-take relationship, if one side starts to tilt,

198
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,100
isn't it obvious that the relationship would break?

199
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,860
If you help me just this once, as soon as I get out

200
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,950
I'll remove Baek Chan Mi from your sight!

201
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,720
Why don't you just live out your sentence and start a new life afterward?

202
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,640
Is this what I get after the loyalty I've shown you all this time?

203
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,800
This is why it's a pain to have classless people working for you.

204
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,620
They choose to crawl for you, then start taking liberties when things get inconvenient.

205
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,090
What? Are you done talking?

206
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,100
I liked you because we understood each other,

207
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,090
but it seems like I was the only one who was understanding.

208
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,290
You. Do you think I'll go down by myself?!

209
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,600
Do you have any pretext to take me down with you?

210
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,190
 Ah, yes. 

211
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,300
You must have been deleting CCTV data and getting rid of evidence every time we met so you could cut me out like this.

212
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,810
But what a pity.

213
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:18,320
It seems like you went too far with how much you look down on the Director of NIS.

214
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,730
It looks like you took us too lightly, too.

215
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,360
There are plenty of people who will sell their conscience for a little money.

216
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,380
 I won't die like this. 

217
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,480
 I'm definitely not going to die like this. I won't— 

218
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,070
 The person that you dialed cannot be reached— 

219
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,650
I won't be over like this.

220
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,110
I'm definitely not going to die alone. Definitely!

221
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,140
I was almost hurt because we've been apart so long.

222
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,280
You must have known how I was feeling, coming here yourself.

223
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,430
People aren't on the same wavelength this often.

224
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,110
Did the office's interior change recently?

225
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,420
I changed the whole place to match the art.

226
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,830
The main item has to stand out.

227
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,250
You're openly buttering me up because I'm a major shareholder.

228
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,280
It makes you look low class.

229
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,010
You're so honest.

230
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,490
Don't measure or back out and just join me.

231
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,750
Just leave CEO Yoon who's not thinking straight because he's hung up on a woman.

232
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,910
Being too truthful is revolting though.

233
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,160
This is I.K. Aesthetic's

234
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,090
new business plan they will present when you launch Il Gwang Cosmetics.

235
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,900
I like a clear give-and-take deal.

236
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,530
Trust and faith are useless when time passes and situations change.

237
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:12,600
Giving what you're supposed to give, and receiving what you need to receive, is a more transparent relationship,  should I say?

238
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,380
Of course, this isn't the end of it.

239
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,410
Think of this as just an appetizer.

240
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,800
This is why it's important to have the same principles.

241
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,980
We understand each other.

242
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,800
I'm starting to get curious as to what the main dish is..

243
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,580
The surgery has ended well, but about the patient regaining consciousness, we'll have to wait and see.

244
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,400
What do you mean?! After conducting surgery on her for over 10 hours?!

245
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,070
Does it make sense that you don't know if she'll regain consciousness or not?!

246
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:59,210
Why are you getting worked up? But still, she will regain her consciousness, right?

247
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,500
I also earnestly wish for her to regain consciousness, but...

248
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,560
Are you sure the surgery went well?

249
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,250
You cut open her belly and don't know whether she will regain consciousness? Does that make sense?!

250
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,710
Hey! I earnestly hope she'll wake up, too! You quack!

251
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,950
Why are you like this?

252
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,340
Sunbae, wake up.

253
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,010
If you go like this,

254
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,600
I'm going to hold a grudge against you forever.

255
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,410
 Personnel Appointment Form 
Strategic Planning Team- Baek Jang Mi- Wait Listed- Wait listed for worker's personal reasons/situations 

256
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,130
Wait a minute.

257
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,420
I feel like I'm going to regret this after saying it.

258
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,170
What's the matter?

259
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,410
I heard that Secretary Baek is an NIS agent.

260
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,720
Are you joking right now?

261
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,290
And she's at the hospital right now.

262
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,120
Why the hospital?

263
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,750
It's said that she was shot.

264
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,510
Why didn't you say so earlier?!

265
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,110
Maybe I shouldn't have told him.

266
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:51,530
Why did you break up with Sunbae Chan Mi?

267
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,590
Why? Do you think she betrayed me?

268
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:04,170
Everyone knows her as the betrayer, after all.

269
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,560
I'd rather she had betrayed us. It would feel less distressing.

270
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,790
There was a time when she almost died because of me, you know.

271
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,610
Pardon?

272
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,130
When she intervened, trying to help me.

273
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,980
When it's for the sake of someone she likes, she doesn't care about the circumstances.

274
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,180
She's a person that can't do that calculation in her mind.

275
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,920
After what happened to Kwon Min Seok,

276
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,530
she probably wasn't able to live a normal life.

277
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,080
She probably thought that it would have been better if she had died.

278
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,510
Please go back.

279
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,600
Step aside.

280
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,500
I won't step aside.

281
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,900
What are you doing right now?

282
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,000
That's what I'd like to ask. You canceled the contract and kicked your secretary out.

283
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,900
What lingering attachment brings you running over?

284
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,370
I never kicked her out.

285
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,690
I don't intend to, either.

286
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,550
Even if you don't kick her out, I'm going to withdraw her.

287
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,020
Do we still have business with each other?

288
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,600
What should we do? I have zero intention to leave before I get to see Baek Chan Mi.

289
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,590
Keep your treasured past in your heart and go home.

290
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,550
Who said we were in the past?

291
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,820
I'm thinking present progressive, actually.

292
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,120
The hospital is a place to heal, not where you get hurt.

293
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,350
You should cut it out.

294
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,870
That's what I wanted to say.

295
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,420
What are you doing? Go inside, quick.

296
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,410
Who are you?

297
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,010
If I say it myself, it's no fun.

298
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:58,910
Don't come in now. This is not the time for visitations. You have to leave now.

299
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,200
How can you be lying here just because I told you to leave?

300
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,620
What will I do, then?

301
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,000
You only think of yourself, Teacher.

302
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,580
I wasn't really mad. I just...

303
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:44,180
I resented you and was a little mad in the moment,

304
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,590
but it was really only for a moment.

305
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,430
I was waiting for you to come back apologizing.

306
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,730
But I ended up coming to you first, again.

307
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,200
I'm not letting you go again. Ever.

308
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,930
 The thing I was going to give you... I'll leave it with Min Seok. 

309

 Actually, the Team Leader told me to stay out of this mission, but I forced them to let me in.

00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,980
 I'm going to tell Team Leader everything when the mission is over. I'll say who is the person I'm in love with. 

321
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,980
 I'm going to ask for extended leave for our honeymoon, too. 

322
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:11,270
 I was really happy and warm after meeting you. 

323
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,730
 And I'm thankful that you came beside me when I was lonely. 

324
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:34,520
 I really can't do this. Do I have to do it? 

325
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,410
 Ah, I really can't do this. 

326
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,780
 - You missed a part. 
 - Come on.  

327
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,440
 I love you. 

328
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:09,460
♫  That snowy afternoon  ♫

329
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,380
♫  And that evening sunset,  ♫

330
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,080
 You really have to edit this well, okay? 

331
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,000
 Hey! Why would I be the one editing this footage? 

332
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,380
 Then who would do it? I don't have family or anyone else to do it. 

333
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,420
 Hey, saying this is a foul... 

334
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:36,840
♫  And that day I writhed in my dreams  ♫

335
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:44,020
♫  They go by, same as always. And those days remain  ♫

336
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,130
♫  in me  ♫

337
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,440
It's because of the fine dust.

338
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:12,460
You saw the news, right? The one that says fine dust causes cerebropathy in people and can lead to dementia.

339
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:17,610
As you can see, I get along extremely well with people.

340
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,270
I guess you can say I have a very open personality that allows people to approach me freely.

341
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:27,470
Sometimes they take liberties because a big star like me treats them comfortably,

342
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,860
but I'm nice enough to overlook that stuff.

343
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,720
Do you understand?

344
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,690
But lately, I can't control my emotions, lost my appetite,

345
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,370
and don't have any will to work, which makes no sense.

346
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,040
I used to dance automatically when I saw the numbers in my bankbook

347
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,860
and used to feel full from two lettuce leaves.

348
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,970
Why would I be feeling these unusual symptoms?

349
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,480
It's because of the fine dust. You understand, right?

350
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,570
You clearly do have a problem.

351
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:10,520
I knew it. Is it a serious disease? 
 Excessive Hate Toward Kang Woo Won After Sad News About His Manager... Concerns over "Second Violence"  

352
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:16,420
People tend to obsess over or get absorbed in simple things when they're under extreme stress.

353
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,370
It's the mind's defense mechanism to break away from stress.

354
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:28,350
Does that mean that I'm obsessing over fine dust?

355
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:32,520
Aren't you more bothered by trivial things than before?

356
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,840
 Look, it's not there. 

357
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,880
 Once you give it once, it's over. 

358
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,680
 - It was mine—
 - Taking back something you've given is a cheap move! 

359
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,290
Not at all! Why would a high-level person like me be concerned with something so small?

360
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,470
So what if someone cries? So what if someone leaves their food behind?

361
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,760
As you can see, I'm not someone who obsesses over some little note.

362
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,540
I don't have that much free time.

363
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:09,150
Experiencing high spirits for a time and suddenly experiencing very depressive feelings

364
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,930
shows a high possibility of bipolar disorder.

365
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,010
Commonly known as manic depression—

366
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,940
Yes, I know. Manic depression.

367
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,770
It may seem like unimportant symptoms at first, but if you keep on delaying taking care of it...

368
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:26,390
As long as it's not depression, it's fine. Since there are still moments I feel good, after all.

369
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,980
That President... I told him it wasn't a big deal and he made such a fuss.

370
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,020
Wait a moment.

371
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,260
Ah, I'll give you my autograph the next opportunity we get.

372
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,570
Ah, but your prescription..

373
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,860
 Prescription 

374
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,190
I said to you it was actually nothing,

375
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,870
Did they really say it's nothing?

376
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,720
Did you think that the psychopaths who write negative comments about me online

377
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,530
could make me get depression or something?

378
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:04,470
To me, you looked like my cat who is lovesick.

379
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,450
What are you saying? Lovesick?

380
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,330
Didn't I tell you? My cat had to be hospitalized because it got lovesickness.

381
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,850
What were the symptoms?

382
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,690
- It is depressed. 
 - Depressed.

383
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,840
- Isn't eating. 
 - Not eating.

384
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,960
Doesn't even play. It was just hmmm. Just like you.

385
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,890
Come on. What kind of cat gets lovesick? You make no sense.

386
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,920
Huh?

387
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,100
- Oh! 
 - What is it?

388
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,480
I thought I saw someone.

389
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,220
Who? Who?

390
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,170
I think I'm going crazy!

391
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,550
I don't see her.

392
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,270
 Testimony Record 

393
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,080
Why did you do that... to Sunbae Chan Mi?

394
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,350
I turned it off.

395
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:37,080
Kidnapping So Hee. Threatening me.

396
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:44,590
If you're even a little bit sorry for what you did, tell me the truth at least this once.

397
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,610
Tell me why you did that.

398
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:57,240
Do you know who the best person in the world to put all the blame onto is?

399
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,230
One who is blinded with revenge.

400
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:08,780
Chan Mi was going wild saying she would capture Michael, who killed Kwon Min Seok.

401
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:14,570
So I thought I'd squash her and make sure she couldn't meddle ever again.

402
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,750
He died because of her.

403
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,790
Baek Chan Mi killed your husband.

404
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,510
You should take revenge.

405
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,400
I have a way.

406
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,990
Are you crazy?!

407
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,360
Do you think you guys can do anything to me?

408
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,510
Do you think you can put me in jail?

409
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,380
In the end, you'll all end up like me and hit rock bottom! Just watch!

410
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,980
 Hamyeong High School 

411
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:56,070
The reason I called you is

412
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:01,900
because Joo Yeon is having trouble because of bullying.

413
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,260
Yes, I already know.

414
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,670
As the teacher in charge, I should have been more responsible and looked after her. I'm really sorry.

415
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,590
Oh no, you shouldn't be sorry.

416
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,090
- I'm the one to apologize. 
 - Excuse me?

417
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,930
I left my kid with you and never checked in again with the school.

418
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:23,270
I've got so much going on with work and housework,

419
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,400
I wasn't able to take care of my child until this happened.

420
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,590
It's all my fault. I'm sorry, Teacher.

421
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,730
It's not something for you to apologize for.

422
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,400
Yes, it is. Joo Yeon is a hundred, a thousand times in the wrong.

423
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,290
To be honest,

424
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,280
I sensed something was up.

425
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:48,060
I don't know who she takes after, going around hitting her friends.

426
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,920
But she's not a bad kid, Teacher.

427
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,670
I'll really discipline her this time

428
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,360
and make sure that this never happens again.

429
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,440
I don't understand what you're saying.

430
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,940
Aren't you talking about Joo Yeon?

431
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,290
Joo Yeon isn't the assailant.

432
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:18,790
If Joo Yeon is directly involved with the bullying, but she's not the assailant...

433
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,620
What is she?

434
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,780
She's the victim.

435
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,900
Ma'am.

436
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,430
W-Wait. J-just a moment, Teacher. W-Wait.

437
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,560
Does that mean that my child...

438
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,630
 Wearing makeup and hanging out with bad kids. 

439
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,570
 I know you're going around picking fights! 

440
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,790
Joo Yeon was the one who was bullied?

441
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,440
 Ointment 

442
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,240
Why was she hit? N-No I mean...

443
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,480
H-How...

444
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,960
How... How badly was she beaten?

445
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,300
Why Joo Yeon?

446
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,650
Why, Teacher?

447
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,180
What did my child do wrong?

448
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,290
 We'll have to hold a school violence committee  to find out the details, 

449
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:57,750
 but according to peer witnesses, it seems Joo Yeon is definitely the victim. 

450
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,110
 We plan to summon the school violence committee as soon as possible. 

451
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:05,870
 The parents of the assailants said they will make time to attend as well. 

452
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,120
 What does it matter to you Mom, whether I go to my after school classes or not?! 

453
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,500
 Why did you not care about me before, but are now making such a ruckus about me?! 

454
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,870
 When did I never care about you?! 

455
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:35,550
 Which class am I in? Uh?   

456
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,940
 What is my class number?  

457
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,950
 You doing this right now is ridiculous, Mom. 

458
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,960
 Just do as you did before! 

459
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,150
 Oh hey, hey! Don't get too worked up! 

460
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,020
 -How dare you talk to your mother that way! 
 - I get that you're mad, but this is too far! 

461
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,400
 Let go! 

462
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,980
It's me.

463
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,570
You're still alive. I told the slave boy to do some sweeping,

464
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:54,390
but he went for the keys to his master's warehouse. You got what you deserve.

465
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:57,360
Since you pleaded with me for help three years ago,

466
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,720
this time please grab my hand while I'm drowning.

467
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,750
You should be grateful I'm not having you wrapped up in a straw mat, whipped and kicked out.

468
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,490
How dare you ask me for help.

469
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:14,030
Three years ago, do you remember your call with Michael?

470
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,110
What are you saying.

471
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:20,670
 You better remember...  before I reveal everything during the interrogation!

472
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,800
Why would I have been talking to Michael.

473
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,680
What nonsense.

474
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,290
If I hadn't had had to meet you three years ago,

475
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,230
I wouldn't be in this position!

476
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,040
  You're saying you killed someone?!  

477
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,770
  I took care of Chairman Yoon, so just clean up the rest.  

478
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,390
  - You...   
      

479
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,290
  You're out of your mind.  

480
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,870
  You've gone completely mad!  

481
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,360
  Your hands are already dirty. You can quibble all you want. It'll only make them dirtier.  

482
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,090
  How dare you compare me to a killer like you!  

483
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:08,440
  If I get caught, you think you'll be safe?!  

484
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:25,040
  Once you send some of the nicely taken photos, he won't be able to think about anything else.  

485
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,430
  We need the core technology of the lithography  

486
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,640
  in order to make 176-layers 4D NAND flash possible.  

487
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,030
  Make no mistake and bring the stuff.  

488
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,930
  I told everyone to standby until we got the approval to send backup. Why did she go chase him by herself?!  

489
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,810
  Find out their location immediately!  

490
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,660
  Division Director Tak Sang Gi   
   No Subject Line  

491
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,700
 Michael! 

492
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:46,040
 You are under arrest in accordance with the Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology. 

493
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,540
 But trash like you cannot be saved by the laws. 

494
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,600
 The laws, my butt. Just die, you bastard! 

495
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,450
 Baek Chan Mi, come to your senses! 

496
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,300
  Don't you see the people over there?  

497
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,410
 Keep away, keep away. 

498
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,810
  Phone Call Recordings   
   Executive Director Myeong  

499
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,690
  November 10, 2016 Executive Director Myeong  

500
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,170
  Il Gwang HiTech's Executive Director Myeong?  

501
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,520
  Are you the Michael I've heard so much about?  

502
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,870
  I heard you wanted the core technology of Unixon's lithography.  

503
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:54,750
  The important thing is timing. Can you get it to me as soon as possible?  

504
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,810
  The more important thing is to get it without getting caught by the intelligence service.  

505
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,580
  You should be able to get it before Unixon applies for patent.  

506
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:06,090
 The shorter the time, the higher the cost.  

507
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,160
  It doesn't matter how much it will cost.  

508
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:14,120
  I heard that you, Michael, were the best at taking care of businesses like this.  

509
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,810
  On November 17th at 9pm,   

510
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,740
  I'll see you at Gate 4 on the 2nd floor of the Busan Port Passenger Terminal.  

511
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:42,360
That... audio file. Isn't it dangerous if Director Seo has it?

512
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,510
If it's in his hands then we need to get rid of it right away.

513
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:49,970
He is currently undergoing an internal investigation. Would it be possible?

514
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:53,180
It'll be difficult to find the recording and destroy it,

515
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,250
but killing the guy who knows its location will be easy, right?

516
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,650
I'm not sure I understand well what you are saying...?

517
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:08,040
This will forever be buried if we can kill the one guy who knows where the file is.

518
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,480
I heard that Director Seo is being investigated in the interrogation room.

519
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,660
I should send over a warm bowl of soup with rice

520
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,950
so that his belly is also warm on his way to the other world.

521
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,590
I shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.

522
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:37,060
I should've just cut it at the roots right there and then!

523
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:54,240
To be honest, when they asked me to come back to the field,

524
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:00,440
I hated it but was then happy on the other hand.

525
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,490
I felt that I became a useless piece of the National Intelligence Service.

526
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:15,590
I had no motivation and I felt pathetic.

527
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:20,770
And still, I didn't have courage to leave. But then...

528
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,140
When I was called, it felt like I was hearing,

529
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,800
"Hey, you're still useful."

530
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,010
"You haven't died yet, Hwang Mi Soon."

531
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,000
"Cheer up."

532
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:45,780
It was like I was told those things.

533
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,950
It was comforting.

534
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,230
But...

535
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,590
Why am I so stupid?

536
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:07,650
I can't even take good care of my only daughter.

537
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:10,510
How do I call myself a mom...

538
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:20,830
I didn't even know my daughter was hurting because I was so obsessed with the mission.

539
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,870
What's wrong, Chan Mi?

540
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,360
Over here!

541
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,180
Over here! Over here!

542
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:46,610
This was the sales plan for 2020.

543
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,640
That is all.

544
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,900
CEO?

545
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,690
CEO?

546
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,710
Sorry.

547
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,410
CEO, are you alright?

548
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,890
Yes.

549
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,770
Doctor, please come in here!

550
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,590
Here!

551
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,780
Check her blood pressure.

552
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,990
- Call the resuscitation team and bring the defibrillator. 
 - Yes.

553
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:27,060
CPR!

554
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,270
I am alright.

555
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,450
Yes?

556
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:03,420
 I think you need to come right away! The patient you asked me about 

557
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,870
 is in serious condition. 

558
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,570
CEO?

559
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,080
CEO!

560
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,950
- Charge to 100 joules.
 - 100 joules charged.

561
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,570
Shock!

562
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,090
- Charge to 200 joules. 
 - 200 joules charged.

563
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,740
Shock!

564
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,540
- Charge to 300 joules. 
 - That's dangerous.

565
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,040
Three hundred joules!

566
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,960
Three hundred joules charged.

567
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,680
Shock!

568
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,600
Hurry up please.

569
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,510
Save her, now!

570
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,240
Three hundred joules one more time!

571
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,550
Three hundred joules charged.

572
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,250
Shock!

573
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,090
  Should I tell you a little secret?  

574
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:26,880
  I am... Michael.  

575
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,070
  Do you want to know how  

576
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,880
  I've kept my identity hidden for so long?  

577
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,080
 It's because I take care of people I need to kill right away. 

578
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,750
Maybe it's because of the rain.

579
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,880
There are a lot of deliveries.

580
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,710
Why is the delivery so late? I ordered a while ago!

581
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,530
I'm sorry.

582
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,390
What the. Why is there so little meat? Did you not ask for the 'special'?

583
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,070
The 'special' was 12,000 won, so I ordered the regular which was 10,000 ( ≈ $10) .

584
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:47,820
What?

585
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:53,670
We got a notice to make sure "guys eating in the investigation room don't gorge on anything worth more than $10.

586
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,490
Which bastard said this?

587
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:57,530
You, Director.

588
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,730
Chan Mi, are you awake?

589
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:46,250
Are you okay?

590
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,050
Michael.

591
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:52,740
What do you mean "Michael" as soon as you wake up?

592
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,680
I saw him.

593
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,930
What. What are you doing? Are you crazy?

594
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:02,070
I saw him.

595
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,780
You saw Michael?

596
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:10,790
What are you doing? Do you want to die?

597
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,400
Where are you trying to go in your condition?

598
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,480
Michael killed Pi Cheol Woong and Division Director Tak.

599
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,800
Who do you think is next?

600
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,170
Director Seo.

601
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,860
Even if it's Michael,

602
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:32,040
he probably couldn't get into the NIS and do anything. Right?

603
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,240
 Your call cannot be connected— 

604
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,080
He's not picking up.

605
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,100
No.

606
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,840
You stay here. We'll go.

607
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,170
Where are you trying to go in your condition?

608
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,140
You can't move.

609
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,780
Stay here.

610
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:24,540
 Emergency Bell 
PUSH 

611
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:48,070
I ordered a regular and these guys marked it as 'special'!

612
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,560
Yes, this is the Industrial Security Division. Hang on to that delivery man.

613
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,800
Yes, I'm heading over right now.

614
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:00,330
Excuse me. Hey, Mister.

615
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,330
Wait, Mister.

616
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:08,230
Can't you hear me? Is it because it's raining?

617
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,420
Close all the entrances to the NIS and increase security. Immediately!

618
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,000
Yes, sir!

619
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,790
 Emergency Bell

Huh!

621
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:00,050
- Call an ambulance! Hurry! 
 - Yes! Quickly!

622
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,790
Yes, sir!

623
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,230
Director Seo! Director!

624
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:52,290
Don't go.

625
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:15,470
I'm not letting you go again. Ever.

626
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:22,680
♫  There was never a day so beautiful  ♫

627
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:28,540
♫  I don’t know if you remember it  ♫

628
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:33,430
♫  Those stars being the same as ever  ♫

♫  Brings me even more pain  ♫

01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:53,340
♫  Went by like the wind  ♫

633
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:57,590
♫  And those days become myself  ♫

634
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:04,410
♫  Once every moment has piled up one upon another  ♫

635
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:11,370
♫  And the fallen leaves have landed, 
When comes the time I try to walk again  ♫

636
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,300
 Good Casting - Preview  
 ♫  I hope I can smile beautifully  ♫

637
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,190
 This is Director Seo's killer.   

638
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:15,320
 He has the same tattoo. 

639
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,280
 So it might be Michael. 

640
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,400
 The suspect in the video was definitely familiar. 

641
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,080
 Take care of your health, first. 

642
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,800
 I remember everything. I won't let this slide. 

643
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,670
 Who said you can ignore my calls and disappear? 

644
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,670
 - Kang Woo Won... 
 - Don't fall behind. Stay by my side. 

645
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,210
 My father died because of Executive Director Myeong's ledger. 

646
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,330
 Just hold my hand, please. 

647
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:30,920
 There are some suspicious details in the ledger. 

648
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,750
 They should know that the more they dig, it'll be their grave. 

649
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,240
 Let's share our information. I protected this company with my life. 

650
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,970
 Give me your response now. We can push out CEO Yoon. 

651
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:40,560
 Bring him alive. Drag him here, immediately. 

652
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,140
 Find out Secretary Byeon's location. Hurry! 

653
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,550
♫  remain in me  ♫

654
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:48,480
 Epilogue 

655
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:58,270


656
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:26,480
Don't go...

657
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:40,100
 15 years ago 

658
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:45,190
 Grant me a wish if my grades go up. 

659
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:47,550
 What's your wish? 

660
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:50,610
 That you won't suddenly disappear. 

661
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,610
 That's my wish. 

662
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,870
 My mom, who was always there when I got home, isn't there, 

663
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:15,130
 and it was weird in the beginning, but I got a little used to it. 

664
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:21,580
 But then I started thinking that I would never see my mom again, 

665
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,690
 and I got scared. 

666
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:33,420
 The fact that someone I love can disappear from my side 

667
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:38,640
 and that I can never see them again 

668
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,900
 is so scary. 

669
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:54,680
 So don't suddenly leave me, Teacher. 

670
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:00,030
♫  Let’s love, let’s love  ♫

671
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:05,120
♫  So my heart can never leave you  ♫

672
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:13,410
♫  I love you, I’ll protect you forever  ♫

673
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:20,420
♫  Let’s love, let’s love  ♫

674
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:25,670
♫  Sweetly and deeply  ♫

675
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:33,930
♫  With the world's most precious you  ♫
