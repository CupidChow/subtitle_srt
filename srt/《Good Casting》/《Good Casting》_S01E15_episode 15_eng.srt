1
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,650


2
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,420
 Before you get caught, hurry and deal with the technology chip. 

3
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,260
 And get out of South Korea within three days. 

4
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,300
 If you don't, I can't guarantee your safety. 

5
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,120
Three days?

6
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,910
Let's see.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,590
Is it just one left?

8
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,120
I thought she looked familiar. We've met before, haven't we?

9
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,330
 We found out who Michael is. 

10
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,940
I know. It's Chief Ok.

11
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,800
I just confirmed it at the research center.

12
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,780
We'll talk when I'm back at the office.

13
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,440
We've just been notified that Director Seo's corpse has been found. We're on our way.

14
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,840
What?

15
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,190
- Where is it? 
 - The passenger terminal.

16
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,190
- Who did it?
 - His death was the same as Pi Cheol Woong's. He died from asphyxia by neck compression.

17
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,970
Michael... Could Michael

18
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,040
have left South Korea after killing Director Seo?

19
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,330
Interpol has already issued a Red Notice (wanted order). It'll be hard for him to run.

20
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,620
Rather than risk being caught in China while trying to trade the third chip,

21
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,840
he probably realizes it's safer to deal with the chip in Korea.

22
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,660
We must catch him before that,

23
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,070
no matter what measures we have to take.

24
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,150
Stop.

25
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,110
- Only hand over the files related to today's case to the police.
 - Yes.

26
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,240
Don't say anything about the technology leak.

27
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,690
Request a search and seizure warrant for Il Gwang HiTech Research Center and Chief Ok's residence.

28
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,220
Yes.

29
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,760
 Hello, this is the Report Center. Please speak.  
  Episode 15 

30
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,220
 Hello? 

31
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,890
Wait. Play the last part again.

32
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,750
 Hello, this is the Report Center. Please speak. 

33
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,250
 Hello? 

34
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,540
- Do you hear the whispering? 
 -   Hello?  

35
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,610
I'm not sure...

36
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,150
Is it possible to turn up just Director Seo's voice?

37
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,800
It may be impossible for other people, but I definitely—

38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,900
Just hurry and do it.

39
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,790
 Hello, this is the Report Centre. Please speak. 

40
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,510
 Hello? Hello? 

41
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,650
 Hello? 

42
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,600
  Ho...Honk...Honk Ko...Hong Ko...  

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,540
I hear it. Hong...

44
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,640
It sounds like Hong something...

45
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,960
Hong...Kong. Hong Kong, right?

46
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,950
Yeah. That's right!

47
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,910
But what does Hong Kong have to do with this?

48
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,990
Did they hide the item in Hong Kong?

49
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,180
Could it be that ha was planning on going to Hong Kong before things got messed up?

50
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,470
Hong Kong.

51
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,360
What is the meaning of this?

52
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Hong Kong. What was he trying to say?

53
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,400
That damned man is still messing with us even after he died.

54
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,700
We've only got an hour until Executive Director Myeong can walk free. What should we do?

55
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,970
It's certain that just before dying, and without Michael knowing,

56
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,080
Director Seo left a dying message.

57
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,960
  Name plate 
 Notepad  

58
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,440
  Cabinet 
 Lamp  

59
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,920
  Schefflera 
 (T/N: 'Schefflera' in Korean is called  'Hong Kong Palm Tree')  

60
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,040
I got it.

61
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,930
Where's the plant? You know, the one that Director watered every day and took special care of.

62
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,340
Plant? Why a plant all of a sudden?

63
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,090
- Schefflera (Hong Kong Palm). 
 - Schefflera?

64
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,170
Ah, that. When they were cleaning out the director's office, Sunbae Tae Hee said she'd take care of it herself

65
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,030
and took it with her.

66
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,400
- Tae Hee. 
 - Sunbae?

67
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,660
Where's the plant that you took from Director Seo's office a few days ago?

68
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,490
It was dead when I took it so I gave it water and sunlight but nothing worked.

69
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,980
So?

70
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,860
- So I was going to throw it— 
 - You threw it away?

71
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,190
I was going to, but instead, I put some nutrient drips in it. Over there!

72
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,140
What are you doing, Sunbae?

73
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,390
Finally found it.

74
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,250
What is it?

75
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,090
It's the evidence that disappeared at the Busan Port three years ago.

76
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,870
 The phone that was dropped here. It's not in there. 

77
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,280
Director Seo was keeping it hidden for the last three years?

78
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,220
What's in that cellphone?

79
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,410
  Il Gwang HiTech's Executive Director Myeong?  

80
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,210
  Are you the Michael I've heard so much about?  

81
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,670
  I heard you wanted the core technology of Unixon's lithography.  

82
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,560
All because of this. This is why Executive Director Myeong was trying so hard to get rid of the audio file.

83
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,530
These are all the companies that Michael tampered with?

84
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:51,890
Even at a glance, you can see there are more than eight companies that have declared bankruptcy because of Michael.

85
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,670
How much time do we have left?

86
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,260
There are five minutes left.

87
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,940
Let's go.

88
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,050
Where are you going?

89
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,490
In accordance with the Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology,

90
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,660
any trash who steals industrial technology will be sentenced to at least 15 years

91
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,950
or will be fined at least 1.5 billion won ($1.5M USD).

92
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,650
You know that? 15 years, 1.5 billion won.

93
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,900
You felt time running out so did you rush to piece together evidence?

94
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,680
  Il Gwang HiTech's Executive Director Myeong?  

95
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,490
  Are you the Michael I've heard so much about?  

96
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,140
  I heard you wanted the core technology of Unixon's lithography.  

97
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,080
I clearly gave you a chance to fess up

98
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,450
and the person who kicked away that chance is you.

99
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,360
Don't. If I go, I'll go on my own two feet.

100
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,530
Not there.

101
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,110
I know.

102
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,580
Why are you just standing there? Escort him.

103
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,490
Bye!

104
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,000
This will probably need repotting.

105
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,370
It looks fine on the outside, but the soil was already dried up.

106
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,490
If we'd known from the beginning,

107
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,250
could we have saved it?

108
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,170
The roots were already rotting so we probably couldn't have saved it even with repotting.

109
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,910
It's not our fault, right?

110
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,010
Even if you try your best, there are things you can't stop.

111
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,990
But even then, we tried our best and

112
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,600
we're not done yet.

113
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,470
 TOP SECRET - CODE NAME 'GOOD CASTING' 

114
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,860
 GOOD CASTING 

115
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,080
Did you hear? The wife of the third sales team manager cheated on him.

116
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,380
No way, they have two kids.

117
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,090
Whether you have three or four kids, it's scary when the woman cheats.

118
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:40,340
She threw the divorce papers at Manager Park, then packed up and left the house.

119
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,450
I know them and his wife doesn't seem like that type of a person.

120
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,780
He said there were some signs.

121
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,280
She often pretended to go on a business trip when she was actually traveling with some guy. 
  Automatic cancelation of overseas roaming service. 

122
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,830
  She locked her phone and had calls in secret.  

123
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,040
  She persistently was absent from home on the weekends and would be out all the time instead.  

124
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,260
She snuck out one night and got caught.

125
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,470
My husband?

126
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,870
So what did you tell him, Mom?

127
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,470
Why would you say that?

128
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,870
You could've just pretended to not know anything. Can't you even read into the situation?

129
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,470
I don't know, forget it. I'm hanging up.

130
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,070
Why is he suddenly calling and being troublesome?

131
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,870
  My husband the nemesis  

132
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,970
Hon... Hello?

133
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:39,770
This is my husband's phone. Who are you?

134
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,470
Good going. What is he doing?

135
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,270
Snap out of it, you scoundrel.

136
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,470
Wake up, wake up. Wake up!

137
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,070
Snap out of it! Wake up already!

138
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,370
Seriously. Come on. Aigo.

139
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,270
Stand up straight!

140
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,670
He didn't pay yet.

141
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,370
Ah, yes. Hold on a second. Stay still.

142
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,270
Aish, seriously. Three hundred-sev... 
   Total: ₩3,700,000 ($3,700 USD) 

143
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,770
Three million seven hundred thousand won?

144
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,070
You're saying my husband drank all this by himself?

145
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,670
Yes, sir!

146
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,870
Ma'am, we can do installment payments for up to twelve months.

147
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,870
This is fake.

148
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,370
What are you saying?

149
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,070
- You can ask that when the cops get here 
 - Hey!

150
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,270
This ajumma, what do you think you're doing?

151
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,870
He usually goes down after one bomb shot.

152
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,670
In an hour and a half,

153
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,870
you're saying he cleaned out two, four, six bottles that

154
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,470
each cost over ₩500,000 ($500)?

155
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,270
Are you suggesting that we tampered with this alcohol?

156
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,970
Do you have proof? Do you have any proof?

157
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,870
Is there a security camera here?

158
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,470
Of course, there isn't.

159
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,670
Oh, that's good.

160
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,570
This ajumma! Are you crazy?!

161
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,870
I am about to go crazy for real as of now.

162
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,470
Come at me.

163
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,470
Come at me.

164
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,570
  Pow!  

165
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,070
₩370,000. ($370)

166
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,770
Over how many months?

167
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,870
Five months.

168
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,270
Here you go.

169
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,830
Stand straight!

170
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,270
Taxi.

171
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,070
There's a taxi ready for you at the door.

172
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,670
You better not have called a premium taxi.

173
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,070
Of course not, it's the regular one.

174
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,870
Good job.

175
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,870
Thank you so much.

176
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,570
Please get home safely!

177
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,470
Why is he suddenly doing things he used to not do?

178
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,070
Makes me feel uneasy.

179
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,470
I know all about your secret!

180
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,770
Wh-What do you know?

181
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,670
I know it all. I know what you've been up to.

182
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,070
But I...

183
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,070
What does he mean that he knows?

184
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,770
This nuisance of a man... Sit up straight!

185
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,270
What is that?

186
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,170
Ajussi, wait, please stop here for a moment.

187
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,070
  A global semiconductor company, Il Gwang HiTech,  

188
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,870
  was reported to have been embroiled in the divulgence of technology, and stock prices plunged shortly after the news.  

189
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,870
  At present, Il Gwang HiTech's stock prices have dropped by more than 20% in one day.  

190
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,870
  The 176-layer 4D NAND flash technology that is being developed by the company 

191
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,470
  is rumored to have been leaked and Il Gwang HiTech has received a lot of criticism over the matter.  

192
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,670
We will start a briefing on the leak of the operation and on the press coverage.

193
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,870
No need to make it long. Just make sure to stop the third leak!

194
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,270
We've identified who Michael is and obtained solid evidence to prove the allegations.

195
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,070
It's already a mess with everyone talking about it in the news and the newspaper.

196
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,270
There's only one way to prevent further criticisms from the citizens.

197
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,270
There's no point in catching him once the third technology has already been passed over to the other side.

198
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,070
Make sure to support Industrial Security Team three.

199
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,470
Did you hear me?!

200
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,370
Yes.

201
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,870
There's going to be an emergency board meeting soon in the conference room

202
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,870
to discuss the removal of the CEO.

203
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,270
It's obvious that it's the work of Sim Hwa Ran.

204
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,470
Maybe if you go and try to stop them—

205
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,670
This picture that's already drawn out

206
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,670
probably took more than one or two years to prepare. She probably did a headcount beforehand

207
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,970
and is now making her last move because she is sure of winning.

208
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,070
Reveal that Executive Director Myeong did it

209
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,070
and disclose the notes from the investigation by NIS.

210
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,770
You have to survive first, CEO Yoon.

211
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,670
That... No way.

212
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,470
Don't tell me. Are you being like this because you're afraid Secretary Baek will get hurt?

213
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,570
This is not the time to worry about Secretary Baek!

214
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,270
 Executive Director Myeong will be turned over to the prosecution soon. 

215
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,070
 We've got our hands on the key evidence that Chief Ok found. 

216
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,770
  With this, I'm finished with this report on the operation.  

217
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,070
  So we probably won't need to have the displeasure of seeing each other in the future.  

218
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,470
 I hope to see Executive Director Myeong before he falls into the hands of the prosecution. 

219
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,470
 Who gives you that right? 

220
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,470
 I have some personal matters to talk to him about. 

221
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,270
 Please allow it. I won't interfere with your operation. 

222
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,470
 Yeah, you better not. If the operation fails this time, 

223
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,670
 Baek Chan Mi will collapse before Il Gwang HiTech does. 

224
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:53,770
 Chan Mi lost a precious junior colleague and suffered for three years because of that rat, Michael. 

225
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,670
 If this operation fails, she may not be able to get back on her feet again. 

226
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,670
 Keep that in mind. If things go awry because of you 

227
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,370
 then I really won't let you be. 

228
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,570
We absolutely cannot do that before the criminal is caught.

229
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,670
I mean it.

230
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,670
What is he going to do?

231
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,070
That day when you got caught snooping in Executive Director Myeong's office.

232
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,870
Do you know what the CEO did

233
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,670
just to save his secretary?

234
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,070
  How did you get out? There's no way Executive Director Myeong would've just let you walked out.  

235
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:48,070
  I don't know either. No idea how I got out of there. 

236
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,670
He transferred over all his rights to the NAND flash research!

237
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,070
...Ma'am. 
   (T/N: Ending his sentence in a formal way.)  

238
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,470
There surely is a reason why Executive Director Myeong asked for it.

239
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,270
Have you checked the research fund statement?

240
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,670
If the research fund were all they stole then that would be a relief.

241
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,270
All the blame will most probably be put on the CEO.

242
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,770
Then, what will CEO do now?

243
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,270
The board of directors will probably tear him apart.

244
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,370
And in the end, the CEO will take responsibility for all of it.

245
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:36,370
The funding for NAND flash research and development is hundred of billions of won. Where did it all go?

246
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,870
Instead of asking the CEO,

247
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,670
you should be asking Executive Director Myeong!

248
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,570
Look at the documents.

249
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,870
Don't you see that the CEO approved for all the payments?

250
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,270
The two of them were clearly in it together, which is why there were exchanges between them!

251
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,770
Are you suggesting that Executive Director Myeong took the bribes and slipped some to our CEO?

252
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,870
Everyone, please calm down.

253
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,070
The CEO has caused the worst damage to the company

254
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,470
so he should step down from the position.

255
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,670
Don't you agree with that?

256
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,270
The prosecutor hasn't started investigating and you're already talking about dismissing the CEO!

257
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,670
The fact that he's being silent means there is something there!

258
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,470
Can you not see what's going on?!

259
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,470
You, are you done blabbering?

260
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,070
How dare you?

261
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,370
Do you not know your position?!

262
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,070
My ears are hurting.

263
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,370
Stop with the verbal fight.

264
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,270
Let's put the CEO's dismissal up for a show of hands. Then we can see if it's the opinion of a few

265
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,370
or a consensus of the whole board.

266
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,870
Since Executive Director Myeong, chairman of the board, is not in his seat,

267
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,870
that authority is thus delegated to me, and I will propose

268
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,870
CEO Yoon Seok Ho's dismissal.

269
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,270
What are you doing right now?!

270
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,070
What do you mean?

271
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,170
We're trying to save a company that is rotting to its primary roots!

272
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,470
  Il Gwang HiTech held an emergency board meeting today  

273
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,870
-   and voted to dismiss CEO Yoon Seok Ho.   
 - CEO, Sir.

274
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,870
  A board official revealed that as a result of the vote,  

275
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:06,470
  the CEO's dismissal was passed with 8 out of 15 votes in favor.  

276
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,870
  Il Gwang HiTech subsequently appointed Sim Hwa Ran, President of LK Aesthetic, as the new CEO... 

277
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,770
If you feel at all sorry for what happened to my father,

278
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,070
confess now.

279
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,470
The person who should feel sorry isn't me, it's you.

280
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,270
What did you say?

281
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,070
Do you think I was a money-grubber from the start?

282
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,170
No, I was rather naive.

283
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,070
I believed that research could change the world.

284
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,670
I realized it wasn't the case.

285
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,670
Technology was something that could be bought and sold for money without limit.

286
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,070
Do you know that feeling when the fruit of a whole lifetime of hard work

287
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,800
gets sold for a few brass coins?

288
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,890
I thought about it then.

289
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,650
Money is what makes the world go round.

290
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,960
If so, then I should have money.

291
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:54,800
When the company was in trouble, we survived by technology cooperation with overseas partners.

292
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,860
You worded it so nicely.

293
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,540
That's a relief. Now that I have been able to talk to you,

294
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,510
the things I was speculating about have been made clear.

295
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,870
The one who killed my father...

296
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,300
is you.

297
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,860
Why would I?

298
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:29,020
You mean ... the ledger?

299
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:36,050
Yes. I did sometimes wish that bothersome man would disappear.

300
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,270
But thankfully, someone took care of him first.

301
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,170
Who is that person?

302
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,100
I don't know that.

303
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:54,170
All I know is that it's the ones who've been trying to get rid of Chairman Yoon since long time ago.

304
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,040
Long time ago?

305
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,460
If I had done it, it would've been cleaner and perfect.

306
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,810
If I did do anything wrong, I messed up on

307
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,620
not cleaning up properly, causing you to come in here to say nonsense. That's my only mistake.

308
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,980
Is that really what he said?

309
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,050
That there were guys who tried to get rid of the chairman from a long time ago?

310
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,250
I don't understand

311
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,090
who these guys were or why they were going after my dad.

312
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,450
White collar.

313
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,350
White collar?

314
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,580
When I went on a business trip to Russia as the chairman's personal guard,

315
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,230
I was imprisoned for murder.

316
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,090
Wait a second.

317
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,230
Didn't you two meet for the first time at the Il Gwang HiTech Scholarship Foundation?

318
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,090
To be honest, there were people going after the chairman at the time.

319
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,210
I barely survived trying to save him,

320
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,970
but I was arrested on the spot, for murder.

321
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,810
I heard it when I was interrogated,

322
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,670
that once you become White Collar's target,

323
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,680
you can't escape.

324
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,650
Who is that guy exactly?

325
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,490
It's not just one person.

326
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,730
Apparently, there are several bosses at each level that are operating the organization.

327
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,570
So why on earth would such a group kill my father!

328
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,660
Because he didn't give them what they wanted.

329
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,350
If you find out more, you could be in danger like the chairman was.

330
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:36,110
I could never watch you end up with the same fate.

331
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,570
Call the prosecutors' office.

332
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,470
Tell them I'm volunteering to be investigated.

333
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,320
CEO.

334
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,360
 Kang Woo Won 

335
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,110
Hello?

336
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,230
Right now?

337
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,870
Do I really have to come now?

338
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,450
No, no. I'll come right away.

339
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,840
I was planning to go.

340
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,510
Okay.

341
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,160

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,310
Ready for what?

365
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,310
Ready to listen to your love confession.

366
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:33,600
Did you prepare all this for me to confess to you?

367
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,630
For reference, one candle represents our first day of dating.

368
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,380
Why... Why are you doing this to me?

369
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,890
When did I say I wanted to confess to you?

370
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:54,680
I would already be shell-shocked from hearing a confession and you're saying...

371
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,410
What?

372
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,830
This is unbelievable.

373
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,800
If you want to confess, go to a church and do all your confessions!

374
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,060
All right.

375
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,950
If it's too hard to do for you, I'll confess first. Okay?

376
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,220
Excuse me, Kang Woo Won.

377
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,830
You seem to be misunderstanding what I'm saying.

378
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,590
I never wanted to confess.

379
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,430
- I also don't want to hear your confession. 
 - Why?

380
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:29,640
I... have neither the intention

381
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,590
nor the time to date.

382
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,340
Don't tell me...

383
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,140
Did I get rejected?!

384
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,980
Well, you didn't even confess, so there's nothing to reject.

385
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,560
Let's just pretend nothing happened.

386
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,200
- Nothing at all.
 - Says who?!

387
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,570
I was decorating each flower while getting pricked by their thorns.

388
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,810
I blew up all these balloons until my ears almost popped.

389
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,640
After I debated the song for a long time,

390
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,300
I posted on an anonymous bulletin board and got a recommendation.

391
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,640
I even practiced the piano day and night.

392
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,440
I prepared all this so happily.

393
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,900
Why don't you like me?

394
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,180
It's not that I don't like you.

395
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,220
It's all for your sake.

396
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,280
If you get involved with me, the reputation that you rebuilt

397
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,870
will be crushed again.

398
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,550
This is all because you don't know me well.

399
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,250
I know that you're dumb

400
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,620
and that you are damn scary when you suddenly get angry,

401
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,260
and that you really hate when people secretly look through your phone,

402
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,980
and that you're a National Intelligence Service agent! I know everything!

403
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,220
That's not all there is.

404
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,900
Then...what else is there?

405
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,810
Are you... You're not married, are you?

406
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,280
Don't make me sway

407
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,890
with your temporary sympathy.

408
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,850
Please.

409
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:25,210
You did well. You're in no place to think about dating.

410
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,320
You're the best at knowing your place.

411
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,530
You did well, Im Ye Eun.

412
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,270
I was wrong.

413
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,880
What did you do wrong?

414
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,230
Everything. Everything is my fault.

415
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,400
So don't go.

416
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,610
Things were better off before.

417
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,590
I felt more at ease

418
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,800
when you walked all over me

419
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,060
and did whatever you wanted.

420
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,160
If you keep being like this, I...

421
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,960
You what?

422
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,410
If you keep being like this...

423
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,610
 my heart will sway. 

424
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,210
Just don't say you're leaving.

425
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,360
Stop it.

426
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,750
Take responsibility.

427
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,040
For what?

428
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,860
For making me like you!

429
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,180
What do you want me to do now?

430
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:52,070
That's ... your own business.

431
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,370
Really? You have no feelings for me at all?

432
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,950
I don't.

433
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,500
Look at me and say it!

434
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,560
It's not true, is it?

435
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:36,860
♫  Let’s love, let’s love  ♫

436
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,990
♫  Sweetly and deeply  ♫

437
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:50,430
♫  Let’s love
 With the world's most precious you  ♫

438
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,670
Sorry.

439
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,090
I'm really sorry.

440
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,920
 Healthy and delicious multi-grain rice is complete. 

441
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,520
 Please mix well. 

442
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,490
I even personally cooked.

443
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,510
I wanted to make a real home-cooked meal for her.

444
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,640
I wanted to play for her the song I composed while thinking about her.

445
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,260
I wanted to make her seat on the very front row at my concert and have her look at me.

446
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,070
I worked so hard to prepare all this.

447
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,450
So Hee, Mom is coming home now.

448
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:15,230
I'll hurry back and read your favorite fairytale,

449
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,880
and I'll sing a lullaby until you fall asleep.

450
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,840
Of course.

451
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:30,200
Mom also loves So Hee the most in this world.

452
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:46,080
 Kang Woo Won
Happy Five Year Debut Anniversary! 

453
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:06,070
Woo Won, you'll definitely meet a nice girl.

454
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,560
Not someone who's not good enough like me,

455
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:16,240
but a real cool girl who's a good match for you.

456
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:22,420
You have the right to meet someone like that.

457
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,620
Nam Joo Yeon.

458
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,810
Hi, friend!

459
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,350
You're so awkward. Act more naturally.

460
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,530
Joo Yeon, do you want to come to the convenience store with us?

461
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,620
Are you also making me your delivery girl now?

462
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,260
What are you doing?

463
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,710
Who are you calling?

464
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,820
I'm checking if I have money.

465
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,730
What nonsense is that? We'll treat you. Right?

466
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:18,150
I'll buy you a drink. What do you want?

467
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:24,250
Could I... perhaps upload the photo of us eating bread together on social media?

468
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,580
It's your account. Do whatever you want.

469
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,810
Thank you.

470
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:32,100
By the way, is your mom really a door-to-door insurance saleswoman?

471
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,580
Hey! I could rip your mouth apart. Who are you saying is a door-to-door insurance saleswoman?

472
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,270
Are you not gonna say it straight?

473
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:43,390
I-I-I'm sorry, is your mom really an insurance constructor?

474
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,860
Is she not? Something similar though, right?

475
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,330
I'm sure it is constructor, though.

476
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,940
It's insurance planner.

477
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,540
Planner, that's right, I knew it was something similar.

478
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,130
But...why are you asking?

479
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,840
- Nothing! 
 - It's nothing, nothing at all.

480
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,600
Let's go the convenience store.

481
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,390
I'm seriously so hungry!

482
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,730
I'll treat you to some fried chicken!

483
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,950
How are things coming along?

484
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,110
 yeony_bb: 4 likes 

485
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:23,310
There's a reservation for a flight to Jeju under the name of Chief Ok's subordinate who died last time.

486
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:29,140
I also found it. I went through the list of Chinese people entering Jeju Island, just in case.

487
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,940
Look who came up.

488
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,540
  Kai Wang  

489
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:39,370
Since a Red Notice was issued for Chief Ok and he can't leave the country, I think Wang Kai is coming to Korea, himself, for the third transaction.

490
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:43,850
But Wang Kai will enter the country tomorrow.

491
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:48,620
Why didn't you say so before? Everybody get ready to go to Jeju right away.

492
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,900
What is it? Is something wrong?

493
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,260
When you get married, you eventually find out stuff that you didn't want to know.

494
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,620
What's frustrating in your husband is his lack of perception, but he's not the type to get into trouble.

495
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,780
Exactly, so why is he starting to pick up on things as he gets older?

496
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,680
Why, why, why.

497
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,520
You're going to your mother's again?

498
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,320
I-I will go, too.

499
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,100
Why you?

500
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,900
Do I need to have a reason to visit my mother-in-law?

501
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,820
I'm just saying you don't need to since you're busy.

502
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,290
I can go by myself.

503
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:33,660
No no, she's not feeling well either.

504
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,950
I've been feeling bad since I couldn't go visit her during my last time off.

505
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,200
I have to go with you this time.

506
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,090
I told you it's okay!

507
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,130
Why are you throwing down the drumstick?

508
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,490
What is wrong with you?!

509
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,420
What about me?

510
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,830
If we both leave the house, then... then what about Joo Yeon?

511
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,020
You're coming back right away, right?

512
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,670
Of course!

513
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,010
I'll leave early in the morning and be right back.

514
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,400
I'll hurry back.

515
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,350
By myself. Alone.

516
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,460
Quickly!

00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,250
Crazy person.

522
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,810
Just saying whatever because it's not your problem.

523
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:47,750
 ID 'Sinbad's insurance': We have a kid. Divorce doesn't seem like a good idea... 

524
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:56,830
  If you've been married for ten years, then you should just turn a blind eye. Who would accept a broke ajussi after your divorce?  

525
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,170
  ID: Chirp chirp with a Drumstick in My Hand  

526
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,500
Divorce is the way to go.

527
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,510
She's definitely having an affair!

528
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,520
You're not gonna eat chicken?

529
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,430
I will eat everything!

530
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:18,590
Don't tell me to order you another chicken later.

535
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:59,340
Do you remember the day the bookshelf rail broke?

536
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,520
♫   Every word you say   ♫

537
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,290
It wasn't broken.

538
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:11,050
I was hiding behind and pushing it.

539
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,840
 Please stop pushing,  come on. 

540
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,360
 Please move, come on! 

541
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,670
It started from that day.

542
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:36,020
It was the first time I felt that coming to the office wasn't so bad.

543
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,640
Executive Director Myeong and his followers pressured me every day.

544
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:46,630
And Secretary Byeon was the only person on my side in this hellish place.

545
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,850
I felt like I could take a breath here for the first time.

546
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,010
 What are you doing over there? 

547
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,190
 Hello. I am Baek Jang Mi, the experienced secretary 

548
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,730
 who has been newly appointed to the position. 

549
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,250
  Did you just hit me?  

550
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,320
 I hit men too. 

551
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,230
 Yoon Tae Seok 

552
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,030
 You were by my side on November 17th. 

553
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:29,470
 Being by your side is something anyone could have done. 

554
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:34,280
 You being by my side is something really special to me. 

555
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,130
When I see your face

556
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,410
through the window here,

557
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,470
it feels like I've gone back to the only happy time in my life.

558
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:59,890
The time Mom, Dad and you, Teacher,

559
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,920
were by my side.

560
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,720
- Seok Ho.
 - Tomorrow,

561
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,140
I'm going to go for questioning at the prosecutor's office.

562
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,140
Rather than being dragged there, if I go on my own two feet,

563
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,610
the reaction of the reporters, the directors, and even Hwa Ran

564
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,060
will be quite fun to see.

565
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:28,930
It's too bad. I won't be able to see their expressions.

566
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:40,390
What? You want to grab onto my hand?

567
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,500
I'm sorry

568
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,600
that this is the only thing I could do for you.

569
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,600
You've done enough for me.

570
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,910
You're by my side and didn't leave me.

571
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,890
I don't think I can go with you

572
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,220
to the prosecutor's office tomorrow.

573
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,330
We can say our farewells here then.

574
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,940
But promise me one thing.

575
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,000
Don't leave, but wait for me

576
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,810
until I come back.

577
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:45,710
I promise you.

578
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,650
 Prosecution Service 

579
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,210
Prosecutors are nothing, so don't be nervous. All right?

580
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,400
I think you're more nervous than I am.

581
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,110
Is it obvious?

582
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,060
It's worn out. Throw it away.

583
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:28,020
You bought me this on my first day of work, so I've been wearing it with care, but well...

584
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,650
After the questioning, let's go buy a new one.

585
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,640
Let's go in, CEO Yoon.

586
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,760
- Please take good care of our CEO.
 - Don't worry.

587
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,020
Don't wait till I'm done here. Go back first.

588
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,150
It could take a long time.

589
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,330
CEO Yoon.

590
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,240
- Please be safe.
 - Why are you talking like we'll never see each other again?

591
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,440
You're not going to hand in your resignation and run off while I'm being questioned, are you?

592
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,690
I'll wait for you until the end and get my new suit.

593
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,010
How is it?

594
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:37,430
  I checked what you asked me to find out,  

595
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,610
  and you were right, White Collar is indeed getting into the NAND flash technology.  

596
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:44,870
  You should pull out. You've been through it, so you know how ruthless they are.  

597
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:48,830
I know how they are,

598
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,950
which is why I can't pull out.

599
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,020
  Prosecution Service  

600
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,660
When did you know about the technology leak?

601
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,960
I knew right before CBT (private beta testing) in the third phase of the technology's development.

602
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,520
You were going around overseas branches before you took over as a representative around a year ago.

603
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,090
- And that's why you didn't know about the leak. 
 - That is right.

604
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,820
You must have known you were going to inherit the company,

605
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,570
and there was a project into which the country poured a huge investment,

606
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:28,190
but you didn't try to understand how that project was running?

607
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,400
- As you would know— 
 - CEO.

608
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,560
The nastier people smell, the more they have family members turning up for them.

609
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,310
This one smells especially bad.

610
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,170
Watch your language.

611
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,290
We are here under the claim that our legal rights need to be respected.

612
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,070
Did I say anything bad?

613
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,480
I'm saying you people do your job well.

614
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,710
Let's talk alone then.

615
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:53,460
- CEO Yoon.
 - You seem to be quite confident.

616
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,280
I have nothing to hide.

617
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,430
  What happens if the third chip gets stolen and Michael isn't caught?  

618
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,080
 I'm going to make sure to prove that Seok Ho hasn't done anything wrong.  

619
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,640
 What I'm saying is, in the event that something goes wrong, 

620
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,210
how are you going to prove that the CEO is innocent?

621
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,040
That...

622
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:25,150
If even the NIS can't protect CEO Yoon, then there's no other way.

623
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,160
I'll have to protect him.

624
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:43,170
It's me. I want to ask you for a favor.

625
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:47,270
  You haven't called in years and now you're suddenly asking for a favor.  

626
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:49,290
You know I have the right to.

627
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:52,850
 Then are you joining our team again? 

628
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,260
Once...

629
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,270
Once this matter is over.

630
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,180
Executive Director Myeong Gye Cheol sat there and said the same thing.

631
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:07,150
That CEO Yoon was really obsessed with the project execution costs.

632
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,550
How much did you get from Executive Director Myeong?

633
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:15,750
Look at this guy. You! Do you want to become a suspect instead of a witness?

634
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:21,110
You have nothing to do with Executive Director Myeong's ledger? How can I believe that?

635
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,320
You're the one being questioned, not me.

636
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:28,980
It doesn't matter if you don't believe me.

637
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,550
Are you not aware of what's going on?

638
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:35,280
On the issue of the technology leak, the investigation will conclude I am innocent.

639
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,170
And you don't believe that I'm really selling the technology.

640
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:45,690
How about if I offer twice the amount of money you were promised.

641
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,200
I don't think it's that bad of a proposal.

642
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,700
You should know the people you mess with.

643
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,490
You've just poked a beehive.

644
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,660
If you're going to go fishing,

645
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,120
you should be fishing for the right thing.

646
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:07,560
  Why are you trying to find out about the prosecutor?  

647
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,950
 Now that I threw in all the rest of the bait  

648
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:12,840
  I need to find out if he'll just nibble on it and run off 

649
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,800
  or if he'll take a real bite.  

650
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,010
  He's not on the list in Executive Director Myeong's ledger.  

651
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:24,340
  I don't think he's a bad apple that cleans up after politicians.  

652
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,240
  Fortunately.  

653
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:33,200
Let's not go with some tabloid gossip from the stock market

654
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,150
but with information based on solid big data. For example,

655
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:40,350
how about information on a possible current member of the National Assembly with charges of bribery?

656
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,130
Does that sound tempting?

657
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,630
 Jeju DK Hotel, Room 423  

658
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:06,860
I'm prepared to bleed.

659
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,820
Are you confident you'll be able to hold on even without those backing you up?

660
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,990
Any evidence that that is true?

661
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:24,730
This is the detailed statement on the political funds I provided to Assemblyman Sim Chan's political fund all this time.

662
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:30,330
If it's to pull out in the middle because you cannot handle it, you should give up now.

663
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,250
But if you have confidence to go all the way to the end...

664
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,350
Let's start the briefing of the Jeju operation.

665
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:44,920
On Jeju Island, Chief Ok will trade the materials for the third and last phase of the technology

666
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,420
by meeting up with Wang Kai.

667
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,350
If we can't stop this deal—

668
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,810
Hundreds of billions of won in taxes from our country will evaporate.

669
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:58,790
At the same time, the national loss following the patent being stolen by China will be at least a few trillion won.

670
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:03,370
And if our operation fails, we'll all get punished.

671
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,280
You guys are clear about the situation.

672
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,050
This is our last chance to catch that swine, Michael.

673
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:15,000
According to the information found by Moo Hyeok, Wang Kai is coming to Jeju Island for a total of two nights and three days.

674
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,500
But the hotel this guy booked is a casino hotel.

675
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,150
He's a high roller betting millions of won in a single round.

676
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,440
He's coming to buy an item for hundreds of billions of won

677
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,600
and will trade after some games.

678
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,750
This might be over in a duller way than I thought.

679
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,910
It'll be better if it is dull.

680
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:33,280
We come after Wang Kai once he is lost in the game.

681
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,350
Ye Eun and Mi Soon move in together first.

682
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:39,300
The concept is Japanese mother and daughter, who have a lot of money but are stupid.

683
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,220
 Jeju Island 

684
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:51,550
  Mom, it's very impressive here.  

685
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,540
  I really like it. 

686
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,910
  Don't throw everything in just because you're in a good mood.  

687
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,420
  Cut off at ten today.  

688
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,520
  Why would I need to behave, when it's only a few hundred million?  

689
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,170
But why Japanese?

690
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,510
Because Wang Kai speaks Japanese well.

691
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:35,480
 Ajusshi, I thought I saw two red aces just now. 

692
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,060
 Shut up and just play. 

693
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,990
 Chinese people can be sketchy. 

694
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:43,470
 Don't bother trying to get close to him. 

695
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:47,680
 They're people who will betray you when they get the chance. 

696
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,330
Why isn't it working yet?

697
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:11,720
Why do I suddenly feel dizzy?

698
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,400
Hurry up!

699
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,710
Sorry, Mi Soon.

700
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:22,910
 Dong Casso 

701
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,910
Master?

702
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:29,430
Yes, I know! I'll be out soon!

703
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:32,610
This is so much harder than I thought.

704
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:38,840
Done.

705
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,040
Mi Soon, do you see?

706
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,840
You see it, right?

707
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,650
I'm fine now.

708
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:56,030
It's all good now. So good.

709
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,060
All right.

710
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,100
Baek Chan Mi.

711
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,800
  These are guys who put a bomb jacket on Pi Cheol Woong during the second deal.  

712
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,090
  No doubt that they're prepared with plans B and C. Be careful.  

713
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:30,780
 While Ye Eun and Mi Soon are holding Wang Kai down, Chan Mi will go find Wang Kai's laptop in his room 

714
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,270
 and stick the hacking chip on it. 

715
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,410
The room is strangely too clean.

716
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,510
No time for you to be leisurely. Move quickly.

717
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,560
Raise!

718
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,960
 Raise - Betting more than your opponent 

719
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,090
All in.

720
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:04,070
Are you planning on blowing everything in just one round?

721
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:08,700
 What are you doing? I said, "All in." 

722
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,360
Call.

723
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,480
Open, please.

724
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,540
 Four of a kind, six. You won. 

725
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,610
Mom! Oh my goodness!

726
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:31,050
Amazing!

727
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,660
I found the safe.

728
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,560
Four, Six, Seven, Eight.

729
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,100
I'm so angry.
    

730
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,460
Eliminate seven and four.

731
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,030
 Please enter the password. 

732
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,620
Six is lucky. 
 (T/N: Chinese idiom meaning "All is going smoothly.") 

733
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:30,120
 The Chinese idiom "Six is Lucky“ makes six a lucky number in Chinese culture. 

734
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,760
The lock has opened.

735
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,710
Six is lucky.

736
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,820
"Six is lucky"? What does that mean?

737
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:45,670
It means we're in extremely good luck.

738
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:49,550
Check.

739
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,450
Over.

740
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,990
Call.

741
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:58,240
Open please.

742
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,830
There's no laptop in the safe.

743
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,900
What?

744
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,520
It's not somewhere else?

745
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,660
Seven-high straight flush.

746
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,380
Bring me the money now!

747
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,060
Six is lucky?

748
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:05,870
I found the laptop.

749
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,030
Okay!

750
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,700
Mi Soon, think about finishing up now.

751
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:42,450
Let's stop now.

752
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,290
You're going to leave just like that?

753
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:50,510
Maybe it's because your skills are just so-so,

754
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,670
I've lost interest.

755
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,230
See you next time!

756
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:03,810
Clear the venue now!

757
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:13,490
 Downloading files... 

758
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,960
Right away! Hurry!

759
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,900
What?

760
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,020
What's going on?

761
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,530
  Get out now!  

762
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:28,510
 Get over there! 

763
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,680
Who are you?

764
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,930
Hwang Mi Soon! Im Ye Eun!

765
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,100
 Complete 

766
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,160
Okay! It's done.

767
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,080
Chan Mi, there's trouble in the gambling hall.

768
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,160
I can't get hold of them.

769
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:26,620

 Next Episode Preview 

771
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:43,550
 What did you say? Secretary Byeon came to Jeju Island? 

772
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,030
 What on earth are you trying to do? 

773
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,460
  Could it be there is immense power involved in this?  

774
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,690
 It makes no sense for them to hide their identity to this extent. 

775
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:52,950
 I'm relieved you seem to know me. There's no reason for me to stall. 

776
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,510
 Find Secretary Byeon's location and send it to me.  

777
01:03:55,510 --> 01:04:00,520
  Michael, you're under arrest for violating the Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology.  

778
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,760
 Come out you bastard! 

779
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,700

 Epilogue 

781
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:16,090
 5 years ago 

782
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,800
Seriously. Do I look good today?

783
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:28,160
I mean, people keep looking at me. I did put some effort into my appearance today.

784
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,830
It's my first day at work, after all.

785
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:39,420
I think you tried a bit too much. Especially, your clothes.

786
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,440
What's wrong with my clothes?

787
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:01,640
Go back in.

788
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:16,880
Manager, can you see me please?

789
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:26,700
That's fine. We will buy this.

790
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,430
Isn't this too boring?

791
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,980
Don't be outstanding with your clothes, but with your skills.

792
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,690
I mean, I'm the secretary of the CEO.

793
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:42,780
That's why. Since you're the secretary of the CEO, should you be wearing that kind of clothes?

794
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,680
I think the first one that I tried was the best...

795
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,590
Wear this one before I just take all your clothes off of you.

796
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,460
Yes, sir.

797
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,530
I thought this might go well with the suit.

798
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:56,320
No! I can't wear ties because they're too uncomfortable.

799
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,340
Thank you.

800
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:03,430
Wear it even if it's uncomfortable. Okay?

801
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:08,230
I really can't because they're too uncomfortable.

802
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:13,790
I know this isn't really meant for you nor is it your style.

803
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:18,130
That's why I'm even sorrier... and thankful.

804
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,090
For what?

805
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:26,430
That you threw everything away to be by my side.
