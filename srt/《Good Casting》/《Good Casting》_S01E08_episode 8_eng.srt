1
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,650
I got ahold of Chief Ok's phone.

2
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,250
Now we just have to find Michael's phone number.

3
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,250
It's saved on speed dial number zero. 
  Michael 

4
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,050
Michael. It's this, right?

5
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,150
The phone is turned on. Try finding its location.

6
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,850
  National Intelligence Service Director Seo Gook Hwan  

7
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,250
  Today 1 PM Royal Hotel coffee shop  

8
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,850
  We got exposed to the NIS. I'll contact you later.  

9
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,650
  National Intelligence Service Director Seo Gook Hwan  

10
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:46,650


11
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,550
  Baek Chan Mi  

12
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,850
What are you saying? The phone is off?

13
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,450
It's been thirty seconds since I asked for the location tracking, what have you been doing since, that you couldn't get a signal?

14
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,850
Did I say I wanted the location of the base station?

15
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,750
Okay. I lowered my speech. So what? What?

16
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,450
We were almost there.

17
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,450
But at least we know for such that Chief Ok is related to Michael.

18
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,250
That's why I'm more annoyed.

19
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,050
He was hiding while watching us.

20
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,550
And you, how old are you? How old are you?

21
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,310
What are you? What's your location?

22
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,950
If I'd got rid of her three years ago

23
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,950
it would have been a clean finish.

24
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,950
Figure out Baek Chan Mi's movements.

25
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,850
Unofficially.

26
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,750
  Il Gwang HiTech Research Center  

27
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,050
Ha.

28
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,050
Could Chief Ok have noticed the CCTV in his office?

29
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,850
Didn't you say that Chief Ok got surprised by seeing you pop out through the ventilation system and was knocked out?

30
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,250
Exactly. I can't understand this.

31
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,250
Is it possible to be so completely shocked by this face?

32
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,250
I'm the one who got more surprised, goodness.

33
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,050
I was so shocked— Aaah!

34
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,850
What is this? Goddammit.

35
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,050
What's wrong with this?

36
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,250
Why didn't you tell me? You guys, really.

37
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,350
What is this?

38
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:49,850
Still, just in case, I took it off and brought it.

39
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,250
Awesome. How did you think of bringing it over?

40
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,050
Your flair is still alive.

41
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,250
Having this much intuition is nothing.

42
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,650
I've been working in this field for so many years.

43
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,050
Top Secret — Code Name 'Good Casting'

44
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,250
Good Casting

45
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,650
 Episode 8  
 You got a phone call from Taiwan.

46
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,050
Did we find that person?

47
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,350
I think this time is for certain.

48
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,050
Plan a business trip. I need to meet him immediately.

49
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,950
Don't you have other things scheduled?

50
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,650
  Weekly schedule 

51
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,250
I'll just go alone this time.

52
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,850
I've been looking for him everywhere like a crazy person for three years.

53
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,050
Now, after all this time...

54
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,450
I need to leave the country tomorrow afternoon.

55
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:35,150
CEO, you should go to your informal schedules with Secretary Baek.

56
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,470
With Secretary Baek?

57
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,050
Search everything Michael used, including his aliases.

58
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,250
I even checked his past messages,

59
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,450
but they are so clean that I don't think this is his main phone.

60
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,650
What is this? This.

61
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,050
All of this is research material.

62
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,050
When a really fishy guy doesn't give off any smell,

63
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,350
that means he has a bombshell carefully hidden away.

64
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,250
Ah really.

65
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,670
Why is this so easy?

66
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,450
If you do it like this, it's not fun.

67
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,350
The moment this computer is hacked

68
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,850
 the hacking prevention tool operates and automatically tracks the other IP address. 

69
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,850
 - So they get hacked as well, right? 
 - Yes. 

70
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,250
Hey. This would be so fun to use in the future.

71
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,450
Does this work on a phone?

72
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,050
Well. I think it'll work. Let's try.

73
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,650
What if we hold out an olive branch to Division Director Tak?

74
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,150
Since he must have been ditched by Director Myeong anyway, we could take the opportunity to drag him to our side.

75
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,650
Division Director Tak knew about my identity yet hid it.

76
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,150
If we try to use that to our advantage without thinking things through, we'll probably get hit by a counterattack.

77
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,450
Is there anything on Chief Ok's phone?

78
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,250
It's all related to the research.

79
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,750
He just seems like a person crazy dedicated to research.

80
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,250
Moo Hyeok, you trace the person who registered the phone. Ye Eun, keep searching Chief Ok

81
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,950
until something related to Michael comes out.

82
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,550
Ye Eun.

83
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,570
You look pretty.

84
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,950
If I lost one,

85
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,950
I should take two away for us to be even.

86
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,200
Sunbae!

87
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,700
Shit. It's that dream again.

88
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,100
Ah. That scared me.

89
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,500
  Death Anniversary  

90
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,940
  Phone  

91
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,490
  Continuous nightmare sleep paralysis can be a sign that traumatic memories were suppressed due to dissociative fugue  

92
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,200
  and are now being expressed through dreams.   
    

93
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,130
People with short-term amnesia

94
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,250
often get playbacks of some memories.

95
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,560
The fear you experienced in the past keeps being repeated.

96
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,060
 What do you think about trying to get a hobby? 

97
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,810
 It can help your anxiety so you can focus on other things. 

98
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:20,270
 Cooking, playing an instrument, reading... drawing is good, too. 

99
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,250
Perfect.

100
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,490
  Il Gwang HiTech  

101
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,100
Secretary Baek. Do you have a driver's license?

102
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,190
I used to...   before it got suspended.  

103
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,030
I remember seeing on your resume that you have one.

104
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,970
That...

105
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,330
What should we do?

106
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,620
Someone needs to accompany the CEO to the countryside this afternoon.

107
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,260
  Informal Schedule  

108
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,040
  He normally doesn't share his nonofficial schedules. 

109
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,090
  What's going on?  

110
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,110
I can go.

111
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,310
You said you don't have a license.

112
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,820
I actually do.

113
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,670
  From this afternoon on.  

114
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,990
But your arm is injured, driving is a bit.

115
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,550
I'm an expert at using one hand.

116
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,450
Really? I see.

117
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,710
  Calling Team Leader Dung  

118
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,730
It's me. Quickly make me a driver's license.

119
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,750
Why a license all of a sudden?

120
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,900
It's urgent.

121
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,230
When will Baek Chan Mi's suspension of license be lifted, again?

122
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,670
It's to accompany CEO Yoon to his nonofficial schedule.

123
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,020
I really need it.

124
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,940
We don't deal with illegal acts here.

125
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,760
Hey! Oh. Tem Leader Dong!

126
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,840
Agent Baek doesn't have a license?

127
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,520
She has the skills of an F1 Grand Prix holder, if only she hadn't gotten her license revoked.

128
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,160
Did you get the initial place of registration for Chief Ok's phone?

129
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,710
I'm in the middle of checking.

130
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,950
Wait a minute.

131
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,630
If she got her license revoked... was she driving under the influence?

132
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,780
Road rage.

133
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,320
Well with Sunbae Baek's personality, it's possible.

134
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,020
I think she chased down a hit and run driver with a record of driving under the influence,

135
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,950
and ran into his car with all her strength.

136
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,590
I heard that car was pretty much wrecked and they had to scrap it.

137
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,750
I don't know if the person was all right.

138
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,930
I'm sorry?

139
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,560
Hey. Isn't it time to eat?

140
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,290
  Lunch time 12:00-1:00 PM 

141
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,730
Can you issue my temporary license?

142
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,430
It's one minute to noon, right?

143
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,210
 Northern Police station - Emergency Crime Reporting: call 112 / Other reports: call 182 

144
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,800
Why do you think I married a greenhorn like Yoon Seok Ho?

145
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,700
He keeps his promises.

146
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,710
He's someone who hasn't bothered a hair on my body after we wrote the prenuptial agreement.

147
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,920
  Transactions Record: There were no transfers in the past two weeks.  

148
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,980
We live separately, and don't interfere in the other's personal lives, nor do we engage in skinship.

149
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,880
But why isn't he making the deposit?

150
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,170
That consistently unchanging person.

151
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,210
Did he change his mind?

152
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,310
Look into these two.

153
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,870
If you can get anything, that'd be great.

154
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,050
If there's none, it's a relief.

155
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,980
I'll ride from the front.

156
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,490
I feel bad making you drive, with your arm in that state.

157
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,350
It's okay.

158
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,890
 Please slow down.  

159
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,410
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

160
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,580
Don't be nervous. Take your time. It's fine, it's fine.

161
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,270
If you sat in the back, you could have been more comfortable.

162
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,160
I normally prefer the front seat.

163
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,360
Well, it's just that Secretary Byeon takes it first every time.

164
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,680
Here it is.

165
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,690
Are you taking the plane to Taipei taking off at 1:35 pm?

166
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,170
Yes.

167
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,890
 The person you are trying to call... 

168
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,980
Did the old man age twice as fast and get senile?

169
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,640
What are you going to do if you forget that my mouth is light?

170
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,000
  Kuala Lumpur 1:35 pm  

171
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,040
He should know to take what I offer.

172
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,940
How tiresome. I'll have to say things in person for him to understand.

173
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,580
Aish. What is this?

174
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,250
Oof, damn.

175
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,550
You're dead, rascal.

176
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,920
Why are these punks doing this?

177
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,240
These darn morons...

178
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,630
Hey you! How can you drive like that?

179
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,000
- What's with this fool? 
  - Hey you!

180
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,350
Hey. Lower your window! This little rascal!

181
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,270
Oh, seriously this buffoon.

182
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,390
Oh. What's going on?

183
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,980
What is it?

184
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,210
Is there something wrong?

185
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,750
It seems like they're fighting over there, in the middle of the road.

186
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,250
They should just calm down.

187
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,520
It could be dangerous.

188
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,300
Switch lanes so we can avoid them.

189
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,840
Yes, I will.

190
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,610
Let's go...

191
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,480
This...

192

  54 LEO 6103  

193
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,200
Six one zero three.

194
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,400
  Northern Police Station  

195
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,550

  19 NA 2362  

199
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,800
CEO. Grab the handle tightly.

200
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm sorry? Why suddenly?

201
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,300
I'm going to speed up a bit.

202
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,140
Yes, well.

203
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,560
Okay, let's go.

204
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,270
Just wait a bit.

205
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,580
Aish.

206
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,480
I'll drop by the bathroom.

207
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,450
Yes. That's fine.

208
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,340
The bathroom is on this side.

209
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,140
Search some licenses for me.

00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,330
Yes. I got it.

213
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,250
Team Leader, can temporary licenses get revoked or suspended if some issue comes up?

214
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,890
What are you talking about? 
  Chinese spy 

215
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,850
I'm really worried about Sunbae Baek.

216
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,400
Who should I catch first?

217
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,900
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

218
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,310
Catch a tiger by the toe

219
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,580
2362, you win.

220
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,060
Why are you crying? Where's your mom?

221
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,460
Why are you crying here alone?

222
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,360
Ahh! What is this?

223
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,860
Hi.

224
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,840
Who are you?

225
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,350
Min Jae!

226
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,570
Thank you very much. You don't know how scared I was.

227
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,270
Min Jae. You should stop crying now.

228
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,180
A man should protect the person they love.

229
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,920
Once you lose them, crying is foolish.

230
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,570
Excuse me, as a thank you,

231
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,420
can I buy you a cup of coffee?

232
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,460
No. That's fine.

233
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,030
It's really okay.

234
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,150
Aish. Argh!

235
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,850
Not that, you can't...

236
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,530
  CEO Sim Hwa Ran  

237
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,720
Hello. What should I give you?

238
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,430
- I'll have this one. 
 - Yes, here.

239
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,480
Yes. Thank you.

240
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,520
This moron. Are you crazy? Do you want to die?

241
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,660
Wrong. I am crazy.

242
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,250
But the one who wants to die is the ex-convict who runs out and about while he's on probation.

243
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,510
9318, that's you.

244
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,460
Who are you? What bastard sent you?

245
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,800
- Who sent you? 
 - That's what I want to ask.

246
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,890
Who sent you?

247
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,280
Do you need to get beaten up on this gloomy day

248
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,020
for you to regain your senses?

249
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,600
This—

250
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,130
You made the first offense, right?

251
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,030
No.

252
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,990
Oh. Oh. Oh why?

253
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,180
Are you out of your mind?

254
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,930
No, the crazy one isn't me, it's her!

255
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,530
I accidentally dropped a bottle.

256
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,030
He got angry because he slipped and fell on that.

257
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,860
Even if it's the case...!

258
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,760
Then, you're saying this I fell over on my own and became like this?

259
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,380
Hey. That's it. Let's bring the CCTVs out.

260
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,240
Let's bring the CCTVs out!

261
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:58,130
You deliberately chose a place without CCTVs and lured me here!

262
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,740
Let's just go.

263
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,670
What if he comes after us and attacks us?

264
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,500
Let's go.

265
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,240
If I see you again, you better prepare yourself.

266
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,700
-  Leave!  
 - Careful, careful.

267
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,000
- Oh my, what a scare. 
 - Let's go, it's okay.

268
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,420
What's with her?

269
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,500
- What's wrong with your arm? 
 - It's all right.

270
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,610
That person seriously!

271
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,260
Seriously!

272
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,130
Yes. I am still following them.

273
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,470
Baek Chan Mi isn't ordinary.

274
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,090
Be careful to not get caught. If you do...

275
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,030
What should I do?

276
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,660
take care of her quietly.

277
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,220
Oh no.

278
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,390
I'm sorry.

279
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,350
Thank you.

280
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,480
  Death anniversary  

281
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,950
  Kang Woo Won  

282
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,330
  If you don't pick up in 10 seconds, you're out for breach of contract.  

283
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,380
  Kang Woo Won  

284
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,530
- Yes, Kang Woo Won? 
 - It's an urgent matter so hurry here within an hour.

285
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,990
Hello, this is the house where you agreed to work from next week on.

286
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:36,880
If it's okay, can I ask you to come over now?

287
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,240
Whats the urgent matter?

288
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,740
Huh?

289
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,920
That.

290
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,140
What's with the rice cooker?

291
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,860
I wanted to have a home-made meal for the first time in a while, but I'd have to know how to use it.

292
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,880
My manager used to do all the work so I have never used it before.

293
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,090
Don't tell me

294
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,020
you called me because of the rice cooker?

295
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,930
I am a model for a rice cooker.

296
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,890
You are an employee of the company.

297
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,850
You must have forgotten that you have to deal with anything I call you for.

298
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,260
What should I do? Shall we start over?

299
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,600
About that, based on Article 4, Clause 5 of the contract,

300
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,290
it was decided that I only have to support you on site

301
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,190
when you are exhibiting a product from Il Gwang HiTech.

302
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,140
Exhibit? Give me a second.

303
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,610
I advertised the product on my social media with a million followers.

304
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,200
Is that enough?

305
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,310
While you're making the meal, prepare a few side dishes as well.

306
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,260
I won't expect much taste-wise.

307
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,030
I'll eat a few spoonfuls to honor your sincerity.

308
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,850
There's meat in the refrigerator.

309
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,320
- Hello? 
 - No matter how much I search 6103, there's nothing.

310
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,080
There's nothing on the license number, car model, anything.

311
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,390
Could it be a fake one?

312
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,130
 It's not a fake one. There is a registered owner.  

313
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,020
Send me the owner by text.

314
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,480
There are too many spam calls these days. It's a problem.

315
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,470
Isn't that because you are being too nice when talking to them?

316
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,260
Block that number.

317
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,380
Now.

318
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,830
Yes.

319
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,870
 It's owned by a corporation, but it looks like a phantom corporation. Should I dig some more? 

320
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,160
They even sent a message?

321
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,450
They are persistent. Give it to me. I'll deal with them.

322
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,880
Ignoring them is the wisest thing to do.

323
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,740
It is wisest, indeed.

324
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,060
But why are we here?

325
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,280
It's my father.

326
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,010
Did your father

327
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,520
pass away?

328
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:21,830
  15 years ago  

329
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,470
  Ah. It's raining a lot.  

330
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,530
  Why are you here?  

331
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,530
  No matter how much I waited you didn't come. 

332
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,580
  What am I supposed to do if I miss you? Of course, I should come. 

333
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,630
 We'll count to three and run.  

334
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:53,160
  Let's go. One, two.  

335
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,960
♫   The words I want to say the most
 and the words that come from deep down  ♫

336
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,980
♫   Are the words "I miss you"  ♫

337
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,100
♫   The words I really want to hear are the words “I love you”  ♫

338
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,920
♫   But I'm worried that they may come out too easily  ♫

339
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,340
♫   I can’t hide this heart, it's already out  ♫

340
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:25,160
♫   Will it seem too much?
Will I look easy?  ♫

341
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,750
♫   But I can’t wait so should I  ♫

342
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,760
♫   confess first?   ♫

343
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,220
 I love you. I love you.  
 ♫   Let’s love  ♫

344
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:43,070
♫   Let’s love sweetly  ♫

345
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,970
♫   and deeply, let's love  ♫

346
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:53,640
♫   With the world's most precious you  ♫

347
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,740
  I came here to say bye. To bid farewell.  

348
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,540
  Did you decide to study abroad?  

349
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,600
  I was forced to stay because of my mom, but there is no longer a reason for me to stay.  

350
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,830
  It's the last time but I couldn't even prepare a bouquet of flowers.  

351
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,110
  Your feelings have changed already.  

352
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:17,040
  You know very well that I have a single-minded, unchanging heart. 

353
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,980
 Being buried under flowers during the whole funeral ceremony, I must have gotten tired of it.  

354
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,250
 Bleh, just seeing lilies makes me feel totally nauseated.  

355
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,690
  Seok Ho, that day, I...  

356
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,320
  Don't go around getting rained on. You'll get a cold.  

357
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,300
  Seok Ho! Take the umbrella with you! You're getting wet!  

358
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,830
  Later! If we see each other again,  

359
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,390
  I'll return this to you!  

360
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,200
  Same with the umbrella, give it back then!  

361
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:02,370
♫   There are a lot of good people in the world  ♫

362
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:08,550
♫   But how can I compare them with you?  ♫

363
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:22,030
That's why they say a son is no good. They were selling some just out front.

364
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,130
You felt embarrassed to buy flowers, that's why you came empty-handed, isn't it?

365
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:32,690
But don't people normally bring white lilies?

366
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:44,030
I for some reason don't like lilies much.

367
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,950
  Taipei  

368
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,070
He passed away suddenly three years ago.

369
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:20,410
 If it's three years ago today, it's Min Seok's death anniversary. 

370
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,900
But I don't understand

371
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,580
why he went to Busan without a chauffeur that day.

372
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,700
He went to Busan?

373
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,510
What happened on that day?

374
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:50,140
Wherever I go, wherever I flee, they follow me.

375
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,680
Those dogged guys.

376
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,760
Who?

377
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,150
Dad!

378
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,600
Go back in. Hurry!

379
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,050
Even the chairman passed away like this.

380
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,480
For someone like me, it's only a matter of time.

381
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,810
I heard that the chairman favored you especially.

382
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,170
Here. This is the picture the chairman had on his desk.

383
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,490
Because of me...

384
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:11,330
I promise you that I will never, never, tell anyone.

385
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,130
Secret ledger.

386
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,230
Ledger?

387
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,570
It's because of me.

388
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:28,410
Are you saying that the chairman had a secret ledger?

389
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,740
Director of Headquarters Myeong.

390
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,340
If you say Director of Headquarters Myeong... It's Executive Director Myeong Gye Cheol?

391
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,330
  Division Director Tak  

392
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,860
  Executive Director Myeong Gye Cheol  

393
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:59,120
Those bloody money bugs. Once they smell money, they just infest it all.

394
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,780
They don't know to get lost after getting their share.

395
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,670
We might know if we meet the chairman's driver.

396
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,940
That person... died two years ago.

397
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,800
He died?

398
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,390
Get out.

399
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,350
- Team Leader. 
 - Get out of my house.

400
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,880
Leave immediately!

401
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,820
- Team Leader. 
 - Get out! 
 - Team Leader!

402
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,980
-  Team Leader! 
 - Get out.

403
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:39,440
Team Leader, wait, hear me out. Wait a second. Team Leader!

404
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,580
 Red Rose Hair Salon 

405
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,100
Don't open the door! I said don't open the door!

406
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,030
 Did someone die?  

407
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,250
What's this?

408
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,360
What's wrong with it?

409
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,660
Don't you know that I don't eat my meals without meat?

410
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,800
Don't you know I only eat pork when it's stir-fried?

411
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,310
Oh, it's stir-fried.

412
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,730
You've gotten better.

413
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,600
This drawing...

414
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,490
What is this?

415
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:08,050
This? I just suddenly got some artistic inspiration and drew it.

416
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:12,370
What do you think? That touch isn't just something ordinary right? You get the feeling right away, don't you?

417
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:15,880
My artistic talent wasn't something that I could suppress with my will.

418
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,130
It jumps out even while I'm eating or inspires me in the bathroom.

419
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:22,020
Sometimes it even pops out mid-sleep.

420
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,920
That's why I decided...

421
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,030
to open an exhibit.

422
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,460
Drawings like this have a lot of value,

423
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,680
so instead of sharing it with a lot of people,

424
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,230
I think it'd be better to get it reviewed by a professional who would understand its value.

425
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,520
That does make sense.

426
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,400
Not anyone could recognize the worth of my work.

427
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,160
I know someone

428
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,350
who is very influential in contemporary art.

429
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,830
Who?

430
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,340
What's this thing? Did a kid draw that?

431
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,080
Did Kang Woo Won draw this?

432
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,230
Yes, Team Leader.

433
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,970
Is that the contemporary art virtuoso?

434
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,660
Okay, okay.

435
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,640
What do you think?

436
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,960
It's 100% Baek Chan Mi and Hwang Mi Soon.

437
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,720
Right? I agree.

438
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,470
 Kang Woo Won hasn't regained his memories, has he? 

439
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,510
I don't know.

440
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:35,070
What if he is slowly regaining them?

441
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,700
 Since I've confirmed that there are no pictures, let's say the contract never existed.  

442
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,410
 Sunbaenim!  

443
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,620
 Make sure you stay next to him and watch him at all times from now on. 

444
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,390
If his memories return and he makes a fuss about wanting to sue Pi Cheol Woong...

445
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,950
Would it put us in a very difficult situation?

446
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,590
Like what happened with Secretary Goo, the second our only witness gets taken away from us by the police,

447
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,270
our plan gets ruined.

448
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,090
But Team Leader,

449
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,790
I think I'll die before Pi Cheol Woong does.

450
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:12,810
Can I stop being in charge of watching Kang Woo Won?

451
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:18,960
Why? What did they say? How good is my drawing?

452
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:23,790
They think they'll need to see it in person to appraise it.

453
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,490
What did you say their name was?

454
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:28,600
Why do you want to know that?

455
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,800
Shouldn't I know what kind of famous artist they are

456
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,360
if I'm going to be showing them my drawing?

457
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,700
Oh...

458
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:41,320
The thing is... they use a pseudonym.

459
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,070
What was it again?

460
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,490
What's their surname?

461
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:49,140
It was Dong... something.

462
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,930
Dong?

463
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,880
  Contemporary art virtuoso Mr. Dong.  

464
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,060
  Dong Casso, born in 1969, field of work, related quotes 

465
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,740
Okay, got it.

466
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,020
 Personage Information: Dong Casso - Born in 1969, Field of expertise, Career 

467
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,370
Dong Casso?

468
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:19,090
Yes! I think that's it! Tonkats—  (Turned tonkatsu, a breaded pork cutlet, into a name.) 

469
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,650
I mean, Dong Casso...

470
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,950
Hello?

471
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,350
Yes.

472
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:43,970
Yes, that's alright, I can take your call.

473
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:47,480
Like this.

474
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,680
You go here.

475
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,860
Daddy?

476
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,220
Oh, gosh.

477
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,770
O-Oh my, are you okay?

478
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,660
I heard a snap. Are you okay?

479
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,750
This won't do.

480
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,860
I'll drive today.

481
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,360
You had a license?

482
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,340
I have a class-one regular license. Let's go. 
  (T/N: for vehicles up to minibuses, small trucks, construction machines.) 

483
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,310
Sir, I think your shoulders are bit too tense right now.

484
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,810
D-Don't talk to me, I need to focus.

485
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,480
When... did you get your license?

486
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,570
I got it when I was 20.

487
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:40,140
Then... you have more than 15 years of driving experience?

488
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,910
But your speed is a bit...

489
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:46,030
After I got my license, this is

490
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,480
my first time actually driving today...

491
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,870
Hurry up and park. Park the car.

492
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,620
Let me...

493
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,130
Don't merge! (informal speech)

494
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,150
Don't merge!

495
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,060
Are you speaking informally to me?

496
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,980
Don't look at me. Look forward. (informal speech)

497
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,360
- Take a right. 
 - Right? 
 - Right, right.

498
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:13,970
Oh my goodness!

499
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,720
Don't merge!

500
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,770
 Busan 

501
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,020
Look forward.

502
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,490
Will we make it?

503
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,490
B-Busan?

504
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,510
- If we go this way— 
 - Look forward.  
 - Yes, yes.

505
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,590
You're leaving already?

506
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:36,100
What do you mean already? It's past nine.

507
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,990
When did my phone turn off?

508
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,670
Wait, the rice cooker! You need to teach me how to use the rice cooker.

509
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,290
For next time, so you don't have to call me

510
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:48,110
and use it whenever convenient for you,

511
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,610
I wrote out the instructions in detail

512
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:53,380
and put them on the refrigerator.

513
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,370
Where? Where?

514
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,440
I don't see it.

515
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,590
I put it on the refrigerator.

516
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,120
I'm telling you it's not there.

517
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:12,360
Huh? I'm sure I put it up there.

518
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,020
Look, it's not there.

519
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,440
Then look at this.

520
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,060
I don't read books because I'm addicted to printed words.

521
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,650
If you're addicted to them, why don't you read?

522
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,100
I'm keeping as much distance from reading as possible for treatment.

523
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,430
When how do you read your script?

524
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:38,780
My manager records it for me. I learn it from those.

525
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,420
Are you joking with me right now?

526
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:46,430
By chance... did you just get angry at me?

527
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,250
It's not by chance. I am angry.

528
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,840
You call me whenever you want. Since you were bored today,

529
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,230
you just called me here, telling me to cook and make you side dishes.

530
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:02,060
Am I your manager? Your maid? Your girlfriend?

531
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:06,970
Why do you tell me to come and go, do this and that as you please?

532
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:10,440
Any other day, I would've let it go.

533
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,200
But today...

534
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,320
at least today...

535
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,300
Today I shouldn't be doing this.

536
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,190
Do you know that?

537
00:51:55,150 --> 00:52:05,330
♫  I used to try to grasp onto it with all my might, I didn’t know then  ♫

538
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,810
♫  That even with all my efforts  ♫

539
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,270
I'm sorry Oppa.

540
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:18,040
I wanted to make you a really delicious dinner.

541
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:24,420
Nobody else would've prepared it for you.

542
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:29,930
♫  Those stars being the same as ever  ♫

543
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:35,610
I, at least, was supposed to do that, I'm sorry.

544
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,220
I'm sorry.

545
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:44,020
♫  The mornings I shed ecstatic tears  ♫

546
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:50,120
♫  Went by like the wind  ♫

547
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:55,450
♫  And those days become myself  ♫

548
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,830
We somehow ended up all the way in Busan. But it's still nice, huh?

549
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:34,390
Why did you say you would drive when you couldn't?

550
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,610
I want to let you rest a bit.

551
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,400
Have you ever been here?

552
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,650
This is my first time in three years.

553
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:55,780
Why? Because it's so far?

554
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,480
No.

555
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,060
 I wasn't brave enough. 

556
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,950
Stay here. I'll go buy an umbrella.

557
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,960
No, no. You stay here. I'll go buy one.

558
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,720
You'll get a cold if you stay out in the rain. Take cover somewhere!

559
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:40,250
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

560
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,290
Can you give me one of these?

561
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:43,970
 54 LEO 6103 

562
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:29,230
I almost forgot because there were so many people chasing after me today.

563
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:32,850
Nice to meet you, 6103.

564
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,600
You're an agent?

565
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,600
I only heard about you,

566
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,520
but meeting you in person is an honor, should I say?

567
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,110
  CEO Yoon Seok Ho  

568
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,650
Who sent you?

569
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:07,110
If we get caught, I'm guessing it'll be as bad both for you and me, am I right?

570
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,780
  CEO Yoon Seok Ho  

571
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:28,530
  Aish.  

572
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:40,470
  The person you are calling...  

573
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,100
  CEO Yoon Seok Ho  

574
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:20,710


575
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,370
  Epilogue  

576
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,920
You're saying that this person is the contemporary art virtuoso?

577
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,470
- Mr. Dong Casso. 
 - Dong Casso.

578
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:06,270
I heard you wanted to meet me absolutely, at all costs, by any means.

579
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,390
I have heard of the fame of your admirable reputation.

580
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:12,330
That you have made a strong difference in the sphere of contemporary art.

581
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,890
Well, that's not such a big thing.

582
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:17,920
But I did. A very deep difference, yes.

583
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,950
I am impudent enough that I wanted to hear what you think about my drawing.

584
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:31,910
Wow.

585
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,720
How should I put it...

586
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,220
It goes beyond post-modernism,

587
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:43,870
and can be seen as a representative form of contemporary art.

588
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:46,350
The lines are very simple,

589
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:50,750
but I see the exceptional attempt at trying to break down

590
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:54,110
the former convention, should I say?

591
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:58,510
Wow. Thank you for showing me.

592
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,190
Thank you.

593
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:02,800
I'll take a picture of both of you.

594
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,690
Okay.

595
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,090
♫   Think about it  ♫

596
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,030
  Good Casting  

597
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:20,470
Pi Cheol Woong died?

598
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:23,030
  When the fire alarm rang, Pi Cheol Woong was murdered in the meantime. 

599
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:25,630
 If I tell you there is a way to clean up all the things giving you a headache, what will you do?  

600
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:27,110
 Security Operation team 3 will be dissolved.  

601
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,440
In the end, this was what you wanted?

602
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,330
  - What's the problem again? 
 - You had me followed! 

603
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,680
 Did you not play traitor or something? 

604
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,980
Hello? Im Ye Eun? Why aren't you saying anything? 
   Don't you want to see your daughter?  

605
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,740
 It's a relief you didn't get hurt. It was eating at me.  

606
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,760
I left something.

607
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,020
It's mine.

608
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,600
Why are you doing this to me?

609
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,570
 Don't you want to find Michael? He is next to you.  

610
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,470
What are you saying?
