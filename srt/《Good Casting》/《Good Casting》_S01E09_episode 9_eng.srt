2
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,900
  Aish.  

3
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,000
 CEO Yoon Seok Ho 

4
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,900
 Caller identification restricted 

5
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,300
 You'd better pick up. 

6
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,000
 Don't you want to see your daughter? 

7
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,100
 Don't you want to see your daughter? 

8
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,500
 Caller identification restricted 

9
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,700
Hello?

10
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
 Mommy!  

11
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,300
So Hee!

12
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,100
How did it go? Did you take care of it well?

13
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,900
Did you get caught?

14
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,900
She realized I'm an agent.

15
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,100
 Did you figure out who the other man was? 

16
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,700
That I wasn't—

17
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,100
 Hello? 

18
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,700
 What's going on? 

19
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,000
 Hello? 

20
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,600
 Hello? 

21
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,100
 Hello? Hello! 

22
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,700
 Why is the call such poor quality? 

23
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,300
 I'll take care of the next part myself, so stay quiet until I contact you. 

24
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,100
Where's Director Seo?

25
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,600
Director Seo?

26
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,000
He's in his office, why?

27
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,500
 I'm sorry, sir. 

28
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,400
 Something urgent came up. I'll head up to Seoul first.  

29
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,500
 Byeon Woo Seok 

30
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,700
 The task has been completed. 

31
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
 Okay, see you there. 

32
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,900
So Hee!

33
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,500
Mommy!

34
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,200
Does it hurt a lot?

35
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,700
I'm not hurt. It doesn't hurt at all.

36
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,700
I'm okay.

37
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,700
 You'll have to keep your promise now. 

38
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,100
 You just need to report to me what your teammates are doing. 

39
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,200
 Team Leader Dong Gwan Soo 

40
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,700
 Hello? Hello? 

41
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,300
 Im Ye Eun. 

42
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,100
 Im Ye Eun! 

43
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,200
 Why aren't you saying anything? 

44
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
 You'd better pick up. 
 Don't you want to see your daughter? 

45
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,700
 Calm yourself down with a cup of tea first.  

46
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,800
 You can't live in a safehouse forever, can you?  
  (Safehouse - secret government-protected living space for victims or witnesses.) 

47
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,700
Mommy...

48
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,400
 Top Secret - Code Name 'Good Casting' 

49
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,800
 Good Casting  

50
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,500
 Episode 9  
  The third phase of research is progressing without a problem, I presume? 

51
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,700
I’ve been stuck inside the office, not breathing any fresh air

52
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,500
for weeks now, trying to complete it by the deadline.

53
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,000
If things go awry at the very end, it's not just the driver who dies.

54
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,900
I'm telling you to keep in mind that everyone around him will be thrown on the road to death as well.

55
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,700
Of course! I am naturally taking this as a matter of life and death!

56
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
Don't worry!

57
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,100
What is it?

58
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,200
I'm sorry. I told him he couldn't, but he keeps calling.

59
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,510
Do we still have things left to discuss?

60
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,300
I was just tying my shoes, getting ready to go visit you personally if you didn't pick up this time either.

61
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,900
You're terribly quick-witted.

62
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,900
You arrived safely in Malaysia, I guess?

63
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,100
The food over there doesn't suit my tastes. I just couldn't bring myself to go.

64
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,100
I thought I had made myself pretty clear.

65
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,100
That if you rest at the Malaysian branch for three or four years, I'll call you back here when the time comes.

66
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,700
 I've seen plenty of people get their relations with you cut exactly this way. 

67
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,500
What is it that you want?

68
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,600
Half of your borrowed-name savings accounts.

69
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,100
I already know everything about your accounts details anyway.

70
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
If you just tell me the password, I'll take it and leave you alone.

71
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,690
I'll also clear all those useless things for you.

72
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,390
The cleaning fee seems excessively high to me.

73
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:59,520
 If Pi Cheol Woong starts talking and I pitch in, you will take the most damage. 

74
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,670
I'll have to think about it.

75
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,120
I can't wait long. Let's get this over with in a day.

76
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,160
Let's first have a drink and then talk.

77
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,290
I'll take my time to drink after I hear whatever difficult thing you have to say.

78
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,020
I left it because I thought it would just leave a little scar, but it was filled with pus.

79
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,440
What should I do?

80
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,610
If you don't get rid of the pus quickly, it'll smell bad.

81
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,970
It'll hurt when you squeeze it out, but that's how new skin will grow.

82
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:04,300
So are you asking me to get rid of the pus? Like three years ago?

83
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,540
If that's what this is about, you've come to the wrong person.

84
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,370
You only got to that position by riding on my coattails.

85
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,230
Climbing up may be difficult, but falling down is an instant.

86
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,110
I'll take care of myself!

87
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,690
It seems like you're not taking such good care of yourself.

88
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,690
What would you do if I said there's a way to get rid of all the things causing you headaches?

89
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,450
I'll give you the broom. So just sweep a few times with it for me.

90
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,150
Will anyone notice if a few bugs die while you're sweeping the porch?

91
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,930
  National Intelligence Service Protection Ward  

92
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,150
  No entry unless authorized  

93
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,580
Time for rotation!

94
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,570
You worked hard.

95
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,090
- Work hard. 
 - Yes, go.

96
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,780

  No entry unless authorized  

99
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,430
  There is a fire. There is a fire. 

100
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,950
What's going on? Is there a fire? Go check!

101
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,090
Yes, sir.

102
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:43,100
Fire alert! Fire alert! Requesting verification for fire alert in the closed ward.

103
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,170
What is this now?!

104
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,160
  There is a fire. There is a fire. 

105
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,200
- A fire, a fire! 
 - Let's go. 
 - Please do not run.

106
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,480
Please don't push.

107
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,660
Hold on.

108
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,460
Wait a min—

109
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,490
  1 
 B1 

110
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,120
Need backup. Culprit escaping to basement level...

111
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,370
The culprit is escaping to the basement level. Block all the emergency exits, parking lot, and building exits.

112
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,660
Call the headquarters. And call 119 (Korean 911)!

113
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,290
- Check the other floors as well. Hurry! 
 - Yes.

114
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,350
 White Collar 

115
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:58,110
This is a blowfish. It's a blowfish!

116
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,110
So Hee, who did you meet earlier?

117
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,180
Dad.

118
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,530
What do you mean Dad?

119
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,200
Dad bought this for me.

120
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,700
What are you saying?

121
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,030
How did you meet Dad?

122
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,440
I'm sorry. Mom made a mistake, I'm sorry.

123
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,030
Yes, Team Leader.

124
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,890
Pi Cheol Woong is dead?

125
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,320
 National Intelligence Service Korea 

126
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,340
How did Pi Cheol Woong die?

127
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,720
Let's talk when we get up there.

128
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,330
The culprit is gutsy.

129
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,700
He took down two agents and made his way up...

130
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,110
Why isn't Baek Chan Mi here yet?

131
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,440
Why isn't she here yet?!

132
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,870
I called her.

133
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,700
He says he called her.

134
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,740
Where have you been?

135
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,340
Our Team Leader Dung's foul mood index is at its highest today, so keep a low profile.

136
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,590
Hey. Hey!

137
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,110
Why are you going there?

138
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,080
Yes, there! Rewind it.

139
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,220
Zoom in on that guy's vest.

140
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,100
 Company name: White Collar - Corporate registration number - Address 

141
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,360
White Collar?

142
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,360
It's a laundry service agency.

143
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,380
Pull up the CCTV for the ward at the time White Collar got off the elevator.

144
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:27,950
Pi Cheol Woong was murdered during the time that White Collar showed up and the fire alarm went off.

145
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,980
- It seems pretty clear, right? 
 - They set off the alarm as a distraction, then killed Pi Cheol Woong.

146
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,110
Moo Hyeok, check the laundry pick-up car.

147
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,520
The rest of you scour the CCTV within the premises

148
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,770
and find White Collar's travel route. Begin.

149
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,550
Bae Moo Hyeok. I thought you said Director Seo was in his office.

150
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,510
Follow me outside,

151
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,060
Why are you looking for Director Seo?

152
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,410
He put a tail on me.

153
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,100
He was watching you? Why would Director Seo do that?

154
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,890
I'm curious why he's doing that, too.

155
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,020
Let's talk after we catch the criminal first.

156
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,380
We had barely put Pi Cheol Woong in the protective ward when Director Seo was trying to give him over to the prosecutors,

157
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,950
but now I may take all the blame and get fired on top of it.

158
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,390
Wait. He tried to hand him over to the prosecutors without a police investigation?

159
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,220
It won't be too late to suspect him after we catch the culprit. There's no time now.

160
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,760
How far have we traced the culprit?

161
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,070
A laundry pick-up car.

162
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,660
The laundry pick-up car disappeared from the basement parking lot.

163
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,700
What do you mean?

164
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,820
The CCTV caught him entering the lot,

165
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,620
but I can't find him leaving no matter how much I look.

166
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,640
Did he sink into the ground or what?!

167
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,630
He must have left some crumbs behind even if he sank into the ground.

168
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,680
What time did they call the cops again?

169
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,400
23:43.

170
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,150
The fact that a cop car came and left before they even called the cops...

171
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,180
It makes no sense, of course.

172
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,000
I think he disguised his car as a police car and escaped the hospital.

173
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,140
It's a black bongo car. 16 LEO 3419. 
   Date - Chassis - Model - Year code 

174
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,820
It left the hospital around 23:40,

175
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,790
so check the area.

176
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,790
I found it! A black bongo, 3419.

177
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,320
We're tracking its movement.

178
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,150
Did you make a search on the vehicle?

179
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,740
  Car Registration, Theft Report   
 Lee Gwang Hyeok, 58, Male.

180
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,620
But he filed a car theft report recently.

181
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,750
Do you still not have it's location?

182
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,830
It took the road to Incheon Airport about 3.5 hours ago.

183
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,880
Incheon? Is this punk trying to get away after having finished his business?

184
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,840
I actually think he's trying to.

185
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,260
He passed Yeongjeong bridge 3 hours ago.

186
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,570
We're on our way, so hurry out and join us.

187
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,250
- All of you, follow me. 
 - Let me take care of something more urgent first.

188
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,520
What are you doing? Let's go.

189
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,660
Didn't you hear me?!

190
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,300
- From this moment forward, Team Leader Dong Gwan Soo is relieved from duty. 
 - What?

191
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,000
Relieved from duty? Who's going to lead our team?

192
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,090
What is the need for a team without a captain?

193
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:17,190
Industrial Security Team 3 will be dissolved as soon as an emergency meeting is held.

194
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,550
What are you talking about?

195
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,080
Is this what you wanted ultimately?! Dissolving our team?

196
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,510
Can you say that after you made a witness die by doing vain work?

197
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,060
Pi Cheol Woong's cause of death is a murder framed as suicide.

198
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,080
We have to catch the criminal before he escapes!

199
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:37,310
You're right. The media will report it as a suicide but there is definitely a culprit.

200
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,390
Division Director Tak.

201
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,910
How did you already find that out?

202
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,460
Division Director Tak didn't get on his scheduled flight and disappeared at the airport.

203
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,760
Where else could he have gone? The finger and footprints found on the scene,

204
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,300
and even the knot that was used, all of them are a match with Division Director Tak.

205
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
How do you do that without any definitive evidence?

206
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,830
We already found the weapons of his crime on his personal yacht!

207
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,390
What is it? What happened?

208
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,280
He said the team is dismantled.

209
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,600
- What are you saying? 
 - By chance,

210
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,440
we won't be fired, right?

211
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,680
Director Seo.

212
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,280
Where is Director Seo now?

213
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,970
It's already said and done.

214
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,580
He said all the general directors are going to hold an emergency meeting

215
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,870
on the dissolution of our team.

216
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,160
Chan Mi!

217
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,480
The Industrial Security Operations Team 3...

218
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,260
Open the door!

219
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,060
Ignore her, I locked the door because I knew that would happen.

220
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,070
Let's start the meeting now!

221
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,040
Oh?

222
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,270
Are you out of your mind?!

223
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,290
Did you just find out today that I was crazy?

224
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,600
What's the problem now?

225
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,940
You were watching me!

226
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,300
Tell me.

227
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,810
Why did you secretly investigate me?

228
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,100
Why did you put an agent on me?

229
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,390
You...

230
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,820
want to discuss that here?

231
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,280
Why? I don't think the reason behind the inspection of your subordinate

232
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,780
is an issue that needs to be private.

233
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,020
I sent my subordinate on the field to complete the operation,

234
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,400
but she couldn't focus because she had been reunited with her former tutoring student!

235
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,700
Sure, I was surveilling you.

236
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,190
- That... 
- Wait!

237
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,990
Did you...

238
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,010
know Yoon Seok Ho from before?

239
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,020
There's no way the top agent Baek Chan Mi

240
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,100
would have forgotten the on-site regulations.

241
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,800
Don't tell me,

242
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,060
did you act as some kind of traitor?

243
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,380
Just like three years ago?

244
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,630
Is that true? Did you violate the on-site regulations and observe someone

245
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,210
related to your personal history?

246
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,090
Sunbae, are we really going to be dismantled?

247
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,030
What is true and what isn't...

248
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,260
I don't know at all anymore.

249
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,880
- What does that mean? 
 -  Sunbae Chan Mi and Yoon Seok Ho. 

250
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,300
 I heard they used to be in that kind of relationship. 

251
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,940
What?

252
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,280
Hang up!

253
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,320
I'm just saying this in case you misunderstand this,

254
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,440
but I didn't wait for you. You just came up after I did.

255
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,010
You wanted to punch Director Seo but ended up getting punched twice.

256
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,320
That's why you need to control your temper.

257
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,140
You succeed up to 99% and then ruin everything with that temper of yours.

258
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,570
Why don't you tell me what to do once you quit smoking.

259
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,220
That?

260
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,600
That's not mine. I already quit smoking.

261
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,240
When?

262
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,050
Five years ago.

263
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,830
Then you must've quit smoking around the same time you quit me.

264
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,460
You must've been really tired of it.

265
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,330
After I left and quit you, I thought I would die if I kept smoking like I was.

266
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,430
That's why I quit.

267
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,160
Why did you take on Yoon Seok Ho's case

268
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,620
when you knew it would become an issue?

269
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,310
I only heard up to this point.

270
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,580
So the finance team head worked under Executive Director Myeong and managed the secret ledgers?

271
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,220
There's nobody to trust.

272
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,400
Director Myeong persuaded him that it was for the sake of the company.

273
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,480
That's also the reason he couldn't get over his guilt and confessed to the chairman.

274
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,050
So in conclusion, just before Father passed away,

275
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,350
he found out about Director Myeong's ledgers.

276
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:06,160
And just after he argued with Director Myeong about those ledgers,

277
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,830
he got into a car accident.

278
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:12,820
Then the reason must be inside the ledger.

279
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,760
I...

280
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,430
will bring it.

281
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,950
You don't even know where to find it.

282
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:28,110
A place where a mere ant wouldn't dare get into. It must be Director Myeong's office.

283
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,150
No, it's too dangerous.

284
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,290
Don't worry. It will be dangerous for Director Myeong instead of me.

285
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,570
You can't even kill a mere ant, what a bluff.

286
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,770
I can't kill an innocent ant but I should give a roasting to the guilty.

287
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,650
The Yoon Seok Ho that I know

288
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,640
would never do a bad thing.

289
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,820
But if someone else observes him,

290
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,100
they will definitely have a prejudice against him.

291
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,150
First, Yoon Seok Ho isn't a child.

292
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:08,020
Second, you're the one who has a bias.

293
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,830
Your conviction that Yoon Seok Ho won't do anything bad.

294
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,060
On what ground? With what evidence?

295
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,330
If I was Director Seo, I also would have been suspicious of you.

296
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,470
Yet you aren't suspicious of Director Seo?

297
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,750
I'm telling you he even put an agent on my tail.

298
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,390
I would follow through to the end if I was as great as a certain someone and had the skills to hold out.

299
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:33,160
But you know well that I'm not someone who can do that.

300
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,131
You must be looking for Intern Im?

301
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:39,181
Did she not come to work today?

302
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:42,331
She took the day off despite being an intern.

303
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:45,071
What department are you from?

304
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:52,041
So you are the secretary of the CEO.

305
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:56,171
What is it? How come you're looking for the intern?

306
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,731
What could be the matter?

307
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,971
I had a business-related question. I'll be on my way.

308
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:09,961
  For the sake of our security, please carry your employee pass with you.  

309
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:29,761
Good morning, CEO.

310
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:35,611
It's not really a good morning. I went through a lot of trouble after losing my secretary at the Busan Port, you see.

311
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:39,091
I'm really sorry for that day.

312
00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:45,641
I was worried that you might have been kidnapped so I was looking everywhere for you like a madman.

313
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:49,161
No way, who would kidnap me?

314
00:31:49,161 --> 00:31:52,281
You could've called me, but I only got a single text,

315
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:54,851
saying that you're leaving first!

316
00:31:54,851 --> 00:32:00,251
That's because... I had to take care of an urgent situation.

317
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,781
What could've been so urgent that you would abandon your CEO?

318
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:06,981
Abandon you? It's not that at all.

319
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:08,091
Then what happened?

320
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:11,791
I temporarily entrusted my responsibility

321
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:14,221
to your driver.

322
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,421
Entrusted?

323
00:32:20,821 --> 00:32:22,161
Basically you passed the buck.

324
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:26,581
I know that what happened can be misunderstood...

325
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:30,971
Entrusted. She said she entrusted.

326
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:35,381
I should've been responsible until the end.

327
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:39,441
I will make sure this doesn't happen again.

328
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:53,321
- It's a relief that you are not hurt. 
- What?

329
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:57,981
I was really concerned something happened to you.

330
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:00,761
I was acting mad just now out of revenge for making me concerned.

331
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:09,971
Now, let's keep what happened that day between us, and not tell Secretary Byeon.

332
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:12,671
Come in after ten seconds.

333
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:25,941
One second,

334
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:28,701
two seconds, three seconds...

335
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:32,451
Hello.

336
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:37,661
Oh thank you, thank you, thank you! Looks good!

337
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:40,631
I'll call you back later.

338
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:43,891
It's yummy.

  This letter first started in England and goes around the world once a year, providing good luck to its recipient. It has now reached you... 

341
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:58,051
  With some nice music  

342
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:00,491
  This is an announcement of the end of your mission.  

343
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:04,921
  As of today midnight, Operation White Rose will be dismantled.  

344
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:08,621
  As such, you mustn't carry out any additional work after that date.  

345
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:14,801
  If your identity is revealed after the termination, any affiliation with the agency will be denied.  

346
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:20,361
  You are advised to promptly withdraw from the scene within the time limit.

00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:23,061
  This message will be automatically deleted.  

348

What email are you looking at that's making you upset?

349
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:28,841
Spam mail.

350
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:32,471
There are still people who send Lucky Letter?

351
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:37,921
  But then don't you feel uneasy when you don't forward it?  

352
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,231
Pardon?

353
00:34:42,231 --> 00:34:46,981
I once received a lucky letter before and I didn't forward it.

354
00:34:46,981 --> 00:34:51,151
But then I got into a car accident and had to wear a cast on my leg.

355
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:52,841
I don't believe in superstition though.

356
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,471
Do you think people send them because they're superstitious? They do it just in case.

357
00:35:09,461 --> 00:35:11,181
Say ah.

358
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:19,261
What to do?

359
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:22,941
I'm not done paying the installments for this laptop.

360
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:29,991
I didn't get to show it to the team leader yet.

00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:42,121
  I wrote down the instruction in detail and stuck it on the fridge.

"I am speechless." Argh. That didn't feel right.

371
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:08,431
The handle of a millstone is called eoi, eoi.

372
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:11,491
If you were to turn the millstone

373
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,461
and the handle were to fall off,

374
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:17,371
we say that situation makes you speechless. 
  (T/N: literally, "has no eoi") 

375
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,391
I can't make it feel dynamic when I do this alone.

Let's see.

377
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:35,321
Wait. The person that made the mistake is not me, but her. Why do I have to call first?

378
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:38,271
I'm not going to do it, I can never do it!

379
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:51,941
If you're here to prostrate in apology,  know that I have no plan to forgive you—

380
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:54,501
I left something here.

381
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:57,661
- What? 
 - I'll leave as soon as I get it.

382
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:08,501
You came here just to pick up a note?

Why is it like this?

I am speechless, seriously.

387
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:27,711
You. You're leaving just like that?

388
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:32,621
I'll text you the instructions for the rice cooker.

389
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:35,121
This is mine.

390
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:38,381
I said I'll give you the instructions again.

391
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:41,121
Why are you taking something you already gave to me?

392
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:42,861
It was originally mine.

393
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:44,491
Taking after giving is really shameless.

394
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:47,371
I told you I'll give it to you again.

Do you want this?

399
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:09,721
I can't just give it to you either.

400

Try it.

401

If you weren't today's you, I would have forever not known what love is.

That's not the right feeling!

403

Put some feeling into it. Feeling.

404

Can't I just read the lines?

405
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,621
I'm not even an actress. I'm just helping you practice your lines.

406
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:41,591
That's the problem. When I have you looking like a robot in front of me,

Ultra Fine Dust. You have never dated, right?

413
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:05,001
There's no reason for me to answer any personal questions.

414
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:11,981
This line is like the first and the last time she says goodbye right before leaving the person she loves.

415
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:17,561
Of course. A dating noob like you can't possibly know this.

Thank you for teaching me how to love.

I'll stay behind.

You can leave first, Department Head.

428
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:52,071
Is today some kind of special day for you to volunteer working overtime?

429
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,991
Is it about time for you to resign?

430
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:57,531
You can head home now.

431
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:59,401
Sounds good to me.

432
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:04,571
If that's the case, tell CEO Yoon when he comes out.

434
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:10,031
No way. Did you already change your mind?

00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:13,311
I apologize for always leaving work exactly on time.

Don't tell me your desk will actually be cleared out when I come to work tomorrow.

439
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:26,851
If that's not the case, we're good.

00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:29,011
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

I think he ironed it like this...

442
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:51,231
If damn Pi Cheol Woong was going to quit, he should have transferred his duties to someone before quitting.

What's so important about this for her to come asking for it like that?

446
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:09,421
I mean. Did she really not have any better excuses?

447
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:12,271
She could have just sincerely apologized.

448
00:43:12,271 --> 00:43:14,951
She just had to come up with such a pathetic excuse using this lame piece of paper.

449
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:17,341
Did she think I'd be so naive as to believe it?

450
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:28,291
It'd be a pity to simply  give it back.

451

I should use it to have her at my back and call a few more times before giving it back.

 Known as celebrity Kang Woo Won's manager, Mr. Pi,

It's obviously Chan Mi and Mi Soon.

A bit strange.

00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,161
What... Did he remember something else?

472
00:44:43,161 --> 00:44:46,431
Rather than that, he usually

00:44:46,431 --> 00:44:48,311
glares at me like this

00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,861
but these days, he looks at me like this

475
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:53,511
and calls me whenever.

476
00:44:53,511 --> 00:44:56,281
When I get there after his calls, it turns out to be nothing.

477
00:44:56,281 --> 00:45:00,931
Then he finds some little thing to nitpick about and keep me from going home.

478
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:07,031
Ye Eun, tell me... Was So Hee's dad the first person you dated?

479
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:10,151
Yes. Why do you ask?

480
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:14,241
You're asking as to why Kang Woo Won is acting like that...

481
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:22,881
Never mind. If I say something

482
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:25,331
I'll have a hard time taking care of the aftermath later.

483
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:30,761
It's not good if he gets worse though.

484
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:07,001
If you couldn't trust me,

485
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:08,931
I would be disappointed.

486
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:11,241
Disappointed?

487
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:14,701
I put someone on his tail because you couldn't handle CEO Yoon.

488
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:18,271
Did you come here this late to complain about this?

489
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:22,931
Just as you have entrusted me with Il Gwang HiTech, on my own I would have—

490
00:46:22,931 --> 00:46:26,131
Did you choose to not tell me that Baek Chan Mi

491
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:31,621
and Yoon Seok Ho knew each other or did you not know?

492
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:38,521
If you didn't know, that means that you lack skills. If you did know but kept your mouth shut...

493
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,481
It's disgraceful.

494
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:48,931
I was going to tell you soon.

495
00:46:56,681 --> 00:46:59,601
That's why I can't quit smoking.

496
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:02,791
Because the ones below me can't do their job right.

497
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:06,731
So what was that? Disappointment?

498
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:09,371
I'm sorry.

499
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:13,771
If you do things like this, do you think I can continue to entrust you with the job?

500
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:15,681
Or not?

501
00:47:15,681 --> 00:47:20,691
If you keep doing this, do you think I can push you to be a president?!

502
00:47:20,691 --> 00:47:23,021
Or not?

503
00:47:26,171 --> 00:47:27,871
Answer?

504
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:33,561
I'll do it properly.

505
00:47:35,491 --> 00:47:37,351
Take your leave.

506
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:43,101
Don't take the elevator and get caught on camera.

507
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:45,861
Take the emergency stairs.

508
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:48,881
You should know to do that without me telling you, right?

509
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:51,321
After all, you're the director of the NIS.

510
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:12,331
She's so rude for someone who's hella younger than me.

511
00:48:14,121 --> 00:48:16,101
Ah!

512
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:18,731
Gosh, my knees.

513
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:27,471
Are you getting off of work?

514
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:32,161
Since the secretary didn't take care of her boss who was working late, he went hungry, you see.

515
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:34,841
I'm finally going out for dinner.

516
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:37,861
I'm sorry. Should I make a reservation at a restaurant nearby?

517
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:40,881
If not, I can quickly go out and buy it for you.

518
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:42,961
Let's go together.

519
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:46,101
- I'm sorry? 
 - You also starved.

520
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:51,881
If that's the case, buy me

521
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,661
something delicious, please.

522
00:48:56,481 --> 00:48:59,411
Eat a lot. I'm treating you because I'm thankful.

523
00:49:02,361 --> 00:49:06,451
I don't think I've much of a help all this time, though.

524
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:09,921
You kept me company on November 17.

525
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:11,841
Keeping you company

526
00:49:11,841 --> 00:49:14,661
is something anyone could have done.

527
00:49:16,191 --> 00:49:20,641
You staying next to me is a huge deal to me.

528
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:28,671
Everyone I thought of as important to me until now has left.

529
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,301
Each and every one of them.

530
00:49:48,901 --> 00:49:53,351
  Give me a minute. I'll leave once I see his face.  

531
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:58,601
  With the termination of your contract, private meetings are no more allowed. I'm sure you have signed that oath. 

532
00:49:58,601 --> 00:50:02,391
  I'm meeting him as a brother-like friend. Not as my tutoring student.  

533
00:50:02,391 --> 00:50:04,691
  That is all the more reason for me to not allow you.  

534
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:06,341
  Please leave.  

535
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:13,871
  Seok Ho  

536
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:19,611
♫   I was walking with a vacant look   ♫

537
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:25,771
♫   and stopped in my tracks   ♫

538
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:30,771
♫   After staring for a while   ♫

539
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:34,801
♫   Tears rolled down my cheeks   ♫

540
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:40,941
♫  You’re doing well, right?  ♫

541
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:45,841
♫  Today feels cozy as spring  ♫

542
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:50,741
♫  I look back on that day  ♫

543
00:50:50,741 --> 00:50:55,811
♫  And softly close my eyes  ♫

544
00:51:16,211 --> 00:51:18,241
When it comes to relationships with people,

545
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:22,251
meeting someone means that you could also part with them.

546
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:30,701
My mom passed away as she was sick.

547
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:34,421
My father suddenly left this world.

548
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:39,991
The person I trusted in the most also

549
00:51:41,251 --> 00:51:43,241
left first.

550
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:59,941
Secretary Baek, don't do such a thing as disappearing from my sight.

551
00:51:59,941 --> 00:52:04,211
But I'm a contract worker anyway.

552
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:07,771
I'll believe that you will never do that.

553
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:17,901
Aigoo. You're all working hard.

554
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:21,541
Department Head. You didn't have to do this.

555
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:23,091
You're the only one

556
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:24,771
that takes care of our security department.

557
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:26,261
Wow.

558
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:28,491
He sure is stabbing me for not being able to take care of you all these days.

559
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:30,561
Exactly, come by more often.

560
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:33,911
We can't go look for you up there. You should come down.

561
00:52:33,911 --> 00:52:37,041
Sure. On payday next month, I won't forget

562
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:39,761
- to come down either. 
 - I love you.

563
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:42,561
- Alright, let's eat. Let's eat. 
 - Yes, go ahead and eat.

564
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:45,391
What do we have here?

565
00:52:45,391 --> 00:52:48,661
Let's eat. Wow. We got pig trotters, pizza.

566
00:52:48,661 --> 00:52:52,251
and chicken. Wow. There's a lot of food. 
   Cam84: Executive Director office 

567
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:53,771
What are you doing? Let's eat together.

568
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:56,761
Don't mind me. I came after eating.

569
00:52:56,761 --> 00:52:58,521
You should hand out the cups

570
00:52:58,521 --> 00:53:02,091
and pour out the drinks instead of just standing.

571
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:04,521
I got it. I got it. Eat. Eat.

572
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:06,781
Let's eat!

573
00:53:09,581 --> 00:53:11,261
 Restricted Caller ID  

574
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:16,051
That's also spam right?

575
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:18,501
I told you to block the number.

576
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:22,101
Hello?

577
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:27,511
The moment you trace the call, I'm hanging up so just listen.

578
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:30,661
Give me a moment.

579
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,711
The executives' office is bustling until late into the night.

580
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:42,721
It's because they are executives.

581
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:44,531
Executives are temporary workers of some kind.

582
00:53:44,531 --> 00:53:46,991
To not get fired, they must work until late.

583
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:49,261
- Isn't that right? 
 - Of course.

584
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:51,261
Executive Director Myeong's room is empty though.

585
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,911
With Executive Director Myeong, it's on the dot.

586
00:53:52,911 --> 00:53:56,601
He comes to work three hours earlier than everyone, but leaves on the dot.

587
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:00,701
Then the secretary must be tired, taking care of things from the morning.

588
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:03,981
Is there anything to take care of? That man takes care of his own documents.

589
00:54:03,981 --> 00:54:06,261
And even his door opens by itself, like "open sesame!"

590
00:54:06,261 --> 00:54:08,101
Open sesame?

591
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:11,911
Let me show you.

592
00:54:12,491 --> 00:54:15,231
Look at Executive Director Myeong's door closely.

593
00:54:15,861 --> 00:54:18,651
It doesn't even have any security system at all.

594
00:54:19,481 --> 00:54:22,521
How does he get in then?

595
00:54:22,521 --> 00:54:25,641
- I don't know. 
 - I'm sure there's got to be a way.

596
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:28,331
Be it opening with a key or scanning a pass.

597
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:29,751
Let's see.

598
00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:34,441
Look look look.

599
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:36,851
Open sesame!

600
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:40,701
Wow. That's fascinating.

601
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:43,431
Not anyone can go in then, right?

602
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,651
There actually is just one person who can go in.

603
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:49,871
Who is that?

604
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,291
Division Director Tak?

605
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:54,281
 Why do you think I didn't tell Executive Director Myeong about you 

606
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:56,941
 despite knowing that you were part of the NIS? 

607
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:58,531
Why did you do that?

608
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:01,551
For insurance, to be ready for a time like this.

609
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:05,991
But what should I do? That insurance has already been terminated.

610
00:55:05,991 --> 00:55:09,171
I'm aware of that. That's why I was thinking that between us abandoned people,

611
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:12,421
we could make a deal that would benefit each of us.

612
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:14,211
Show me the card you have first.

613
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:17,241
I need to see them in order to get a feel of whether I should make a deal or not.

614
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:19,581
My cards are definite.

615
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:23,471
To be honest, I went to kill Pi Cheol Woong

616
00:55:23,471 --> 00:55:25,881
but saw something interesting.

617
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:16,481
You're saying that you weren't the one who killed him?

618
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:19,761
 If you can't trust me, go ahead and check it out. 

619
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:30,381
What do you want?

620
00:56:32,631 --> 00:56:34,781
Oh, how did she get in?

621
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:37,681
She was hired externally and comes in once a week.

622
00:56:37,681 --> 00:56:40,111
Executive Director Myeong personally hired her.

623
00:56:40,111 --> 00:56:43,361
I'm sure that ajumma is the only one who knows how to enter.

624
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:47,881
But why are you curious about the door to Executive Director Myeong's office?

625
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:54,611
I am seriously considering whether we should install that system

626
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:58,091
for our CEO's office as well. Yes.

627
00:57:00,261 --> 00:57:05,641
Can I see that ajumma enter the door on another day?

628
00:57:05,641 --> 00:57:08,291
- That... why? 
 - I mean,

629
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:12,131
- I should check that the system works well, that it doesn't break down. 
 - To check?

630
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:13,701
Yes.

631
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,301
Okay. Let's see, let's see.

632
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,161
It's not opening.

633
00:57:26,161 --> 00:57:29,311
- It's not opening. 
 - Was it out of order?

634
00:57:30,751 --> 00:57:33,861
Wait. Can you go back a bit?

635
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:48,111
 Executive Director Myeong's ledger. 

636
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:50,391
Ledger?

637
00:57:50,391 --> 00:57:54,051
The ledger that Executive Director Myeong hid in his safe. Bring it to me.

638
00:57:54,051 --> 00:57:56,661
I'm leaving Il Gwang HiTech tomorrow.

639
00:57:56,661 --> 00:57:58,981
How am I supposed to bring it to you?

640
00:57:59,731 --> 00:58:01,991
You should figure out the method by yourself.

641
00:58:01,991 --> 00:58:04,681
Don't you want to catch Michael?

642
00:58:05,671 --> 00:58:07,611
Michael?

643
00:58:21,691 --> 00:58:26,341
Don't tell me, the culprit Is Michael?

644
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:29,861
 He said it himself just before he killed him. 

645
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:34,151
 But do you know what's more interesting? He's by your side. 

646
00:58:34,151 --> 00:58:36,401
 Somewhere extremely nearby. 

647
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:40,661
What are you saying? By my side?

648
00:58:40,661 --> 00:58:44,231
 If you want to know, get the ledger out. I'll contact you again. 

649
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:46,141
Wait a minute.

650
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:56,971
I was worried that you had suddenly disappeared like the last time.

651
00:58:58,161 --> 00:59:00,561
I got an urgent call.

652
00:59:03,921 --> 00:59:06,551
Your face is pale.

653
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:08,661
I'm fine.

654
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:12,861
The rice cake ramen is already soggy.

655
00:59:12,861 --> 00:59:14,761
Let's eat some next time instead.

656
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:25,121
  First, Yoon Seok Ho isn't a child.  

657
00:59:25,121 --> 00:59:27,991
  Second, you're the one with a bias.  

658
00:59:27,991 --> 00:59:31,271
  Your certainty that Yoon Seok Ho will not do something bad. 

659
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:34,861
  On what grounds is it? With what evidence?  

660
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:54,681
 I'm in front of your house. Come out right now. 

661
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:31,111
-  If you don't come out right now, I'm going to force my way in.  
 - I'm coming,

662
01:00:31,111 --> 01:00:33,101
I'm coming out.

663
01:00:47,471 --> 01:00:50,011
This woman really, she has to step on me, doesn't she?

664
01:00:51,571 --> 01:00:55,441
Wait up. Where is she going in the middle of the night?

665
01:01:10,691 --> 01:01:14,421
Are you crazy? How can you come find me at my house?

666
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:17,351
What is this?

667
01:01:17,351 --> 01:01:19,641
What's going on?

668
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:29,811
I was contacted by Division Director Tak.

669
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,491
What was with that jerk?

670
01:01:31,491 --> 01:01:35,421
To make a deal on his sentence? Is he saying he'll stow himself away to somewhere?

671
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:41,291
Division Director Tak apparently has a video of Michael killing Pi Cheol Woong.

672
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:43,751
Michael is the one who killed Pi Cheol Woong?

673
01:01:43,751 --> 01:01:47,701
Division Director Tak offered a deal.

674
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:51,821
Executive Director Myeong must have a ledger, apparently.

675
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:57,221
If we bring him the ledger, he said he would hand over the video.

676
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:01,701
You don't believe a murderer's words, do you?

677
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:05,451
And on the very slim chance that it's true?

678
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:09,551
What if Michael really killed Pi Cheol Woong

679
01:02:09,551 --> 01:02:11,711
and dismantled out team?

680
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:16,081
What? That means

681
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:19,781
that the culprit's final target is us?

682
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:23,321
Are you perhaps suspicious of Director Seo?

683
01:02:23,321 --> 01:02:25,801
It's not suspicion.

684
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:27,821
It's certainty.

685
01:03:06,651 --> 01:03:08,831
Agent Baek Chan Mi

686
01:03:09,981 --> 01:03:11,571
said that tomorrow,

687
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,551
she will steal the ledger.

688
01:03:15,551 --> 01:03:20,761

You're going to rob Executive Director Myeong's office?

698
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:49,921
That means we need to steal Executive Director Myeong's sensor that allows entry.

699
01:03:49,921 --> 01:03:54,101
- You must return all the equipment. 
 - We have no choice but to go the analog way.

 - If I knew you weren't a normal secretary,

701
01:03:56,481 --> 01:03:58,331
I would have gotten rid of you earlier.

702
01:03:58,331 --> 01:03:59,541
This is only the beginning.

 - Finish up in three minutes.

706
01:04:05,231 --> 01:04:07,181
- Turn on the backup generators. 
 - The security team is here.

707
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:09,501
Come out quickly. Hurry!

708
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:14,491
You're saying my secretary robbed Executive Director's office?

  Epilogue  

710
01:04:43,771 --> 01:04:46,281

713

 Achilles heel: In the past, Im Ye Eun was Kwon Min Seok's girlfriend. At the time of So Hee's birth, Kwon Min Seok passed away.  

714
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:43,421
Kwon Min Seok?
