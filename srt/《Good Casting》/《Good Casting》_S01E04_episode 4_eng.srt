00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,390
 Episode 4 

2
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:50,070


3
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,010
  Identification card - Baek Jang Mi  

4
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,290
  Secretary Baek Jang Mi's real name is Baek Chan Mi. 

5
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,360
Name, Baek Chan Mi. Age, 38.

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,480
  Affiliated with the NIS Industrial Security Team Three.   
    

7
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,860
 Relieved from duty three years ago after failing in the apprehension of Michael. 

8
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,520
  Agent Gwon Min Seok, who was her immediate subordinate at the time, died then.  

9
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,060
I didn't hear a proper introduction from the new secretary. Your name is?

10
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,740
They call me Baek Jang Mi.

11
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,740
 HQ VP Tak Sang Gi 

12
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,650
Nice.

13
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,520
Yeah, you must live a long life.

14
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,690
I'm seriously going to go crazy.

15
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,490
  Division Director Tak will arrive within three minutes.  

16
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:07,560
I heard you are an experienced employee. What did you do before?

17
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,370
You must have a lot of time on your hands these days, seeing that you're taking interest in irrelevant things.

18
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,510
You two looked so close, so it made me curious

19
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,010
if there was a backstory I wasn't aware of.

20
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,100
I'm not interested in things like your backstory with Executive Director Myeong, though. Should I slowly take an interest in it?

21
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,490
I'm starting to get curious all of a sudden.

22
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,420
Let's go.

23
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,810
They said he was a scarecrow of a CEO and now he's got a crow.

24
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,410
How interesting.

25
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,880
Why did this thing have to break? These things should be eat— Oh.

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,800
Does he only feed himself with red ginseng?

27
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,980
  From Baek Wacko Chan Mi: Division Director Tak will arrive within three minutes.  

28
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,020
One, two, three, four, five...

29
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,600
I searched everywhere but nothing comes out.

30
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,280
What in the world did she want me to find?

31
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,880
I can only find something if there's something to find.

32
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,730
Women

33
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,640
Fifteenth, at 8 pm. Red Purple?

34
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,790
I looked into it, and Red Purple is a wine bar managed as a private club.

35
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:02,170
Membership works on the basis of reservation, and they thoroughly protect the members' privacy.

36
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,370
So that means he secretly met someone there.

37
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,880
But why are you suddenly fixed on Division Director Tak?

38
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,430
Division Director Tak might be Michael.

39
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,730
Division Director Tak?

40
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,700
If he is Michael, with an offer, he had a meeting with someone.

41
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,550
Then, couldn't he have had a transaction at Red Purple?

42
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,540
Let's get the CCTV.

43
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,230
They start business at seven, so let's move as soon as we get off work.

44
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,930
  Top Secret -  Code name 'Good Casting' 

45
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,080
  Good Casting

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,100
  Il Gwang HiTech

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,350

  Club Diary / Gangnam - Red Purple 
 DJ Yuyamuya "Detective Lover" April 4th  

49
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,930
  First club of my life "Red Purple" 
 Gangnam clubs Top 3 "Red Purple"  

50
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,250
  This is a welcome gift. Like a bribe for you to stay for a long time. 

51
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,630
Cute. Cute.

52
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,770
  Screech  

53
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,020
  O-oh! My bag!  

54
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,540
   Oh my! His hands... on her chest... @ㅁ@  

55
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,050
 Pow! -_-^  

56
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,150
Say hello. This is your new tutor.

57
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,530
  If there's a scar on a handsome face, it's less handsome.  

58
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,710
  Stay still. -_-  This small hand of mine has a punch that stings.  

59
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,880
  Let's work well together in the future! Yoon Seok Ho! ^O^ 

60
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,690
  I love you~♥︎   I love you~♥︎   &gt;_&lt;  

61
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,120
6:00 pm!

62
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,300
I'm just asking just in case, but—

63
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,970
I'll be getting off of work now

64
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,820
That toy, that toy, that...

65
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,460
What were you doing?

66
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,020
This... this... this doesn't work very well these days. You know?

67
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,690
Recently, the office equipment has been a mess as well.

68
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,280
There's the issue with the bookcase rail, too.

69
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,890
There are times when it doesn't work.

70
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,320
Did the new secretary take off?

71
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,680
Yes. She very courageously got off work on the dot.

72
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,060
If there's something you need her to do, should I call her back?

73
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,550
No, there's no need. What are you going to do if she quits because we give her too much work?

74
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,360
This guy.

75
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,790
What?

76
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,610
What?

77
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,360
We'll just continue to pretend we don't know anything.

78
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,940
"Kang Woo Won's fan signing event in Taipei for the celebration of the new product launch."

79
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,310
Everything I sign causes me to lose money, geez,

80
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,890
but someone gets money from signing.

81
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm jealous.

82
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,810
They say that Kang Woo Won is the hottest star in China and Taiwan these days.

83
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,530
It does deserve three times the original contract fee.

84
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,460
I think everything's just about done

85
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,430
What do we do? I think it's going to overflow.

86
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,680
Hyung, since you always waste your brain on such stupid concerns, that's why your head isn't working.

87
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,390
Just pack another bag! Then it's all good!

88
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,200
Right. We can pack another bag.

89
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,560
No, no. It'd be better to pack the shoes separately.

90
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,080
You're planning to take three suitcases?

91
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,940
You can't even do addition?

92
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,910
Two bags for clothes, one bag for shoes,

93
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,850
and my food.

94
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,780
You forgot my mukbang bag. Mukbang bag. Don't you see?

95
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,270
I was going to pack that at the very end.

96
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,070
I'll pack that when I've finished organizing all the luggage.

97
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,860
You can't pack luggage, can't calculate, and sulk easily.

98
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,040
What is it that you're good at?

99
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,640
Gosh! That son of...

100
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,630
  Restricted caller identification  

101
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,060
By 9 pm tonight,

102
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,040
  get the item from locker 7-49.  

103
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,760
  When you arrive in Taiwan, Wang Kai will get in touch with you.  

104
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,180
  You just have to meet him and give him the goods.  

105
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,350
Taiwan, my foot.

106
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,590
I can finally escape my shitty life.

107
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,700
I don't know what it is, but I'm sure it's more expensive than the delivery fee.

108
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,380
 Red Purple 

109
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,720
 Ssak Ssak 

110
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,290
As soon as you enter Red Purple, Hwang Mi Soon will stick the hacking chip in the security system,

111
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,990
 and Moo Hyeok will hack the CCTV. 

112
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,330
 Bae Moo Hyeok 

113
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,200
 Baek Chan Mi gets all worthwhile information.
  

114
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,980
 It's easier than eating rice cake lying down (pie), so let's finish within 10 minutes. 

115
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,270
 Enter. 

116
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,560
  Mission Clear!  

117
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,470
It's the two of us together for the first time in a while.

118
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,570
Then shall we slowly start to pick at Division Director Tak now?

119
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,280
Wait.

120
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,040
Put them in.

121
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,390
Hide Baek Chan Mi for the time being.

122
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,960
Let's wait a bit before reporting it to Executive Director Myeong.

123
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,910
We caught this joker card.

124
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,690
I'm sure we'll find her handy sometime.

125
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,590
  Your call cannot be connected, please leave a— 

126
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,140
I cannot get in touch with Pi Cheol Woong.

127
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,710
What are you talking about?

128
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,480
Seeing that he completely turned off his phone,

129
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,260
I think he was resolved to go into hiding.

130
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,310
Check his location.

131
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,510
What is this?

132
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,910
Did I see wrong? I think it sparkled.

133
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,040
He is still in Kang Woo Won's house.

134
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,820
Go catch him right away, before he runs off.

135
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,890
  Kang Woo Won said this.  

136
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,380
  That for this advertising contract,  

137
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,160
  he wanted you to be the one to discuss it with him.  

138
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,500
Her character is that of a total loser.

139
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,620
Exactly the type I don't like.

140
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,220
Let's add one more condition.

141
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,410
Then you're saying you'll sign, right?

142
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,930
I didn't say I'd sign yet.

143
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,890
No matter what condition it is,

144
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,260
we are ready to oblige.

145
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,930
It's me. I received the contract well.

146
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,110
Let's make one amendment.

147
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,370
Article four, section five.

148
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,730
On any future event in relation to the advertisement,

149
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,260
Article four, section five.

150
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,810
the advertising company's employee in charge will be...

151
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,310
- What's your name? 
 - Pardon?

152
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,260
Your name. What is it?

153
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,840
It's Im Jeong Eun.

154
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,820
The employee in charge will be Im Jeong Eun. I'm hanging up.

155
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,820
What?!

156
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,850
I'm telling you to come take care of the filming site yourself every time a product from Il Gwang HiTech is being shown.

157
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,960
What? Can you not do it?

158
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,490
No, I must do it.

159
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,160
I will do it unconditionally.

160
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,860
And most importantly,

161
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,890
hand me the pictures.

162
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,130
What pictures?

163
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,080
Do you think I'll just let it slide if you feign innocence?

164
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,060
The pictures you took last time!

165
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,010
Why do you have so many baby pictures?

166
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,160
I never took any pictures of you and there will never be any reason to.

167
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,300
I don't even want to take them.

168
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,220
You go through my own private things, as you please!

169
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,820
That's very rude, you know!

170
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,330
Since I checked that you don't have any pictures,

171
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,520
let's terminate this contract.

172
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,560
 If you can't, it's over. 

173
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,930
 
  End. You know? 

174
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,780
  
 The End. 

175
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,490
Why aren't they coming?

176
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,950
- He's here, he's here. 
 - What?

177
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,510
 Great Wall 

178
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,830
Where is it?

179
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,640
- Why are you so late?
 - Geez

180
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,470
Gosh.

181
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,850
Here.

182
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,320
The receipt.

183
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,420
Gosh. Give it back, I'm not selling it to you.

184
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,940
Gosh, why? Never mind.

185
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,230
Where are the danmuji (pickled daikon)?

186
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,040
Gosh!

187
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,810
Gosh, the danmuji...

188
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,470
Hey, you should at least give us danmuji!

189
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,680
Danmuji! Danmuji! Danmuji!

190
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,480
Danmuji!

191
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,270
Gosh, as a human,

192
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,580
he should give us sweet radish.

193
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,030
Hey, press the mic.

194
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,090
Hey, Baek Chan Mi, Hwang Mi Soon!

195
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,050
Come out before we finish eating this jajangmyeon.

196
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,000
Five minutes are enough.

197
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,790
Let's go.

198
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,470
Please go back.

199
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,340
Me? To where?

200
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,210
You're being too hard. It's not like we come here just once or twice.

201
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,070
I think it's our first time seeing you.

202
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:20,520
Oppa, are you acting like this because you don't know that a girl's face changes all the time?

203
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,680
- Keep up the hard work.
 - For her it's her nose. For me.

204
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,470
Gosh, I'm getting annoyed. What's up with this.

205
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,450
We'll see each other again.

206
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:00,100
In the good old days, I'd just have to play the geomungo (6-string Korean zither) and they'd all fall, even the Russian minister of defense. What do they take me for?

207
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,090
What is this?

208
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:12,330
Well, I heard you were lacking in staff since it's Friday night. So I came to help in the kitchen.

209
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,820
Asking confirmation for the entrance of kitchen help.

210
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,680
I'm telling you it's true.

211
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,970
How many times do I have to tell you it's true?

212
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,830
People really lack trust toward others.

213
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,480
That's a big problem really.

214
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,080
I think Baek Chan Mi got in,

215
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,560
but where's Hwang Mi Soon?

216
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,230
Hey, Hwang Mi Soon!

217
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,060
Hwang Mi Soon!

218
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,160
On standby in the seventh-floor kitchen.

219
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:21,360
Ajumma! There are seven fruit tapas to prepare. Hurry up, quickly.

220
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,850
Okay, I'm on it! Quickly, quickly.

221
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,370
Why are you coming out so late? We need to get it to them soon!

222
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,350
- Bring some snacks before they run out of drinks.
 - Yes, undestood.

223
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,240
- Oppas! 
 - Who are you?

224
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,420
My treat.

225
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,650
You must be tired. Take it easy.

226
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,360
You should eat first.

227
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,270
Gosh, what is all this?

228
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,500
Hey, but why are the guys out back not responding?

229
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,270
I don't know either.

230
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,550
Go check, you punk.

231
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,360
What the hell are you waiting for?

232
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,830
Gosh, why do you always pick on me?

233
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,330
Oppas, keep up the good work!

234
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,120
You too.

235
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,910
It's five meters ahead of the fourth floor emergency staircase exit.

236
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,270
Staff Only

237
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,950
There should be a door next to the boiler room that says "Emergency Exit" on it.

238
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,310
  Boiler Room  

239
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,060
  Emergency Exit  

240
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,100
- General Manager Park, it was good today, right? 
 - Oh, yes.

241
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,690
- Oh, Madam Lee. Thank you for the food. 
 - Did you have a good time?

242
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,120
Red Purple

243
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,020
Oct. 2019

244
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,810
Sept. 2019

245
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,770
  Division Director Tak Sang Gi.   
    

246
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,380
HDLive

247
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,940
I put the flag in.

248
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,640
Oh!

249
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,960
- Yessir. I'll wave the flag in two minutes.
 - Good, good.

250
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,720
- If we had Sunbae Ye Eun with us, it would have taken her less than a minute.
 - Sure.

251
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,440
  When you get into Kang Woo Won's house, try to take the opportunity,  

252
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,700
  - and secure the surveillance cameras. 
 - Secure them?  

253
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,320
  Since it's not open circuit, we have no choice but for someone to go in.  

254
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,730
 But isn't this like surveillance of ordinary civilians?  

255
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,030
 Exactly, so just get the CCTVs outside. 

256
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,150
 What, you can't do it? 

257
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,550
 I have to do it. I'll do it. 

258
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,980
Secure Network

259
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,940
I got it!

260
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,640
Hey, you can't take that! Come back. Come back!

261
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:14,750
Which one, which one, which one should I eat? Guess. Ding dong daeng dong!

262
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,830
What a great job my manager's doing, leaving his main celebrity without even feeding him.

263
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,280
What kind of manager is busier than a top star?

264
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,220
Hey, what is that?

265
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,860
Where'd you get it?

266
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,180
Poppy! You'll get sick if you play with dirty things!

267
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,450
Poppy! Poppy!

268
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,110
Come on, let's go home.

269
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,700
What is that?

270
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,950
  Son of a X - Go broke - Nutcase - X personality - Inconsiderate X - See if you live well.  

271
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,420
  You crazy nutcase jerk, I'm quitting.  

272
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,820
 Have a good life! 

273
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,820
AHHHH!

274
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,010
That crazy...

275
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,090
Th-Th-Thief.

276
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,080
A th-thief!

277
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,750
I don't care how you do it, but bring Pi Cheol Woong in front of me right now!

278
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,800
It's the person you hired, CEO!

279
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,760
How would I know where he ran off to?

280
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,830
He ruined my precious zoom-zooms...

281
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,980
I won't go to Taiwan event until they are returned to their original state.

282
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,790
I'm hanging up.

283
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,130
Gosh, what else isn't going right?

284
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,360
What's the problem?

285
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,300
Ah, it's all in English, dammit.

286
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:20,080
It's finally working. But only this much came out.

287
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,720
Gosh, you scared me.

288
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,000
Is she crazy?

289
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,270
Now she's sneaking into my house?

290
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,440
Okay, sure.

291
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,680
You're dead.

292
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:54,020
Hello? This is 112, right?

293
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,440
Someone trespassed here.

294
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,440
B-B-Behind you!

295
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,170
Yes, the address is—

296
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,830
What do I do?

297
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,950
68GA-3877

298
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,980
Six, eight, GA, three, eight, seven, seven.

299
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,340
Six, eight, GA, three, eight, seven, seven. Six, six, eight...

300
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,820
Gosh, what was it, again?

301
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,170
What are you talking about? A girl?

302
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,390
Did that girl see everything too?

303
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,900
Bring her too.

304
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,700
 68 GA 3877 

305
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,280
It's okay. It's okay.

306
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,580
Asleep or awake, be careful of your left, your right, your front, and your back.

307
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,240
It's me.

308
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,140
I caught Pi Cheol Woong and that woman.

309
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,340
Bring them to the abandoned factory. I'll go there right away.

310
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,440
 Connected - Access CCTV data 

311
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,270
Okay, finished hacking.

312
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,340
Noonims you can exit the mission, now.

313
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,730
Why isn't Im Ye Eun answering her phone?

314
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,270
Come on, Sunbae. Stop hassling Seonbae Ye Eun.

315
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,490
Data analysis can't be done in a few seconds within a blink of an eye.

316
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,260
Right. Even if it would've taken a year or twelve months,

317
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,380
I should have made you do all the gruntwork, right?

318
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,210
Just backing up the ladies is making my spine distort (he's that burdened).

319
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,270
Oh, why is my stomach hurting so much? I'll go to the bathroom really quick.

320
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,350
Ouch. The bathroom.

321
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,860
 Ssak Ssak Clean - Whatever it is, we clean it all up for you!  

322
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,420
Dammit.

323
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,060
Gosh, where is this punk?

324
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,300
We have a problem!

325
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,990
What?

326
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,780
Block off all exits!

327
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,710
Get her!

328
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,020
Ah!

329
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,120
  68 GA 3877 

330
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,510
Help me with this please.

331
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:23,860
  If you press the button here for more than three seconds during an emergency, it'll be a code blue. 

332
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,170
Hey, do you really want to die?

333
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,780
Gosh, I should be saying that!

334
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,050
Hey. Hey!

335
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,640
Aish. It's taking him such a long time to poop.

336
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,610
Do I need to be doing this at this age?

337
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,350
 Im Ye Eun  

338
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,650
Huh? Code blue.

339
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,080
Damn it, no wonder you haven't been answering the phone.

340
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,470
Hey, Baek Chan Mi, Hwang Mi Soon, Im Ye Eun's code blue popped up!

341
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,800
Hurry up!

342
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,830
Baek Chan Mi! Hwang Mi Soon!

343
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,530
Hey!

344
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,070
Hey, come here!

345
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,080
 Open the door! 

346
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,640
The keys, the keys!

347
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,610
It's open!

348
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,710
Hey! Get her!

349
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,740
Ow!

350
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,630
Whoa!

351
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,200
It's too late! It's all the way down!

352
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,230
Please, please, please!

353
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,910
Hey! Gosh! Get her!

354
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,670
Woohoo!

355
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,130
red purple

356
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:54,530
Oh my gosh that scared me.

357
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,860
Why do I always have to do this kind of thing?

358
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,200
Aigo, for the second time,

359
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,330
I'm sorry. Let's go.

360
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,850
Hey! What are you doing? Go get her!

361
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,090
Go the other way!

362
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,370
Ssak Ssak Clean

363
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,970
Why are you so late?

364
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,430
- Go on, go, go, get driving. Quick.  
 - What? What, what's going on?

365
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,370
 I almost died! 

366
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:26,480
Hey, Team Leader Dong. For this one, it's a matter of good conscience that we should get quadruple the hazard pay.

367
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,890
Let me see the videos you got first.

368
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,280
But why are you driving?

369
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,050
Ask Moo Hyuk when you see him!

370
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,560
It was 8:30 PM on the 15th, so start playing at 8.

371
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,540
8...

372
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,240
Team Leader! What happened?

373
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,560
He didn't leave me, right?

374
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,890
What is this. What is this. What is this?

375
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,370
Where are they?

376
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:33,580
Sir, give me the plates!

377
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,620
I'm someone from there. 
   Bae Moo Hyeok - NIS 

378
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,850
I'm busy so let's go.

379
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,180
- You're from the NIS, Ajussi? 
 - Yes, yes.

380
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,460
Wow! Put on the helmet from the back!

381
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:50,840
Even the NIS has to wear a helmet. Hold on tight!

382
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,700
Okay, let's go!

383
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:58,650
What's this? It wasn't Kang Woo Won but his manager?

384
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:01,170
- Pi Cheol Woong is a Chinese expatriate.
 - Dammit.

385
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,400
Our guess was totally wrong, dammit.

386
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,520
Wait. The fact that Division Director Tak met Pi Cheol Woong...

387
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,870
That must mean that Pi Cheol Woong has the item.

388
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:14,970
But where are we going right now?

389
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,650
Sir, where are we going?

390
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,180
Over there! Over there!

391
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,080
O-O-O-Over... Follow that car!

392
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,720
As for me, it is so exciting!

393
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,440
Ssak Ssak Clean

394
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,050
Im Ye Eun's in code blue? What happened?

395
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,790
I don't know. She said she'd go meet Kang Woo Won.

396
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,330
Could it be that things blew up because of Pi Cheol Woong?

397
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,270
Hold on tight for a little bit, Im Ye Eun.

398
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,360
Go left from here. Left.

399
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,120
What are you talking about? Follow the GPS's instructions!

400
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,370
Hurry and go to the left!

401
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,780
- No, follow the GPS! It's right! 
 - Left!

402
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,840
Gosh, you're noisy. Be quiet!

403
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,320
Go left from here! Left!

404
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,370
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

405
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,810
- I can see! 
 - Are you just going to see? Step on it!

406
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,390
- Step on what? 
 - I'll just do it.

407
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,810
- No! No! 
 - Hey!

408
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,120
Your driving license has been suspended!

409
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,830
- It's for official duty, so it's fine. I'll just do it. 
 - Hey hey hey!

410
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,090
- Let go. 
 - If we get in trouble, insurance won't cover it!

411
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,940
- I'll do it! I can't just watch! 
 - I said no!

412
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,560
Let go!

413
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,670
Let go of me!

414
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,400
- Stop it, be quiet! 
 - Turn right!

415
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,010
Let me do it!

416
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,230
- Why are you doing this to me?  
 - Come here, you.

417
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,290
Ah really.

418
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,530
Ssak Ssak Clean

419
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,390
Is that the scale of the NIS? We don't even have the money for HIpass (wireless toll pass system)!

420
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:51,400
To get that, we have to request it by submitting a draft plan. Anyway, it's too complicated.

421
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,690
What if they slip through our fingers because of this?

422
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:57,310
Seeing that they're going toward Pocheon, it's the way to the abandoned factory.

423
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,190
Let's go.

424
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,060
What is that?

425
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,660
Team Leader! It's me!

426
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,950
Open the door!

427
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,670
- Team Leader. 
 - What's this?

428
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,500
This little. Hey, you! Damn it.

429
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:37,580
Where were you this whole time?

430
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,620
What?

431
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,520
Hey, keep following our truck!

432
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,910
I can't hear anything you're saying!

433
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,470
Follow us! Follow us!

434
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,710
Follow us!

435
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,270
What... what's wrong with you?

436
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:50,450
What are you doing?

437
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,640
Let go!
 Hey!

438
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,990
- Ajussi!
 - I said let go of me!

439
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,260
What did you say?

440
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,550
Ajumma! Ajumma, ajumma!

441
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,140
Hey, you brat!

442
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,310
Are you out of your mind? Let go!

443
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,930
Hey, the car! The car!

444
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,320
What are you two looking at?

445
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,430
Did you see? They flinched!

446
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,980
Pi Cheol Woong.

447
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,200
  Pi Cheol Woong? 

448
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,020
It's not me. It's not me!

449
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,130
When stealing someone's item, you must have at least put your neck on the line.

450
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,010
  No! I'm not Pi Cheol Woong! 

451
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:42,570
Say something!

452
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,280
  Hey! This is worth a hundred million won (≈$100K), you scum!  

453
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,750
You son of a..

454
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,400
Ssak Ssak Clean

455
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,910
I reported for reinforcements, so keep watch from outside.

456
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,150
I'm saying this in advance but if Michael's in here,

457
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,550
he's all mine no matter what.

458
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:43,460
I get how you feel about Michael. But I'm saying this again, we're in the middle of an operation.

459
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,340
I won't tolerate anyone diverging from the playbook.

460
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,600
You're so freaking loud.

461
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,510
Sunbaenim!

462
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,090
Hey!

463
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,160
What are they?

464
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,210
Just some little girls.

465
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,950
Sunbaenim!

466
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,140
Im Ye Eun!

467
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,640
You are all dead today.

468
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,190
Let go! You won't?

469
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:14,490
-  There! 
- Aish.

470
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,030
Sunbaenim! Over there!

471
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,650
Are you okay?

472
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,410
How long have you been lying down?

473
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,590
Sunbaenim.

474
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,980
I don't normally take this out, but

475
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:38,580
for a guy who bothered one of our teammates, a bullet doesn't seem too bad too use.

476
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:42,380
Oh, sorry. You're not a guy.

477
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:57,000


478
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:08,170
  Epilogue

00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,180
  Kang Woo Won said this.  

480
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:17,450
  For this advertising contract, he wanted you to be the one to discuss it with him.  

481
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,790
Hello, Mr. Kang Woo Won.

482
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:32,840
I came from Il Gwang HiTech, my name is Im Ye—

483
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,290
No, Im Jeong Eun.

484
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,640
You're surprised, right?

485
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,530
Her character is the kind that gives a real headache.

486
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,760
She's exactly the type I don't like.

487
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:53,200
Is this too fake?

488
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,990
I am Im Jeong Eun from the advertising planning team.

489
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,720
I heard you called me.

490
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,730
Yeah. I did. So what?

491
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:05,130
I always trusted that a top star such as Kang Woo Won wouldn't be so sullen

492
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:10,490
as to nullify the contract over such a small happening.

493
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:13,260
What? A small happening?

494
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:17,560
I mean, it's not like I made a mistake because I wanted to.

495
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:22,460
It happened while I was trying really hard.

496
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:28,230
How can anyone have consideration the size of a pea that they would increase their contract fee quadruple!

497
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,490
You should have a bit of empathy for the past times.

498
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,120
Wow, you've gone crazy insane!

499
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:46,800
I can't even make a sound when I'm in front of him, and here I am bluffing.

500
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,630
No matter what I say, they're all excuses...

501
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:54,560
Even I would never want to see me again.

502
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,730
I should've done well like seonbae told me to from the beginning.

503
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:01,120
But I just had to make a mistake.

504
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:11,510
How does someone like me handle a well-to-do celebrity?

505
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:17,180
I'm not even on par for this job, why did they assign it to me? What should I do?

506
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,770
If I don't get his signature, I'll probably get fired though.

507
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,900
  Good Casting 
 Preview  

508
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,200
  Hand it over to the police and step back.  

509
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,060
  I put a not so small amount in the trunk.  

510
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,570
 I'll follow you like you asked. 

511
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,440
  Do as you see fit. I trust you, after all.  

512
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,130
  Director! Why did you put me on this operation?  

513
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:28,890
 - Where am I? 
 - He has amnesia? 

514
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:29,650
  I found him.  

515
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:32,210
 - We found Pi Cheol Woong's location. 
 - It's headed for Taipei. 

516
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,790
  It's been a while. Shall we fly?  

517
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:34,920
 Be careful! 

518
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,010
 I'll look for him. 

519
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,650
 Sir!  

520
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,160
  What's this? Did the transmission cut off?  

521
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,610
  For Baek Chan Mi, there's no record of her returning.  

522
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,710
 Even if you don't catch the tail, you can catch the scent. 

523
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,620
  He's inside the plane.  

524
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,620
 You know who I am. Why did you pretend you didn't? 

525
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,910
 It's you, isn't it? Michael.
