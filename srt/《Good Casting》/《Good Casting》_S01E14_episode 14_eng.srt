1
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,730
A secret that should never be revealed to the world.

2
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,830
What exactly is it?

3
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,370
If I say it, if I reveal the secret, can you take responsibility?

4
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,990
So there is something.

5
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:52,930
If Executive Director Myeong were an easy person to catch, he wouldn't have been able to get to where he is today.

6
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,590
He'll wipe out anyone who stands in his way and trample on them without even blinking an eye!

7
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,300
What if you

8
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,470
use me as bait?

9
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,730
If word gets out that I'm still alive, they won't be able to stay still.

10
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,980
They?

11
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:27,220
If Pandora's Box opens, Executive Director Myeong won't be the only one that gets hurt.

12
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,560
What about the item?

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,220
Once Executive Director Myeong is in custody,

14
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,060
I'll give it up then.

15
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,220
 Do you believe Director Seo? 

16
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,550
Even if we're desperate, we shouldn't. Never!

17
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,380
It's the fastest and most sure way to catch Executive Director Myeong.

18
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,680
  Episode 14   
It does feel iffy that Director Seo offered up himself as bait,

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,610
but if we cover it properly, wouldn't it be possible?

20
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,620
A jerk who has already betrayed us onceâ”€

21
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,520
Will betray us again and again.

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,820
You know this and you still want to take his hand?!

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,200
Don't get caught up in your emotions and look at the facts!

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,680
Director Seo has the item and Executive Director Myeong is in a frenzy trying to get it.

25
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,610
I don't know what the item is, but he said we'll be able to catch Michael too.

26
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,180
There's only a week left until the third R&amp;D announcement.

27
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,730
It'd be best if we could catch Executive Director Myeong before the third R&amp;D announcement.

28
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,590
What's the plan?

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,550
  Information about Director Seo being alive needs to reach Executive Director Myeong first.  

30
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,930
  Once Executive Director Myeong realizes Director Seo is alive, their side will start moving.  

31
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,050
  We'll be on standby and wait until they take the bait.  

32
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,700
 Ssak Ssak Cleaning 

33
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,390
Now, shall we get started on the plan?

34
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,450
That car, it's the car that killed Pi Cheol Woong, right?

35
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,940
Right. White Collar.

36
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,870
 Ssak Ssak Cleaning 

37
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,590
  White Collar  

38
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,490
 Ssak Ssak Cleaning 

39
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,770
Did they notice us?

40
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,580
What are they doing?

41
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,240
 Ohh! 

42
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,630
We should follow them! S-S-Stop!

43
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,850
- Hurry and chase them! 
 - Damn it.

44
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,400
Crap, did we lose them?

45
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,540
There. There. There.

46
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,780
Step on it, step on it!

47
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,500
C-C-Car!

48
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,500
What is that?

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,740
What is that? Damn it, back up.

50
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,300
- Shoot. 
 - What if we lose them?

51
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,350
Chan Mi, we lost some distance with them.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm chasing right behind them so hurry and catch up.

53
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,600
 TOP SECRET - CODE NAME 'GOOD CASTING' 

54
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,780
 Good Casting 

55
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,430
How valiant it is to watch the backs of those who depart knowing exactly where they're headed.

56
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,970
However, there are always some idiots

57
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,100
who don't know when to go.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,300
I'm someone who believes that farewells can be beautiful.

59
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,630
But then, you guys are trying to pull a prank?

60
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,170
I'm not the one who dirtied my hands.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,990
It was you, right?

62
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,530
Where is the file?

63
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,200
What will happen to me if I hand it over?

64
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,870
If you don't remember, then we should help you remember.

65
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,520
  White Collar   
   Professional company  

66
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,710
This is Executive Director Myeong's villa.

67
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,880
Who gave you the file?

68
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,380
I don't know. Who was it?

69
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,330
Did Michael give it to you?

70
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,560
I don't know.

71
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,060
Who is Michael?

72
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,290
You should have disappeared silently when I gave you the chance.

73
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,090
Why did you come crawling back like an insect and get in the way?

74
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,990
Just why?!

75
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,330
I'll ask you one last time.

76
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,940
- Where's the file? 
 - You must have forgotten.

77
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,480
If I die, the file gets released.

78
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,670
  Il Gwang HiTech's Executive Director Myeong?  

79
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,450
  Are you the Michael I've heard so much about?  

80
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,240
  I heard you wanted the core technology of Unixon's lithography.  

81
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,260
  Il Gwang HiTech's Executive Director Myeong?   
   Il Gwang HiTech's Executive Director Myeong?  

82
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,400
  Are you the Michael I've heard so much about?  

83
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,790
Where's the original file?

84
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,270
Where is it?!

85
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,520
Where is it?! Where is it?! Where is it?!

86
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,760
What was that?

87
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,830
The uninvited guest I was waiting for is finally here.

88
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,600
You little...

89
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,770
Shit!

90
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,400
What? Secretary Baek?

91
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:56,570
  You're saying that you came to an office without its owner present, in the middle of the night, to look for this?  

92
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,630
Hey! Let me go!

93
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,810
Shut up and stay still. We don't have the time for that.

94
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,820
 White Collar 

95
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,560
- What happened? 
- Why are you alone? Where's Director Seo?

96
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,030
He disappeared.

97
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,370
He disappeared? What's that supposed to mean?

98
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,360
He planned to fool us from the beginning.

99
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,510
You annoyed me from the moment I first saw you.

100
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,660
You, dirty rat, hid well out of my sight.

101
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,990
I'm tired of listening to your bullshit.

102
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,290
So just shut up and take your right to remain silent.

103
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,080
You can shut up and come with us.

104
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,410
Let go!

105
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,180
Get in.

106
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,000
 M 

107
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,550
 M 

108
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,360
Sunbae.

109
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,300
 M 

110
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,740
He's the one who came to the NIS to kill Director Seo.

111
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,910
Then, all these people...

112
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,710
They must all be connected to Michael somehow.

113
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,600
Since they are all dead, there is no way to verify it.

114
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,390
If he is this skilled then he's not your average guy.

115
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,810
Have you checked the CCTV?

116
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,000
It was installed, but it doesn't work.

117
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,640
Who on earth was it? The one who took Director Seo.

118
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,950
I got rid of the evidence, got rid of the police,

119
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,880
and now I helped you get your revenge on Chief Tak?

120
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,970
Let's get our facts straight.

121
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,390
You didn't help me, I saved you.

122
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,370
Because revenge is revenge and a deal is a deal.

123
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,740
The promised payment. Confirm it.

124
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,190
  Nation Bank, 550-384-5425, 0423  

125
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,960
When you get to China, the person I called in advance will come out and help you.

126
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,220
This is why you have to do a lot of good deeds.

127
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,710
What exactly is the thing they are looking for?

128
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,650
A nuclear bomb that can kill everything.

129
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,750
Where is this bomb?

130
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,440
Director Seo is on the wanted list, so he can't move easily.

131
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,140
His photos are all over the country.

132
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,340
He's been with National Intelligence Service for 20 years.

133
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,280
If he puts his mind to it, it's not difficult to leave the country.

134
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,430
That's why we shouldn't have believed Director Seo from the start.

135
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,470
Still, we were able to arrest Executive Director Myeong on-scene.

136
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,620
You might all know this but these are the same guys that appeared when Pi Cheol Woong died.

137
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,280
One even came all the way into the NIS and poisoned Director Seo.

138
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,020
I am sure that White Collar isn't a regular laundry service.

139
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,790
It seems like they launder people.

140
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,380
The weapons and intelligence they use are comparable to those of the NIS.

141
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:32,160
Who exactly is it that killed the tattooed people and took Director Seo?

142
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,360
If you're capable enough to knock down three trained men,

143
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,970
and take Director Seo...

144
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,200
Executive Director Myeong must know something. I will go right now and try shaking him up.

145
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,100
He is quite crafty. If you interrogate him without preparation, you can get entangled.

146
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,670
Only after we restore the files and get an upper hand.

147
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,850
We just need to interrogate him within the 48 hours.

148
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,320
Oh right, there are tons of people in the legal world who've been paid off by Executive Director Myeong.

149
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,080
There's no way they'll grant us a warrant without solid evidence.

150
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,360
Yes, Woo Won, I was just about to call you.

151
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,440
Tomorrow is a bit difficult.

152
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,410
No. I will definitely see you tomorrow.

153
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,560
 You remember everything? 

154
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,770
When you say you remember everything, that means...

155
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,030
I clearly remember that I fired you and Pi Cheol Woong ran away on his own.

156
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,380
Because of him, I got kidnapped by a psychopath lady.

157
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,790
And then two valiant ajummas (middle-aged women) showed up and fought, 2 against 30.

158
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,840
I am saying that I remember everything very clearly.

159
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,220
So, you must be very angry.

160
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,540
I'm on the brink of exploding.

161
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,100
Then I will get going.

162
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,120
No, no, no, no. Stop!

163
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,080
Sit down. We still have things to discuss.

164
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,730
You can sign the termination contract later.

165
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,290
No, not that.

166
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,830
Then what things?

167
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,880
For example, why, where, with whom, what and how did Pi Cheol Woong die?

168
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,020
Wh-Why are you curious about that?

169
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,770
Of course, I am curious. Because of Pi Cheol Woong, I became national trash. Wouldn't I be curious?

170
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,210
Well, why did Pi Cheol Woong die...

171
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,650
Look me in the eyes!

172
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,320
- Who are you? Your true identity? 
 - Of course...

173
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,180
If you tell me you are an advertising team intern at Il Gwang HiTech,

174
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,350
I will report to the police that I got kidnapped.

175
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,650
Tell me. Who you are.

176
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:08,410
I am just an advertising team intern at Il Gwang HiTech...

177
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,360
Why are you looking through someone else's wallet...

178
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,150
NIS?

179
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,390
What is this?

180
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,420
You are a very dangerous person.

181
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,070
If you fake things like this, you will get into trouble.

182
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,460
Give it, quickly.

183
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,060
 Team Leader Dong 

184
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,460
Team Leader Dong?

185
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,910
Is there another team leader other than the advert team leader that I know?

186
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,960
Answer it.

187
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,790
 Team Leader Dong - Loudspeaker: On 

188
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,290
Yes, Team Leader?

189
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,090
You haven't received Executive Director Myeong's alias' bank statements, right?

190
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,250
I asked the IRS to cooperate,

191
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,860
so keep track of the transactions made through the exchange account.

192
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,830
Yes, understood.

193
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,990
Wait... this person...

194
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,400
The Dong-casso I met that time?

195
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,700
  So this person is the master of modern art...  

196
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,330
  Mr. Dong-casso.  

197
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,650
  Wow, this is beyond postmodernism  

198
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,110
  that tries to dismantle existing norms.  

199
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:37,430
 - What a positively destructive attempt. 
- Thank you. 

200
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,310
  You two should take a photo.  

201
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,450
You motherf*#%*&amp;s!

202
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:54,250
NIS. The team leader you just spoke to is the Dong-casso or Donkatsu I met, right?

203
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,740
Even if you are going to treat someone like a fool, there should be boundaries.

204
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,560
It's not like that.

205
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,170
To be frank, do you think it makes sense that a stupid person like you is an NIS member?

206
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,960
It makes no sense, but let's assume that you do work for the NIS.

207
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,120
This country will be in ruins with no hope for the future.

208
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,910
What's wrong with me?

209
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,960
Zero responsiveness, zero tactfulness and zero motor skills.,

210
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,160
Just now, too. Someone who claims to be a black agent was caught by me.

211
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,700
Is this a camera prank or something?

212
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,420
Whether you believe it or not is up to you.

213
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,860
If you have nothing else to say, I can go, right?

214
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,680
Where are you going?

215
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,460
According to the Field Regulations Article 14 Section 2,

216
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,350
upon discovery of false identity during an on-site operation, the agent will withdraw immediately.

217
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,060
There shall be no trace or any post-identification to be inferred.

218
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:47,980
So, as from this moment, I cease to be in charge of you.

219
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,040
So you are just going to leave like this?

220
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,680
As soon as your identity is revealed,  you are out.

221
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,320
I'm really sorry about everything.

222
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,550
Who told you to go as you please?

223
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,090
I don't have any reason to listen to you anymore.

224
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,440
I will sue you!

225
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,560
Sue me for what?

226
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,890
If you really work for the NIS, the fact that I was kidnapped,

227
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,820
the fact that you stood by and watched as I became national trash because of Pi Cheol Woong,

228
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,550
and even for mental damage. I will sue you.

229
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,520
You're not really going to sue me, are you?

230
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,280
Why not? I thought you said you were leaving.

231
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,980
That I would never see you again.

232
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,510
That was just like a guidance document.

233
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,270
Like a rice cooker document.

234
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,390
From now on, you have to abide by everything you note down.

235
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,350
If you don't, I will sue you straight away.  
(The crackers he holds up, "Goso" is "sue" in Korean.) 

236
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,990
- Speak. 
 - Number 1,

237
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,340
you need to have a meal with me at least three times a week.

238
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,620
What if I just ordered delivery for youâ€”

239
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,850
Do you want to die?

240
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,830
Call me and report before you go to bed.

241
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:24,220
Call me as soon as you wake up in the morning and give me the briefing for the day.

242
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,890
When you are resting, take a selfie and send it to me.

243
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,060
Why do you need my selfies?

244
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,360
I need to confirm where you are and what you are doing

245
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,370
to see if you are really unable to come when I call you,

246
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,200
or you're just lying because you don't want to come.

247
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:48,160
- What else? 
 - You need to report your personal matters to me before you go.

248
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,300
That is definitely inappropriate.

249
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,120
Why do I need to report my personal matters to you?

250
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,690
Don't I need to understand your personal matters

251
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,410
to determine when to and when not to call you?

252
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,830
- This is everything, right? 
  - There is one last thing.

253
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:10,100
All contacts with the opposite sex should be blocked. In-person meetings are not allowed, either.

254
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,110
Why should I do that?

255
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,720
You shouldn't be distracted by things that are so trivial.

256
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,930
In dangerous times like these when we can get attacked by psychopaths,

257
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,360
what will you do if I get harmed because you were thinking of trivial things?

258
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,600
How does that relate to my contact with the opposite sex?

259
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,610
Do you know how many crazy male stalker fans I have around me?

260
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,530
Some of the men around you could be out to harm me, not you.

261
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,110
Like Pi Cheol Woong, do you understand?

262
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,750
Are you finally done?

263
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,310
Be sure to follow it all. Or else, I'll sue you right away.

264
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,930
Yummy! 
   (Word for "sue" also could be used to describe a taste) 

265
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,490
It's so yummy!

266
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,120
Coffee, please.

267
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,830
Is it that you don't have an appetite or that you lost it after seeing me?

268
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,860
I don't think we're close enough to enjoy a meal together.

269
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,500
You wanted to meet outside to avoid being seen by Executive Director Myeong.

270
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,910
You act naive, but you know everything.

271
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,540
That is one of your charms.

272
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,340
What is this regarding?

273
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,740
Things were okay between us up to our divorceâ€”

274
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,650
Quite opposite from what I remember.

275
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,860
I preferred our relationship after the divorce.

276
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,710
Wrap it up with Baek Chan Mi.

277
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,920
What are you talking about?

278
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,110
Baek Chan Mi, who came in lying as Baek Jang Mi.

279
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,490
End things with her.

280
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,180
This is why things were worse before the divorce.

281
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,460
You knew too much about things you didn't need to know about.

282
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,850
You know that's not a charm, right?

283
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,550
Are you in it because you want rumors to spread throughout the company?

284
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,300
CEO Yoon has fallen in love with his secretary, furthermore, that secretary

285
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,610
is Yoon Seok Ho's first love from the past.

286
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,770
You should stop.

287
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,120
That wasn't enough so she snuck in as part of

288
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,370
the National Intelligence Service.

289
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,450
Stop!

290
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,080
You know how to raise your voice.

291
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,590
Do you know you're acting like when I first met you?

292
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,720
Whenever I'm talking to you, I feel like I'm drowning,

293
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,500
running out of oxygen and gasping for air.

294
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,990
If you've got something to say then say it instead of going in circles and tormenting the person.

295
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,750
I can't stand another second with you.

296
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,910
Stopping our divorce and crony capitalism arrangements, let's put it all behind us and go back to how things were.

297
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,730
When things were good and we supported each other.

298
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,440
Things were only good for you.

299
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,440
I had no choice in order to protect my companyâ€”

300
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,120
I will take care of my own money.

301
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,980
You do whatever you want with your stake.

302
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,050
I'm giving you a last chance.

303
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,200
You should think it over more.

304
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,300
Do what you want with your shares, whether it's to hold them against my neck or take me out with them.

305
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,370
I'm not just going to stand by and be idle.

306
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,170
Are we done here?

307
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:26,510
He must not know that once he angers a woman with a temper, she can turn his life into hell.

308
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,480
It's okay, I didn't eat anything.

309
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,950
I'm not sure if it's wise to turn your back on a large shareholder right now.

310
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,070
I know how you feel, but I think protecting the company is more important.

311
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,600
It's not that the company is less important.

312
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,490
I can live without the company,

313
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,060
but I don't think I can live without that person.

314
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,540
Well, well, well...

315
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,620
What, you think we poisoned the food?

316
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,330
You were the one that went through my room that day, right?

317
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,110
Not just your room.

318
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,920
I went through all the food you ate and threw away every day.

319
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,830
It was really tiring.

320
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,910
It would be a waste to throw away something our taxpayers bought you.

321
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,040
If you don't want to, I might as well eat it.

322
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,460
I don't think it's time for you to have an appetite right now.

323
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,630
If you can't find any evidence within 48 hours, you'll have to turn me over to the police.

324
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,020
If it's about alleged illegal fundraising,

325
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,400
I'm sure I'll be released due to insufficient evidence.

326
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,750
At most, I'll be charged with embezzlement.

327
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,510
You arrest me for abduction,

328
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,710
but the person I abducted is your director, who is supposedly dead.

329
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,850
You need to somehow piece everything together, but victims are disappearing.

330
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:24,680
At this point, I need to talk in order for the puzzle to be completed.

331
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,890
What to do?

332
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,690
I have no intention of cooperating.

333
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:37,220
He's making it sound like we arrested an upstanding citizen and made up his charges.

334
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,490
I'm saying the one cornered in isn't me but you guys.

335
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,410
Do you still have an appetite?

336
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:48,640
My appetite... is ravenous.

337
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,940
Everything will solve itself once we're able to unpack the item from the Director.

338
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,450
Let's see... forging data in your ledger,

339
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,840
on top of the item from Director Seo,

340
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,920
add the audio file that's being restored. If we go all-in...

341
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:20,380
Well, I think the minimum would be a life sentence?

342
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,610
Let's go!

343
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,240
So you have the item?

344
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,520
Why aren't you bringing it out?

345
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,180
It's not fun to bring out the hidden card in the beginning.

346
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,690
We'll bring it out at the end to completely turn the tables.

347
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,330
Don't lie.

348
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,280
Director Seo wouldn't have handed that over.

349
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,860
Guess you'll have to wait and see... if it's a bluff or it's real.

350
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:55,270
I clearly gave you a chance to fess up, and the person that kicked away your only lifeline

351
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,780
is you.

352
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,510
It's confirmed that Director Seo does have something.

353
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,630
What could that item be...

354
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,760
Has the audio file been recovered yet?

355
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,440
It's badly damaged so it'll take some time for it to be recovered.

356
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,860
Did they identify the bodies?

357
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,620
They couldn't so they must not be Korean. No fingerprint records either.

358
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,840
If we look at the immigration recordsâ€”

359
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,210
They're probably illegal residents. Or they were smuggled in.

360
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:37,530
They have the same tattoos as Michael so it's definite that they're connected to him.

361
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:46,520
    
 So you're saying you're going to sue the kids?  

362
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,940
That child named Joo Yeong is usuallyâ€”

363
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,970
Her name is Joo Yeon. You should've come in at least knowing my daughter's name.

364
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,580
If you're even a little bit sorryâ€”

365
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,240
You say such... strange things.

366
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,100
You talk as if our kids are in the wrong here.

367
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,950
Whether it's Joo Yeong or Joo Yeon,

368
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,610
are you sure that she didn't do anything wrong?!

369
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,350
I don't think they would've gone out of their way for a quiet kid.

370
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,250
What are you implying?

371
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,810
That my daughter did something to get beaten up?

372
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:28,830
 - Just stay still.
 - Oh, you're so pretty!  

373
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:34,540
  So pretty!  

374
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,910
  See? You're so pretty with makeup on.  

375
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:44,550
I heard that Joo Yeon wanted to stand out from the other kids,

376
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,660
and when our kids lightly pointed something out,

377
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,750
she started yelling at them and came at them!

378
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,550
  You're already ugly so why bullshit and flaunt your bare face?  

379
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,400
  She's got no money to buy any makeup. 

380
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,060
  Stop it, stop it!  

381
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:07,340
  Are you crazy? Hey, step on her.  

382
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,850
  Don't. Stop!  

383
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,220
I understand.

384
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,250
What?

385
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,200
How can they do that to a friend?

386
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,150
No matter how much I thought about it, I couldn't understand

387
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,060
or accept it.

388
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,740
I wondered why they were raised so badly.

389
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,240
But now I know.

390
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,870
What are you saying right now?!

391
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,700
You judged me wrong.

392
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,690
- What is she even saying? 
 - Who are you to threaten us?!

393
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:59,850
  - What are we going to do with her?  
- This is why poor kids are like this.  

394
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:15,600
I'm like this... I'm scared to death...

395
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,060
How scared must our Joo Yeon have been?

396
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,770
Yeah, so...

397
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:57,860
The daughter that lives next door to me,

398
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,910
I heard she's being bullied by kids at her school.

399
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,710
School violence is so common these days.

400
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:12,380
Did you, perhaps, hear anything on how to work out a problem like this?

401
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,810
If you call the uncle package, it'll be solved.

402
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,090
Uncle package?

403
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,260
You know, if you release the uncles who grew up on the dark side...

404
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,520
Ah!

405
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,950
Then it's game over.

406
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,720
Game over?

407
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,960
Do you think school violence is a joke?

408
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,100
It's a matter of life or death to the kids who are victims!

409
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,390
You should be working! Not gaming!

410
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,800
Oh, hi. I was wondering...

411
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,110
that... how much is the uncle package for one day?

412
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,990
Why are you calling for something like that?

413
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,690
You have the aunt package right here.

414
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,950
Shouldn't you have come to us first with issues like this?

415
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,980
How did you find out?

416
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,270
We happened to hear your phone call.

417
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,880
How did you know it was for me, though?

418
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:49,820
I... dropped out of school because of school violence and am a GED recipient.

419
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:58,920
Because of that, I quit high school. But I got my GED and was able to start college early.

420
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,360
I lied about being born early in the year

421
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,330
because I was scared other people would find out.

422
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,920
Why would you?

423
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,810
Why should the victim still live in fear when the attackers are living just fine?

424
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,290
Since I kept getting beat up,

425
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,340
I really thought I was a bad person and that I deserved it.

426
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,770
That's why I really want to help Joo Yeon.

427
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:29,120
She's probably living in hell like I did.

428
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,060
Let's go. I already got the kid's location from Moo Hyeok.

429
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,490
What are you going to do?

430
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:43,810
With those SWWS bullies, you crush them using power.

431
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,150
What SWWS?

432
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,830
Those kids who act strong in front of the weak and weak in front of strong people,

433
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:51,460
they need to be beaten up by a truly strong one to realize, "Ah I'm just some loser."

434
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,100
It puts them back in their place.

435
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,880
Well, it's nothing after all.

436
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,430
Might as well use the "aunt chance" card.

437
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,990
Let's go.

438
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,750
Take everything.

439
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,260
It's so hard to open.

440
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,190
Hurry up.

441
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,110
Ah.

442
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,100
  Coin Noraebang   
  (T/N: private karaoke room rented by the song) 

443
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,010
Five guests. They're looting coins from an unmanned Co-No.

444
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,730
Co-No?

445
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,130
You know the beacon sensor in Executive Director Myeong's office,

446
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,750
Beacon-o..

447
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,310
What? No, it's Coin Noraebang.

448
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,370
- Ah! 
 - Ah...

449
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,720
  Coin Noraebang  

450
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,940
Sunbae, I don't see Sunbae Mi Soon.

451
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,140
What are you doing here?

452
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,030
I don't think I can watch.

453
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,630
What do you mean?

454
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,160
I... I don't think I can see their faces.

455
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,560
Why are you suddenly like this after coming all the way over here?

456
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,490
Would they have done something like this if they were kids who learned after getting scolded?

457
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:41,490
What if it turns into a bigger problem after we interfere?

458
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,920
It's a bigger problem if we let them be.

459
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,520
The great Hwang Mi Soon, why are you being like this?

460
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,500
Because she's a mom.

461
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:58,070
Because there might be a small possibility something could happen to Joo Yeon.

462
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:03,350
If they torment Joo Yeon again,

463
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:06,250
I don't think I'll be able to live with myself.

464
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:20,230
I personally wish you wouldn't run away.

465
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,310
Because you're her mom.

466
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,790
Fine, then stay here. I'll go in by myself.

467
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,460
Hey, Chan Mi. She's driving me crazy. Hey!

468
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,930
- What should we get with this? 
 - Rice soup!

469
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,510
Chicken! What do you mean, rice soup?

470
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,820
You don't know rice soup?

471
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,960
Hi, students.

472
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,800
Hey.

473
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,430
Kids, you should be getting along nicely with your friends.

474
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,100
If you keep bullying the weak,

475
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,470
you'll be treated just like them in the future.

476
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,920
Ajumma, you know me?

477
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm not an ajumma.

478
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,990
I don't know you either, ajumma.

479
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:10,810
So you should butt out of our business. If you don't want to be beaten up like those numskulls.

480
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,790
Pick it up.

481
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,580
Ahjumma!

482
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,700
Be careful, you might pop your hip by doing that.

483
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,410
You should just stop playing smart aleck and take away that smelly pig feet.

484
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,650
L-Let's talk it out. They're children, be gentle.

485
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,130
These little growing buds,

486
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,390
were they raised by watering them with mop water?

487
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,530
Why is your mouth so foul?

488
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,920
What?

489
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,170
This ajumma, is she crazâ€”

490
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,670
Are you okay?

491
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,560
Aish!

492
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,280
We noonas are busy so don't come at me one at a time. Bring it on.

493
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,420
You!

494
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,050
Die!

495
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,130
- Quick, go over there! 
 - You little!

496
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,450
These... You sure you picked every one of them up?

497
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,670
- Y-Y-Yes. 
 - Hey.

498
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,970
It's fate we met like this. Should we follow each other on social media?

499
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:04,760
I-I-I don't do Ansta or Fatebook.

500
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,850
Oh yeah?

501
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,020
  Search Person  

502
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,760
  Follow  

503
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,000
  'Big Unni' has sent you a friend request.  

504
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,570
That's me.

505
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,490
Are you going to reject my request?

506
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,180
  Accept follow request: confirmed  

507
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,260
From now on, I'll be keeping my eyes on you in real-time,

508
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,330
- so don't suddenly go inactive and please keep posting updates. 
 - Yes...

509
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,560
- Louder! 
 - Yes, we understand!

510
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,430
Work hard. Hands!

511
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,150
Lift them higher.

512
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,700
  What do we do...  

513
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,220
  Did you get hurt?  

514
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,620
What's up with that ajumma?

515
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,860
- I don't know. 
 - What is that?

516
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,790
Ah...

517
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,240
What do we do with the coins?

518
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,620
What do you mean, we have to return them.

519
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,140
If the police know, won't it be a problem?

520
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,560
Who said we're going to the police?

521
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,270
Then where?

522
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:24,100
Hey. How long do I need to keep watch?

523
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,800
Sunbae!

524
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,100
Noona!

525
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,200
 Really? 

526
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,000
 You found the person who registered the phone number in Taiwan? 

527
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,300
  Moo Hyeok, you trace the person who registered the phone. Ye Eun, keep searching Chief Ok  

528
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,300
  until something related to Michael comes out.  

529
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,700
 I'll try to find Michael's phone number. 

530
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,700
 I might be able to find out who registered the number through someone I know in Taiwan. 

531
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:01,100
 You said you really needed it. I've paid back my debt now! 

532
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:05,300
 Thank you. Please send the information to my e-mail right away. 

533
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,100
She's so bad at taking selfies.

534
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,300
She's so pretty in real life. Why the heck do her photos look like this?

535
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,900
Just looking at her photos isn't enough for me.

536
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,600
 Kang Woo Won 

537
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,100
Hello? What's the matter?

538
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,700
Come within ten minutes.

539
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,300
It takes more than an hour from my house. How can I get there in ten minutes?

540
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,600
Fine, then within one hour and ten minutes.

541
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,100
What is this?

542
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:25,700
A home-cooked meal prepared by superstar, Kang Woo Won. You can't even buy this with money.

543
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,300
If you want to take pictures for memories, go ahead.

544
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,900
By any chance, are you doing this because I did something wrong?

545
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,700
- What do you mean? 
 - I mean,

546
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,500
I'll feel more at ease if you treat me badly like you usually do.

547
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:31,300
Of course. A non-celebrity like you must not know how to react when receiving the kindness of a superstar like me.

548
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,300
I understand, but from now on, you'll have to get used to this.

549
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,700
But, have you already mastered how to use the rice cooker?

550
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,300
Do you think I cooked this? I ordered all of this.

551
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,100
Didn't you say it was a home-cooked meal you personally prepared, just earlier?

552
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,500
I did prepare this. By ordering.

553
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Plus, isn't eating at home considered home-cooked food?

554
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,100
You should've said so earlier. Your health isn't very good.

555
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,500
It's not good to order delivery all the time.

556
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,600
If I told you, you'd have tired yourself out coming all the way here just to cook.

557
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,900
What do you mean?

558
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,000
If I pester you, you won't want to come.

559
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,200
I have to pester you less if I want to see you often.

560
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,500
Rather than bothering me by calling me here often,

561
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,900
just pestering me occasionally is better.

562
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,100
Are you dense?

563
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,100
Ever since you started taking those bad selfies of yours,

564
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,500
I knew you were clueless and unaware and had the emotions of a piece of dried up gum!

565
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,500
You know squat. A National Intelligence Service agent who doesn't even know how to fight.

566
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,800
Do you know what flirting is?!

567
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,900
Why are you getting angry?

568
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,500
Also, when I'm working, I'm better at fighting than I look!

569
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,300
And I've done my fair share of flirting.

570
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,100
Oh, really? You flirt?

571
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,200
Of course, I'm so good at it.

572
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,700
Then why can't you do it now?

573
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,300
I was just about to do it!

574
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,000
What? Didn't you say you're good at it? Do it then.

575
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,900
I... forgot to turn off the stove at home.

576
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,300
So sudden?

577
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,000
Sorry, I'm leaving now.

578
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,400
You said you were just about to start flirting!

579
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,700
Where are you going?

580
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,900
My heart is pounding because I ran too fast.

581
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,600
It's because I ran too fast.

582
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,300
- What? 
 - What's going on? 
 - What's happening?

583
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,900
- Why is she here? 
 - What's going on?

584
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,100
- What are you doing here, CEO Sim? 
 - Where's Executive Director Myeong?

585
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,200
I'm sure you're all hungry. Let's talk after eating.

586
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,500
My neck hurts. I told you to sit.

587
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,300
Look, CEO Sim!

588
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,500
What did you say?

589
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,300
Have your memories deteriorated and your ears gone deaf?

590
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,900
Look here!

591
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,700
Look at this!

592
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,100
You said, "I will devote myself."

593
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,300
"I am prepared to exert myself to the utmost."

594
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,700
You said you would be loyal to me forever

595
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,300
and that you wouldn't forget my kindness to you.

596
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,700
I picked every single one of you myself.

597
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,400
Yet you stick behind Executive Director Myeong, wiping your mouth from the meal I gave you and pretending not to know me.

598
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,300
I'm disappointed.

599
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,100
Executive Director Myeong isn't coming.

600
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,100
Or should I say, he can't come?

601
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,700
He's being investigated by the NIS.

602
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,700
- NIS? 
 - Investigated?

603
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,100
What should I do?

604
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:19,500
The line you believed in and switched over to, turned out to be a rotten one.

605
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,500
If there's anyone here who didn't become a director with my help,

606
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,900
you can leave.

607
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,700
But just know you won't be seeing me again.

608
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,100
The ship you're all on is going to explode soon.

609
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,300
What is the meaning of this?

610
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:43,300
I can shove a drowning person to their death with my hands,

611
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,900
or I could also reach out to save them from drowning.

612
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,700
What do you say?

613
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,600
Should I kill you...

614
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,100
or save you?

615
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,000
â™« Oh, what a cheerful life! â™«

616
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,500
 I saw that song somewhere. 

617
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,800
That music....

618
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:37,600
It wasn't something I heard. It was something I saw.

619
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,700
 The bomb will explode soon. 

620
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,500
 If you mess up again, 

621
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,900
 they're going to be very upset. 

622
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,300
 I've sent you the location our satellite has found. Move quickly. 

623
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,500
 I'm on my way. 

624
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,900
 You better take care of it without attracting their attention 

625
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,500
 if you want to live. 

626
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,500
Team Leader, take a look at this.

627
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,100
This guy...

628
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:09,500
You asked me to track Michael's phone number so I asked a hacker from Taiwan to search.

629
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,700
This guy is Michael?

630
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,100
When Chan Mi checked, there was no wound on his shoulder.

631
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:23,700
Check the people around him. Look through everyone related to Il Gwang HiTech, even from afar!

632
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,700
I think we already found him.

633
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,200
What?

634
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,900
Why is this guy here...

635
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,300
 Il Gwang HiTech Division Director Myeong Gye Cheol... 

636
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,300
 Are you the infamous Michael? 

637
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,100
 I heard you want Unixen's core lithography technology? 

638
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,500
Will it take long to reverse a distorted voice?

639
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,900
I'll do it as quickly as possible.

640
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,700
Sorry, but please hurry. It's urgent.

641
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,200
Yes.

642
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,810
We've restored the chip.

643
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:01,910
What did you find out?

644
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:05,580
It's an audio clip of a call between Michael and Executive Director Myeong.

645
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,890
Michael's voice was recorded?

646
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,730
It's a modulated recording. It's been reversed, but it's not perfect.

647
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:15,180
Anyway, I'll send it to you right away.

648
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:16,750
All right.

649
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,760
 Il Gwang HiTech Division Director, Myeong Gye Cheol... 

650
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,030
 Are you the infamous Michael? 

651
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:34,110
 I heard you want Unixen's core lithography technology? 

652
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:40,620
Get Michael's location and proceed with the search and seizure of the research center.

653
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:45,310
 Il Gwang HiTech Research Center 

654
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,190
 Introduction to Robotics 

655
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:18,060
 Johann Strauss 

656
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,840
Why does he keep moving his head up and down?

657
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,150
 Johann Strauss 

658
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:49,250
Classical music doesn't fit him at all.

659
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:36,290
You must have thought I wouldn't find you if you secretly ran away.

660
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,450
You...

661
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,910
Who are you?

662
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,720
Die.

663
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,450
Stay still.

664
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,930
You bastard.

665
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,290
You're right.

666
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,780
It's me, Michael.

667
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:46,680
You need to return the item to me.

668
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,150
You're the one who has my phone.

669
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,350
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

670
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:56,970
Whether you tell me or not, you're dying in my hands.

671
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,920
Should I tell you a secret?

672
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,640
I'm... Michael.

673
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:28,570
 112 

674
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:23,580


675
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,620
 Good Casting - Preview 

676
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,720
  We found out Michael's identity.  

677
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,910
  I know, it's Chief Ok.  

678
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,390
  Finally found it. The evidence that disappeared at the Busan Port.  

679
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:42,230
  You should confess. 

680
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,820
  That you're the one  who killed my father.  

681
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,010
  You did this so that I would confess to you?  

682
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,220
 This one candle means it's our first day of dating starting today. 

683
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,630
 They will hold an emergency meeting about your dismissal.  

684
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,560
 Promise me one thing. 

685
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,590
 That you'll wait for me until I come back. 

686
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,620
  Chief Ok is going to meet with Wang Kai at Jeju Island.  

687
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,670
  Then who is it?  

688
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,980
  You could be in danger like the chairman was, if you know any more than this.  

689
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,150
 Is there just one left? 

690
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:04,150
  I thought she looked familiar. We've met before, haven't we?  

691
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,820
 Epilogue 

692
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,930
 Three years ago 

693
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:16,700
 November 17th, 2016: Busan Port Passenger Terminal 

694
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,770
Michael!

695
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:22,250
Die, you bastard!

696
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,450
  I heard you wanted the core technology of Unixon's lithography.  

697
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:43,360
  I heard that you, Michael, were the best at taking care of businesses like this.  

698
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,030
  On November 17th at 9pm,   

699
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:50,060
  I'll see you at Gate 4 on the 2nd floor of the Busan Port Passenger Terminal.  

700
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:27,770
How do I get to Gate Four?

701
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,050
That way.

702
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,080
How did the deal go?

703
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,110
It's done.

704
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:17,300
You've never been injured until now.

705
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,500
I can't personally be in action anymore.

706
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,430
It's dangerous.

707
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:25,850
Won't there be a problem since you lost your phone?

708
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:28,920
All the details of our deals thus far are in there.

709
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,830
The day they find out...

710
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:34,210
We have take it back. Call the number.

711
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,590
Hello?

712
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,080
It seems it's the person who found the phone. What should we do?

713
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,280
Who are you?

714
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,010
And who are you?

715
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,500
I think I got the wrong number.

716
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,660
 Are you perhaps looking for Michael? 

717
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,210
Are you Michael?

718
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:12,540
What if I am?

719
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,880
Then I wish to meet you.

720
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:21,730
Well, let's see... Why should we meet?

721
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:24,140
I wonder if I can commission something?

722
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:28,370
Some big investors in China are extremely interested in the Korean semiconductor technology, you see.

723
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,810
  We need the core technology of the lithography  

724
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:37,450
  in order to make 176-layer 4D NAND flash possible.  

725
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:42,030
What about 176-layer 4D NAND flash?

726
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,120
What's the price?

727
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,880
It'll definitely be expensive

728
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,170
to steal it without getting caught by the NIS.

729
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:06,260
Where are you going to next?

730
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:12,040
Il Gwang HiTech.
