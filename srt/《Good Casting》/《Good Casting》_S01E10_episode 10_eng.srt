1
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,190


2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,610
 Ssak Ssak Clean 

3
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,980
She definitely came this way.

4
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,440
Did you not get the message saying our operation is closed now?

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,930
I also saw it.

6
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,460
So are you saying we should end it here, letting the affair fall through without us having caught Michael, just like three years ago?

7
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,810
What are you afraid of?

8
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,560
You and I both, before being agents we are employees of an institution.

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,190
Did you completely forget about repeating "Command and Discipline" countless times when we were training?

10
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,690
So you're scared you'll be fired.

11
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,760
You too?

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,860
You know that I have a child to take care of.

13
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,500
You might not know this because you're alone,

14
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,850
but next month I have to pay back my loan, the interest, and my kid's after school classes.

15
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,840
My livelihood is on the line here.

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,400
I can't just blindly throw myself out there.

17
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,210
Even... if I ask for your help

18
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,770
only this one time?

19
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,590
You know how important this is to me.

20
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,660
Oh, oh! Damn it.

21
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,640
What do we do? Hide, it's my husband, my  husband.

22
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,310
Oh. Dammit.

23
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,990
- Damn, what do we do? 
 - What should we do?

24
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,860
Why can't I see anything?

25
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,140
Aish.

26
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,300
 Ssak Ssak Clean 

27
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,750
So... What's your plan?

28
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,690
Tell us quick.

29
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,770
That scared me! Oh wait, wait...

30
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,490
What are you doing?

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,310
I-It's just, I was sleeping but then you weren't there.

32
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,980
No but, wait. W-Why are you out here at this hour?

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,770
I told you to throw it away ages ago, you hamheung envoy. 
  (T/N: historical reference idiom, meaning someone sent on an errand gets out of touch) 

34
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,590
I couldn't live with this smell.

35
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,290
At any rate, if I don't throw it out myself, you just live embracing the trash, don't you?

36
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,180
Is it your lover?

37
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,100
I wish you'd cherish me half as much.

38
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,590
Aigoo, look at my fate.

39
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,260
Aigoo really, what a fate!

40
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,010
Man.

41
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,110
 Personal Details - Baek Chan Mi 

42
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,700
 Personal Details - Hwang Mi Soon 

43
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,850
 Personal Details - Im Ye Eun 

44
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,120
 Achilles heel: In the past, Im Ye Eun was Kwon Min Seok's girlfriend.   

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,340
 At the time of So Hui's birth, Kwon Min Seok passed away.   

46
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,640
 Kwon Min Seok? 

47
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,260
Agent Baek Chan Mi

48
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,230
said that tomorrow,

49
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,920
she will steal the ledger.

50
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,180
 TOP SECRET - CODE NAME 'GOOD CASTING' 

51
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,480
 Good Casting 

52
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,440
Il Gwang HiTech

53
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,190
 Episode 10 

54
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,700
 Ledger: Person's name - Amount - Affiliation 

55
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,900
 Il Gwang HiTech Myeong Gye Cheol 

56
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,560
 Kang Woo Won's manager Mr. Pi found dead in the hospital 

57
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,020
You're saying you'll rob Director Myeong's office?

58
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,070
Yep.

59
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,470
Are you in your right mind?

60
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm totally in my right mind.

61
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,380
Look. My pupils have the same size,

62
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,080
and the temperature between the middle of my forehead and the end of my nose is stable.

63
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,480
And my brainwave response feels a hundred percent fine.

64
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,440
Not going back to headquarters is already a violation of the rules,

65
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,940
but the day you get caught having stayed behind on the field to run your operation, you'll really be done for.

66
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,820
I realized it when I lost Michael three years ago.

67
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,610
To catch that scum, I have to put my neck on the line if I want a chance at winning.

68
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,980
If this goes awry, you might never have another chance at catching Michael.

69
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,640
I don't need another chance. Because I'll do it this time, no matter what.

70
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,360
 There's a problem.  

71
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,540
 I can't log in to the NIS security network.   
  Access Denied: YE.LIM9215 - The relevant account is momentarily unavailable 

72
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,280
 There's an even bigger problem here.  

73
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,880
Since the operation was closed yesterday, you must return all your equipment.

74
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,470
I returned them all.

75
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,870
I don't have anything. Well, I'd love to, but I don't have anything to give you.

76
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,830
If I had anything, I would want to give it.

77
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,830
No, but...

78
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,370
There was one here?

79
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,910
What a meticulous guy. Ah really.

80
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,460
A slight move and it could have pricked you. You're quite skillful.

81
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,770
Do you take me for an idiot? I stuck it safely in-between my toes.

82
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,210
Hacking into security doesn't seem possible.

83
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,520
I also got all my equipment taken from me.

84
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,400
The probability of failure is over fifty percent.

85
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,790
If things go awry, it won't end just with you returning your agent badge.

86
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,720
You might become a criminal and get put behind bars. Will you still be fine with this?

87
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,330
Life behind bars suits me, so I'm fine.

88
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,140
Even though the NIS could erase your life altogether?

89
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:55,500
Either I get out, or Director Seo goes out. It's all or nothing.

90
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,370
Fine.

91
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,060
Well, it's all or nothing, anyway, the end game.

92
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,390
Let's do that stuff.

93
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,290
Location tracker.

94
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,450
I still have this one left.

95
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,290
I'll bring you Executive Director Myeong's ledger tonight.

96
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,050
And by what means will you get into his office?

97
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,340
I have already prepared everything.

98
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,100
Is this really the only way?

99
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,120
In case a problem arises, we have nothing to do with each other, CEO.

100
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,740
I can't do that. You know it.

101
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,850
You know as well, CEO, how I managed to come all the way here.

102
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,610
If it weren't for the chairman, I'd have starved to death or died in the streets.

103
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,150
Let's not talk about the past. It's boring.

104
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,280
He took in an orphan no one designed to throw a glance at, fed me, gave me an education, and even sent me to study abroad.

105
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,870
He left without me getting the opportunity to pay him back after I returned, so how do I repay him?

106
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,440
You're doing more than enough now.

107
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,950
I'm saying you already paid him back.

108
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,030
I'll finish it within today, no matter what. Please just know that.

109
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,640
 Il Gwang HiTech 

110
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,460
 Ssak Ssak Clean - Whatever it is, we clean it all up for you! 

111
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,360
 It's impossible to access the NIS security network, so hacking is dangerous.  

112
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,760
 As for the equipment, the only thing we have is the location tracker Mi Soon hid away. 

113
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,410
 We have no choice but to go analog.  

114
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,770
Analog? 
  Analog?  

115
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,410
  There's something like that. It's the way we always worked before you started here, Newborn. 

116
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,490
Analog, what a joke. 
  Analog, what a joke. It just means 

117
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,280
It just means we shovel with our bare hands. 
  Analog, what a joke. It just means we shovel with our bare hands. 

118
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,300
 Il Gwang HiTech 

119
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,440
Ah, later, can you go with the CEO on his agenda outside the office?

120
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,280
- Pardon? 
 - Why are you so surprised? It's not like I'm asking you to work overtime tonight.

121
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,350
Right.

122
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,540
Well then, I'll go deliver some documents.

123
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,770
I'm going in now.

124
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,500
  Cleaning  

125
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,690
Okay, finish it in three minutes.

126
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,670
Sunbaenim, show a bit higher.

127
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,000
I can see it now.

128
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,220
Why is nothing there?

129
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,800
Check faster, there's no time.

130
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,190
Is anyone out there?

131
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,800
  Excuse me, is there anyone outside?  

132
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,890
  Excuse me!  

133
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,450
Hurry up, there's one minute left.

134
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:48,270
There should be a card scanner or at least a facial recognition camera.

135
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,380
Why don't I see anything?

136
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,220
  Be careful, you could trigger an alarm.  

137
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,280
I'm going to go crazy.

138
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,530
If we take more time, I could get caught. I'll just go.

139
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,560
  Wait, I think I found it.  

140
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,010
You got it on camera, right? I'll go for now, let me know once you confirm it.

141
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,980
Hi.

142
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,190
The performance evaluations were approved so I came to drop them off.

143
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,880
You should've pinged me, I could've come up myself

144
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,140
and make a quick visit to the CEO.

145
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,760
Have a good day!

146
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,240
  That's a beacon sensor.  

147
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,960
Beacon? What is that?

148
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,830
It's a security system that opens by sending a Bluetooth signal to the sensor on the door.

149
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,330
Executive Director Myeong doesn't use a smartphone so he can't connect via Bluetooth.

150
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:18,300
As soon as the secretary walked in, a green light turned on at the top where the device is.

151
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,100
She probably has something on her that has a sensor attached to it.

152
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,970
Sensor?

153
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,770
  No earrings  

154
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,620
  Accessory!  

155
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,450
Zoom in on this.

156
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,740
Hers, unlike mine,

157
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,860
has a stone in it, right?

158
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,480
- Yeah. 
 - There's a high chance that the stone is the beacon sensor.

159
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,710
Okay, so we just need to get our hand on that pin?

160
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,120
Just a second.

161
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,690
The light there needs to turn red for the door to open,

162
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,760
but it's still green, so I think

163
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,900
there's a set time range for when the door can open.

164
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,010
So there's nothing we can do even if we steal that pin?

165
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:17,600
Wow. That means we need to steal a sensor that will let us in at any time.

166
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,280
That's complicated.

167
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,080
  As long as you have the beacon sensor, the door will open and it can be duplicated,  

168
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,320
  so Executive Director Myeong probably never lets it out of his sight.  

169
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,560
  We just need to find what it is.  

170
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,000
  Accessory 1: Tie Clip  

171
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,720
  Accessory 2: Badge  

172
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,430
  He's got five accessories: tie clip, pair of cufflinks,   
      

173
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,890
  pin, and a ring.   
      

174
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,610
  Five?  

175
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,990
What kind of criminal wears more accessories than me?

176
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,840
  Il Gwang HiTech
 NAND Flash Construction Site 

177
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,320
As soon as production of the 176-layer 4D NAND Flash is in full swing,

178
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,510
we plan to add two more production lines in response to the significant increase in orders.

179
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,070
Those two will be placed here and there.

180
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,770
  1. pin 
 2. Two cufflinks 
 3. Ring 
 4. Tie clip 

181
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,370
  Pin out.  

182
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,210
- What on earth? 
 - We apologize about that.

183
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,190
Are you alright?

184
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,760
Yes.

185
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,060
  Cufflinks out.  

186
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,800
CEO, here.

187
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,940
Oh thanks.

188
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,050
  Baek  

189
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,950
You made this yourself?

190
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,810
I'm pretty good at sewing.

191
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,740
- Where's the bathoom? 
 - Right this way.

192
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,680
I'll wash it and get it back to you.

193
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,690
- You don't need to. 
 - No, it's okay.

194
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,070
- Excuse me, I'm going to go to the ladies' room. 
 - Okay.

195
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,530
 3. Ring 
 4. Tie clip 

196
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,620
  Ring out. Tie clip is the only option.  

197
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,940
Let me introduce you to the person in charge of the construction of the external facilities.

198
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,110
- Nice to meet you. 
 - I'm looking forward to working with you.

199
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,970
You're so handsome.

200
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,100
♫   If you've ever been in love   ♫

201
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,890
  At Il Gwang?  

202
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,620
♫   I know you feel this beat   ♫

203
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,550
♫   If you know it, don't be shy   ♫

204
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,020
  You bastard!  

205
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,950
As you can see, I'm meeting other women and living fine without you,

206
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,150
so just leave!

207
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,420
  Welcome back to the scene  

208
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,760
Hello,

209
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,300
I'm the CEO's secretary, B-B-Baek

210
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,700
Excuse me, Ms. Baek?

211
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,130
Now, please follow me.

212
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,780
Let's go.

213
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,010
Please follow me, Ms. Baek.

214
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,100
  Out of the many subsidiary companies, why did it have to be this one? Why?  

215
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,700
  Why, why, why?  

216
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,490
  Just look natural, try to leave without looking obvious.  

217
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,300
  You can do it, you can do it...  

218
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,950
Ms. Baek? Ms. Baek?

219
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,670
I have a request to ask of you.

220
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,230
What is it?

221
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,230
I'd like to have lunch with the CEO, whom I've always respected very much.

222
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,750
What?

223
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,190
Why are you so surprised?

224
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,090
  Safety Passage  

225
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,650
I think we've seen enough of the construction site.

226
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,140
let's call it a day.

227
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,350
Yes, that's a very good idea—

228
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,180
THE THING IS,

229
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,840
I WANT TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU, CEO!

230
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,210
  You crazy... 

231
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,260
CEO, CEO, CEO!

232
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,070
CEO, CEO!

233
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,190
Aunties, since we specially invited the CEO to join us,

234
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,240
please serve us your best dishes!

235
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,340
Thank you so much.

236
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,800
I wanted to have a time like this earlier,

237
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,550
and thanks to Chief Woo, I'm glad to have a special time with you all.

238
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,460
Anyway, until we finish the development of the NAND Flash, which represents our company's livelihood,

239
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,030
please work hard during the construction.

240
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,730
Applause!

241
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,540
You should eat, even a little bit.

242
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,540
I have no appetite because of my cold.

243
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:43,220
If you didn't feel well, you didn't have to follow me here.

244
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,840
What is Department Head Byeon doing sending a newbie secretary to a formal visit?

245
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,620
Even if he is busy, he should have chosen the right time to do so.

246
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,760
W-W-Wait.

247
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,500
 She was hired externally and comes in once a week. 

248
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,040
 Executive Director Myeong personally hired her. 

249
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:52,300
It seems like you don't have an appetite. Should I bring you some nurungji (scorched rice in water)?

250
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,100
Chief Woo, don't you have a girlfriend?

251
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,500
You look like one to have a lot of girls.

252
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,700
Don't even mention it. Our Chief Woo

253
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,500
has such little luck with females.

254
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,200
Actually, not long ago, I went on a blind date with the intention of marriage.

255
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,300
Oh gosh. Are you okay?

256
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,500
Water. Water. Have some water.

257
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,900
Don't even talk about it. She was crazy.

258
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,900
A nutjob.

259
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
How was she?

260
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,400
After that day,

261
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,800
I have been getting physical therapy.

262
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,100
Physical therapy?

263
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,000
The woman I met at the blind date was—

264
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,300
So, the woman I met at the blind date was—

265
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,400
That woman was so crazy, she—

266
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,700
CEO, I think we have to go now.

267
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,000
We can take our time though.

268
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,900
So, what's with that woman?

269
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,800
CEO. Don't you have another schedule?

270
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,100
No, I don't have another one.

271
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,500
The following schedule...

272
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,700
Oh, the most important schedule is left, right?

273
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,900
Right?

274
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,300
So, the woman at the blind date—

275
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,300
Tell me about that blind date next time.

276
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
- Let's go. 
 - I'm sorry? N-Next time? When?

277
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,700
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

278
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,100
Please take us back to the office.

279
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,200
No. I need to stop by a place.

280
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,100
The construction site inspection was our last outdoor schedule.

281
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,100
The most important schedule is left.

282
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,500
Is that an unofficial schedule?

283
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,100
You will know when we get there.

284
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,800
Okay.

285
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,100
  The sudden death of Kang Woo Won's manager has been a hot topic.  

286
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,500
  After the release of a video showing Kang Woo Won's past actions,  

287
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,700
  his character became a controversy amongst the netizens.  

288
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
  But this doesn't make sense.  

289
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,300
  Why is the manager's suicide Kang Woo Won's fault?  

290
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,500
  It began with what Mr. Pi posted on his social media.  

291
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,700
  When he was in charge of Kang Woo Won, he wrote "I'm stressed," "I want to die,"  

292
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,300
  "I want to leave this country." Extreme writings like these kept on being posted. 

293
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,900
  He must have wanted to die because of Kang Woo Won— 

294
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,500
  Someone like you  

295
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,500
  - should die. 
 - Go out and die.  

296
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
  - Die. Die. Die. Die. 
 - Why aren't you dying? 

297
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,900
  I told you to die.  

298
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,500
  Die.  

299
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,900
Isn't Kang Woo Won hella annoying?

300
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,600
We barely managed to sign him as a model yet he caused a huge accident.

301
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,700
Now our rice cooker gained a horrible image.

302
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,900
At least it's not driving under the influence or drugs.

303
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,700
This is worse. A person died.

304
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,900
His casting in Kim Yuri's drama will probably disappear, and advertisement contracts will be terminated one by one.

305
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,100
Shouldn't we get rid of Kang Woo Won's advertisements, too?

306
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,700
I'm sure the higher officials will take care of it.

307
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,220
Hey, Im!

308
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,300
Im!

309
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,500
Yes?

310
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,300
The team leader is calling for you. Get a hold of yourself.

311
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,500
The team atmosphere is already bad in the first place.

312
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,960
Go to Kang Woo Won's house and get the contract termination signed.

313
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,300
Contract termination?

314
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,800
And this. It's the breach of contract penalty.

315
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,300
The response to the advertisement was great and the number of orders increased as well.

316
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,900
Do we have to go all the way and terminate the contract?

317
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,500
Kang Woo Won must be having a hard time right now.

318
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,900
We're not a charity that earns money

319
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,300
to help celebrities that cause accidents.

320
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,500
It's the perfect timing to break the deal.

321
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,700
This is only the beginning.

322
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,900
Beginning?

323
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,900
The beginning of Kang Woo Won's demise.

324
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,500
The beginning of his demise.

325
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,900
Do I have to go?

326
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
We can send it through registered mail.

327
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,100
If he doesn't accept it, it'll be a headache.

328
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,700
Make sure he receives and signs it.

329
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,500
Yeah. It's what I had been hoping for.

330
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,700
I can finally escape from Kang Woo Won

331
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,500
and return to a normal life.

332
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,900
How can I tell him?

333
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,500
I can't do it. I can never do it.

334
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,500
Poppy. Why do you look like this?

335
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,100
When was the last time he left the house?

336
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,080
Woo Won.

337
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,400
Kang Woo Won.

338
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,800
  How to use a rice cooker  

339
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,800
  I said I'll give you the instructions again.  

340
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,500
 Why are you taking something you already gave to me? 

341
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,300
 It was originally mine. 

342
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,100
 Taking after giving is really shameless. 

343
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,900
 I told you I'll give it to you again. 

344
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,000
Woo Won.

345
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,900
Woo Won! Kang Woo Won!

346
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,500
What should I do? Ah, right.

347
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,500
119.

348
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
119. 119.

349
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,300
Are you okay?

350
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,000
No need to make a fuss. I'm not dying.

351
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,700
Are you regaining your senses?

352
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,300
Are you sure you're okay?

353
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,900
I just took a couple of sleeping pills because I couldn't fall asleep.

354
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,700
It doesn't seem like a couple.

355
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,900
Why did you come here?

356
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,500
I...

357
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,200
It's nothing.

358
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,100
Do you also think that way?

359
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,900
Think what?

360
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,600
Pi Cheol Woong. That he died because of me.

361
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,300
No.

362
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,300
I don't believe that. Never.

363
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,100
Why?

364
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Because...

365
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,690
It's not your fault.

366
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,500
It's not because of you...

367
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,740
 It's because of us. 

368
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,300
As expected.

369
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,700
I know you said it out of pity. Just leave.

370
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,800
Go away!

371
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,000
You said it was an important schedule.

372
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,010
I'll teach you. Try it.

373
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,300
That's fine. I'm good.

374
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,690
No one starts out perfect.

375
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,950
I also used to suck.

376
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,950
Try it. I'll teach you.

377
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,470
Hurry. Stabilize it with your arm.

378
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,210
Now, place it near your chin.

379
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,530
Keep your eyes open. Open your eyes.

380
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,890
You immediately— You're good at this.

381
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,770
That's a shame. You could have hit it.

382
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,270
It's pretty hard.

383
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,320
I told you it's not easy.

384
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,400
How many shots do you have to make to get the large doll?

385
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,410
It's impossible.

386
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,870
For the small doll, it takes about... 50 shots.

387
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,310
If it's 50 shots... ₩50,000 ($50)?

388
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:49,740
If you collect 50 small dolls, you can get a large one.

389
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:00,010
The place you stopped by every time you worked outside of your office was...

390
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,900
That one what the hardest one to get.

391
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,000
It took about 100 shots. Was it 150 shots?

392
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,730
150 shots...

393
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,120
I've collected about 30 dolls,

394
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,970
so I should be able to trade them for a large one soon.

395
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,210
You want a large doll?

396
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,040
Why else would I be collecting these?

397
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,430
I drop by whenever I think of my father.

398
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,890
Your father?

399
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,800
When I was young, I often went hunting with my father.

400
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,740
We didn't catch anything and always went to eat at a restaurant.

401
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,640
He said I was too much of a coward

402
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,920
and that a man shouldn't be like that.

403
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,940
So he deliberately took me with him.

404
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,140
Still, I thought they were prettier to look at

405
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,490
than to hunt.

406
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,580
You two strangely look alike.

407
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,980
I also hit males.

408
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,830
It'll probably just feel ticklish.

409
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,080
My hands are small

410
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,280
but they are quite spicy (her hits are strong).

411
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,930
  What. What. What are you doing? 

412
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,930
  My hands are small but they are quite spicy.  

413
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,580
  Stay still.  

414
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,730
♫  It's already out  ♫

415
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:34,000
♫  Will it seem too much? Will I look easy?  ♫

416
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,180
What's wrong?

417
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,760
♫  So should I confess first?  ♫

418
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,280
It's late.

419
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,230
Let's go back.

420
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,280
Did you take a look at the necktie pin?

421
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,470
Executive Director Myeong wears this pin every day of the year so I'm sure it contains the sensor.

422
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,080
But wow. This is

423
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,800
a limited edition item from a luxury brand.

424
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,990
There are less than 100 of these in Korea

425
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,670
but the purchase list that Ye Eun acquired doesn't include Executive Director Myeong's name.

426
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,210
Can't we just make a replica?

427
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,410
You probably don't know because you only use knock-offs

428
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,790
but luxury goods are numbered at the back so it's easy to get caught.

429
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,890
We can just return it before we get caught. There's no time so make one immediately.

430
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:24,290
Immediately? There are only a few 3D printers in the NIS.

431
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,250
Let's say I get in without being noticed.

432
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,100
The machine is difficult to operate.

433
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,460
- Finish making it by the time we get off work. 
 - Hang up.

434
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,190
Ah seriously...

435
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,350
They're just saying whatever because they're not the ones doing it.

436
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,900
You sure are coming frequently.

437
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,950
Why are you being like that? I just came to remind you

438
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,480
since it seemed like you forgot about our promise.

439
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,460
- Promise? 
 - I will raise your reputation as the CEO

440
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,120
and you fill my father's pockets in return.

441
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,420
It seemed like you forgot.

442
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,570
I'm still thinking... whether it's worth the deal.

443
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,970
Or if I even need the deal.

444
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,890
So you became a CEO, not because it was your father's long-cherished wish,

445
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,670
but for another ulterior motive.

446
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,920
Ulterior motive?

447
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,580
I'm sure Yoon Seok Ho is the only one that knows what he wants

448
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,290
and why he changed his mind.

449
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,040
That's right. I changed my mind.

450
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,960
I no longer wanted to live while tolerating and hiding my feelings.

451
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,050
Since when?

452
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,660
If you keep going astray, I'm going to sell all my shares.

453
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,490
Who should I sell them to, to make the most profit?

454
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,690
- Did you get hurt? 
 - I'm fine.

455
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,130
Leave it alone.

456
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,920
I'll clean it up. You should have been careful.

457
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,500
CEO, I'm thankful for your help,

458
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,020
but if you keep doing this, it'll be troublesome.

459
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,260
I see. I just can't help myself.

460
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,510
I'll clean this up immediately.

461
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,270
Why are you surprised?

462
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,500
As if you did something wrong.

463
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,810
I thought you already left.

464
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,610
This is a great spot.

465
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,100
If there's something you need, feel free to let me know.

466
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,600
I now know... why you sit here.

467
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,910
I guess you didn't know before, when you had me followed.

468
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,280
  Hey. Hey. Hey!  

469
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,100
Does CEO Yoon know who you are?

470
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,920
You sure have a lot of interest in a mere secretary.

471
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,970
If I knew you weren't a mere secretary,

472
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,710
I would have gotten rid of you earlier.

473
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,850
  You have a new message.  

474
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,070
  A package is being delivered~  

475
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,490
Let's get to work.

476
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,920
 The duplicate doesn't have a serial number on the back. 

477
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,890
- The target is coming in. 
 - Okay.

478
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,210
 You are to complete the mission before he notices. 

479
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,240
My goodness. I'm so sorry. What should I do?

480
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,970
How can you use something dirty? Get it away!

481
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,340
- I'm sorry. 
 - You should've been more careful.

482
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,560
Oh, this valuable thing. I...

483
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,820
What are you doing? Clean the floor completely.

484
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,420
Yes. I will clean it up.

485
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,030
A new city will be developed on highly-valued land.

486
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,900
We are giving our VVIP customers a special chance to take the deal!

487
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,140
- Your investment will be worthwhile. 
 - It's fine.

488
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,230
The serial number is...

489
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,460
Why is there none?

490
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,180
It doesn't have one.

491
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,500
Maybe I should have engraved some random numbers on it.

492
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,040
It's not like that ajumma knew that it was a knock-off.

493
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,390
- It's a knock-off. 
 - It's a knock-off?

494
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,690
Yeah. The cuff buttons and stuff were all knock offs.

495
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,960
- I was nervous for no reason. 
 - Wow.

496
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,500
Ah, that nutjob.

497
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:14,320
♫

498
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,800
♫

499
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,860
♫

500
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,760
Eat. Eat.

501
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,850
Is it okay for us to keep getting stuff from Secretary Byeon?

502
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,760
- He said he'll treat us again when he gets his monthly salary. 
 - Again?

503
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,420
Alright, then I'll treat you guys next time.

504
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,740
Enjoy your meal.

505
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,270
What's with that monitor?

506
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,330
Why? What's wrong?

507
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,490
It went out again.

508
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:52,200
  Emergency Elevators  

509
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,570
You have at most ten minutes.

510
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,660
- Oh? What happened? 
 - I think it's a power outage.

511
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,360
Go turn on the backup generator.

512
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,590
- Hurry up! 
 - Got it.

513
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,240
Okay. Ten minutes. Start.

514
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,790
 Business Expenses and Business Council Budget 

515
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,120
The security team is here. Come out quickly. Quickly!

516
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,870
Why isn't the door opening?

517
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,640
- Hurry and bring the master key. 
 - Yes, right away.

518
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,430
What is she doing? Time's almost up.

519
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,090
Oh? It's back up.

520
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,550
What happened?

521
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,080
What were you doing in my office?

522
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,620
CEO Yoon's secretary?

523
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,890
I also thought it was weird. I was going to make a report.

524
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:12,690
How did you get into my office?

525
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,750
 A fake necktie pin wouldn't have opened it. 

526
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,960
As I mentioned before, the door

527
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,310
was already open when I arrived.

528
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:36,140
 It was a trap set by a cunning viper. 

529
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,380
Why isn't Baek Chan Mi coming out?

530
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,000
I don't know.

531
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,050
Our call was cut off in the middle.

532
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:51,820
 Emergency Elevators 

533
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,990
Why were you in my office?

534
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:58,150
When I stopped by during the day,

535
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:01,430
I accidentally dropped an important letter.

536
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:13,970
You're saying that you came to an office, without its owner present, in the middle of the night to look for this?

537
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,630
Do you expect me to believe that?

538
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:20,740
I understand your suspicion but it's true.

539
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,980
 This letter originated in New England 

540
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,520
 and circulated once every year 

541
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,870
 to give people luck. 

542
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,070
Are you playing with me?

543
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,100
Check the CCTV.

544
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,230
I'm sorry but due to the power outage,

545
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,950
the CCTV was turned off.

546
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,600
Do a body check.

547
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:00,050
What are you doing? Begin searching!

548
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:02,940
Don't leave even a single strand of hair untouched.

549
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,470
Go ahead and search.

550
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:13,370
Everything

551
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,130
including my hair.

552
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,130
  Standards to Sexual Harassment in the Workplace  

553
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,080
What is this?

554
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,840
My secretary robbed your office?

555
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,730
It's exactly as I said.

556
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:10,400
What do you want me to do? If it's something you weren't aware of, I'll hand them over to the police.

557
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:17,330
  If something happens to me, you have nothing to do with me.  

558
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,010
Where are you right now?

559
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:34,410
Your new secretary did something cheeky.

560
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,310
She acted like she was innocent to the end so I had no choice but to listen to her boss' explanation.

561
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,680
I heard nothing was found in the body search.

562
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,600
Don't frame an innocent person and let her go.

563
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,650
It just so happens that the CCTV was off at that moment so it's suspicious.

564
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,870
It will make it difficult for me if you come off so directly.

565
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:00,830
If you are in a tight spot, that's your problem.

566
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:07,380
It makes me feel disgusted to see my employee get suspected without reason.

567
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:21,690
If there's a rumor that the CEO's secretary crawled into the Executive Director's office,

568
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,830
I don't think I'll be the one put in a tight spot.

569
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:26,830
Do as you wish.

570
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,180
Isn't it a problem legally?

571
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,360
This is the first time this kind of situation occurred.

572
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,920
She's not a full-time employee, but a contract worker, I think handing her over to the police is...

573
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,230
No, no.

574
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:46,490
Handing her over will only get her charged with trespassing. Reporting her to the NIS is better.

575
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:50,460
You never know. She might be an industrial spy.

576
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,750
What are you doing right now?

577
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,170
Seeing as to how she's still not out, something must have happened.

578
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:14,780
If Chan Mi was caught, what happens to her?

579
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,510
We're not in the middle of an operation, so it's up to the disciplinary committee.

580
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:20,230
The three of us, too.

581
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:24,990
We'd be lucky if it's just the disciplinary committee. If the police are involved, we'll be ousted from the NIS.

582
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:27,650
We'll be ousted in life, too.

583
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:36,330
It seems like you can't trust your secretary either.

584
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,540
There's nothing to worry about if there are no problems, no?

585
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,120
You should be careful with what you say.

586
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,570
We'll know what's true once it's revealed.

587
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,320
I told you to be careful.

588
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,900
It seems like you are the one who's being irrational and needs to be careful.

589
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:05,490
You see, if that rat over there is a bug that came into nibble and eat at the company,

590
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:10,850
I will make sure to have her rot in jail.

591
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,300
Do you really think I can't do that?

592
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,680
I heard that you personally picked your secretary.

593
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:25,660
Don't tell me that you are also involved in this.

594
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:54,780
 Il Gwang HiTech 

595
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:02,690
I'm sorry, CEO.

596
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,470
I said this before.

597
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:11,750
I can work with someone who doesn't do a good job. But I can't with someone I can't trust.

598
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:17,000
I'll accept any punishment you give me.

599
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,350
I have never given anyone a second chance.

600
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:25,400
Why did you...

601
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,080
Goodnight.

602
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:57,450
Wait. How did you get out?

603
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,330
There's no reason for Executive Director Myeong to let you go easily.

604
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:01,700
I also don't know

605
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,490
how I managed to come out.

606
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,060
  What is it that you want? 

607
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:15,610
  Pass me the rights to the NAND Flash project. 

608
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,280
  Take it and fuck off. 

609
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,790
 I'll be leaving with my secretary. 

610
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,460
It has a fingerprint lock.

611
00:56:55,970 --> 00:57:01,630
 When I stopped by during the day, I accidentally dropped an important letter. 

612
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,490
Where's the safe located?

613
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:06,490
Under the table.

614
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,930
Are you sure it's a fingerprint lock?

615
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:15,650
Just as you told me, he didn't have to buy the latest model. I'm sure.

616
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,720
That's a shame. If it needed a vein scan, we could have peeled his flesh off.

617
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:25,220
If it was an iris scan, we could have plucked his eyeballs  out.

618
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:28,340
Anyway, the sun will rise soon. We just need a few hours to get his fingerprint.

619
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,470
Let's speed it up.

620
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,020
 Ninhydrin Spray 

621
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,200
Myeong Gye Cheol comes to work at 6 AM sharp. We don't have much time, so hurry.

622
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,940
6 AM...

623
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,770
It's a piece of cake, then.

624
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,960
  Take a break.  

625
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,630
He's right on time.

626
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,060
Our guest is making his entrance.

627
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,170
  Error. Try again.  

628
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,000
  Error. Try again.  

629
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,840
This is driving me nuts.

630
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,490
Ta-da.

631
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:07,790
What are you doing? Get out of there.

632
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:09,460
Okay.

633
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:38,850
Stop.

♫  Not just anyone can love her, this girl of mine  ♫

635
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,630
♫  Is really, really selfish  ♫

636
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:14,360
♫  No one could ever love her  ♫

637

♫  That is a really, really big miracle for me  ♫

  Good Casting 
Preview 

639
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,960
 Director Seo was the traitor? 

640
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,310
 I was only moving based on an anonymous tip. 

641
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:28,660
 I'm suspicious that Director Seo could be Michael. 

642
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,260
 It will be over once we get the video in our hands. 

643
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,880
 Do you have Executive Director's ledger? 

644
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,330
  Are you sure that you have the video of Michael?  

645
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:35,850
 I'll wait for you to get up and back on track. 

646
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:37,060
  Because of that darn fine dust...  

647
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,190
 That's because Michael and Baek Chan Mi are in the same league. 

648
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,170
 Were you the one that killed Agent Kwon Min Seok? 

649
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,320
 I killed him. 

650
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,190
 Don't let your emotions take you over.  

651
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:45,870
 He trusted me but I used that to my advantage. 

652
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,700
 The problem is that Director Seo might not be the end. 

653
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,870
 Baek Chan Mi. 

654
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,040
♫  Red backpack  ♫

 Epilogue 

656
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,950
You're continuously being treated but there's no improvement.

657
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:08,590
If you erect buildings, there are times like these.

658
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:14,820
Things go wrong when you try to erect a building on places with bad foundations.

659
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,570
What do you do then?

660
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:19,480
You must tear them down and rebuild them.

661
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,300
But when it comes to the human body,

662
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:27,210
once you get hurt, it's hard to recover.

663
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,200
How did you get injured again?

664
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,460
- I was hit. 
 - I was hit.

665
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,130
Ah... both of you?

666
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,380
This injury isn't something you get from a fistfight.

667
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,310
Where you mobbed by a gang?

668
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,480
It was a one-on-one.

669
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:56,210
Your opponent must have been really good then.

670
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,900
I totally underestimated her.

671
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:04,760
 You made the first offense, right? 

672
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,650
If that's the case, consider yourselves lucky to be in this state,

673
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:11,450
since it seems like your opponent was a male with a strong build.

674
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,320
It could have been worse.

675
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,860
This will hurt a bit.

676
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,890
I should not have met her in the first place.

677
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:29,500
I should not have been cocky in the first place.

678
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:34,920
For some reason, I can't get that woman out of my head today.

679
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,540
Woman?

680
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:40,380
- Baek Chan Mi! 
 - Hey!

681
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,850
♫  Do you perhaps know about perception?  ♫

682
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:47,530
♫  The perception that’s about sense. Make a choice  ♫

683
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:52,900
