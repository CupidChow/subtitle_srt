1
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:37,999
Pull up another screen.

2
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,499
Stop!

3
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:44,099
Zoom in.

4
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:50,499
Isn't that a tattoo?

5
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:02,899
You saw him for 7.2 seconds. You were facing him for 7 seconds.

6
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,499
Does it make sense that you can't remember?

7
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:08,099
We always order the same food from the same restaurant.

8
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:10,299
How can I remember the face of the delivery man every time?

9
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,699
Exactly, that's your everyday job. Because you slacked every day, someone died!

10
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:21,099
Along with the death report, write an apology letter.

11
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:30,099
No matter how much of a crooked bastard Michael is, I didn't think

12
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,499
 Episode 13 
 he would come into the NIS.

13
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:37,899
If we'd got to Director Seo a bit earlier...

14
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,499
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:44,799
  National Intelligence Service Director Seo Gook Hwan  

16
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,899
Store all the things from Director Seo's room separately.

17
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:52,799
Yes, I understand.

18
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,299
Team Leader. Poison has been found in the food that Director Seo consumed.

19
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,299
What is it?

20
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:04,899
What was it called? Batrachotoxin?

21
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,699
It doesn't sound like a chemical. What is it?

22
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:10,299
It's a natural toxin that's more potent than tetrodotoxin.

23
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:15,499
Two micrograms would 100% lead to death. Once it spreads, there's no antidote.

24
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:18,499
They sure were determined to cut his lifeline.

25
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:23,099
What's Chief Ok up to?

26
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,899
We're still watching him. He hasn't made any notable moves.

27
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:30,299
Keep watching him. He's a stinky fellow.

28
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:32,399
Understood.

29
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,099
I hope you're aware that the CBT for the third phase is in one month.

30
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,299
Yes, of course.

31
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:48,299
Then you should know that the chip must be in my hands by this weekend, at the latest.

32
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,899
Yes. I'm sorry to say this,

33
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:55,099
but I haven't been able to see the sun and have been stuck in the lab.

34
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,499
I really had a hard time.

35
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:02,099
Are you telling me to give you a monetary incentive?

36
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,899
If you were to show the utmost concern towards me, I would gain strength.

37
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:08,099
You want to make a bargain with me.

38
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,799
Have you heard the news? Director Seo, who was being investigated by Internal Affairs died.

39
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,999
It's such a shame he ended up like that at such a prime age. But fortunately,

40
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,699
he was able to have a warm bowl of rice soup on his way to the afterlife.

41
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:27,099
He might have felt wronged, but at least he left with a full belly.

42
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,699
What did you say?

43
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,099
To show the utmost concern?

44
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,299
No.

45
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,599
I'll make sure to complete the third phase—

46
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,299
He hung up.

47
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:52,199
Damn.

48
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:58,999
If someone is talking, he should listen to the end.

49
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:08,499
He... doesn't have... basic manners.

50
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,499
  Important Guidelines 
 Sender: White Collar 

51
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,699
 Once we get the chip with the development of the third phase, we should get rid of the priming water. 

52
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,099
  Chief Ok knows too much. We don't need to take him with us. 

53
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,799
 The trash needs to be thrown out before it starts to smell. 

54
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,509
That's Director Seo's killer. Does he look like the Michael you saw in the video?

55
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,099
I don't know.

56
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:01,099
Think back carefully! You know that you're the only one who saw the video.

57
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:04,699
Is there any other picture? Any picture where I can at least get a glimpse of him?

58
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,799
If I had it, I would have brought it.

59
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:12,549
Wait a minute... this tattoo.

60
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:23,499
The letter M. It's the same tattoo he had.

61
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:26,899
So there's a possibility that this guy could be Michael, right?

62
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:29,299
Do you remember seeing this tattoo on Michael?

63
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:32,399
He could have gotten a new one within the three years.

64
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,299
Please stop!

65
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:40,499
He can be the same culprit who shot you. Think about it carefully.

66
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,499
What are you doing with a patient right now?!

67
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,899
Differentiate when you can interfere!

68
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,299
Get her attending doctor's permission first. Before then, I won't be allowing this.

69
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:52,699
Who are you to give permission?

70
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:56,899
I'm warning you, don't interfere.

71
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:00,899
I don't have time to deal with someone who interferes with our operation.

72
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,299
I don't care about your operation,

73
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:07,999
but don't make someone who almost died relive her nightmare.

74
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,899
Who are you?

75
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,499
Then who are you?

76
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,699
Gosh! Seriously!

77
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:40,099
Sunbae.

78
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:46,699
How can you just move as you wish? Your wound might get worse.

79
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:49,099
There's something I have to check.

80
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:51,099
Where are you going to go?

81
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:52,099
Home.

82
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,399
You want to get discharged?

83
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:56,499
You can't.

84
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,799
It's urgent. I can't send you out alone. Never.

85
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,299
What is all this?

86
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,699
The culprit I saw from the video...

87
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,299
He was definitely familiar. He's someone I know.

88
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,499
Even the humming sound.

89
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:39,499
Where was it from? I heard it somewhere.

90
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:42,099
Do it later.

91
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:45,299
Stop it!

92
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:53,299
Please take care of your own body first.

93
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,499
What is all this?

94
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:04,099
How crazy do you have to be to─

95
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,299
If you're like this Sunbae, I...

96
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:11,499
I just did what I had to do.

97
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:16,299
I become sorry.

98
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:22,599
Don't say that. The one who has to apologize is me, not you.

99
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:29,099
As for Min Seok, I am really sorry.

100
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,899
Thank you.

101
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,969
My oppa...

102
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,899
You didn't forget him and continuously went after the culprit.

103
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,779
I saw the video you left at the charnel house.

104
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:53,599
And I realized...

105
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,599
My oppa...

106
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:01,899
He must have been happy.

107
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:07,299
He was alone his whole life and was lonely,

108
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:12,739
but he must have felt warm because of you.

109
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,919
I felt relieved.

110
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,999
It's so fortunate...

111
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:33,199
that a person like you is my oppa's team leader.

112
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:40,009
And, that you're on the same team as me.

113
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:47,479
So never think about running away by yourself,

114
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,199
but just stick to our team.

115
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,299
You even know how to console a person.

116
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,499
Do you think that's the only thing I can do?

117
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,699
I can also take revenge.

118
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,699
Revenge?

119
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:07,799
I can never forgive Michael.

120
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:15,399
For taking my husband's life and also destroying your life.

121
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:26,289
So let's do it together.

122
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,499
But first take care of your body.

123
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:47,199
Please take care of yourself.

124
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:10,099
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

125
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:13,099
Did you know how surprised I was that you suddenly disappeared?

126
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:14,499
How did you find me?

127
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:17,099
I went everywhere you could have gone.

128
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:21,099
I didn't think you would go back home once you got discharged, so I went around like a crazy person.

129
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:25,699
Sorry. It wasn't a situation where I could tell you.

130
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:34,769
If you're sorry, let's go have some rice cake ramen.

131
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:41,499
You and your rice cake ramen. I'm sick of it.

132
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,799
The restaurant from before is still there.

133
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:46,899
They're still there?

134
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,539
  Mimi's Neighborhood Restaurant  

135
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,699
This place hasn't changed one bit.

136
00:11:55,699 --> 00:12:00,099
You'll be coming back to work, right?

137
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:02,149
I'll see.

138
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:06,719
Just do it. Until you're done with your operation, you can hang around the company

139
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,729
and you might get more information that could be useful.

140
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,329
That's why you came into the company in the first place.

141
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,339
Thank you for the food.

142
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,739
Enjoy your meal!

143
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,899
Thank you.

144
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:30,519
Hey, is that man from the hospital in the same team as you?

145
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:33,199
Yeah, he's our team leader.

146
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,509
You two didn't seem like just colleagues.

147
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:38,999
How should I put it...

148
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:42,999
It felt like he was overly involved in your work,

149
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:45,939
but I could be misinterpreting it.

150
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:48,739
Of course, you're misinterpreting it. It's been a long time since we broke up.

151
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:50,499
Broke up.

152
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,499
He's your ex-boyfriend?!

153
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:55,889
Yes.

154
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:58,419
So you're currently working with your ex-boyfriend?!

155
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:02,049
What does it matter whether I work with my ex-boyfriend or my ex-husband?

156
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,879
Wow, this cursed American mindset.

157
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,639
This is Korea; it isn't appropriate here.

158
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,239
You have the power as a CEO to handpick who you work with,

159
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:15,619
but I'm in a low working class, which means if I'm told to work with a psychopath, I have to.

160
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:18,959
So I'm very grateful to be working with an ex-boyfriend.

161
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,429
Then... you're sure you've broken up?

162
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,969
It seems like he still has a lot of lingering feelings.

163
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:32,599
- Then or now, he is unnecessarily too interested in my life. 
 - Wow.

164
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:36,279
Eat quickly, I have to go to work.

165
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:41,769
- Myeong— 
 - Executive Director Myeong's ledger is being analyzed by the National Intelligence Service.

166
00:13:45,109 --> 00:13:47,379
You don't even lie anymore.

167
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:53,589
I didn't get a close look, but your father's name is not in the ledger.

168
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:17,749
My father passed away while he was Executive Director Myeong's bookkeeper.

169
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,139
What does that mean?

170
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:24,829
He found out about Executive Director Myeong's ledger.

171
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:29,479
The accident happened when he was driving to Busan by himself.

172
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:34,849
I think that accident is somehow linked to Executive Director Myeong.

173
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:36,619
That's...

174
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,199
not clear yet.

175
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:46,309
That's true. It's all speculation based on context.

176
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:49,239
That's why it's frustrating.

177
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:52,679
I don't know who to blame,

178
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,639
so I keep blaming myself.

179
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,559
Seok Ho...

180
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:07,499
If you want to comfort me,

181
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:12,119
just hold my hand.

182
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:46,089
From now on, instead of trying to comfort me, which you're not good at, hold my hand.

183
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,009
You don't have to say anything. I know how you feel.

184
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,369
How do you know how I feel?

185
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,989
I don't even know how I feel.

186
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,099
There's a way to know it all.

187
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:17,949
  15 Years Ago  

188
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,269
  You don't eat green onions?  

189
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,369
  Raw onion is a bit spicy so I don't like them.  

190
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,489
  Why is there so much?  

191
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:41,129
  When you love someone so much, you can't help but stare,  

192
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:45,789
  and you notice every little thing they do.  

193
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:49,759
  That's how you can see their heart.  

194
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,379
Do you know why I like rice cake ramyeon?

195
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:20,059
Didn't you always like it?

196
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,319
Let's go.

197
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:42,189
  Top Secret - Code Name 'Good Casting'  

198
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:44,419
  Good Casting  

199
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,069
There's suspicious data in Executive Director Myeong's ledger.

200
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,419
For the past three years, there's a borrowed-name account in Singapore

201
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,699
that he's been depositing into. From $50,000 to as much as $100,000.

202
00:17:56,699 --> 00:18:01,809
He made sure to send his down payment and the balance in every transaction.

203
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:04,759
The last one was November 9th, 2019,

204
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:07,749
when $50,000 was deposited. No details after that.

205
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:13,049
He's been stealing confidential data and sending money to someone.

206
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,529
- That account name is— 
 - National Intelligence Service Director Seo.

207
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,039
Why did you come? You should rest.

208
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,689
Yeah, we've been struggling for days analyzing Executive Director Myeong's ledger.

209
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,409
I knew you'd be struggling which is why I came.

210
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,179
Whoa, what is this?

211
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:39,109
Oh my goodness! It's so good.

212
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:43,109
How did you know the borrowed-name account belongs to the director?

213
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:44,799
Moo Hyeok?

214
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,719
Sunbae Chan Mi said...

215
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:51,709
  "Put in a request for cooperation to the bank and dig up all the borrowed-name accounts in the ledger."  

216
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,359
It's obviously an illegal account!

217
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,739
  Even if you dig into it, it probably belongs to someone we've never seen or heard.  

218
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:01,919
  So dig into that someone we've never seen or heard.  

219
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,069
It's obvious that... 
   it's probably someone with no relation to the director.  

220
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:10,279
  Even if he has no relation to the director and he's someone we've never heard or seen, 

221
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,119
  search through everything including his family. Everything!  

222
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,549
So that's where you caught it.

223
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:18,859
  The account holder's husband's cousin is the director's asset manager!  

224
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:22,559
Good job.

225
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:28,099
So the big reason the director was going after Executive Director Myeong's ledger is

226
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:31,109
because he was trying to hide the fact that he received dirty money?

227
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:33,949
It's so obvious and pathetic

228
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:36,039
that I can't even eat.

229
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:42,029
Anyway, the director's corruption has been revealed, even though it's too late.

230
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:47,379
Who profited the most when the director died?

231
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:51,749
Executive Director Myeong is the most likely right now.

232
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:54,889
Though, would he really kill someone over a ledger?

233
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,419
It could be more.

234
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:03,959
There might be something we don't know in the ledger. Or, there is more to hide.

235
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:07,719
Something more serious than the ledger?

236
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:09,539
What could that be?

237
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,839
We'll have to catch him to know what it is.

238
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:15,169
When is the scheduled date for the third R&amp;D announcement?

239
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,419
It's not far.

240
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,769
Executive Director Myeong will be on the move soon.

241
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:22,079
But, isn't it too quiet?

242
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:27,039
Right? He lost his ledger but he's so quiet.

243
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,309
It's suspicious.

244
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:33,129
  VIP Room 1   
   Seo Gook Hwan  

245
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:35,069
 Chief Mourner- Wife: Park Ji Seon 
 Son: Seo Ji Yong 

246
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:42,719
  It's a shame that something I valued was stolen,  

247
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:47,109
  but I gained one after losing one, so it's not too bad.    

248
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:59,479
The ledger...

249
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:04,239
They should know that the more they look into it the deeper they're digging their own grave.

250
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:10,279
If they bring that into prosecution, it'll be worth watching.

251
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:22,469
Internship termination all of a sudden?

252
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:23,709
  Notice of Employment Contract Termination  

253
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:27,859
If you don't want to leave, go get Kang Woo Won to sign his contract termination agreement.

254
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:30,919
It's one-sided breaking of the contract from the company.

255
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:37,299
I think it is unreasonable to force it on Kang Woo Won.

256
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:40,819
Then there's nothing else we can do. You can leave.

257
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:42,219
Chief...

258
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,819
Society is a jungle.

259
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,739
Either you get eaten or someone else does.

260
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:51,309
If you don't like both, then go relax at home.

00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:39,139
Let's take a break.

Make sure to match the line, damn it.

274
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,719
  Advertising Contract Termination  

275
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:56,899
  I heard that one woman from the advertising team came to get your signature but just left.  

276
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:59,479
  Looks like she got fired because of that.  

277
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:03,079
 She got fired? 

278
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,879
  Kang Woo Won!  

279
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,059
  Why did you come here?  

280
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,719
  It's nothing.  

281
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,419
Should we get started now?

282
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:22,429
Hey, where are you going?

283
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:25,409
Kang Woo Won! Where are you going?

284
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:34,959
  If you weren't today's you,  

285
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:38,199
  I would have forever not known what love is.  

286
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:43,899
  Thank you for teaching me how to love.  

287
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:48,339
  And for teaching me how to receive love.  

288
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:54,649
  Are you not going to do your lines?  

289
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:00,419
  If it's not bipolar disorder?  

290
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:03,089
  Your mood goes up and down, you space out sometimes, 

291
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,089
 and you cling on to pointless things. 

292
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:07,989
  Well then...  

293
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,939
  Then what is it?  

294
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:17,359
  Something deadlier than fine dust. You've fallen in love.  

295
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:36,849
What... Why is Kang Woo Won here?

296
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:39,979
Oh no!

297
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:49,579
You, keep in mind what I'm about to tell you.

298
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:54,009
If you quietly stay in your lane, you'll be average at the very least.

299
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:57,699
This is what happens when you get in the way and then volunteer to take on Kang Woo Won for no reason.

300
00:24:57,699 --> 00:24:59,409
  Kang Woo Won File  

301
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:02,519
You can give that to me.

302
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:08,899
I made that file myself so I'll be taking it with me.

303
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:11,479
Why would you take the advertising team's material?

304
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:14,359
It's not the advertising team's.

305
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:17,679
And it contains personal information on Kang Woo Won.

306
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,079
If it gets leaked, it could turn into a big problem.

307
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:23,379
Which is even more reason why you should give it—

308
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:27,109
You little... Did you not hear me?!

309
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:30,869
  Kang Woo Won File 

310
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:34,669
I warned you, don't get in the way.

311
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,309
You should be the one that shouldn't be getting in the way.

312
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:06,929
Who is this crazy guy?

313
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:09,859
Me? I'm the owner of this file.

314
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,429
What are you saying?

315
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:12,989
What are you doing here?

316
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,049
You...

317
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,189
Who said you can get fired?

318
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:20,179
Isn't that Kang Woo Won?

319
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,779
- I think it is him. 
 - He's so handsome.

320
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:25,309
Who said you should be belittled by this jerk?

321
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:28,199
Who said you can ignore my calls and ghost me?

322
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:30,249
Why are you making me come all the way here?!

323
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:32,899
He's so cool!

324
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:35,519
Let's talk outside.

325
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:44,619
Even if you leave, leave on your own terms.

326
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,729
Wow he's so cool!

327
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:56,399
How cool. He's so cool!

328
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:00,239
It's Kang Woo Won.

329
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,739
Why did you fire her?

330
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,699
Do I necessarily have to say?

331
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:18,579
I think you came here knowing the answer.

332
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:24,549
This idiot bent over backward working for me and listened to all my demands so that she could become full-time.

333
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:29,269
You're saying you squeeze them until they're no longer useful and you merely spit them out?

334
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:30,369
Exactly.

335
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:34,649
So you fire her the next morning? Like how you asked me to terminate my contract?

336
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:36,339
Yup.

337
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:43,189
What you want is to terminate our contract?

338
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:46,479
- What are you planning? 
 - I'll terminate it.

339
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:50,109
But you have to cancel Im Jung Eun's dismissal.

340
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:55,519
Put your affairs in order.

341
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,839
Termination of our contact should come from my side first, and this woman

342
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,639
is leaving this no-good company on her own feet.

343
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,029
How funny that someone who can't even see people for who they are

344
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:07,219
is talking about firing them.

345
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:19,119
- Kang Woo Won... 
 - Don't pull away, stay close to me.

346
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:24,259
♫   Let's love, let's love   ♫

347
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:28,799
  Stay close to me.  

348
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:31,949
♫   Let's love    ♫

349
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:38,459
♫   I will forever make you smile   ♫

350
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:46,249
What a mess.

351
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:50,849
Woo Won, let go of my hand and let's talk.

352
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:56,259
Do you not have pride? Do you need money that badly?

353
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:58,159
Is this the only company you can work for?

354
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,259
Why can't you speak up after being treated like this?

355
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:05,929
You're right, I don't have pride,

356
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:09,089
which is why I was able to meet all your demands.

357
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:12,119
I also desperately need the money.

358
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:16,309
If I become unemployed right now, I'd take the first minimum wage job

359
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:20,469
so even if I get treated poorly, I'm glad that I'm able to work

360
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:22,539
and I'm thankful for a job.

361
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:26,689
So you only stayed by my side for money?

362
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:33,649
The life you live, being able to cancel a contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars

363
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:38,349
is a luxury and whininess to people like me.

364
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:43,299
So what, you're going to go back up?

365
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:50,079
Hey! Come here!

366
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,609
Wait, r-r-right there—

367
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:10,579
- Woo Won! 
 - Are you okay?

368
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:13,719
- Kang Woo Won! 
 - I tried to say something...

369
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:16,349
Are you okay?

370
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:30,339
  You are all dead today.  

371
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:40,199
  Since I checked that you don't have any pictures, let's terminate this contract.  

372
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:50,609
  Sunbaenim!  

373
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:02,019
I remember everything!

374
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:06,659
I'm going to kill them... I'm going to kill everyone!

375
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:29,049
Hello, CEO.

376
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:30,389
Good morning.

377
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,649
Good morning, CEO.

378
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:42,989
What's wrong with him?

379
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:45,349
  Chan Mi's Comeback.  

380
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:48,269
You want me to come back to work?

381
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:50,299
Why? You don't want to?

382
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:52,229
No,

383
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:56,349
I'd be happy to. Thank you, thank you so much.

384
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,529
I'm not the person you should be thanking.

385
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,309
What?

386
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,669
It's thanks to Kang Woo Won.

387
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:07,789
Kang Woo Won said, 'he'd calmly sign 
      

388
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:11,629
so have Intern Im bring the papers.'

389
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,859
One is fighting not to get cut off

390
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:17,599
while the other is fighting to get cut off.

391
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,099
I can't watch because it's too sad.

392
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:25,369
  Ye Eun's comeback.  

393
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:29,809
Meanwhile, you got fired?

394
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,199
Do you think I wanted to get fired?

395
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:37,259
It was so hard to be careful around security guys old enough to be my sons

396
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,799
while cleaning during that time!

397
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,589
If you're not going to eat, I'll finish it.

398
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:43,999
Let go.

399
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:47,399
- Wait, the pickled radish. 
 - It wasn't included.

400
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,509
They forgot about the pickled radish again!

401
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:53,899
Pickled radish, pickled radish! Yellow pickled radish!

402
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:56,339
I can still eat well without the pickled radish.

403
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:58,449
Damn it!

404
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:04,629
You should give me an answer now.

405
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:09,529
Will you get on my boat or get stranded with CEO Yoon?

406
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:15,709
You're in too much of a hurry.

407
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:18,519
If you're too quick with the sword cutting other people's necks,

408
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,629
you could accidentally cut your own.

409
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:26,019
If you join me, I'm ready to slash with a single stroke.

410
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:29,339
I value honesty.

411
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:34,699
What you need isn't me. Isn't it my shares?

412
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:38,309
Honesty...

413
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,889
It's not that you want to send off your ex-husband, but you want to catch him.

414
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:48,609
Then we'll need to completely destroy him.

415
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:54,929
If you throw a life vest to a drowning person, who wouldn't catch it?

416
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:02,879
If the additional shares I'm going to secure are combined with yours,

417
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:06,099
we can push CEO Yoon out.

418
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:11,139
It'll cost you quite a bit to secure those shares.

419
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,939
You don't have to worry about that.

420
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:17,739
Everything will be ready within this month.

421
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:21,699
You can get it done that quickly?

422
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:32,579
  You're asking me to relocate this photo, then what will I get?  

423
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:35,759
  I'll just be sitting in the CEO's seat  

424
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:42,249
  while the true owner of Il Gwang HiTech is someone holding my leash, you.  

425
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:46,239
  True owner...  

426
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:54,479
He could be the true owner,

427
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:56,459
so why me?

428
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:07,039
What happened?

429
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,169
Secretary Baek's transfer has been put on hold.

430
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:14,649
You're going to keep the bomb next to you?

431
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,589
Call CEO Yoon. Tell him I want to meet him on Friday at 7 pm at the Royal Hotel Restaurant.

432
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:29,529
Make sure to tell him if he doesn't come, Secretary Baek will be in a difficult situation.

433
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:40,649
I think we need to clarify our titles.

434
00:35:40,649 --> 00:35:45,649
Even if you are older than me, I've got more years of experience than you

435
00:35:45,649 --> 00:35:49,909
so I should be able to talk to you casually... please.

436
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:53,229
Of course, we should definitely define how we address each other.

437
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:57,289
Right, I'm above you in a professional setting but in a social setting—

438
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:00,939
I'm Seok Ho's teacher.

439
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:06,619
So you're also a teacher to me?

440
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:10,509
They say once a teacher, you're forever their teacher...

441
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:11,999
  Six o' clock!  

442
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,869
It's time to go home.

443
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:15,299
Oh, you're leaving right at six?

444
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:17,319
Yeah I have to go to the garden.

445
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:20,629
Wow, that's how you call the National Intelligence Service (Shortened word for NIS also means 'garden').

446
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:22,939
That's so cool.

447
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:24,669
It hurt a lot back then, right?

448
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:26,909
A little.

449
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:30,089
Keep going to physical therapy or else it could turn into a chronic disease.

450
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:32,269
- I will. 
 - Here you go.

451
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:33,989
Good work.

452
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:36,179
Take care.

453
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:43,579
Something went wrong.

454
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:46,329
It feels really off.

455
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,159
Hello?

456
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:57,479
I'm sorry. The executive director has been sensitive recently,

457
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:59,109
so it's been hard to leave my desk.

458
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:03,039
It's okay, it's no problem for me to come and get it.

459
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,279
By the way, he's been staying later these days.

460
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:10,389
There was a burglar in his office before.

461
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:12,389
Really?

462
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:15,849
Thanks to that night,  I've been staying later as well.

463
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:18,599
Yes, Executive Director.

464
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,639
Make a reservation for 10 pm at Umino. Don't record the schedule.

465
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,439
Yes, will do.

466
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,979
You must be busy, I'll leave now. Thanks.

467
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:29,789
Goodbye.

468
00:37:36,299 --> 00:37:37,869
Is this Umino?

469
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:41,199
I'm making a reservation for Executive Director Myeong's dinner.

470
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:56,399
Director Ok has started moving.

471
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,899
Check the final position and send the coordinates. I'm going right now.

472
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:05,599
Executive Director Myeong urgently booked a reservation at his favorite Japanese restaurant.

473
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,839
At 10 pm?

474
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:13,079
Yes. It seems he's trying to meet someone in secret. I think we should check, considering the situation.

475
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,989
Knowing Executive Director Myeong, if we get caught, we'll definitely get blackmailed.

476
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:20,309
I will go quietly.

477
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:22,879
I'll go with you.

478
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,769
No, I'll go by myself.

479
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,819
You got hurt last time.

480
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:31,189
You can't go by yourself. I'll go with you.

481
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:35,009
Okay.

482
00:38:35,009 --> 00:38:39,489
  Ssak Ssak Clean  

483
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,799
Executive Director Myeong and Director Ok are in there?

484
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:48,229
Soon after Director Ok arrived, Executive Director Myeong went in.

485
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:51,619
It turns out this is one of Executive Director Myeong's favorite Japanese restaurant.

486
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:54,929
It's obvious the two of them are scheming.

487
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:59,689
Executive Director Myeong didn't show his tail for so long—

488
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:03,709
Over there, isn't that CEO Yoon and Secretary Byeon?

489
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:04,929
- What? 
 - Huh?

490
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:06,669
Where?

491
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:28,449
Executive Director Myeong is meeting someone in this room.

492
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,859
Executive Director Myeong is in here?!

493
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,689
They're talking in this room.

494
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:32,759
Ah, in this room!

495
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,869
In this room!

496
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:43,289
What are you doing right now?

497
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:45,429
  Secretary Baek  

498
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:47,229
Hang up quickly!

499
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:53,589
  The person you are trying to reach is not able to accept calls...  

500
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:57,609
You didn't know Yoon Seok Ho was coming?

501
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:02,549
Maybe instead of a party of two, it was a party of four.

502
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:04,799
What are you saying?

503
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:09,609
It's just odd timing that Yoon Seok Ho appeared.

504
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:12,019
It's very suspicious.

505
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:18,439
Why did they come here?

506
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,129
Did you come here to do just that?

507
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:30,449
What's wrong with this?

508
00:40:30,449 --> 00:40:33,119
You could've put up hidden cameras or wiretapping devices.

509
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,749
A paper cup is a bit unreliable, no?

510
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:39,249
Where would you even get those last minute?

511
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:40,529
I'm not the National Intelligence Service.

512
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:44,549
Why? You might as well poke a hole and look through.

513
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:48,699
Even if I wanted to do something, I didn't have time!

514
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:51,669
Your plan is to overhear, but do you even hear anything?

515
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:56,039
If you can stay quiet, I'm able to hear a little bit.

516
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:15,939
Are my ears not working?

517
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:17,749
I don't hear anything at all.

518
00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:19,599
I don't even hear breathing sounds.

519
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,099
A few words here and there! Okay?

520
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:24,099
I can hear something that sounds like words!

521
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,959
Ah...

522
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:29,059
Trusting you and coming with you...

523
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:31,639
I'm the fool here.

524
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:43,319
Perhaps, the reason you asked to meet...

525
00:41:52,189 --> 00:41:56,379
The data that'll go in here is still moving along with no issues?

526
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:58,559
Data?

527
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,329
Data?

528
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:07,909
That watch, I'm hoping to get it back as soon as possible.

529
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:12,619
Yes, I'll try as fast as I can.

530
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:18,709
Do you know why I partnered with Michael?

531
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:26,219
I thought that you trusted him because he's the most effective and efficient broker.

532
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:31,599
Why would I trust a criminal like him and use him as bait?

533
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:35,859
Michael is just a stalk.

534
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:37,289
A stalk?

535
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:43,199
It means if I climb him and get to the top, I could reach a goose that lays golden eggs.

536
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:46,549
I'm not sure what you mean.

537
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:49,009
You'll know, once this is done,

538
00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:53,279
what kind of giant was hiding behind Michael.

539
00:42:55,929 --> 00:43:00,619
Then the file that NIS Director Seo had...

540
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:09,809
What I mean is, if the file that contains your weakness is leaked,

541
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:15,319
I'm just concerned it'll turn into a big problem.

542
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:22,739
I don't know how NIS Director Seo got his hands on that file,

543
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:26,569
but the guy who played around with the copy disappeared.

544
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:31,239
If you get rid of the guy that has the original copy, it will be over.

545
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:33,929
Then Michael, too?

546
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:39,389
Once you get what you need, then you must relentlessly pull up the stalk.

547
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:41,839
Root and all.

548
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,969
Then it would be impossible to find the goods that NIS Director Seo had.

549
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:56,079
That's why we've been cleaning up, so we could bury it forever.

550
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,659
It was something that shouldn't have existed in the first place.

551
00:43:59,659 --> 00:44:07,359
Keep in mind that's what happens when you bite off more than you can chew out of greed.

552
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:13,069
I'll engrave it on my bones.

553
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:45,099
Executive Director Myeong.

554
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,129
I told you to clear out adjoining rooms when I'm here.

555
00:44:47,129 --> 00:44:51,379
I'm sorry, it was a special reservation guest.

556
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:54,449
Special reservation?

557
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:23,039
Executive Director Myeong, why all of a sudden...?

558
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,649
Hurry and get in! Get in! Hurry!

559
00:45:58,649 --> 00:46:01,779
Damn it.

560
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:20,639
It's okay, it's okay.

561
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:31,849
Didn't this vehicle just take off?

562
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:34,089
No way. No way. No way.

563
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:37,139
Hello! Hello! There's someone here!

564
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:40,399
Hey! There's someone here! Stop!

565
00:46:40,399 --> 00:46:43,349
- Hey!
 - Ah!

566
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:06,829
- Let's go after Chief Ok. 
 - Hang on.

567
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,189
CEO Yoon is not out yet.

568
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:30,629
In these modern times,

569
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:33,389
does it make sense that a cell phone doesn't have reception?

570
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:35,649
At least I brought mine.

571
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:37,149
You didn't even bring yours.

572
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:41,629
Oh, it's so cold. Can you still not get service?

573
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:46,869
Oh. I-I-I got it!

574
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:49,879
Hey. Stay still.

575
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:03,599
Just go ahead. I'll be right behind you.

576
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,989
Chan Mi, you...

577
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:31,259
I'm telling you they didn't even eat the food and just left.

578
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:57,889
It's me. Locate Secretary Byeon. Hurry!

579
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:05,019
You know, right?

580
00:49:05,439 --> 00:49:07,969
I have chronically cold hands and feet.

581
00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:23,259
F-F-Freezes! I can't. I really can't. It freezes!

582
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,209
You can do it. You run hot.

583
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:39,329
You can do it. You can do it!

584
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:41,759
There it is! Good job, good job!

585
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:44,499
It works, it works, it works.

586
00:49:44,499 --> 00:49:46,919
It worked!

587
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:08,259
 The cell phone turned on just for a moment and it was located to be at a gas station. 

588
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:10,229
Gas station?

589
00:50:16,259 --> 00:50:18,449
 Over here! 

590
00:50:31,189 --> 00:50:34,849
Hey! What are you doing?

591
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:39,319
It's because it's so cold.

592
00:50:45,649 --> 00:50:47,849
So cold!

593
00:50:57,959 --> 00:51:04,559
You're warm...

594
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:11,399
It's warm.

595
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:58,169
You crazy woman! Why are you opening my truck!

596
00:51:58,169 --> 00:52:01,419
It's so cold.

597
00:52:06,959 --> 00:52:10,269
How did you get on a refrigerated truck?

598
00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:13,389
You're lucky I tracked you guys

599
00:52:13,389 --> 00:52:18,199
or you would have been discovered at Busan harbor with frostbite.

600
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:23,259
C-CEO, do you think we can ask

601
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:26,399
for help from the NIS?

602
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:31,109
Why? What do you want help with?

603
00:53:23,019 --> 00:53:26,889
  Once we receive the microchip with the third phase technology, we should throw out the priming water.  

604
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:31,089
  Chief Ok knows too much. We don't need to take him with us. 

605
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:34,979
 The trash needs to be thrown out before it starts to smell. 

606
00:53:52,919 --> 00:53:55,779
Did that jerk catch on to us?

607
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:19,189
Why aren't you following him?

608
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,309
Something doesn't feel right.

609
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:25,889
It feels like they're luring and pranking us instead of being shadowed by us.

610
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:30,119
True. They've been circling intersections this whole time.

611
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:33,369
Sunbae Chan Mi wants us to meet up.

612
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:34,709
What?

613
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:39,239
But, she says she wants CEO Yoon Seok Ho to be there, too.

614
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:42,349
- Why does she want that jerk? 
 - Why?

615
00:54:53,759 --> 00:54:55,889
Just...

616
00:54:55,889 --> 00:54:58,539
How many NIS agents have been planted in our company?

617
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:00,269
This is all of us.

618
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:03,269
But we are only the core members.

619
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:07,299
You could say we're like the "essence."

620
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:13,609
So you're saying that Director Seo had Executive Director Myeong's weakness?

621
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:16,079
What is this?

622
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:21,799
We have to right to know too, you know?

623
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,529
Let's each share the information we have.

624
00:55:26,529 --> 00:55:30,099
You never know. We may be of some help.

625
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:39,359
Director Seo was poisoned recently.

626
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,939
What? You're saying Executive Director Myeong murdered Director Seo,

627
00:55:43,939 --> 00:55:45,719
who knew his weakness?

628
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:50,869
I don't doubt it. He's doing exactly what he did in the past.

629
00:55:52,009 --> 00:55:54,829
 Just like he did to my father. 

630
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:02,799
It'll all be revealed once we capture Executive Director Myeong.

631
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:07,359
We provided the information, so share your operational plans with us.

632
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,239
CEO.

633
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,289
What are you saying?

634
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:10,939
Don't be absurd.

635
00:56:10,939 --> 00:56:14,259
If not, I'll just have to do my own thing.

636
00:56:14,259 --> 00:56:15,149
Do your own thing?

637
00:56:15,149 --> 00:56:16,789
To you guys, Il Gwang HiTech might just be

638
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:20,179
a field you can leave when your mission is over.

639
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:23,459
But to my employees, it is a workplace they need for survival,

640
00:56:23,459 --> 00:56:27,289
and my father even gave up his life for this company.

641
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:31,589
I can't pin the fate of my company on some secret plan with no guaranteed outcome.

642
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:33,519
Never.

643
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:40,879
Let's do that. It's not like he's going to interfere with our plans.

644
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,479
We won't share any classified information.

645
00:56:50,059 --> 00:56:54,269
You. Come outside.

646
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:09,059
- Doesn't it seem like there's something between them? 
 - Gosh...

647
00:57:15,189 --> 00:57:18,569
You got the results for Secretary Byeon's background check, right?

648
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:19,719
How did you know that?

649
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:21,849
Is that important?

650
00:57:23,279 --> 00:57:28,779
Moo Hyeok only found records from before he went to study abroad. 707 Special Forces member.

651
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:34,689
He worked as a mercenary after he was discharged, accompanied Chairman Yoon to Russia as his personal bodyguard,

652
00:57:34,689 --> 00:57:35,969
and got involved with a murder case.

653
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:38,839
You're saying Chairman Yoon put some stray dog to care for his son?

654
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:41,189
I think he got caught up in the murder trial trying to save Chairman Yoon.

655
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:45,579
It's not certain since there are no official records.

656
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:48,179
The fact that he was deemed innocent with Chairman Yoon's help,

657
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:52,269
and that he studied abroad alongside Yoon Seok Ho and joined Il Gwang HiTech are confirmed.

658
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:55,559
Sounds like he'll dedicate his life to anything involving Chairman Yoon's household.

659
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,139
He's loyal.

660
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:01,689
It seems like Chairman Yoon thought

661
00:58:01,689 --> 00:58:05,929
he was the right person to protect Yoon Seok Ho from this jungle of a world.

662
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:13,209
There's something between them. I'm 100% sure.

663
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:17,319
A hundred percent. Hundred percent.

664
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:21,939
That blanket you've got on was a gift from Secretary Baek.

665
00:58:21,939 --> 00:58:24,349
For me to use so take it off.

666
00:58:24,349 --> 00:58:25,789
Take it off.

667
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:29,659
She gave it for us to share. Not just for you.

668
00:58:29,659 --> 00:58:34,149
And I'm the one who put his hand in the ice water and got frostbite on his toes.

669
00:58:34,149 --> 00:58:35,999
They won't even move. Oh.

670
00:58:35,999 --> 00:58:38,139
Look. Look at this.

671
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:43,369
Your body runs hot.

672
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:48,589
Whether your body runs hot or cold, everyone freezes at -25 degrees Celsius.

673
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:52,459
You run hot. You were born from fire.

674
00:58:52,459 --> 00:58:54,589
Take it. Take it. Take it.

675
00:58:56,279 --> 00:59:00,799
So we're sure that Director Seo holds the key to capturing Executive Director Myeong.

676
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,479
I wonder what that is.

677
00:59:02,479 --> 00:59:06,919
Why wonder? We can go find out right away.

678
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,999
There's only one way.

679
00:59:08,999 --> 00:59:12,859
We have to ask the dead.

680
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:18,989
  NIS Safe House 

681
00:59:31,979 --> 00:59:33,889
You eat it first.

682
00:59:34,659 --> 00:59:37,389
Eat if first, you punk!

683
01:00:08,269 --> 01:00:12,009
If you couldn't catch the rat that crawled into his hole on his own and he got away,

684
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:14,089
shouldn't you be doing everything to catch it?

685
01:00:14,089 --> 01:00:17,889
How long do I have to stay cooped up in here?!

686
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:23,299
That's why I came, to catch everyone.

687
01:00:23,299 --> 01:00:27,699
I know that you're holding the Pandora's Box.

688
01:00:28,949 --> 01:00:31,759
What nonsense are you saying?

689
01:00:31,759 --> 01:00:36,419
A secret that should never be revealed to the world.

690
01:00:36,419 --> 01:00:38,939
What is that exactly?

691
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:46,879
If I say it and reveal the secret, can you take responsibility?

692
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:50,979
So there is something.

693
01:00:50,979 --> 01:00:56,419
The item that Executive Director Myeong holds on to dearly?

694
01:00:56,419 --> 01:01:02,149
I heard you haven't found Division Director Tak's body yet. How could I trust you and speak openly?

695
01:01:02,149 --> 01:01:06,899
Which is why you should just give us the item instead of opening your mouth.

696
01:01:06,899 --> 01:01:12,569
We'll catch the rat and close up the rat hole like you want.

697
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:17,049
You think Executive Director Myeong will be caught that easily?

698
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,069
You won't cooperate until the end.

699
01:01:19,069 --> 01:01:26,879
If Executive Director Myeong was an easy person to catch, he wouldn't have been able to get to where he is today.

700
01:01:26,879 --> 01:01:33,269
For everyone that gets in his way, he'll clean them out and trample on them without even blinking an eye!

701
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:38,139
NIS Director Seo is still alive?

702
01:01:51,509 --> 01:01:53,899
Those NIS sons of bitches.

703
01:01:53,899 --> 01:01:56,889
I'm not very greedy.

704
01:01:56,889 --> 01:02:05,049
If you give me half of what the director received, I'll remove my weight.

705
01:02:05,049 --> 01:02:07,339
Why would I trust you?

706
01:02:09,149 --> 01:02:15,729
But then who knows. If the director's hiding spot burns down, then I could trust you.

707
01:02:21,749 --> 01:02:26,099
I feel like you don't believe in me enough to join hands with me.

708
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:28,779
Eighty percent.

709
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:34,199
For this scale, I need to receive 80%.

710
01:02:57,549 --> 01:03:01,469
I saw something incredible today.

711
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:06,459
Someone who shouldn't be alive is alive.

712
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:12,039
That's a question I should be asking you.

713
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:18,609
You should've made sure to take care of it in the first place.

714
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:22,029
Do it properly this time.

715
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:25,899
Get rid of Director Seo now!

716
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:34,989
Are you looking for me?

717
01:04:34,989 --> 01:04:40,309
Wait. I want to play something interesting for you all.

718
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:43,789
  Il Gwang HiTech's Executive Director Myeong?  

719
01:04:43,789 --> 01:04:46,589
  Are you the Michael I've heard so much about?  

720
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:51,459
  I heard you wanted the core technology of Unixon's lithography.  

721
01:04:52,379 --> 01:04:57,809
The moment I die, this audio file will immediately

722
01:04:57,809 --> 01:05:00,499
be sent to National Intelligence Service.

723
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:09,219
Don't kill him, just bring him here.

724
01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:13,089
Bring him here immediately.

725
01:05:46,339 --> 01:05:49,619
 Ssak Ssak Cleaning 

726
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:54,439
Now, shall we get started on the plan?

727
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:28,549


728
01:06:41,259 --> 01:06:43,149
 Good Casting 
 Preview 

729
01:06:43,149 --> 01:06:44,659
  The file is of Michael and Executive Director Myeong's call exchange.  

730
01:06:44,659 --> 01:06:46,469
  Get Michael's location and continue with the plan. 

731
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,159
  Where's the original file?  

732
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:49,119
  You came.  

733
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,199
  Who do you think it could be? The person that took Director Seo.  

734
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:53,209
  Wrap it up with Baek Chan Mi. Let's go back to how it was.  

735
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:54,119
  Only you benefited from it.  

736
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:55,779
  I'm sure I'll be released due to insufficient evidence.  

737
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:57,489
  You're the one who rejected your lifeline.  

738
01:06:57,489 --> 01:06:59,729
  I don't look it, but I've done a fair share of flirting!  

739
01:06:59,729 --> 01:07:00,569
  Didn't you say you're good at it? Do it then.  

740
01:07:00,569 --> 01:07:01,769
  I think I left my oven on.  

741
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:03,119
  I want to help Joo Yeon.  

742
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,519
  Okay, might as well use the aunt chance.  

743
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:06,219
  - Ajumma, you know me? 
 - I am not an ajumma. 

744
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:08,099
  - Noona! 
 - Let's talk it out, they're children.  

745
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:08,719
  Bring it on.  

746
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:12,449
  I didn't hear it, I saw it.  

747
01:07:14,289 --> 01:07:17,699
 Epilogue 

748
01:07:17,699 --> 01:07:21,469
Unni, why were you fired?

749
01:07:21,469 --> 01:07:24,449
I don't know, don't ask me.

750
01:07:24,449 --> 01:07:28,029
The secretary manager is being unreasonable.

751
01:07:28,029 --> 01:07:31,779
You shouldn't be cut just because you spilled a bucket of water.

752
01:07:31,779 --> 01:07:32,989
Stop it.

753
01:07:32,989 --> 01:07:38,299
It's true. You shouldn't have been fired because someone fell.

754
01:07:38,299 --> 01:07:41,739
I think we should do something. I'll go to the CEO and talk—

755
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:44,619
Just stop it!

756
01:07:45,629 --> 01:07:48,249
Did you do something really bad?

757
01:07:56,289 --> 01:07:59,589
Ahjumma, why are you being like this to me?

758
01:07:59,589 --> 01:08:01,209
I... well...

759
01:08:01,209 --> 01:08:04,029
You're doing this on purpose so that I get cut, right?

760
01:08:04,029 --> 01:08:09,499
No, it's just that Kang Woo Won came out of the blue and was surprised—

761
01:08:09,499 --> 01:08:13,709
What if the CEO fell down, what would've happened?

762
01:08:13,709 --> 01:08:16,529
What would've happened?!

763
01:08:21,949 --> 01:08:25,099
What, what, what will you do?

764
01:08:25,099 --> 01:08:26,549
I was wrong.

765
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:27,259
What?

766
01:08:27,259 --> 01:08:29,699
I was wrong!  (casual) 

767
01:08:29,699 --> 01:08:32,569
- Oh?
 - Yo!  (formal) 

768
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:37,949
Ahjumma. Out of all things, you should know this.

769
01:08:37,949 --> 01:08:41,719
I'll be watching you so keep that in mind.

770
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:46,119
Who do you look after?

771
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:05,879
  Thanks to Nam Sung Jin for special appearance
