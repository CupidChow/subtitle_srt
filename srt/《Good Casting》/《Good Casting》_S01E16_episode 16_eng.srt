1
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,450
Get everyone out right now! (Chinese)

2
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,250
What?

3
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,050
Get out!

4
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,250
- Get out now! 
 - Get out!

5
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,850
Hwang Mi Soon. Im Ye Eun!

6
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,250
 Complete 

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,050
Okay, I'm done.

8
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,250
 TOP SECRET - CODE NAME 'GOOD CASTING' 

9
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,450
 Good Casting 

10
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,960
Take them away! (Chinese)

11
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,250
What are you doing? (Japanese)

12
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,250
I'll give you back the money I won. I was going to give it back anyway!

13
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,050
Why are you taking us away!

14
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,250
Chan Mi. Something happened in the hall. I can't get a hold of them.

15
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,650
What?

16
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,850
They don't have anything. (Chinese)

17
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:14,050
Then... Just kill the two of them.

18
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,760
Do you think it's just us?

19
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,850
Out team is covering the entire area outside.

20
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,250
Your Mandarin is pretty good.

21
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,650
Your Japanese is pretty good too.

22
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,650
So it isn't just you two here?

23
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,250
There's a sniper on standby on the building opposite from us.

24
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,250
You almost got riddled with bullets.

25
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,650
You should know what you're messing with.

26
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,950
That's right! If you harm us, do you think you'll be fine?

27
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,650
If there is really a sniper over there tell them to shoot this.

28
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,950
What?

29
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,250
If they don't hit this in the next minute, we'll shoot you in the head.

30
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,050
  Restricted Number  

31
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,850
Hello?

32
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,650
Chan Mi.

33
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,050
What are you doing? You should be telling her to come.

34
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,050
I think... you need to come up again.

35
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:58,250
If you don't want a hole in your head, tell her to come right away!

36
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,950
Right now.

37
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,050
Now that all three of you are here, how much do you think I can sell you for?

38
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,650
You're going to use us for a deal?

39
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,150
It seems like a waste if I just kill you off.

40
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,250
If I bring you to the transaction tomorrow, I think I can get a million bucks per person.

41
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,350
Who said that you'll be able to trade tomorrow?

42
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,050
You want to stop my deal tomorrow.

43
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,550
Isn't that why you ruined my game and snuck into my room?

44
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,450
You can only make a deal if you're alive.

45
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,950
About that gift you gave us last time...

46
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,850
What are you babbling about?

47
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,650
I prepared a gift in return.

48
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,450
What are you doing?

49
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,450
Carefully, carefully.

50
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,250
What's going on?

51
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,950
My apologies.

52
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,850
What are you doing?

53
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,250
Take it off. Won't you take it off right now?

54
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,850
Hey, calm down. It'll explode if you make a wrong move.

55
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,650
What are you saying?

56
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,350
If this explodes, we're all going to die. What should I do?

57
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,350
Push it?

58
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,850
You think this will allow you guys to walk away alive?

59
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,850
You want to die together?

60
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:07,650
Okay, even if I don't push the button, it'll explode after a minute and forty seconds.

61
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,050
Ah, there's a minute and thirty seconds left.

62
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,050
What are you...

63
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,850
Just let us go.

64
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,450
Then as soon we're out, I'll turn off the switch.

65
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,650
Why should I trust you?

66
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,250
If you don't want to believe me then I'll make it go off now!

67
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,450
- No. No 
 - No. No.

68
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,950
Which will be faster, you shooting me or me pushing the button?

69
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm giving you ten seconds. Choose wisely.

70
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:50,050
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

71
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,850
Chan Mi, I think ten seconds is too short.

72
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,150
You're counting too fast.

73
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,450
Six, five...

74
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,950
Four...

75
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,650
Okay! Okay.

76
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,450
Don't move!

77
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,650
When did you make the bomb?

78
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,450
You think making a bomb is easy?

79
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,650
That? I asked Moo Hyeok to improvise and quickly make a fake one.

80
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,050
How did you get him to wear the vest?

81
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,950
This noona will dress you in a pretty, colorful thing.

82
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,450
The support team has successfully arrested Wang Kai and his men without sustaining any injury.

83
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,450
Everyone, good job.

84
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,250
There are still a lot of reporters around the exits.

85
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,050
Where's Secretary Byeon?

86
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,450
He said he had to attend to an urgent matter in Jeju Island.

87
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,050
Jeju Island?

88
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,250
If you find out more, you could be in danger like the chairman was.

89
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,850
I could never watch you end up with the same fate.

90
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,650
Let's go to the airport.

91
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,250
Pardon?

92
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,850
Right now.

93
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,650
 DK Hotel 

94
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,650
  Jeju DK Hotel room 423  

95
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,650
Come to the address I sent you in ten minutes. (Chinese)

96
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,650
Let's meet at the hotel I'm staying at.

97
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,450
Meeting at a place that I choose is part of our deal.

98
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:57,050
I came all the way to Jeju Island, is it too much to ask for you to come to my hotel?

99
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,450
Location?

100
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:06,750
Jeju Casino Hotel... Room 774.

101
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,250
What's wrong?

102
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,450
Seventy-four. It's a number that Chinese people don't use.

103
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,250
He just sent a sign to Michael.

104
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,250
What?

105
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,450
In a democratic country, (Chinese)

106
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,050
you wouldn't fire a bullet in the head of a criminal.

107
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,250
But if I go back to China after a transaction has gone wrong, I will certainly be shot dead.

108
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,850
You really think I'll risk my life to make him come here?

109
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,650
Track the location of his cell phone right now.

110
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,850
It's urgent, hurry!

111
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,650
This idiot. Why get caught and screw it up.

112
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,650
We've been working together for so long. Is he set on screwing me over now?

113
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,650
Why do you chasing me?

114
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,450
Did you get his location?

115
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,850
  I can't track it because the phone works with satellite connection.  

116
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,050
Satellite phone?

117
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,750
Could it be there is immense power involved in this? If not, then—

118
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,650
That doesn't make sense. If they're trying this hard to hide their identity...

119
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,850
Talk. Where is Michael? (Chinese)

120
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,050
Where is Michael? Talk!

121
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,860
Do you still not know the reason

122
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,370
he hasn't been caught yet? Nobody can meet him

123
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,930
unless he comes to you first!

124
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,830
The only way to find him is to make him come to you himself.

125
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:45,450
Given the situation, that option seems to have gone down the drain, though.

126
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,240
What are you doing?

127
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,130
Are we going to lose Michael again?

128
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,330
What does that mean?

129
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,030
What you mean, Secretary Byeon is on Jeju Island?

130
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,030
What on earth are you doing on Jeju Island?

131
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,910
- You know that it's top-secret information. 
 - You're not going to tell me?

132
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,290
I have no option other than going there myself.

133
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,660
Hello? Hello?

134
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,910
What is it? What do you mean Secretary Byeon is here?

135
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,700
I don't know why Secretary Byeon is here in Jeju.

136
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,190
Find Secretary Byeon's location immediately and send it to me. Hurry!

137
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,840
You're quite skilled, as the rumors say.

138
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,280
I'm relieved you seem to know me.

139
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,370
There's no reason for me to stall.

140
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,300
Hand over the chip with the third phase of the technology.

141
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,900
If you want it, try taking it from me.

142
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,440
I've finally found it.

143
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,430
Easy, easy.

144
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,210
Taking it is easy.

145
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,330
But you have to be alive for it.

146
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,780
Darn it.

147
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,150
We lost the tracking around here, so look for him nearby.

148
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,600
I'll try going into the school.

149
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,130
Go.

150
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,320
Go and catch that guy.

151
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,460
Hurry.

152
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,300
I said to go!

153
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,290
Hurry!

154
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,380
 Sunbae... 

155
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,620
If not now,

156
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,860
you'll never catch him. Hurry!

157
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,430
I said to go! Hurry!

158
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,610
Please go!

159
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,890
Hurry!

160
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,400
Michael.

161
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,780
For violating the Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology,

162
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,580
I'm arresting you.

163
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,790
So come out you bastard!

164
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,430
Can you speed up a bit?

165
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,780
Hurry up.

166
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,680
Endure it just a little longer.

167
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,250
Woo Seok...

168
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,950
How did you come all the way here?

169
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,450
I told you not to go around alone.

170
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,150
I told you not to go anywhere alone because it's dangerous. What is this?

171
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,850
I'm sorry.

172
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,050
Don't say anything. Stop talking, please.

173
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:17,650
I promised...

174
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:23,050
I promised to protect you and the chairman no matter what.

175
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,050
Exactly, so you have to keep your promise. Woo Seok...

176
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,950
I really wanted to...

177
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,450
keep that promise.

178
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,050
You know that you're my only family.

179
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,750
You know, right?

180
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,850
I know. I'm not going anywhere.

181
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,450
I have to get my suit from you.

182
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:00,050
Okay. I got it, so stop talking.

183
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,850
These are my favorite clothes,

184
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,250
but now they've all been ruined.

185
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,050
 CEO Yoon. 

186
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,850
 Please take care.  

187
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,850
 What the heck? Why are you acting like you'll never see me again? 

188
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,050
 I'll wait for you until the end and make sure I get my new suit. 

189
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,250
 I know you weren't meant for this, and I know this isn't your style. 

190
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,050
 That's why I'm even more sorry and grateful.  

191
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,050
 That you threw everything away to be by my side. 

192
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,850
 If you find out more, you could be in danger like the chairman was. 

193
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,950
 I could never watch you end up with the same fate. 

194
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:05,150
Try to focus a bit. Focus, Woo Seok.

195
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,550
I-I'm sorry.

196
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,050
I wanted to stay...

197
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:25,250
stuck right by your side.

198
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,050
Woo Seok, open your eyes.

199
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,250
Woo Seok, open...

200
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,950
Woo Seok. Woo Seok.

201
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,350
Woo Seok... Woo Seok!

202
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,050
Oh no...

203
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,850
Open your eyes!

204
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,850
 At the end of last month, the body of a male citizen who went to Jeju Island on vacation was found with a gunshot wound. 

205
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:36,050
The police were dispatched after hearing reports from local residents who heard a gunshot.

206
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,850
We found this in his stomach.

207
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,850
Here, take a look.

208
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,850
It looks like he swallowed it after wrapping it in foil.

209
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,850
I think he knew beforehand the foil wouldn't be melted by the gastric acids.

210
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,640
They found a chip inside Secretary Byeon's stomach.

211
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:08,550
I think he wanted to catch Michael to prove you were innocent.

212
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,850
How did Secretary Byeon know to go after him?

213
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,650
How could he find someone the National Intelligence Service couldn't find?

214
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,450
That...

215
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,650
We'll have to slowly look into it. Secretary Byeon was no ordinary person, after all.

216
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,050
Check Secretary Byeon's call history, and look into his whereabouts

217
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,550
before he came to Jeju Island. Find out as much as you can.

218
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
Let me make one request.

219
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:46,050
I can't forgive the bastards that killed my dad and Woo Seok.

220
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,050
Bastards?

221
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,250
Whatever you find out, please let me know.

222
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:56,050
Then I'll decide whether or not to tell you what I know.

223
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,650
 I heard it while getting interrogated. 

224
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:05,050
 Once you've become White Collar's target, you can never escape. 

225
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,550
 Who is that guy exactly? 

226
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:10,850
 Apparently, there are several bosses at each level that are operating the organization. 

227
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:26,650
  Prosecutors concluded that former CEO Yoon Seok Ho was free of charges regarding the technology leak.  

228
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,250
  Mr. Myeong, who was tried for leaking industrial technology, hiring an assassin,   

229
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,650
  embezzling public money, and evading taxes, was sentenced to 37 years in prison, 

230
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,850
 a fine of 15 billion won (≈$15M) and an additional penalty fee of 8.4 billion won (≈ $8.4M).  

231
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:44,250
 Celebrity idol Kang Woo Won, who suffered from anxiety caused by aggressive criticism from anti-fans, 

232
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,250
 announced that he would be taking merciless legal action against all those who had left malicious comments 

233
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,450
 following the news that his manager Mr. Pi's death was not a suicide, but a homicide. 

234
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,650
Stop taking pictures!

235
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,850
 Il Gwang HiTech's CEO Sim Hwa Ran announced prior to the inauguration 

236
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,250
that she would be stepping down from the CEO position.

237
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,650
The former CEO, Yoon Seok Ho, who recently returned to the business,

238
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,250
  explained he will follow his late father’s will and invest in eco-friendly semiconductors,   

239
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,150
  in order to improve the coexistence of people and technology.  

240
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,850
It was a bit awkward coming in. Is it because Secretary Byeon isn't here?

241
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,750
This is the tea you liked, right?

242
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:31,840
I'm finally getting the treatment that I couldn't even receive while we were married.

243
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,650
Back then, neither of us were interested in each other.

244
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,850
That's true.

245
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:41,450
You must've only gotten curious about what I liked and disliked after we got a divorce.

246
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,050
Since you'd have to know my tastes if you wanted to keep your management rights.

247
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,050
You're good at steeping tea.

248
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,250
I'm sure you didn't come just to drink some tea.

249
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,450
This is the contract for the transfer of my shares of the company.

250
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:05,650
Exposing my father's corruption, wanting to cut me off, even when you'd be losing from it,

251
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,850
I understood it.

252
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,450
Congratulations.

253
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,250
You've ultimately gotten everything you want.

254
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:24,450
Legal proceedings for the transfer of shares will be conducted through an attorney.

255
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,650
What's the reason you're doing all this, so suddenly?

256
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,050
Why do you think I kept these measly shares in the first place?

257
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,950
I had to at least have those...

258
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,660
for you to look at me.

259
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:59,450
If not for those shares, you wouldn't even have seen me.

260
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:33,650
 Since I've eaten till my stomach feels like bursting thanks to you, I should give you a gift in return. 

261
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,250
 I like that you're clean about the give and take exchanges. 

262
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,250
 This is how I'm repaying everything I'm indebted to you for. 

263
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,350
 I'll have to listen to what it is, first. 

264
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,750
  There are rumors that Executive Director Myeong has a ledger.  

265
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,250
  It'll soon get out.  

266
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:52,050
  Why get excited over some old tabloid gossip.  

267
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,050
  It's not just gossip.  

268
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:58,950
 Maybe it was three years ago? The connection you had with Executive Director Myeong almost was almost revealed. 

269
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:02,650
 Did you really not know that CEO Yoon Seok Ho stopped that from getting out? 

270
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,050
 What are you talking about? 

271
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,450
  When the board of directors was protesting against your management rights over LK Aesthetics, 

272
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,050
  there were talks of secret ties between you and Executive Director Myeong.  

273
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:17,250
 CEO Yoon released shares at that time and just barely managed to stop the rumors from spreading. 

274
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,750
  You know very well that since then, it's been hard for CEO Yoon to defend his management rights.  

275
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,950
  I thought that was all the big plan you had been drawing since then.  

276
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:48,150
Ugh, I'm dizzy.

277
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,650
My head hurts so much I think I'm going to die.

278
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:22,250
 Don't make me sway with your temporary sympathy.  

279
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,850
Her asking me not to make her sway...

280
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,140
means that she was swayed!

281
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,450
Okay.

282
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,850
 Kang Woo Won 

283
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,650
Is it an emergency?

284
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,850
No, it's not.

285
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:49,850
The same character kept appearing while investigating the crimes Michael had committed.

286
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,250
Name, Woo Myeong Sook. Age, forty-six.

287
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,050
Woo Myeong Sook? Madam Woo?

288
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,450
Do you know her?

289
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:05,550
 Madam Woo, who died three months ago in solitary confinement.  

290
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,650
 She should've left it to you. 

291
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,850
She's a woman who was managing a ledger for drug traffickers.

292
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,950
But... What does Madam Woo have to do with White Collar?

293
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,850
We'll have to look into it.

294
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,450
Why? What? How?

295
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,050
Okay. Chan Mi will wrap up that case.

296
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,250
Now, since we've recovered the chip and caught Michael...

297
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,050
Are we dispersing now?

298
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,250
Each of you handle the cleanup for your assigned on-site missions, following the rules.

299
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,650
 Kang Woo Won 

300
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,250
There isn't a problem, is there?

301
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:44,450
Of course not. It's all been taken care of. There are no issues.

302
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,050
Okay, fine. Let's take it to the end today.

303
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,950
I'll wait for you even if I have to pull an all-nighter.

304
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,850
Come. Down you go.

305
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,650
It's all good.

306
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,450
Isn't it fun?

307
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,650
I want to go on the swings.

308
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,450
The swings?

309
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:28,050
So Hee, let's go on the see-saw. That's more fun, isn't it?

310
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:33,050
The swings! Swings! Swings! Swings!

311
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,950
Okay, okay. Let's go on the swings.

312
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,650
One minute, okay?

313
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,850
Yes, Team Leader?

314
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,850
Dads are always busy.

315
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,150
I don't have a dad, though.

316
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,020
Come on.

317
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,950
I only have a mom.

318
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,330
I really wish I had a dad too...

319
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,250
Mom!

320
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,350
So Hee!

321
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,450
Did you have fun?

322
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,850
You came back early today.

323
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,850
It was difficult watching So Hee, right?

324
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,250
You should come in. I went grocery shopping to make curry.

325
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,850
Sure, give that to me.

326
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,050
Let's go.

327
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,550
Woo Won...

328
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,220
What are you doing here?

329
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:25,450
So not only are you not Im Jeong Eun of the advertising team, but Im Ye Eun of the National Intelligence Service, and

330
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,650
you're also a mom?

331
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,050
That's why I told you

332
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,850
there's no benefit for you

333
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,750
in getting involved with me.

334
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,030
Eat up.

335
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,650
Do you think I am able to swallow any food right now?

336
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,850
Even if you can't, you should try to force it in.

337
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,550
So you'll have the strength to go back home.

338
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,150
And...

339
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,050
don't ever come back here.

340
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,250
Is that something you should be saying to me right now?

341
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,050
It's different from where you live.

342
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,850
This neighborhood has a lot of eyes watching and rumors spread fast.

343
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,050
There's no need for you to become the subject of rumors here by wandering around—

344
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,650
Stop saying things like that! Dammit.

345
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,450
I'll take care of my own image. You don't need to worry about it.

346
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,450
How can I not worry?

347
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,650
I saw very well how difficult a time you had because of that.

348
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:29,050
I don't care if my entire reputation gets ruined!

349
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,450
Don't cry. Don't cry.

350
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,650
You should make sure to eat your meals.

351
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:11,650
I have a million followers on social media.

352
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,750
I also have a lot of rich fans, so I get sent tons of expensive gifts from all over the world, but...

353
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,030
this place has never hurt before.

354
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,950
I've received hundreds and thousands of fan letters saying they love me, but this here has never fluttered.

355
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,150
But... why do you make me feel this way?

356
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,050
Woo Won...

357
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:35,050
Now you're going to tell me to leave and be well?

358
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:40,450
How can I leave and be well... after you've taken my heart?

359
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:09,050
I can't go. You take responsibility.

360
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,650
Since you shook my heart, you should take responsibility!

361
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,450
I'm not afraid at all of what people say.

362
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,850
What I'm the most afraid of right now is never being able to see you again, that's all.

363
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:27,650
So just tell me. Are you going to reject me or not?

364
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,950
Woo Won, instead of doing this here, let's go inside—

365
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,450
Do you want me to say it louder?

366
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,050
Are you going to reject me or not?!

367
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,650
- Hurry up and tell him! 
 - Don't reject him!

368
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,350
- Don't reject him! 
 - Go ahead, tell him you won't!

369
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,250
Okay.

370
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,850
What's okay?

371
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,250
I said okay for now.

372
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,450
So you're not rejecting me?

373
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,450
I said okay.

374
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,650
So let go of my hands and—

375
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:03,850
♫  Let’s love, let’s love  ♫

376
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:09,050
♫  Sweetly and deeply  ♫

377
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,450
♫  Let's love  ♫

378
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:17,650
♫  With the world's most precious you  ♫

379
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:24,250
♫  Should we go on a short vacation or take a walk in the park?  ♫

380
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,350
♫  I'm happy thinking of what we should do  ♫

381
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:34,450
♫  I picked out a pretty outfit and put on a no-makeup look  ♫

382
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:40,150
♫  Thinking of how else I can look good for you  ♫

383
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:45,250
♫  I can’t hide this heart, it's already out  ♫

384
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,450
♫  I can’t hide my feelings for you  ♫

385
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:54,650
♫  But I can’t wait,   ♫

386
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,450
♫  so should I confess first?  ♫

387
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,850
So Hee, don't look at that. That's unsuitable for spectators under 19.

388
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,650
What's that?

389
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,450
It's a good thing.

390
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,850
If it's good, I want to see it.

391
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:12,050
No, I said you can't.

392
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,650
♫  Let's love.  ♫

393
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,850
♫  Sweetly and deeply.  ♫

394
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,450
♫  Let's love.  ♫

00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:29,050
♫  With the world's most precious you  ♫

396
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,650
 Letter of Resignation 

397
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,050
What if I don't sign this for you?

398
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,250
I want to leave after following the official procedure.

399
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,150
This is my last request.

400
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,550
Wow... You look like you'll go on an unauthorized resignation if I don't sign this.

401
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,650
Do you... have to leave?

402
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:01,450
I have nobody left next to me. If you leave too...

403
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,950
I'm not leaving.

404
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,250
Just like you've returned to your position,

405
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,250
I'm just returning to my place.

406
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,450
You're cold-hearted to the end.

407
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:21,450
This must be why they say to not even start a one-sided love.

408
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,650
Secretary Byeon said it's no use to run into your first love again...

409
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:33,250
 Even if you meet your first love again, your feelings will just seem like the unspeakable worst... 

410
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:39,270
 of the best memories... which will be amazing beyond words, thus unspeakable.  

411
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,610
 Letter of Resignation. 

412
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,250
  CEO's Signature  

413
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,980
Now...

414
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:09,530
Now you're not my teacher or my secretary, so I can call you whatever I want, right?

415
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,880
What do you want to call me?

416
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,470
What is it? Did you forget something?

417
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:36,320
How should I say it... I feel kind of sad, but also a bit relieved.

418
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,130
It was my first on-site infiltration.

419
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:43,370
For some reason, I feel sad leaving.

420
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,480
I know that feeling. Your first on-site investigation is like a first love.

421
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:59,260
It stays stuck in your memory, and sometimes it even makes your heart hurt.

422
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,720
It'll be like that.

423
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,020
A first love is only beautiful if you leave it as a memory.

424
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:09,990
Since if you meet again, it'll only reopen the wound that had healed.

425
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,310
What are you doing? Let's go.

426
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,060
Just leave without them.

427
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,210
Okay.

428
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,170
Wait, I'm coming! I'm going!

429
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:21,270
- Hey! Hey! 
 - Wait!

430
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,800
Hey! Are you serious?

431
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,640
 Ssak Ssak Cleaning 

432
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,750
I'm back.

433
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,490
You have to eat dinner.

434
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,870
I ate with my friends.

435
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:12,170
- With your friends? 
 - Yeah.

436
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:17,580
Full-coverage medical insurance? Life insurance? Which one is it this time?

437
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,630
Why are you making conversation with me all of a sudden?

438
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,270
If you don't want to talk to me, then never mind.

439
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:29,980
Joo Yeon, should I quit working in insurance?

440
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,660
Why?

441
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,010
Aren't you embarrassed by it?

442
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:41,800
Why is that embarrassing? You're working hard to feed and raise me.

443
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:47,320
It would've been better if my job was a bit more flaunt-worthy.

444
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,750
You're cool even like this.

445
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,360
What?

446
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:59,080
You're probably more embarrassed than I am, but you're earning that money for me.

447
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:27,310
Speaking of which... can I go to Kang Woo Won's concert?

448
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,840
That punk! He thinks he's some kind of prince,

449
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,590
and he's a major snob who only knows himself in the world. Why would you like someone like that?

450
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:39,480
Do you even know my Oppa Woo Won, Mom?

451
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,070
Why is he your oppa? Did I give birth to Kang Woo Won?

452
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,680
Goodness, I really can't converse with you.

453
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,100
- You just try going to Kang Woo Won's concert. 
 - Forget it.

454
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,270
If you go— You little...! If you go—

455
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,390
I'll just... goodness...

456
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,230
You must have a lot of free time these days.

457
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,120
Your phone is so quiet and you don't go out.

458
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,680
I've fulfilled my performance results, so I'll be quite free for the time being.

459
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,570
You're done?

460
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:08,900
I told you I would only be busy for a few months.

461
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,070
You were really busy because of work?

462
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:17,410
Then because of what else would I be busy?

463
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,620
Aren't you tired? Should I do the dishes?

464
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,860
Goodness! Why are my daughter and husband both—

465
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,070
Just act like you normally act, in your annoying ways.

466
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,470
Why are you doing that?

467
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,470
Rest up.

468
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,490
Goodness...

469
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,990
They're really something.

470
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,540
Aunt,

471
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,480
this is really the last time. You have to keep your promise.

472
00:49:55,650 --> 00:50:01,010
It's me. Is there an operation going on today at the Royal Hotel today, perhaps?

473
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,990
Never mind. I'm hanging up.

474
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,230
♫   If you've ever been in love before   ♫

475
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,030

477
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,410

478
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:36,990
♫  Don't cry, it's a thing of the past.  ♫

479
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,880
We must really be fated.

480
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,090
Seeing how we meet again, like this.

481
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:47,860
I wonder... We could be ill-fated.

482
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,690
Oh my.

483
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,730
I've got a phone call.

484
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,530
I'm sorry.

485
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:00,630
Hello?

486
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,820
 Is this Ms. Baek Jang Mi? 

487
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,110
 This is the financial supervisor. 

488
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:09,660
I was waiting for your call. Please tell me what you need.

489
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,640
 Pardon? 

490
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,050
 Your personal information has been hacked. 

491
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,110
Really?

492
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,850
  After quickly checking your balance, if you cooperate with us... 

493
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:22,370
Shall we meet?

494
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:26,190
 Pardon? Sure, that would be good but... 

495
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:29,120
If you let me know the location, I will be there right away.

496
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,440
 I mean, immediately is... 

497
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,070
What should I do?

498
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:40,180
 Track the location of the phone number I just sent you. I think it's voice phishing. 

499
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,260
I'm really sorry. Something urgent came up, so I think I need to go.

500
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,980
It was so difficult to meet again. We should at least share a meal together—

501
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,860
I apologize about last time.

502
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,810
About today, I'll put in good word to my aunt.

503
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,650
Goodbye.

504
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,130
I want to date you officially!

505
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:04,730
I thought about you every Monday as I received physical therapy, and I realized something.

506
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,350
That I fell for you at first sight last time.

507
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:11,670
That's why I called your aunt and told her

508
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,830
that I wanted to meet you again.

509
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,510
♫   I'm still crying for you   ♫

510
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,770
♫   I love you   ♫

511
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:22,230
Please date me.

512
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:25,640
Congratulations!

513
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,990
- Accept him! 
 - Congratulations!

514
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:34,280
♫   You know me well, that while loving you   ♫

515
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,980
CEO Yoon?

516
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,610
What to do? I'm sorry, but she's going to be seeing me.

517
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,050
Hey.

518
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,490
How are you here?

519
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:50,870
Did you submit a letter of resignation and put on makeup on the weekend just to do this?

520
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,450
I'm sorry.

521
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,370
Let's go.

522
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,350
What are you doing?

523
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,180
I told you I was going to call you whatever I wanted now.

524
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,140
If calling me lover is still too awkward, what about boyfriend?

525
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,730
Or if you don't want that either, I can start as your guy friend.

526
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,600
But... I don't want to just have a student-teacher relationship.

527
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,240
Stop joking around.

528
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,400
For real.

529
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,020
I decided 15 years ago,

530
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:34,260
if I met you again, even by coincidence, I would hold on to you and never let go.

531
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:40,130
Now you're even speaking casually? Why not just drop all formalities, while you're at it?

532
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,960
I was just about to.

533
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,470
What?

534
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:52,290
♫  Not just anyone can love her  ♫

535
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,770
♫  This girl of mine is really, really selfish  ♫

536
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:01,380
♫  No one could ever love her  ♫

537
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,650
♫  That is a really, really big miracle for me  ♫

538
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,790
You've always been the one executing the operations, but never been on the other end, right?

539
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,840
Here is my operation plan:

540
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:21,330
If you run away 100 times, I'll chase after you 100 times and catch you.

541
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:27,140
But I have no patience, so I can't do it 101 times. You should come over to me within those 100 times.

542
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:42,720
You're leaving? You're really just going to leave?

543
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,510
 Royal Hotel 

544
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:00,790
If you date me, I'll suddenly disappear, lie as frequently as I eat,

545
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:04,440
and there'll be countless times I show up as I please after being gone for an entire month.

546
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,430
I'm prepared for that.

547
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,270
I can't take care of anniversaries, or be next to you when you want me to.

548
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:16,890
You could be more lonely than when you were alone.

549
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,250
That's okay!

550
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,450
Everyone says that at first, that it's okay.

551
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:24,080
The car in front, in front, in front.

552
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,140
Even when you call, I won't be able to pick up most of the time.

553
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,460
Not only will I get hurt all the time, you could be in danger too.

554
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,990
I said it doesn't matter!

555
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:36,970
I could... suddenly die!

556
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,310
That one is a bit much...

557
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,740
See? That's why I said we can't work out.

558
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,710
I mean, what kind of person would be understanding about suddenly dying?

559
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,400
Are you trying to die right now?

560
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,750
I'm going to catch a bad guy.

561
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,480
S-S-Slow down a bit! Slow down!

562
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,010
There's a camera. Camera! Camera!

563
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,250
 6 months later  

564
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,940
  Trusted Advanced Corrections  

565
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:29,650
Hi, Barbara Massalitinova.

566
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,570
Over there.

567
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:44,170
  ... and repay it with drops of sweat.  

568
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:48,790
  Goo Tae Rim had been released due to lack of evidence, but during Executive Director Myeong's trial,  

569
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:53,240
  she was revealed to be involved with Division Director Tak and proven guilty. She's now in jail.  

570
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,120
I'll be on the lookout for you.

571
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,270
Hurry up.

572
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,870
- Sorry. 
 - Hey.

573
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,490
Where are you running off to?

574
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,000
Do you know me?

575
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,780
Crazy... Why would I know you?

576
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:19,420
Ah looks like you haven't heard of me yet. I'm the Lotto of the Southern Prison.

577
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,390
I just want to be in peace while I'm here, so it'd be nice if you can cooperate.

578
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:26,810
What is this psycho saying?

579
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,190
I dropped it because of you. Pick it up.

580
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:36,870
Not with your hand, but with your mouth.

581
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:42,550
What are you looking at? I told you to pick it up!

582
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:47,180
Can I just pick it up with my hand?

583
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:51,060
I told you to bite it, you crazy b*tch!

584
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,630
Like this?

585
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:25,480
Do you know what we found out after tracing Executive Director Myeong's records?

586
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,170
White Collar. You know what it is, right?

587
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:32,300
I don't know.

588
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,580
So scram.

589
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,010
I know you snitched and sold Director Seo to White Collar.

590
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:42,910
Director Seo is dead?

591
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:48,790
Of course, they would kill off Director Seo. Who do you think is going to be next?

592
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,960
Won't it be even easier to get rid of someone in prison?

593
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:03,490
I especially invited someone special here.

594
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:08,840
Try acting up with her, too. You'll get completely crushed.

595
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,240
Which crazy b*tch dares to

596
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,050
stir trouble on the first day...

597
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:20,070
Long time no see.

598
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:31,860
  An upstanding person must always keep their promises. You said you'd keep this place clean.  

599
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,480
Why is it you again...?

600
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,910
You said you'd live as a kind person, yet you're still living like this?

601
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,910
That's disappointing.

602
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,450
No...That's not it.

603
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,930
Unni, what happened to you? Do you know this b*tch?

604
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,800
No, I-I-I—

605
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,400
I was in the middle of putting varnish, so—

606
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,430
Stop!

607
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:55,480
I'm really busy today. Just bring it on.

608
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,610
Lift your arms up straight!

609
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,650
Does MK stand for Michael?

610
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:19,480
It's Maxim in Russian. Their M tattoo is an acronym for that.

611
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:37,100
If you go there and say you want to make a deal with White Collar, they'll connect you with them after they verify the item.

612
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,500
I don't know anything else.

613
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:46,250
Let's end our deal here. Don't find me again, got it?

614
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,330
Let's live as kind people.

615
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:57,790
Of course! I will.

616
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:00,960
I'm confident I can do it.

617
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,900
Please speak.

618
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,600
Blood!

619
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,810
What is this?!

620
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,870
Emergency! Call the paramedics!

621
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:03,090
Emergency in room 1102! Call an ambulance!

622
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,880
Oh no, what do we do!

623
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,790
Please make way!

624
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,280
Slowly, slowly.

625
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,880
- Please call another nurse as well. 
 - Yes.

626
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,580
One, two, three!

627
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:08,650

628
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:14,640

629
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,850
Are you okay?

630
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,840
Yes, I'm fine.

631
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,140
I don't think you're fine.

632
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,850
Who are you?

633
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:38,610

01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:43,850
 Thank you to our segmenters cont:&nbsp;hana_860, chemellelott,&nbsp;sophie2you, and miss_rochester.&nbsp; 

635
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:48,440
Don't tell me you really thought I was dead?

636
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:54,700

637
01:03:54,700 --> 01:04:00,750

638
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:06,550

639
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:12,180

640
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:18,630

641
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,410
 Chief's Office 

642
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,700

643
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,310
On the other hand, you haven't changed at all after becoming a team leader.

644
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:42,890
We've got a way to make contact with White Collar now.

645
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:45,800
- Here.
 - What is that?

646
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,380
  Personnel Appointment Announcement  

647
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:52,700
  Division: Industrial Security team 3 |  Name: Baek Chan Mi | Appointed to: Industrial Security team 1  

648
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,380
Michael was murdered.

649
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:57,340
Who did it?

650
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:00,130
We analyzed the surveillance footage.

651
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,070
See for yourself.

652
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:08,780
What we're sure of is that Michael used a satellite phone to plan an escape the day before his trial.

653
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,030
And the fact that he was killed while trying to escape...

654
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:13,780
Means that someone from the top decided to cut off the tail.

655
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,870
Stopping us from riding it to climb up to them.

656
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:19,100
This is a big case...

657
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,370
Can you handle it?

658
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:24,390
That's why I personally brought in a precious person.

659
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:26,720
What are you waiting for? Get ready.

660
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,580
Turn around.

661
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:37,650
 Thank you to our page designer: rose_shn. 

662
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,310
What about my team members?

663
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:42,590
I gathered only the best players, of course.

664
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:47,190
I'm looking forward to seeing how amazing are the aces you've gather...ed.

665
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,120
Long time no see.

666
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,480
No wonder you didn't come to visit me in jail!

667
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,930
Congratulations on getting out of jail!

668
01:05:56,930 --> 01:06:02,780
For reference, one candle represents the first day of our operation!

669
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,280
Clap, clap, clap!

670
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,090
You blew it out, so it marks our first day!

671
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:07,360
Was the plan to gather all of us?

672
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:12,230
It was a special order from the deputy chief. He said to gather the three of you for this sally no matter what.

673
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:14,940
That's why we're having premium Korean beef today!

674
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,340
Premium Korean beef is the best of all meat indeed.

675
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,150
I'm definitely not going undercover at a company like last time again.

676
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,040
Don't worry, it's not a company this time.

677
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,810
We'd be better off at a company. I can already see we're going to have a hard time.

678
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:30,170
I'm a little nervous... and also a little excited.

679
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:30,930
Where are we going?

680
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:35,340
Let's just say, being undercover at a company is like a kid's game compared to this.

681
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:36,480
Where exactly is it?

682
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,010
Is that even important? What's important is who you're with!

683
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:44,180
No matter if it's an operation or a TV drama, the casting is what's important!

684
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,850
That's right! The three of us make the perfect team!

685
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:48,270
We're amazing!

686
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,780
We are pretty good. We're exactly that, aren't we?

687
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:52,930
- What? 
 - What? 
 - What?

688
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:54,750
Good casting.

689
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:57,720
