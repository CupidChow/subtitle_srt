1
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,630
 Episode 1 

2
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,070


3
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,990
Here!

4
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,480
Hey, bring the ice box.

5
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,970
Here it is, Boss.

6
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,680
Alright, let's check what's inside.

7
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,190
Will do.

8
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,920
What is this?

9
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,540
  (in Chinese) 

10
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,930
 (in Chinese) 

11
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,680
Here.

12
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,220
Alright. Prepare for departure.

13
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,650
 M 

14
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,900
Director! It's a bomb.

15
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,840
All the crew members perished?

16
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,700
Including the team leader, there were four in total.

17
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,090
Fortunately, it happened during a top-secret mission without reinforcements.

18
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,550
So, the damage isn't big.

19
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,380
 Geum Dong Seok, NIS Deputy Department Head 

20
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,220
The entire crew perished. And yet you say it is "fortunate"?

21
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,200
The media will report the fishing boat accident as a fire caused by a power failure. 
 National Intelligence Service Director - Seo Gook Hwan 

22
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,790
I am Dong Gwan Soo, NCIS Industrial Security Operations Team 3 Leader.

23
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,830
I will start the briefing.

24
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,610
When the domestic industrial security division, under the direction of the industrial security directive's team during its operation,

25
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,200
all of its team members died.

26
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,690
The investigation has revealed that the power behind this incident is

27
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,460
Michael, the NIS's level-1 surveillance target.

28
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,830
Is that certain?

29
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,040
Based on the analysis of recorded files from the background, we are certain.

30
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,880
Full name, Michael Lee.

31
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,050
After he was caught smuggling classified defense technology from a private American corporation to China,

32
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,820
he lifted classified American Air Force data

33
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,160
and used that to apply for asylum in China.

34
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,510
In all transactions involving Michael, all others were missing or dead.

35
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,600
Because his identity was never compromised,

36
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,480
he has evaded arrest multiple times. Thus he's being called an unidentifiable ghost.

37
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,910
Which company was Team 3 mining?

38
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,360
Il Gwang HiTech. Under government funding, they are preparing a 176-layer,

39
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,950
4D NAND Flash-related technology patent.

40
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,580
The fact is that Il Gwang HiTech has struck a deal to share technology with Chong Lee Oil Company

41
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,270
and has gathered immense start-up investments as a result.

42
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,130
If the information gets leaked outside of the country before they patent the technology,

43
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,560
a minimum national loss of 3 billion KRW is estimated.

44
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,720
What is your point?

45
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,570
Lighting a fire in front of a tiger's den

46
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,790
will not lead to the target revealing his identity (will not lead the tiger to us).

47
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,890
I will go into the den myself.

48
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,950
If we become entangled with Michael or whatever,

49
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,290
even our most talented agents will die.

50
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,560
Who would actively risk their lives for this?

51
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,910
There may be a few suitable talents.

52
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,780
What do you mean "there may be"? Are you not certain?

53
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:08,390
There are agents who struggle with NIS work, no matter what kind of mission they are given.

54
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,280
Who are they?

55
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,070
Door opening

56
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,470
 Together Property Insurance 

57
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,630
Pardon me.

58
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,840
Was it about a month ago?

59
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,090
The fire in apartment building 106? Did you know about it?

60
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,490
-There was a fire? 
 - I didn't know. It's the first -time I heard.

61
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,080
See, I knew it would be like this.

62
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,560
The thing is the more severe an incident, the more sharing information is vital.

63
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,940
Would shushing it up keep the truth hidden?

64
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,360
- That's right. 
 - Oh dear. 
 - A fire?

65
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,750
That mom didn't have fire insurance and now she's got construction fees,

66
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,060
hospital fees, and now even emotional suffering,  so much. You can't even imagine!

67
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,740
- I am so upset for her.
 - Really.

68
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,360
- How much is fire insurance?
 - That's right.

69
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,780
It's not like anything will happen if you skip one cup of coffee a month, right? 
    

70
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,690
It only costs as much as one cup of coffee.

71
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
Not having fire insurance you know...

72
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,610
Mommy, gun.

73
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,860
Okay, I'll buy you a gun later.

74
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,900
No, really, a gun!

75
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,330
What is wrong with you?

76
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,370
Just wait a little bit.

77
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,250
 Name, Hwang Mi Soon, 24 years in the national security division. 

78
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,810
 She tracked down spies and worked as an appeasement agent in difficult political situations. 

79
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,810
 When UN Secretary General Ban was kidnapped, 

80
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,370
 she went to Russia and finished the negotiation in just 20 minutes. 

81
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,270
 She's has an extraordinary talent for negotiation and appeasement. 

82
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,440
 Where is she now?

86

 Agent Im Ye Eun  
 Next... she joined 4 years ago and is promising—

87
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,620
She's a white agent.

88
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,990
White? You mean she has no field experience at all?

89
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,600
Yes, but she has multiple years of experience from providing field support.

90
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,770
She was hired as an IT special recruit

91
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,010
and is the most suitable for getting through Il Gwang HiTech's security.

92
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,860
The first level of security is blocked.

93
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,130
There's an underground escape route seven meters to the left of the back door.

94
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,830
One minute and thirty seconds left in the mission. Please hurry.

95
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,010
An XXL is flying in from the east.

I will look for an emergency exit.

98
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,850

100
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,650
Good job.

101
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,180
We barely have a chance with the best. Would this even be subpar?

102
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,320
As of right now, this is the best we have.

103
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,170
She's still pretty useful...

104
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,150
Who do you mean, sir?

Let's call in Baek Chan Mi.

- That's...! 
 - Deputy Director, that's...!

109
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,820
For that kind of jerk, we need the most skilled, most crazed person

110
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,500
in order to have a chance of success.

I will forgive all those who have sinned.

I will love my enemies.

00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,790
I will not kill even a single ant.

I will live full of joy.

She looks so normal.

125

 - Huh?

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,400
What did she do before she came here?

129
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,600
I heard she was a government official?

130
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,400
They say she received a bribe.

131
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
She's total trash.

00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Hey, oh hey, hey.

I cleaned this place earlier.

Why? Do you, bitch, also want your face washed?

139
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,000
Shut your trap and fuck off!

140
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,300
I'm just letting you know to keep it clean.

141
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,800
I said whenever I see your face, vomit retches up, so I can't digest my food,

142
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,200
so I told you to not to poke your head up.

143
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,600
Do you not fucking understand words?

144
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,800
No, stop!

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,800
I feel the one who doesn't understand words is you.

146
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
What did she just say?

147
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,000
Did that girl inject drugs in her brain, or what?

148
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You crazy thing—

149

Hey, let go, crazy!

151
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,600
An upstanding person must always keep their promises.

152
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,000
You said you'd keep this place clean.

153
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,200
Yes, ma'am.

Anyway, she's really a nut job.

You're the only one who would choose to go into solitary confinement right before being released on parole.

Are you crying?

159
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,000
Can I have one more spoon of gochujang?

160

Why is this so good today?

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,500
The vegetables must have been seasoned just right.

162
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Bring Baek Chan Mi and capture Michael, no matter what.

163
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Deputy Director, even so, inserting Baek Chan Mi into the mission is...

164
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,600
The VIP room is watching. The maintenance or dissolution of the Industrial Security Division depends on this issue!

165
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
Do you understand?

166
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Please trust Team Leader Dong and leave it to him. He's going to do a good job.

167
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,700
You take full responsibility and handle this mission, Team Leader Dong.

168
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,700
S-sir...

169
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,400
I can't handle Baek Chan Mi.

170
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Do you think I like this?

171
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,800
But you saw it, too. The bosses say to shut it.

172
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,400
If you don't want to, leave, or grow your abilities.

173
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll quit.

174
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,200
Isn't your paycheck being withheld because you can't pay alimony to your ex-wife?

175
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,900
You need to eat and live somehow!

176
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 TOP SECRET - CODE NAME 'GOOD CASTING' 

177
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,400
 Good Casting 

178
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,400
Continue working.

179
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,200
 Sweet Americano over ice 1, 700 KRW 

180
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,000
Didn't I tell you?

181
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,600
Eating outside of a mission can't be reimbursed. How many times do I need to tell you?!

182
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,600
I drank this while I was on standby when I was working as a guard for the summit last month.

183
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
- Oh, the summit. 
 - Yes.

184
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,800
In Hongdae? At 2:00 am?

185
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,100
 2:15 am 

186
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,500
Let's do better.

187
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,200
Yes?

188
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,400
Yes, I am indeed Hwang Mi Soon,

189
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,560
but I'm afraid you have the wrong number.

190
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,400
This one is Team Leader's.

191
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,800
Iced tea.

192
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,600
For Sunbae, who works hard on the field. Iced Americano.

193
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
I should be the one buying.

194
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,200
I have so many lives indebted to Ye Eun.

195
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,600
If the field agent is the motor, we can say the field support team is the oil.

196
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
And that is, the top quality oil.

197
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,400
I'm merely supporting from the background.

198
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,800
What good is it to only have a top-quality supercar motor?

199
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,700
When we run out of gas (oil), we can't dash.

200
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,180
Ye Eun, you don't want to work on the field?

201
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,400
No, no way. Not everyone goes for fieldwork.

202
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,400
I like office work. Staying in this office until I reach mandatory retirement,

203
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,800
that's my goal.

204
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,000
You know as for us,

205
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,400
lasting a long time while putting in the least amount of effort is the best.

206
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,700
There've been more than just one or two colleagues putting their lives on the line to meet results and performance, who left swiftly in the end.

207
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,800
For sure!

208
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,400
- Having a white agent on the scene has no precedent and makes no sense.
 - Of course.

209
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Just a moment.

210
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,900
Hello. This is Im Ye Eun from the supporting department.

211
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Pardon?

212
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,300
I won't do it.

213
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,580
You want me to go over the hill while working in the field at this age?

214
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,600
I can't even go down the stairs if not for an escalator, because of my arthritis.

215
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Whatever. I told you I can't do it.

216
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,100
Why are you like this?

217
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,900
Heavenly Hwang Mi Soon, you are not a person who'd chicken out due to mere arthritis.

218
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,400
It's been a while since our cohort last gathered.

219
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,800
That was a long time ago. Which cohort are you?

220
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,600
"Love our cohort, Love our nation." You want to die by my hand?

221
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,800
With who? With this one?

222
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,600
Do what? The field work?

223
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I've never had fieldwork experience.

224
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,200
See? What do you want me to do with this little kid whose plucky cotton-cuteness isn't all gone?

225
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
Though I look like this, I'm a mom.

226
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,800
I have a cotton-ball like, three-year-old child.

227
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,600
Did you get kid insurance, which comes with our job?

228
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,400
You know, kids get hurt in a blink of an eye.

229
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,500
Hospital fees are no joke, you know?

230
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,500
I see.

231
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Excuse me, could we say that I cannot do fieldwork due to unavoidable circumstances, or—

232
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Right. It's called fieldwork, but it's the same as a battlefield.

233
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Why would you volunteer to suffer? Right?

234
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
- I know, right? 
 - Thank you.

235
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,400
The higher-ups had prepared some things just in case, so take them with you.

236
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,600
Hwang Mi Soon. Payback the employee loan by the end of this month.

237
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Im Ye Eun. Please move out of the employee apartment by next month.

238
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,000
Dismissed.

239
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,150
Fuck.

240
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
H-Hey, this is blackmail!

241
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,800
Did you expect persuasion then?

242
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,000
If I move out of the employee apartment immediately, where would I go?

243
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,600
You shouldn't be asking me.

244
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,800
Who's the target?

245
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,000
That's the right question!

246
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,600
Michael.

247
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,800
Michael?

248
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,200
Michael.

249
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,100
What now? Are you in or what?

250
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
You fucker.

251
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,120
 Gwon Min Seok! Gwon Min Seok! Min Seok! 

252
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:58,320
Min Seok! You can't lose it! You can't be like this! No!

253
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,700
Min Seok! Wake up, dude!

254
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,000
You're all dead.

255
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,290
Mom.

256
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,750
I'm coming. Yeah.

257
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,010
 Security Clearance denied. Cannot be confirmed. 

258
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,370
  Im Ye Eun, you must vacate the employee residence by next month. 

259
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,490
Mom is the only one who could protect our So Hui.

260
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,750
Dad would be so angry if he found out.

261
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,430
I'd be more enthused if this were a lottery ticket.

262
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,140
How long has this wallpaper been here, anyway?

263
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,740
I'm exhausted.

264
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,760
This is the last solitary confinement cell. If it's not here...

265
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,260
 Barbara Massalitinova 
(T/N: written in Russian) 

266
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,050
I found it.

267
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,490
That nut job. She's as brisk as always.

268
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,780
♫  With a red hat on my head  ♫ 
  

269
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:23,530
♫  I am a clown, always smiling  ♫

270
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,010
♫  Behind that laughter,  ♫

271
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,490
♫  there are tears that no one knows of.  ♫

272
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,230
♫  Even though I smile at my miserable self.  ♫

273
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,190
Hi, Barbara Massalitinova.

274
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,420
That was so hard to say.

275
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,760
You have the thing I'm looking for.

276
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,770
There's no such thing  (speaking in Russian). 

277
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,850
I'll call the guard if you don't stop annoying me.

278
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,490
Madam Wu who died in

279
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,000
the solitary cell three months ago.

280
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,180
I bet she left it with you.

281
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,600
I don't know that person.

282
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,300
Hey, do you think I will let it go if you act like you don't know?

283
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,540
I can't do that!

284
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,340
I really don't know!

285
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,570
How about we talk this out now?

286
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,160
If I give it to you, how much will you give me?

287
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,910
You want me to pay you for holding onto it?

288
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,310
Once I get out of here,

289
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,560
I'll be deported. I can't just let you have it.

290
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:47,520
$100,000 USD should be enough to get you home.

291
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,050
Keep your word.

292
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,500
You'll get ten months in prison for violating the Occupational Stability Act and Immigration Control Act.

293
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,520
And for industrial espionage,

294
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,990
you will get at least three more years, Barbara Massalitinova.

295
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,850
Congratulations.

296
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,930
Hey!

297
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,940
Hey, you mad wench!

298
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,610
I knew that thing could speak great Korean.

299
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,940
 Transfer of Personnel 

300
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,500
 Deputy Director of Industrial Security Team, Geum Dong Seok 

301
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,610
Dear Director, you've sure aged a lot in three years.

302
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,400
It seems your position doesn't agree with you?

303
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,660
Because of you, we lost Michael and I barely clawed my way back from certain death.

304
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,910
How could I look okay?

305
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,620
That was my only mistake. Give me a chance to make up for it.

306
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,090
Sure. That's why you came to prison, right?

307
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,470
Turn around.

308
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,520
When did you join forces with the deputy head?

309
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,190
Are you upset because I made a deal with him behind your back?

310
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:45,450
If you ruin my plans as you did three years ago, I will not save any blood nor tears for your sake.

311
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,450
Don't worry.

312
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,170
I will wrap it up T.O.P.

313
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,310
T.O.P?

314
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:56,240
In Time, without going Overboard, Perfectly.

315
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,500
Shall we?

316
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,590
Will this team be trustworthy?

317
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,720
What do you mean?

318
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,410
Three years ago,

319
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:28,100
that jerk of a teammate, who I trusted with my life, gave me a really hard time

320
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,700
because he tattled to the higher-ups that I took a bribe to let Michael go.

321
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,600
Who was it?

322
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,710
It can't have been you, Director.

323
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,930
As long as you behave, this team will be fine.

324
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:55,620
I'm really looking forward to it! What amazing aces did you put in line for me?

325
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,530
Long time no see.

326
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,390
What "long time no see"? You came to visit me in prison last week.

327
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,420
I heard you did time.

328
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,960
My body must've been used to solitary confinement.

329
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,200
It's quite awkward to sit on such a plush chair.

330
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,870
Okay, let's unbundle our thoughts slowly once we eat.

331
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,520
Wait.

332
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,750
Where did you bring that bloody babe from?

333
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,280
The industrialteam? The international team? Or the terror team?

334
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,860
I worked for the field support team in the Industrial Security Depart—

335
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,600
What?

336
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,540
One's an old woman with arthritis.

337
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,730
Another one is a rookie that has been observing field practices through a monitor.

338
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,170
Do you want me to complete the mission or to fail miserably?

339
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,240
That's why the deputy director personally scouted you, Team Leader Baek.

340
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,340
Above ten that may be iffy, he puts his faith in reliable you.

341
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,570
It's not Team Leader Baek. It's Agent Baek now.

342
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:15,940
If you play on your own like you did when you were a team leader, you are out of my team without any margin, alright?

343
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,860
You know I'm a person who doesn't look back when I am resolute.

344
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,070
Yeah, just like you did when you broke up when we were dating.

345
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,470
Ah, seriously..

346
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,110
What? It's better to reveal it like this than let people gossip behind our backs, no?

347
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,370
You are still the same. You don't consider the other party at all.

348
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,610
You are the only one who's the best, right?

349
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,820
You didn't know?

350
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,800
I went to jail by myself because I'm the only one that is the best of all.

351
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,050
I think just about everything has been sorted out.

352
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,630
Shall we eat now, elegantly?

353
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,180
I will go order five A-course meals.

354
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,770
Alright.

355
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,130
Knock on a bridge several times even if it is made of stones. 
   (Proverb meaning you should use caution even if the situation is familiar and looks secure.)  

356
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,930
You're one to be cautious beyond reason.

357
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,810
What are you going to do if I stab you in the back for real with Michael?

358
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,300
Are you warning me before you betray me or what?

359
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,600
I avoided dismissal because the higher-ups tried to protect their pride, but doesn't everyone believe I would do that?

360
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
It's classified, so not many people know about this.

361
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,120
And out of those few, from the beginning I never believed you'd do such thing.

362
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,050
By what?

363
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:34,790
Baek Chan Mi. You do whatever you want but don't ever cross the line.

364
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,320
Right. You know Sunbae Baek Chan Mi.

365
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,450
Yeah.

366
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,540
What did she go to jail for?

367
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,120
Ah.

368
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,780
She didn't go for real, but for undercover.

369
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,310
Ah, I had thought something else.

370
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,680
But since Baek Chan Mi is in now,

371
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,790
you should brace yourself.

372
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,240
Excuse me?

373
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,700
Speak of the devil.

374
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,050
So it's your first time working in the field?

375
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:19,090
Yes. I might not be good enough, but I will think of it as a learning process and do my best.

376
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,110
Reduce your shortcomings on your own, and forget about any learning process.

377
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,760
We don't have the time or leisure to teach you.

378
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,830
Then, I will do my best.

379
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:31,060
Doing your best works in the office.

380
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,350
Doing your best in the field doesn't bring the dead back to life.

381
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:39,260
Bring me a hundred target sheets from your shooting practice by next week.

382
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,330
A hundred copies?

383
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,800
I'm not telling you to shoot others, but to protect yourself.

384
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,950
And come to the gym every morning at six, so we can train.

385
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:52,660
Well, I have a child, so

386
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,810
6 am is not possible.

387
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,720
You look too young to have a child.

388
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,240
Then, we will do 6 pm.

389
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,590
You get what I mean, right?

390
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,590
- I don't care, you eat it.
 - Just give me one then.

391
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,530
You won't eat it?

392
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,460
Hey, So Hee's mom. You are coming to the kids' cafe later, right?

393
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,610
Kids' cafe?

394
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,770
You must not have seen our group chat yet.

395
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,290
Later, we are all going to the kids' cafe together.

396
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,480
Well, So Hee's mom is a working mom. You must be too busy to join us, right?

397
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,610
It would be nice if you could join in.

398
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,020
I can come today.

399
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,700
Our husbands are also joining us.

400
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,990
It could be a little bit awkward, right?

401
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:56,160
Tell your husband to join!

402
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,490
What? Why are you hitting me?

403
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,040
Let's go clean. We need to go to kids' cafe later.

404
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,230
- See you.
 - Let's go!

405
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,330
- Make sure you come. 
- Let's go to the kid's cafe.

406
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,020
- Hurry. Let's go.
 - Be sure to take your stuff. We need to go home.

407
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,660
Where are you going?

408
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,070
- What, what? 
- You didn't know So Hee doesn't have a dad?

409
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,840
Oh my. What shall I do?

410
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,520
My bad, I truly made a mistake.

411
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,580
Hey, So Hee. We should go too, shall we?

412
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,110
There. Let's go.

413
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,560
So Hee.

414
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,620
Let's be sure go to kids' cafe with your friends next time.

415
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,040
Promise.

416
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,220
Promise. Copy.

417
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,600
 I wish it were a daughter. 

418
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,750
 This, this.. What is this in the middle? 

419
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,520
 It's a hand. 

420
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,650
  It looks like a gummy bear.  

421
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,350
 It's amazing. 

422
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,170
 It's so tiny but 

423
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,160
 it has arms and legs. 

424
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,280
 How much longer again? 

425
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,000
 A lot of time's left. Maybe after winter? 

426
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,610
 I want to meet this baby soon. 

427
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:42,980
 I will be the coolest dad in the world. 

428
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,810
 I was most envious of kids with dads when I was little. 

429
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,550
 I'm so happy, but I'm really anxious. 

430
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:00,120
 Because I'm afraid that the first family member I ever had will disappear. 

431
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:11,030
 We won't disappear but stay by your side like this. 

432
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,930
 So don't worry. 

433
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,590
 Let's get married immediately when this task is over. 

434
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:23,030
 By then, I will be able to meet your parents with confidence. 

435
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,870
 I can tell my team leader, too. 

436
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,320
 We were going to keep it a secret until the mission is over. 

437
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,820
 I don't want to burden you, Oppa. 

438
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,700
 Promise. 

439
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,380
My little teddy bear.

440
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,990
Come at me.

441
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,550
Come at me.

442
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,640
Hey, hey.

443
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,960
I surrender.

444
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,630
With your lack of physical stamina and lackluster mental grit,

445
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,020
you plan on going into the field?

446
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,830
Unlike you, Sunbae, I don't have a sense of duty or

447
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,350
patriotism of any sort.

448
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,080
I'm doing this to make a living.

449
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,280
I'm doing this for fun.

450
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,730
Whether awake or asleep, take care to your left and right, front and rear.

451
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:37,540
 National Intelligence Service National Martyr Memorial 

452
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,600
It's been three years.

453
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,750
 In commemoration of National Intelligence Service agents who dedicated their lives to the nation 

454
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:10,220
 3 years ago 

455
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,000
 BUSAN 

456
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,240
 One minute till opening. Let's get ready to welcome our guests. 

457
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,200
  All of you stay alert, to your positions.  

458
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,190
  Everyone focus. Not even for a second— For the taxi, you requested the premium kind, right?  

459
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,990
 Private 

460
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,250
 You are done now. I told you to get a premium taxi. How many times did I tell you? 

461
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,430
 We welcome you. 

462
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,360
 Welcome! 

463
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,890
 Excuse me, excuse me. Let me go first. 

464
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,090
 Welcome. 

465
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:54,550
  For groups, please gather in front of the skyway to proceed inside.  

466
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,670
 I see. Thank you. 

467
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,670
 Welcome. 

468
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:07,720
      
   Ten points, I see. Which way is the skyway? Ah, really.   

469
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,460
 Oh my, sorry. 

470
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,330
 I'll come home straight after work.  

471
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:33,120
 I will come home straight after work. Are you craving anything? 

472
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,970
 Rather than my craving,  

473
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,790
 there is something I want to hear. 

474
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,730
 I love you 

475
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:13,730
 So he doesn't tell me 'I love you.' 

476
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,560
 Group tourists, please gather around here. 

477
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,780
 Come on. This way. 

478
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,340
 Please use the restrooms before we enter. 

479
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,630
 This way, please. 

480
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,090
 I will tell you where the restrooms are located. 

481
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,560
 That way! 

482
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,090
 That way... 

483
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:53,360
 Oh, alright. Understood.  

484
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,950
 It's been a while since Ive been out in the field. I don't even know where east, west, south nor north are. 

485
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,930
 Please text him.  

486
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,930
My husband is at work.

487
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,050
 Tell him that our baby is on the way. 

488
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,230
 2 o'clock position. Blue scarf. 

489
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,950
 Hang in there. 

490
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,160
  Women  

491
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,870
  10LT  

492
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,430
 I should use it first. 

493
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:06,000
 But this is the women's restroom. 

494
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,620
 There. 

495
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,730
 In maintenance. 

496
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:12,740
 If you get it now, get lost. 

497
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,190
 I'm in a hurry.. 

498
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:19,380
 You are damn slow-witted. 

499
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,640
 Get lost before I kill you! 

500
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,800
 In maintenance 

501
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:56,610
 What's this? You are not getting lost? 

502
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:03,880
 This woman has a dying wish- 

503
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,060
 It took me two hours to get ready. 

504
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,540
 Why are you doing this to me? 

505
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,140
 Now you get how much of a hurry I'm in, right? 

506
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,910
 Alright, then. 

507
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,350
 It's connected. 

508
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,950
  I'm following ten meters behind.  

509
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:02,030
 Stay where you are. Taxi should be on wait until requested, too. 

510
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,040
 When you spot Michael, report it to me immediately.  

511
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,090
 Got it. 

512
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,990
 Breathe. 

513
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,170
 Please take a breath. 

514
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,100
 You are doing well. 

515
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,200
 Are you alright? 

516
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,230
  Here.  

517
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,020
 I'm sorry. 

518
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,930
 Guide and Kangaroo. Come to the tower and support us. 

519
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,310
 I'm coming! 

520
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,050
 I think there is something wrong with Rabbit. 

521
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,730
 It's an emergency. Come right to the tower. 

522
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,970
 Kwon Min Seok. What happened? 

523
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:17,870
 - Blue scarf.
 - What? 

524
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,820
 Blue scarf. 

525
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,430
 We found him. He's the one with a blue scarf. Block the elevator. 

526
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:26,510
 Excuse me. Let me pass. 

527
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,650
 - Ms. Baek!
 - Where's is Michael? 

528
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,200
 Team Leader, the director is telling us to stay on standby. 

529
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,530
 I can't do it. I'm not doing it. No. 

530
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,980
 I'm not doing it. I can't. 

531
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,860
 Ms. Baek! 

532
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,370
 Ms. Baek! 

533
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,920
 What's going on right now? 

534
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,600
 What is this? Why is it doing this? 

535
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,200
 Look. Is Team Leader Baek creating an incident again? 

536
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,030
 I'm going to the east gate parking lot. Get the taxi ready. 

537
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,060
 One moment please. 

538
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,860
 What are you waiting for? Can't you see the motorcycle? 

539
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,760
 I was told to wait until we were called in to reinforce. 

540
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,990
 You get out. Get out! 

541
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:32,980
 I couldn't stop Team Leader Baek. 

542
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,150
 I'm sorry. 

543
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:40,160
 You should've stopped her until we get reinforcements! 

544
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,720
 What kind of fool are you, idiot! 

545
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,100
 I said stand by until the order to reinforce came through. Why would she go after him on her own? 

546
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,920
 First track her location now! 

547
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,350
 This is why I asked for a premium taxi. 

548
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,960
 Kwon Min Seok? 

549
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,460
 I almost shot you. 

550
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,140
 How'd you catch up? 

551
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,110
 I followed after you right away. Are you alright? 

552
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,730
 I'm good.  

553
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:03,020
 Go take a look around. Michael is near us. 

554
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:34,940
 You are alright. You will be alright. 

555
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,990
 Hang in there a bit. 

556
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,440
 Chan Mi! Chan Mi! 

557
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,930
Ahh!

558
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,050
She's out!

559
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:08,720
 Baby is here. You suffered a lot. 

560
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,660
 You did well. 

561
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,930
♫  I was walking, a vacant look on, and stopped in my tracks  ♫

562
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:41,110
 Min Seok, I think I'm going to give birth now.  

563
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:46,060
♫  Staring for a while,  ♫

564
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,630
♫  Then tears rolled down my cheeks  ♫

565
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:56,100
♫  Are you doing well?  ♫

566
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:01,030
♫  Today is cozy like Spring  ♫

567
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:05,950
♫   I look back at that day  ♫

568
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:10,620
♫  I gently close my eyes  ♫

569
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,830
 I love you. 

570
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:22,860
♫  I used to try to grasp onto it with all my might  ♫

571
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,960
♫  I didn’t know, then,  ♫

572
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,490
♫  That even with all my efforts  ♫

573
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,930
 What's this? Kwon Min Seok! 

574
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:38,550
 Kwon Min Seok! Min Seok! 

575
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,900
 Min Seok! Open your eyes! No! 

576
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,240
 No, no, Min Seok! No! No! 

577
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,950
 Min Seok, open your eyes! 

578
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,480
 Team Leader Baek! 

579
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,010
 It can't be like this. 

580
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,960
 Michael! 

581
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:21,260
  You are under arrest in accordance with the Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology.   

582
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:30,320
 But trash like you cannot be saved by the laws. 

583
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,170
 The laws, my butt. Just die, you bastard! 

584
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:53,140
 Baek Chan Mi, come to your senses! 

585
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,610
 Your call cannot be connected. After the beep-- 

586
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:23,120
 Clear. Shock.

 150 joules.  

588
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,910
 Charge. 

589
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:30,010
 Clear. Shock. 

590
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,470
 Your call cannot be connected. After the beep, you will be transferred to the voicema-- 

591
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,360
 Patient Kwon Min Seok passed at 20:30. 

592
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:37,030
 - Chan Mi.
 - Don't do this. 

593
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,990
 What are you doing? 

594
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,850
 Don't do this. Stop. 

595
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:48,050
 - Let go. 
 - Sunbae.  

596
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,940
  Why?  

597
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:54,440
 Don't do this. Get yourself together! 

598
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,520
  You really!  

599
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,610
 Come here. 

600
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:06,020
 Come to your senses! 

601
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,820
 You wait a bit. 

602
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:47,340
 I will get that bastard who killed you and make him kneel before you. 

603
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:44,590
There is only one opportunity. Go forward or fall to your death.

604
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:48,990
If one person makes a mistake, we all fall and die.

605
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:50,890
Depart!

606

 Epilogue 

614
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:36,910
 Baek Chan Mi 

615
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:39,040
 Personnel File 

616
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:52,200
Three agents in total will start the undercover infiltration

617
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,440
of Il Gwang HiTech.

618
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:06,600


619
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,130
 Good Casting 

620
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,960
- Baek Chan Mi. 
 - You didn't fill in her resume?

621
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,230
 So you were not worried about a career break? 

622
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:19,690
  The society which directly rejects women who have had an interruption in their career is exactly...  

623
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:20,600
 Darn it. She must have gone crazy. 

624
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,530
  Position secured.  

625
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:24,360
 On the field, it's a fight to the second. Don't get distracted. Break through.   

626
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,110
 Hey, Ma'am. Where are you going! 

627
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:28,320
 - He's here.
 - We are not even close. We should hurry. 

628
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,870
 What should we do if Sunbae Baek Chan Mi gets caught? 

629
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:33,560
  - Good! 
 - It's me, the hottest star at the moment, Kang Woo Won. 

630
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,620
  Where are you going? Tell me. Who are you? What's your identity?  

631
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,350
 Don't involve personal emotions at work. Do you want to croak over the hill again? 

632
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:40,760
 I'm going to dig till the very end! 

633
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,530
 Until I get him.
