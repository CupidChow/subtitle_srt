1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,960
The North assassin, Hailan Zhen,

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,600
He sneaked into our country through the marriage

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,800
to assassinate the Crown Prince.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,280
It's a heinous crime.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,880
He will be executed immediately.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,040
Time's up.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,520
Execute!

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,040
Wen Ruyu!

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,600
Don't come to save me again.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,480
Live on.

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,320
Another one died.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,280
What happened?

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,560
This is suicide.

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,720
If you can't see anyone before you die,

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,880
I'll return to the Reincarnation Temple.

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,880
I knew it.

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,479
This is my last chance.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,039
I must change everything.

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,120
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

20
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,440
Madam.

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,240
Our young master is handsome.

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,080
from a noble family.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,440
Whoever marries him is really lucky.

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,080
Yu'er said he had a lover.

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,520
and refused to get married.

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,199
But I think the Princess of the North

27
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,480
is also elegant.

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,600
and Yu'er

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,440
will be a loving couple.

30
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,400
Greetings, Princess.

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm Wen Ruyu.

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
a third-rank official of the Southern State.

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
Although she is a civil official,

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,079
Could it be her?

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,960
I should leave.

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,040
Will we meet again?

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Yes.

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,800
When the war is over,

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,920
I'll come to North to find you.

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,720
How long are you going to dawdle?

41
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,079
You're definitely not Laya.

42
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,400
She can't be a killer.

43
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
What's going on?

44
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,320
How long are you going to dawdle?

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
That again.

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,920
The same move.

47
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,000
Again.

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,680
Why did you attack me?

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Why did you kill me?

50
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,080
You look weak.

51
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,480
but also skilled.

52
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm the descendant of the general.

53
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,560
I know some martial arts.

54
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,159
Unfortunately, you can't fight in real life.

55
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,760
I died again.

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,880
How long are you going to waste?

57
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,840
I won't lose to you this time.

58
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,640
I must dodge this time.

59
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,560
She is indeed better than me.

60
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,920
I can't get involved with her anymore.

61
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,120
We can't stay here forever.

62
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,760
We have to find a way out.

63
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,240
Princess.

64
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,240
The guests are waiting outside.

65
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,480
Why don't we meet the guests first?

66
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,400
No need.

67
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

68
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,280
Go and meet the guest.

69
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,080
Huh?

70
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm not her target.

71
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,720
Yes, that's great.

72
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,400
Congratulations.

73
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,960
Congratulations.

74
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,440
Thank you.

75
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,680
Congratulations, Mr. Wen.

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,440
Congratulations.

77
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,160
Congratulations, Mr. Wen.

78
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,000
Thank you.

79
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,640
Congratulations.

80
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,280
Enjoy yourselves.

81
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,840
Your Highness, please.

82
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

83
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
You're welcome.

84
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,400
Today is your wedding with the princess.

85
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,600
is the best time for the Southern Kingdom and the North.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,200
From now on,

87
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,120
I hope the two states will stop fighting.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
So you are the Crown Prince in the south.

89
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,120
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

90
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,560
Princess Hai doesn't know how to address you.

91
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,280
I will teach her slowly.

92
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,160
It doesn't matter.

93
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,520
I don't need you to teach me how to do things.

94
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,720
Yu'er!

95
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,840
Help!

96
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,080
Help!

97
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,400
The target is...

98
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,880
is the Crown Prince.

99
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,560
So her real target is not me.

100
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,120
It's the Crown Prince.

101
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,480
No.

102
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,200
I need help.

103
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,720
How long are you going to dawdle?

104
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,680
If you are bored,

105
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,640
let me take you out to meet the guests.

106
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Although I can't beat her,

107
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,280
the master of the Southern State is in my mansion.

108
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,159
As long as I make her believe General Yuchi is the Crown Prince,

109
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
and lead her to attack,

110
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,800
With Yuchi's skills,

111
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,040
with Yuchi's skills.

112
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,040
Your Highness will be safe.

113
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

114
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,520
Ah.

115
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,360
You're teasing me.

116
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,240
He has calluses on his fingers.

117
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,080
He looks like a general.

118
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,240
You are really smart.

119
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,480
This is General Yuchi of the Southern Kingdom.

120
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,200
Wen Ruyu.

121
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,159
You're usually calm.

122
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,080
Why are you so naughty today?

123
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,520
So you are the Crown Prince.

124
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,280
No.

125
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,320
I can't let her succeed.

126
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:43,919
Come with me.

127
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,560
Assassin!

128
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,680
Your Highness!

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,320
Run! Assassin!

130
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,960
Wen Ruyu.

131
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,120
What's wrong with you today?

132
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,120
so abrupt today?

133
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,480
Your Highness must not approach the Princess of the North today.

134
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,560
Why?

135
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,960
I heard that...

136
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,120
you don't want to get married.

137
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,760
it wouldn't be like this.

138
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,360
Your Highness.

139
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,160
I suspect the identity of the princess.

140
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Dear.

141
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
Where is the assassin?

142
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,320
So scary.

143
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Who is the assassin?

144
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,880
Wen Ruyu is just joking.

145
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
Go back and marry the princess.

146
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,280
Stop it.

147
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,600
Your Highness, step back.

148
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
Wen Ruyu!

149
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
I am the assassin.

150
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,520
The one I want to kill

151
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,960
is the Princess of the North.

152
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
Our Wen family has always had a generation of talents,

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
but all died on the battlefield.

154
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,640
I'm going to revenge today

155
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,960
and die with you!

156
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,040
Wen Ruyu.

157
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,680
Have you lost your mind today?

158
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,600
Guards!

159
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,520
Protect the princess!

160
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,000
Take Wen Ruyu to the Shadow Sect

161
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,000
and wait for his punishment.

162
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,560
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.
