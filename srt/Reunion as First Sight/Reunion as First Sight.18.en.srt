00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Miss, what are you doing?

3
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,080
Are you Wen Ruyu?

4
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,440
You got the wrong person.

5
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,880
Take off your mask and let me see.

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,120
I said you got the wrong person.

7
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,080
Miss, please behave yourself.

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,720
Be careful.

9
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,720
Why did he commit murder in public?

10
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,160
Eunuch,

11
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
I wanted to kill Linyuan but failed.

12
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,520
so I came to apologize.

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,640
Who allowed you to hurt Linyuan?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,160
I asked you to find Lian Cheng.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,320
I can't find out where Lian Cheng is.

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,680
If Linyuan wants to kill him,

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,160
I'll kill him for you.

18
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,560
None of your business.

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,759
Follow Linyuan closely.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,440
Find Lian Cheng as soon as possible.

21
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,759
After that,

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,759
I'll kill him.

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,560
Wen Ruyu.

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,920
Tell me.

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
who did this to you?

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't know you.

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,040
Please go back.

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,720
No.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,360
Then why are you staying in the villa of Wen Mansion?

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,040
Is this the villa of Wen Mansion?

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,640
I only heard that the family moved out.

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,640
so I rented them here.

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,280
Wen Ruyu.

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,560
Let me ask you.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,320
I only wish we could be together

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,440
We'll still be together even when we grow old.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,240
We got married here that night.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,160
Does what you said still count?

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Nonsense.

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,640
Are you crazy?

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,000
Take off your mask and let me see.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,640
Are you crazy?

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
I'm crazy.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
There's a mole behind Wen Ruyu.

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,720
Take off your clothes and let me see.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,360
I know you're Wen Ruyu.

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,520
Why are you avoiding me?

48
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,640
We finally got here.

49
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,000
Why won't you see me?

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm telling you now.

51
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,680
I was the one who robbed you that day.

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,520
If you don't go back to North,

53
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,760
I'll kill you right away.

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,960
Okay.

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,800
I got the wrong person.

56
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,120
I came back to the North...

57
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,080
The person who wants to kill me today

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,640
must be arranged by Eunuch Zhu.

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,000
The sooner you leave,

60
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,160
the safer you are.

61
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,360
Bai Hua.

62
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,600
The alive evidence is Lian Cheng.

63
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,240
Only by getting his confession

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,800
can Eunuch Zhu be executed.

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,159
Before that,

66
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,880
don’t let Eunuch Zhu find him.

67
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,200
What do you need me to do?

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,640
I want to hide him in your residence for interrogation.

69
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
If anything happens,

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,520
put a bouquet of white flowers at my door.

71
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,760
I will come here to find you.

72
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,920
What took you so long?

73
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,160
You're so patient.

74
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,920
Why do you want me to wait in this shabby house?

75
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Hurry up.

76
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,360
You didn't even know I was tailed.

77
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,280
Sir.

78
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,400
Every moment of the night is precious.

79
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,600
Why are you still shy?

80
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,360
He left.

81
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,920
Why are you here?

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,480
You really think I'm leaving?

83
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,520
I just wanted to see what you were doing.

84
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,960
I didn't expect to meet another stalker.

85
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,480
I've walked the way to Wen's Mansion so many times.

86
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,080
I knew you were coming here.

87
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,160
so I took a shortcut.

88
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,160
What about the person waiting here?

89
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,400
You said you don't know me.

90
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,480
Aren't you curious

91
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,840
why I am so familiar with the Wen Mansion?

92
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,720
Oh, right.

93
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,159
the person who is here

94
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,840
is Yuchi, right?

95
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,400
I told him to leave early.

96
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,000
But

97
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,480
I kissed him

98
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,520
I kissed him.

99
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,840
But I didn't expect my kiss would work.

100
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,480
He remembered

101
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,240
in his previous life.

102
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
You kissed him?

103
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,480
Wen Ruyu.

104
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,159
Don't be in danger alone.

105
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,760
For my sake,

106
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
I will kill you.

107
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
Do you understand?

108
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,960
Eunuch, I followed Wen Ruyu to Wen's mansion.

109
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,919
I thought he would meet someone.

110
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
But...

111
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,000
What's wrong?

112
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,840
I didn't expect him to have an affair

113
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,039
with a woman.

114
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,400
I still haven't found Lian Cheng.

115
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,400
I can't let Wen Ruyu find the evidence.

116
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,440
Wen Ruyu!

117
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,360
How dare you mess with me?

118
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,240
I don't believe you have no evidence.

119
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,200
Eunuch.

120
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,800
Eunuch.
