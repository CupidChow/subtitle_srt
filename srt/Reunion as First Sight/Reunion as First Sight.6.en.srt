1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
It's adapted from the online April Day's novel, Network 19, 9. The male lead wants to kill me.

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,040
I used to watch lanterns with Mr. Wen.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,680
Aren't you used to Wen Ruyu having a princess?

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,480
It's an honor to have you by my side this year.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,440
Maybe I can meet them again.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,080
Let's go. The Crown Prince is over there.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,720
Let's go over there.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,160
Let's go.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,800
Let's go.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,200
What are you doing?

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,880
Calm down.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,000
Hurry up.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,960
It's not the time.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,440
Let go of me.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,080
Hold me tight.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,680
This is the riddle stall I told you about.

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,400
What are you doing?

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,240
Young Master.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,600
This...

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,440
Looks like they are lovers.

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,680
Today's lantern riddle...

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,560
Let's go.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,440
Forget it.

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
Go away.

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,160
What are you doing?

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,880
Be careful.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,840
Laya!

28
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,080
It's dangerous!

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,000
Run!

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,160
Laya!

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,400
Laya!

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Laya!

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,200
Doctor.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
How is he?

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,160
Doctor, how is it?

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,920
I've checked

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,360
I’ve checked it carefully.

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,760
but I'm not sure which poison it is.

39
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,960
If we delay it for a while,

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
I'm afraid...

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,280
if I look at someone before I die,

42
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,440
I'll go back to the first time I saw him.

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,000
Then...

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,000
Doctor.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,520
Wait for me.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,640
Okay.

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,440
Rest early.

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,440
Doctor,

49
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,080
If someone tries the poison in person,

50
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,480
can you confirm the poison on the arrow?

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,520
Of course.

52
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,960
But life is at stake.

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,440
Who would like to give it a try?

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,760
Mr. Wen, what are you doing?

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,880
Please cure me.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,200
Mr. Wen.

57
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,320
The detoxification needs to be punctured into the vital acupoints in your body one by one.

58
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,760
You are...

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,920
You'll die for sure.

60
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,320
Do as I say.

61
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Mr. Wen, I see.

62
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,320
It's the meteor powder.

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,839
Write it to me.

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Thank you.

65
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Thank you.

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,200
Doctor.

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,159
What happened?

68
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,000
My wife was poisoned by the meteor powder.

69
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,880
Please treat her.

70
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,480
Okay.

71
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,760
Yu'er.

72
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,880
What's wrong?

73
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,200
You look pale.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,640
Mother.

75
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm fine.

76
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,840
Young Master.

77
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,560
General Yuchi is here to see you.

78
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,440
Okay.

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,520
This is the corner of the sky. It's nutritious.

80
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,440
Take it to the princess.

81
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
Thank you, Yuchi.

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
How about

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,280
keep it for yourself.

84
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,440
The princess is poisoned.

85
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you alright?

86
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,800
The princess was assassinated in public.

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
His Majesty was furious.

88
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,720
She's looking into it.

89
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,840
The princess...

90
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,400
Tell me if you need my protection.

91
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,760
Oh, right.

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,960
I've got news

93
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Is there any news?

94
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,840
Yuchi, tell me.

95
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,840
I asked my friends in the army.

96
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,480
Back then, when the North arrived at Vegeta City,

97
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,280
there was a joke.

98
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,000
Our army

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,160
bribed a North General.

100
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,720
But I chose him because

101
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,720
he was injured on the battlefield.

102
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,640
It's said that he can't do human deeds anymore.

103
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,840
and no offspring.

104
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,520
And those who don't need to think about their children

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,560
is easier to get paid.

106
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
Wen Ruyu.

107
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,120
Wen Ruyu!

108
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,360
Wen Ruyu!

109
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,840
Wen Ruyu!

110
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,600
Run, Wen Ruyu!

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,840
Run!

112
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,600
Laya!

113
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,720
Wen Ruyu.

114
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,280
You're calling me so closely.

115
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,920
Godfather.

116
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,840
Let me have a look.

117
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,280
How can the medicine from the South

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,440
can't stop the North's blood.

119
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,160
Godfather.

120
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,560
What did I do wrong?

121
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,680
Please tell me.

122
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,200
How dare you ask me

123
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,120
How dare you ask me?

124
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,920
I think you've grown up.

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,040
You really want to be the wife of the Wen family.

126
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,840
Godfather.

127
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,680
Isn't Wen Ruyu my spy in the Southern Kingdom?

128
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,080
Bastard!

129
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
Who told you it was him?

130
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,680
Nam-kook is so cunning.

131
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,320
How much does he know

132
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,360
How much does he know?

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,560
Tell me.

134
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,960
He should...

135
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,920
only knew that I wanted to assassinate the Crown Prince.

136
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,760
I didn't know Godfather's existence.

137
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,520
He didn't arrest you

138
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,360
to lure me out, right?

139
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,400
I don't think so.

140
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,920
He's just worried that I'll implicate his mother.

141
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,960
I'm sorry, Godfather.

142
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,640
I will make up for my mistake.

143
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
I only give you three days.

144
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,640
to find out his purpose

145
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,720
and kill him.

146
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,920
Remember.

147
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,280
Do it properly.

148
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,440
Don't let anyone suspect you.

149
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,960
Understand?

150
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,400
Laya.

151
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,200
Don't blame me for being angry.

152
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
I've met the South agent.

153
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,560
He will create an opportunity for you.

154
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,560
If you can't kill the Crown Prince,

155
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,080
you will never be able to atone for your parents.

156
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
No.

157
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,120
No.

158
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,760
Eunuch.
