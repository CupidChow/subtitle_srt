00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,200
Is there anyone else?

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,320
Everyone is asleep so late.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,440
I didn't know Yuchi had feelings for you.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,080
You just marry him when you open your eyes.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,560
I came back with you.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,680
What happened this time?

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
He died again.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,600
What happened?

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,800
I don't know.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
And this time,

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,600
I should be reborn in the Reincarnation Temple.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,880
What do you mean?

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,200
Anyway, if I see someone's face before I die,

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,440
I'll be reborn until the first time I saw him.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,680
But this time is different.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,160
I guess

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,800
maybe it was the last reincarnation.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,480
When I fell asleep,

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,640
before I fell asleep.

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,600
If you can't see anyone's face before you die,

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,040
will be reborn in the Reincarnation Temple.

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,320
I don't understand.

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,599
But what should we do now?

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm running away from marriage. You're snatching the marriage.

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,720
And back to this time,

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Alb is still here.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,360
I will force you to assassinate His Majesty.

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,520
Anyway, we must find a way to kill him.

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,680
Actually...

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,760
Is there any way

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,920
Don’t let her die.

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,640
We share the same disease.

34
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,320
It's just that she asked for it.

35
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,560
Got it.

36
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,360
Your Highness.

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,400
I ran away from the marriage

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,520
to give an explanation to the soldiers of the North.

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,920
Why do you say so?

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,720
During the war between the two countries,

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
there was a betrayal letter

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,920
I wonder

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,280
remember it.

44
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,920
It was too long ago.

45
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,479
Please tell me.

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,240
That letter

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,160
caused the whole MowRige of the North to be killed.

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,640
But later I heard

49
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,880
that letter was fabricated.

50
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,760
It's a sowing discord

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,320
used to sow discord.

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,759
And that general

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,600
is Yuchi's father.

54
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,920
I have an idea.

55
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,079
You can perform tomorrow.

56
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,800
We'll kill four birds with one stone.

57
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,360
Kill four birds with one stone.

58
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,880
That's right.

59
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,280
First, you need a reason to run away.

60
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,560
So I...

61
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,680
even if I want to get married,

62
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,880
I will never

63
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,560
marry someone from Yuchi Residence.

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,720
This...

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,760
Your Highness.

66
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,320
My father has always been a tough man.

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,600
He would never play such a trick to frame us.

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,120
Please investigate, Your Majesty.

69
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,360
Don't ruin my father's reputation.

70
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,880
Okay.

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,880
Your Highness,

72
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,079
allow me to get the letter from the Shadow Sect.

73
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,079
Everything will be clear.

74
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,560
Please come with me.

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,240
Your men have sided with the Crown Prince.

76
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,760
In the future, the Shadow Sect

77
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,880
the letter will be announced to the world.

78
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,720
You don't have much time.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,240
What should we do next?

80
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,800
Alber received the news.

81
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,880
he won't miss this chance.

82
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:27,960
By then,

83
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
we'll catch a turtle in a jar.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Someone assassinated the Princess of the North.

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
General Yuchi, come and protect His Majesty!

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,760
Eunuch Zhu.

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Why is this assassin

88
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,160
wearing your Shadow Sect's clothes?

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,800
Your Highness.

90
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,280
I made a mistake

91
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,240
and let this assassin sneak into the Shadow Sect.

92
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,720
I deserve to die.

93
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,720
Your Highness.

94
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,040
He is not an assassin.

95
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,160
He's our North General.

96
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,040
Alb!

97
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,680
General of the North.

98
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,280
Why did he assassinate you?

99
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,880
Your Highness.

100
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
He tried to assassinate the princess when she received the letter.

101
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,200
I guess

102
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040
is related to that letter.

103
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,000
Bring that letter.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,840
Yes.

105
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,320
Why is the letter from the North written...

106
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,640
Alb.

107
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,159
I understand.

108
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,240
Alber wrote a letter of treason

109
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,560
and framed the loyal.

110
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
Now he knows the princess is investigating this.

111
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,440
and was afraid of the incident,

112
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,800
so he followed Nam-kook and tried to kill him.

113
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
What are you talking about?

114
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,159
If that's not the case, I would've killed you.

115
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,640
As a North General,

116
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Why did you sneak into the South and shoot?

117
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
Your Highness.

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,640
The MowRige family is the hero of the North.

119
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,640
I didn't expect

120
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,640
he was killed by his own people.

121
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,800
I wronged General Yuchi.

122
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,280
Your Highness.

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,480
Please send this letter

125
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,160
to the North King.

126
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,760
and clear my name.

127
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,840
You traitor!

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,159
Your Highness.

129
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,520
I'll keep an eye on him.

130
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,800
and make amends for my mistake.

131
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,920
Fine.

132
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,960
This is the state affairs of the North.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Tomorrow, send this letter

134
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,760
to the North tomorrow.

135
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,720
Leave it to the North King.

136
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

137
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
We'll pay you back!

138
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,880
and frame Alb

139
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
and clear your parents' name.

140
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,520
Now that you've avenged,

141
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,680
and he won’t be able to assassinate His Highness.

142
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,480
You have another reason to escape.

143
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,600
There are only three.

144
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
You said killing four birds with one stone.

145
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,480
One more.

146
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,520
I think when the letter of betrayal is announced,

147
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
Xiaobaru might be able to let go of his obsession

148
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,280
and live well.

149
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,440
Mr. Wen,

150
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,720
You didn't recover the day before yesterday.

151
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,560
and made a scene.

152
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,600
I should apologize to General Yuchi.

153
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,880
Also, the misunderstanding between Princess and the Yuchi family has been resolved.

154
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,640
the marriage is still valid.

155
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,920
Let's get married another day.

156
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,560
Your Highness.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,680
I beg you

158
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,240
to marry Princess Helan.

159
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,880
Wen Ruyu.

160
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,880
What did you say?

161
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,760
I beg you

162
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,400
to marry the real Princess Helan.

163
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,400
Wen Ruyu.

164
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
Dare you say that again?

165
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,760
Do you really think I dare not beat you?

166
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,560
Can you defeat me?

167
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,480
Stop!

168
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,640
Who dares to hit my husband?

169
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,480
Eunuch.
