[Adapted from online April's novel] [Network 19+9] [novel "The Almost-through Male Wants to Kill Me"]

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,960
Dear.

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,320
Honey!

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,880
Honey.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,000
Lazy Bug, get up.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,920
Laya.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,400
Laya!

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,120
Why is Laya missing again?

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,120
What's going on?

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,440
Mother asked me to make breakfast for her.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,120
No.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,760
When did you become so obedient?

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,840
Didn't you say I'll listen to you?

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,920
What?

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
You don't like it?

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,000
Yu'er.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,960
Look at the cakes the princess made for you.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,760
What a good wife.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
Mother.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,200
My husband treats me very well.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,600
So of course

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,000
take good care of him.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,680
Then I have to thank my wife.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,480
Dear.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,280
Hurry.

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
Eat.

27
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,840
Yu'er.

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,760
Why is your jade pendant gone?

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,240
Oh no.

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,800
What's going on?

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,720
Did you fall into the Shadow Sect

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,120
last night?

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,039
Madam. Young Master.

34
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,800
Someone is looking for you.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,800
Mr. Wen.

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,240
please come with me.

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,920
I have something

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,960
to talk

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,880
with Mr. Wen.

40
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,720
Let's talk at home.

41
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,880
The Shadow Sect is so scary.

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,440
Mother.

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,560
Don't worry.

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,520
I'll go with them. I'll be back soon.

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,880
Let's go.

46
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,960
Mr. Wen,

47
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,960
If the jade is in the Shadow Sect,

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,039
Wen Ruyu

49
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,520
will be in danger.

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,520
Mother.

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,800
What does my husband's jade look like?

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
The smell of blood is too strong here.

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,880
Light some incense.

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,160
to help Mr. Wen feel better.

55
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,400
What can I do for you?

56
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,920
I remember you always wear a jade pendant.

57
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,440
Today...

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,600
Why aren't you wearing it?

59
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,440
I was invited in such a hurry.

60
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,120
I don't have time to wear it.

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,760
Lord Wen must have known

62
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,640
about the fire at the Shadow Sect yesterday.

63
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,440
the weather is dry recently.

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,560
Please strengthen security.

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,760
Why did you burn the Shadow Sect?

66
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,160
I don't understand

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,480
I don't understand.

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,079
You must know what the Shadow Sect is up to.

69
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,160
Although I'm just a servant,

70
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,240
I'm not

71
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,800
can

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,280
can make a scene here.

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,440
Wen Ruyu.

74
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,600
What time is it? Why don't you go home for dinner?

75
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,760
Have you grown up?

76
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,920
Come home with me.

77
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,480
Princess Hai.

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,079
What do you mean?

79
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,120
Eunuch Zhu.

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,160
I heard that the Shadow Sect caught fire last night.

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,640
so she asked me to bring you a gift.

82
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,520
Please accept it.

83
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,480
This is...

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,320
This is my husband's jade pendant.

85
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,160
It's glowing in the temple.

86
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,079
I came here to give it to you to keep you safe.

87
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,120
Honey.

88
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,320
I told you the jade was at home.

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,160
A thief stole the jade pendant from the Shadow Sect yesterday.

90
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,600
Eunuch said

91
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,840
it must be me.

92
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,720
What are you talking about?

93
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,720
Mr. Zhu has handled so many cases.

94
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,960
How could he make such a mistake?

95
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,280
It's just a jade pendant.

96
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
How can it be evidence?

97
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,840
Princess Hai,

98
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,720
You put on a show for me.

99
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,360
You think

100
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,400
as a fool.

101
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,600
Eunuch Zhu.

102
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,840
What do you mean?

103
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't understand.

104
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,360
He's my real husband.

105
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,480
and the son-in-law of the North King.

106
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
If you dare to talk about it,

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,520
you'll ruin the marriage.

108
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,160
disregarding the dignity

109
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,160
and the North King.

110
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
I wonder

111
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,760
what kind of punishment should I punish you?

112
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,560
You traitor!

113
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,640
Let me tell you.

114
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm being polite today.

115
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
If they dare lay a finger on you, I will...

116
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,360
Yu'er.

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,280
Are you okay?

118
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,520
Mother.

119
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,480
My husband just took me shopping.

120
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,560
so I missed some time.

121
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,920
You scared me.

122
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,360
I thought something happened.

123
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,280
Nothing.

124
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
Eunuch Zhu wrote a poem

125
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,720
to ask you about it.

126
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,600
You can come to my mansion.

127
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,600
Why are we going to such a bloody place?

128
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,920
That's good.

129
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,960
I'll cook. Let's eat.

130
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,080
Okay, Mother.

131
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,440
Why are you laughing?

132
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,400
You look like a good wife now.

133
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,000
In order to protect me,

134
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,480
Why do you look like a tough woman?

135
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,160
It's my duty to protect my superior.

136
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,360
Who else will protect you?

137
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,920
You're right.

138
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,400
Did I

139
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,000
cooperate well?

140
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,520
Just so so.

141
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,920
You're smart.

142
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,640
From now on, we still need to cooperate.

143
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't act recklessly.

144
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,680
If there's any evidence,

145
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,520
is no joke.

146
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Okay.

147
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,040
Deal.

148
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Give me five.

149
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,960
Deal.

150
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,280
Give me five.

151
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,080
It's a deal, Laya.

152
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,480
What's wrong?

153
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,360
Nothing.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,440
I'm going back to my room.

155
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,840
Could it be him?

156
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,680
Because your life is important.

157
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,600
That's why he said my life is important.

158
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,560
You're not.

159
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,120
No one was born a knife.

160
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,760
You are a living person.

161
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,440
You can love and be loved.

162
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,920
So he said I deserve to be loved.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,520
Laya.

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,040
No matter what happens,

165
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,560
we'll face it together.

166
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
So he's willing to bear my pain.

167
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,360
So he risked his life to save me.

168
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,760
Is it really him?
