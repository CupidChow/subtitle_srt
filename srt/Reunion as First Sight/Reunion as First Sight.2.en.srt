00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[It's adapted from the online April's novel, Network 19+9.]

2
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,360
I've finally trapped her for a while.

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,200
But who is she?

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,560
Where did you get these cinnabar mole?

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,520
Could it be...

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,040
related to my rebirth?

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,560
Mr. Wen has thought about it for a long time.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,480
Have you made up your mind?

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,160
His Highness asked me to ask Mr. Wen.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,880
why you assassinated Princess Hai

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,920
kill Princess Hai?

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,200
Eunuch Zhu.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,840
I had no choice.

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,519
I just wanted to trap the princess first.

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,840
You've always been responsible for His Highness's safety.

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,320
Only you can help me with this.

17
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,360
What happened?

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,400
Go ahead, Mr. Wen.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,000
The Princess of the North wants to assassinate the Crown Prince.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,320
But I can't prove it now.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,840
Please investigate it.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,440
This is a serious matter.

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,800
How about

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,039
I go to see Princess Hai first?

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,160
There are so many skilled Shadow Guards.

26
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,000
can't cure you, a fake princess.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,640
Yu'er.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,320
What happened?

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
Mother, don't worry.

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,560
Princess.

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,200
Eunuch Zhu from the Shadow Sect wants to see you.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,880
Princess.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,760
Princess.

34
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,680
Oh.

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,480
Mr. Wen.

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,400
This...

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,120
The Princess of the North died in your residence

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,079
it's a serious crime to kill your whole family.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,480
I'm in trouble.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,640
This has nothing to do with the Wen family.

41
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,040
Please testify for me.

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,480
I can testify.

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,360
You were in the Shadow Sect just now.

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,000
But I'm afraid Madam Wen and the others

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,360
must be taken away.

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:47,960
Let's go.

47
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,560
How dare you!

48
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,680
Eunuch.

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,400
My mother is the wife of a general.

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
It's not up to you.

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,600
Don't be impulsive, Mr. Wen.

52
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,680
I'm just following the rules.

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,560
I just want you to visit the Shadow Sect.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,640
Let's go.

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,600
Yu'er.

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,280
Mother.

57
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:03,920
Yu'er.

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,840
You are...

59
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,920
Laya.

60
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,640
Hush.

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:42,880
Hey.

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,800
Have you seen Nam-kook?

63
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:46,960
It's...

64
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,880
That way.

65
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,320
Arrest everyone in Wen's mansion.

66
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,920
If I die,

67
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,360
I can start over.

68
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
I'm sure we can start over.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,080
Laya.

70
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,280
Why are you here?

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,360
Will we meet again?

72
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,320
Yes.

73
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,840
When the war is over,

74
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,200
I will come to the North to find you.

75
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,560
Deal.

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,400
It's a deal, Laya.

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
Why are you here?

78
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,560
Laya.

79
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,120
I can't keep my promise to you.

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,159
I'm going to marry the Princess of the North tomorrow.

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,320
You and I

82
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,800
will never be together again.

83
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,680
I only wish the two realms peace.

84
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,360
I hope

85
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,040
find a good man.

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,600
Laya.

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,120
I must save you.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,600
Laya.

89
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,760
I finally see you.

90
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,400
I've been looking for you.

91
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,240
Laya.

92
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,680
Please wait for me.

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Please wait for me.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,080
How long are you going to dawdle?

95
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,680
Laya.

96
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,280
You are Laya.

97
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,360
What are you doing?

98
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,560
Where have you been these years?

99
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,240
Why did you become a princess?

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
Why did you assassinate His Highness?

101
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,920
Who are you?

102
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,200
I don’t know why I can be reborn.

103
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,159
I saw you assassinating His Highness

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,159
and you were murdered.

105
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,960
Laya,

106
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,200
You'll marry the princess tomorrow

107
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,720
and marry into the Southern State.

108
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,040
You just need to assassinate the Crown Prince on your wedding day.

109
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,880
Yes.

110
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,480
Anyway,

111
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,080
I'm your childhood...

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,360
Why am I dead again?

113
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,000
How long are you going to dawdle?

114
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,560
It won't work.

115
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,080
We have to find a way to fool her.

116
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,080
Wait.

117
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
You can't kill the Crown Prince today.

118
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,120
Who are you?

119
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,120
How did you know?

120
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,880
I am...

121
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,000
hiding in Nam-kook.

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
to help you.

123
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,800
Godfather.

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,920
Get up.

125
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,200
Laya.

126
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
You just need to assassinate the Crown Prince on your wedding day.

127
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,520
Yes.

128
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,240
I've got a spy.

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
As for how to escape,

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
we have our own way.

131
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,960
Why should I trust you?

132
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
What evidence do you have?

133
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,400
You're not a princess.

134
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,560
Your name is Laya.

135
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,600
You're just an orphan from the North, right?

136
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Your mission this time

137
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,840
is to expose yourself

138
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,320
in public, right?

139
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,840
Whose idea is it?

140
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,960
When the Crown Prince goes out,

141
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,000
Shadow Guards are always on standby.

142
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,440
If you fail to assassinate him,

143
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,120
our plan will be in vain.

144
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,000
Are you really my superior?

145
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,680
You said there are many masters around the Crown Prince.

146
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
How will you help me

147
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,280
How will you help me?

148
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,200
How?

149
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,080
I only know that someone wants to kill you today.

150
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,560
I'm afraid our plan has been exposed.

151
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,320
For the sake of the overall situation,

152
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,200
don't act rashly.

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,400
Eunuch.
