[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,920
I wrote a memorial yesterday.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,840
Have you thought about it, Your Highness?

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,160
I've thought about it for a long time.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm waiting for you here.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,720
How dare you block the report to His Highness?

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
You want to investigate me in secret?

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,280
that Alber and I were conspiring to assassinate the Crown Prince.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,320
Sir Wen,

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,400
Why do I feel that

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,240
something is missing?

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,440
I want to assassinate him.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,400
There must be an assassin.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,960
Tell me.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,400
Who is this assassin?

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,800
Who is she?

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,640
This is the Crown Prince's residence.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,280
I have a meeting with the Crown Prince.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,720
It's none of your business.

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,440
I forgot to tell you.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll wait for you here.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,160
It's the Crown Prince's order.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,880
Eunuch, other brothers are waiting at the door.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Wen Ruyu.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,200
I've told the Crown Prince

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
the identity of the princess is fake.

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,280
She's just an assassin from the North.

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,160
She wants to assassinate the Crown Prince.

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,960
He should be killed on the street as a warning to others.

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,039
As for you,

32
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,440
Arrest the Shadow Sect for now. If you dare to resist,

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
is equivalent to treason.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,800
Mr. Wen,

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,120
please think about Madam.

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,840
Cui.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,960
Why are we here?

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,800
Princess, Young Master asked me to bring you here.

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,400
Why?

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,880
Young Master.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
He said he had something to deal with.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,000
Wait for him here.

43
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,480
He'll come to you soon.

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
What is he up to?

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,680
I'll teach him a lesson.

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,320
You can't go.

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,480
If I knew you were a North assassin,

48
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,840
I shouldn't have promised you.

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,680
The whole city is looking for you.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,680
Young Master doesn't want to tell us your whereabouts.

51
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
and was locked up in the Shadow Sect.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,640
Shadow Sect?

53
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,760
Mr. Wen.

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,720
Tell me the whereabouts of the assassin.

55
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,840
I will untie you now.

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,680
Are you really not going to say anything?

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
I want to see...

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Your Highness.

59
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,560
If you can see His Highness,

60
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,480
you're underestimating the Shadow Sect.

61
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,160
Since you won't say anything,

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,320
I...

63
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,640
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,320
Laya. Yes?

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,160
Eunuch.

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,760
That female assassin turned herself in.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,640
Yu'er.

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,200
Mother.

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,440
I'm at the Shadow Sect.

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,000
The princess turned herself in.

71
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,800
She has been lying to you.

72
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,240
This has nothing to do

73
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,640
to do with you.

74
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,440
His Highness was willing to let you go.

75
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,000
Laya.

76
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,120
Mr. Wen,

77
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,960
You've recovered and forgot the pain.

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
How dare you come to the Shadow Sect?

79
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Where is she?

80
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,960
At this hour,

81
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,440
probably

82
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,280
He's at the execution ground.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
Wen Ruyu.

84
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,880
His Highness said it himself.

85
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,360
Considering your family's loyalty,

86
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,680
since you were a child,

87
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,480
for your childhood study partner.

88
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,640
I won't kill you today.

89
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,600
But if you dare to break into the execution ground, it's treason.

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,159
The whole Wen family will be executed.

91
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,840
You colluded with the North to assassinate His Highness.

92
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,040
Aren't you afraid that the world will be revealed one day?

93
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,680
I've been with you for so many years.

94
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,520
What you know

95
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
is what I want him to know.

96
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,720
If you want to die,

97
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,360
if you want to kill yourself.

98
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,040
to kill you

99
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,320
kill you?

100
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,840
Why did you do that?

101
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,720
His Highness treats you well.

102
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,160
He treats me well.

103
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,320
Yes.

104
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,600
He treated me well.

105
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,680
My father

106
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,960
was an imperial physician.

107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,880
When the Crown Prince was eight,

108
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,680
he had a fever and couldn't be cured.

109
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,000
His father

110
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,159
ordered to execute

111
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,440
of the Xiao family.

112
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,240
Because the Crown Prince is his only son.

113
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,440
Nothing must go wrong.

114
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,760
Before my mother died,

115
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,520
before she died.

116
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,520
That's how I survived.

117
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,240
I hid my identity

118
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,760
and cut myself out.

119
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,360
I've endured humiliation for so many years

120
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,560
so that the Crown Prince

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,880
the emperor

122
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,080
to make the Southern Kingdom

123
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,320
ignorant, foolish,

124
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,120
hypocritical and cold.

125
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,880
to die with my family.

126
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,080
I want everyone to know

127
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,880
that despite being small,

128
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,240
Trees shake trees

129
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,600
You are from the South.

130
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,800
You are the only Crown Prince of the South.

131
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,760
Do you know that if something happens to His Highness,

132
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
the Southern Kingdom will be in chaos.

133
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,120
Isn't that good?

134
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,200
To be honest,

135
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,520
I've been working hard in the Shadow Sect for so many years.

136
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,000
I can guarantee

137
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,280
you will never see the Crown Prince again.

138
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,560
or the emperor.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,320
You?

140
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,200
How can you compete with me?

141
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,560
Look at him.

142
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
Weak and weak.

143
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
I didn't know she was an assassin from the North.

144
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,520
Look at her. She must be a bad guy.

145
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,400
Yes.

146
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:52,960
Eunuch.

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,360
Eunuch.
