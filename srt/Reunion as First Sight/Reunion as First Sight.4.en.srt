00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,800
Good.

3
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,320
You're born to be a killer. You're born to be a killer.

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,120
Father. Father.

5
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,520
Get up! Get up! Get up!

6
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,560
Your Majesty, I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,760
You'll marry the princess tomorrow

8
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,960
and marry into the Southern State.

9
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:01,880
Yes.

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,400
Northerners lose their hair, so they don't care.

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,480
I've set up a spy.

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,480
You just need to assassinate the Crown Prince on your wedding day.

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,160
As for how to escape,

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
we have our own way.

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,200
As long as the assassination is successful,

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
you can atone for your parents.

17
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,320
Oh no.

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
What happened?

19
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,759
She didn't kill His Highness.

20
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,680
Yu'er.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,360
What are you waiting for?

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,800
Come and see His Highness.

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,759
Here.

24
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,120
Have a seat.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,520
Eat this.

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,760
Here.

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,160
Wen Ruyu.

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,440
Why are you so panicked?

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,880
Don't scare Princess Hai.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,199
How can I not panic when she wants to kill you?

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,960
Madam Wen just asked me to do something.

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,640
I thought it was something.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,520
It's for Princess Hai's amulet.

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,480
An amulet?

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
I will send an eunuch right away.

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,240
Thank you, Your Highness.

38
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Here is the thing.

39
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,200
I heard there is a double moon flower tree from the North.

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,120
The princess came from afar

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,520
so I asked Your Highness for double moon flowers.

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
in the amulet I made

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,880
to relieve your homesickness.

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,560
The princess is my daughter now.

45
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,520
As a mother, I always hope

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,079
to be safe.

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,560
Thank you, Mother.

48
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,960
You're still the kind Laya.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Don't mention it.

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,160
It's Yu'er's blessing

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,960
to marry you.

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,280
Thank you.

53
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,520
Princess.

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
Your Highness.

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,000
I have a request.

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,880
It concerns the Princess of the North.

57
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,760
Tell me.

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,880
to ask the Crown Prince

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,120
to get some

60
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
from the palace.

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,560
Princess and I are very eye-catching.

62
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,280
and she's very kind.

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,440
In my heart,

64
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,240
as my daughter.

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
The Crown Prince has sent her away.

66
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,040
I just sent him away.

67
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,360
Tell me.

68
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,960
Why did you stop me from assassinating the Crown Prince?

69
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,880
I told you.

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
if you hurt my mother in the Wen Mansion,

71
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,000
it's none of my business.

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,280
Then why did you stop just now?

73
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,120
Thank you.

74
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,920
for letting my mother go.

75
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,880
As long as the assassination is successful,

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,000
you can

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
atone for your parents.

78
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,560
What are you doing?

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,680
The Crown Prince is right in front of me.

80
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,920
But I was soft-hearted and missed the chance to kill him.

81
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,200
I deserve to cut off my fingers.

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,720
What did you do wrong to save my mother?

83
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,560
I'm a knife.

84
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,360
A knife can't kill. What's the use of me?

85
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,159
You're not.

86
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,640
No one was born a knife.

87
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,320
You are a living person.

88
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,360
You can love

89
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720
and deserve to be loved.

90
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,640
A weapon should be used to protect the most important person.

91
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,159
You're not a cold person.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,480
I knew it the first time I saw you.

93
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,200
I got it.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
I got it.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,920
The Crown Prince ordered Eunuch

96
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,760
I didn’t expect you to care so much.

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,680
Our princess is beautiful and kind.

98
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,080
Of course everyone cares about her.

99
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,400
Of course.

100
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,720
Our princess

101
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,040
in the mansion.

102
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,440
Those women and maids like them very much.

103
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,040
She's so pretty and kind.

104
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,000
If I had a daughter like her,

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,440
I would wake up with a smile every day.

106
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,440
If Yu'er bullies you in the future,

107
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,600
I'll teach him a lesson.

108
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,120
I know, Mother.

109
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,440
I'll prepare some food

110
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,760
for the two ladies.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,120
I'll go with you.

112
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,000
to cook her signature dish.

113
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,800
The Wen family treated me like family.

114
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,480
but I can only bring them disasters.

115
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,520
Godfather.

116
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,400
Laya has betrayed the Prince of Wen.

117
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,080
The assassination failed.

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,760
[Please come to Nam-kook.]

119
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,880
and get rid of the traitor.

120
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,240
Father!
