00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,360
Laya.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,720
Don't be afraid.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,560
I'll take you home.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,160
It's a big day.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,120
Why are you crying?

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,200
In this world,

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,320
no one cares about me as much as you do.

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,720
Only you.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,240
You're the only one who loves me.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,120
Because your life is important.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,040
Because I really care about you.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
I'm a knife.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,840
A knife can't kill. What's the use of me?

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,280
No one is born with a knife.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,160
You're not a princess.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Your name is Laya.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,680
You're just an orphan from the North.

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,520
Deal.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,120
Laya.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,520
How could it be you?

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,720
You finally recognized me.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,600
I thought we would never meet again.

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,440
All these years,

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
I've never given up looking for you.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,960
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,720
I...

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,039
I just...

29
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,640
Wen Ruyu.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
I remember you.

31
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,199
I don't know what happened either.

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,240
Anyway, every time I was born,

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,480
the cinnabar mole on my arm will be missing.

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
Then there are two more.

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,079
By the way,

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,720
I've memorized the signature on the letter.

37
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
I'll write it to you.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
Impossible.

39
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,040
How could it be him?

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,440
Who is he?

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,680
His name is Alb.

42
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,360
He's my godfather.

43
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,760
He colluded with the enemy

44
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,480
and framed my parents.

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,640
and made me an orphan.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,440
and lied to me to work for him.

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,760
What are you going to do?

48
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,080
He's at the border station.

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,720
I want him to pay with his blood.

50
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,960
Let's split up.

51
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
I've told you the truth.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
How would I know

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
if what you said is true?

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,040
I found my husband.

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,160
the secret letter that Alb colluded with the enemy.

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,320
Bah!

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,920
I believe you.

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
You are the daughter of a traitor.

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
Your parents are the shame of the North.

60
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,800
Alb is at the border station.

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,200
If you've figured it out,

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,440
come and help me.

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,240
Laya, let me go.

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,800
You must have been tricked by that scholar.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,640
Laya!

66
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,400
Laya.

67
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,320
You just got married.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,000
You're here already.

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,960
Are you scared?

70
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,640
You know.

71
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,560
I'll end up being a traitor.

72
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,080
I have nothing to be afraid of now.

73
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,080
I just want to ask you one thing today.

74
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Did you frame my parents

75
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,440
to my parents back then?

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,080
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,680
[The letter to Vegeta's City]

78
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,600
It's hidden in the Southern Kingdom Shadow Division.

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,440
Do you need me to recall it for you?

80
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,720
You used the chance of assassination

81
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,160
to investigate the truth.

82
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,640
Why did you do that?

83
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
Why?

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,360
Fine, I'll tell you today.

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,920
I was badly injured

86
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,480
I was seriously injured

87
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,560
and became a eunuch.

88
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,440
All the merits belong to your father.

89
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,840
Why can't I

90
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,280
Why not?

91
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,920
You're despicable.

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,159
Don't forget

93
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,080
I taught you.

94
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,120
From the day I taught you,

95
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,000
I've been waiting for this moment.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,040
I deliberately left a loophole.

97
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,920
You'll never get your revenge.

98
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,840
Who are you?

99
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,800
I'm her husband.

100
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,400
We're two against one now.

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
You might not be able to defeat us.

102
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,960
There's no chance of winning.

103
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Laya, wait.

104
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,800
Count me in.

105
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,000
Shamaness.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,080
You believe us?

107
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

108
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,040
I'm here to save Godfather.

109
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,159
You two will die tonight.

110
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,200
You're overestimating yourself. You're asking for death.

111
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,240
Dream on!

112
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,320
I've informed our generals of South Kingdom to come.

113
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,360
You have no chance of winning.

114
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,920
Get up. Go.

115
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
Shamaness.

116
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,680
Godfather.

117
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,320
I can't leave.

118
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,400
You go first.

119
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,280
No.

120
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,240
I'll wait for them at my last breath.

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,640
and kill Laya.

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,520
and avenge my parents.

123
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,320
That bastard

124
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
lied to me.

125
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,040
that Godfather

126
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,480
Godfather is the traitor back then.

127
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,960
How could I believe that?

128
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
She didn't lie to you.

129
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,080
The most regretful thing in my life

130
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,640
is that I took you in.

131
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,600
The more loyal you are,

132
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,320
the more I regret it.

133
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,200
the more I feel guilty.

134
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,640
I owe you in this life.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,080
in the next life.

136
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,040
die with me.

137
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,320
Eunuch.
