00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,760
Eunuch,

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,720
Alber's body was found near the post.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,800
What?

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
His men haven't done anything yet.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,920
He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,120
I'm still investigating.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,680
He was a general of the North.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,160
He died in the Southern State.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,960
I'm afraid His Majesty wants an explanation.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Please rest assured.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,720
I've told everyone

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,440
His Majesty will never know about this.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
Don't let your guard down.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,920
Find out who killed him.

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,560
As long as there is a little suspicious,

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,720
no one can stay.

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,720
Yes.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,800
Father, Mother.

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,440
I've avenged you.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,120
Unfortunately,

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,519
you still have to bear the blame.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
Shamaness,

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,160
Your life is hard.

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,039
You can be free now.

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
What's your plan next?

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,400
I'll stay with you, of course.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,440
Deal.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,640
Deal.

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,120
Honey.

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,200
Why did you bring me here today?

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,840
According to the order last time,

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,600
Yuchi will deliver the painting soon.

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,080
Let's buy the painting of the Princess of the North now.

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
to save us trouble.

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,920
You're so smart.

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,280
Then we will have a smart child.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,040
On the street.

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,720
Is that Yuchi?

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,040
Looks like he'll buy the painting again.

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,040
The real thing from the North Palace.

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,440
I heard that the Princess of the North has a dusty temperament.

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,640
and heroic.

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,920
And this painting is not half as beautiful as the original one.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,040
You're indeed handsome.

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,520
and elegant.

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
You must have seen her.

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,400
I heard that a man will fall in love

49
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,840
he'll fall in love with her.

50
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,960
Is that true?

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,000
How should I put this?

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,400
I've never seen her before,

53
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,360
but we seem familiar.

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,520
It's like I've seen it in my previous life.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,000
I wonder if this is

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,800
Yes.

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,800
You're a typical Hong Luan star.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,640
You must be from an extraordinary family.

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,720
Are you the lover of the Princess of the North?

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
No wonder he bought a painting for his lover.

61
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,640
But

62
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,000
I heard that the Princess of the North has married into the Wen family.

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,720
I see.

64
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,280
You are the son of the Wen family.

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,000
I wondered why he came to deliver the painting last time.

66
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,280
He also said he wanted to give you a treasure.

67
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
I wanted to see you.

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,680
Don't be angry.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,920
I just found out.

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,440
Yuchi hid it well.

71
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,079
I didn't see it last time.

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,720
He's good at pretending.

73
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,640
It's not his fault.

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,320
You've been repeating yourself.

75
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,880
He saw you and me in his previous life.

76
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,880
I thought it was fate.

77
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,600
Are you still defending him?

78
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,000
No, I'm not.

79
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,840
Young Master, Princess.

80
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,280
General Yuchi is here.

81
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,920
Yuchi is here.

82
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,960
General Yuchi came at a bad time.

83
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,840
My wife and I need to go back to our room to rest.

84
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,440
Hey.

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,880
No, no.

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,520
General Yuchi, please sit down.

87
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,640
I'll make you some tea.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,040
Your hand.

89
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,920
to take care of you.

90
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,560
How could I let you pour tea?

91
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,440
Well...

92
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
I'll come another day.

93
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Another day?

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,440
What is General Yuchi doing today?

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,320
just say it.

96
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,280
I...

97
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm here to give you a treasure.

98
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,080
Painting?

99
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,560
Let's just take it out and enjoy it together.

100
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,320
Momo.

101
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,560
Bring me all the portraits I drew for the princess.

102
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,720
Yes.

103
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,680
I'll accept

104
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,480
for you.

105
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,160
But I'm afraid

106
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,960
can't fit the general.

107
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
I...

108
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,560
Goodbye.

109
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,920
You drove her away.

110
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you still angry?

111
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,600
I can't be angry.

112
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,120
Are you still angry?

113
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,080
Okay.

114
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Let me ask you a question.

115
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,280
Then you can breathe slowly.

116
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,400
What's the problem?

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,320
We've been married for so long.

118
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,400
When?

119
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
Get married.

120
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,760
I...

121
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,680
Eunuch.

122
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
We found a clue.

123
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,640
The one who killed Alber was the fake princess.

124
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,640
And Wen Ruyu.

125
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,560
Mr. Wen.

126
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,880
Wen Ruyu.

127
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,640
He killed Alber.

128
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,880
He probably already knew the assassination plan.

129
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,320
Kill him.

130
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,400
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

131
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,280
Eunuch.
