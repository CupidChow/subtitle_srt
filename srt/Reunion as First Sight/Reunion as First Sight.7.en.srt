00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,160
You can't kill the Crown Prince today.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,360
Who are you?

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,200
How do you know?

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,280
I am...

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,320
hiding in Nam-kook.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,760
to help your superior

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,480
to hide your identity with me

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,480
is also your mission.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,200
Why did you lie to me?

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,520
Why didn't you let me assassinate His Highness?

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,560
This is Wen Mansion.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,920
My mother has nothing to do with this.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,280
You're awake.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,640
Lie down and don't move.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,840
Watch your wound.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,600
Don't move.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,360
Did you lie to me?

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,720
What's wrong?

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,600
Tell me.

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,400
No.

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
What's wrong with you?

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,120
Nothing.

24
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,080
You just said

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,120
you want me to stay with you.

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,039
Of course.

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,560
Wait.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,880
Will you go with me to burn paper for my parents?

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,039
Okay.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,480
My family name is...

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,120
is Mowgli.

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,920
My parents said

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,440
no matter where I die,

34
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,760
as long as you leave a mark on the stone,

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
and reincarnate in the next life,

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,560
They will find me again.

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,560
Do you believe in reincarnation?

38
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,920
I don't know.

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,120
If there is a cycle,

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,520
I hope you won't meet me again.

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,200
I was thinking

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,760
if you would kill me.

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,280
You knew I would kill you.

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,880
You want to atone for your parents.

45
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,520
how could you give up so easily?

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,160
The North must have told you my identity is fake.

47
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,120
and asked you to kill me.

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
You knew I would kill you.

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,600
Why did you follow me?

50
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,200
If I don't come with you,

51
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,760
if I don't come with you?

52
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,079
Stop being cheesy.

53
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,520
Tell me.

54
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,200
How did you know our plan?

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,160
Who told you that?

56
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,079
No one else knows it except me.

57
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:34,920
If you want to kill me,

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,160
do it.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,320
You saved me.

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,480
I don't owe you anything.

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,880
I'll give you three darts.

62
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,200
After the three darts,

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,520
I'll do it.

64
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,360
How can I bear to fight you?

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,600
Fine.

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,079
I'll make it quick.

67
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,320
Wen Ruyu.

68
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,600
We have different standpoints.

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,680
I don't blame you for protecting your Crown Prince.

70
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,000
But why did you...

71
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,760
Why can't you arrest me, resent me, hate me?

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Why did you make me a traitor?

73
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,360
I hate these words the most in my life.

74
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,240
I'd rather die

75
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,680
to prove the innocence of my family.

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,040
Don't you know?

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,600
But your parents may not be traitors.

78
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,200
Yuchi heard that

79
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,200
I think the traitor

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,640
was not your parents.

81
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,360
According to Yuchi,

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
he was injured on the battlefield.

83
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,080
That's why he has no children.

84
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,520
In that case,

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,640
your parents are obviously not.

86
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,560
You don't have to live with the crime all your life.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,160
You should live for yourself.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Impossible.

89
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,520
Impossible.

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,640
Are you lying to me?

91
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,200
You lied to me.

92
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,120
Don't lie to me.

93
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,360
What did you do to me?

94
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,200
Rest well.

95
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Don't be afraid.

96
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,360
I'll get the letter for you.

97
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
No one

98
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,640
don't come near the Shadow Sect.

99
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,880
I'm Wen Ruyu.

100
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,159
I want to get a letter from the Shadow Sect.

101
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,840
If you need the token,

102
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,200
I do have one.

103
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,240
Grandfather's token.

104
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,720
So you are the descendant of General Wen.

105
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,040
I didn't recognize you.

106
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,920
The letter you just mentioned is...

107
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
Grandfather used a letter

108
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,880
as a war document.

109
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,560
to the Shadow Sect.

110
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,840
Mr. Wen.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
Sorry for not welcoming you.

112
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,520
You want to visit our company?

113
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,760
Why did you choose a day when I'm not here?

114
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,480
It's just a small matter.

115
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,840
Thank you for your concern.

116
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,520
Please have a look

117
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,600
Please have a look.

118
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,480
It's just a letter.

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,560
Just send someone to inform me.

120
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,360
Why did you come here in person?

121
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,400
The old general is so affectionate.

122
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,360
No wonder you care so much.

123
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,960
Mr. Wen came in person

124
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,600
you must have come prepared.

125
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,440
What I want

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,200
is the letter you stole.

127
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,000
Princess, you're awake.

128
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,320
Where is Wen Ruyu?

129
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,600
Young Master left after sending you back.

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,320
But Madam heard that

131
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,280
Young Master went to the Shadow Sect to steal something.

132
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,360
and got caught.

133
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,440
Princess.

134
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,520
Eunuch.
