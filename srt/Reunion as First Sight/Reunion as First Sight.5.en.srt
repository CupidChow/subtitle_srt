[Adapted from the online April's novel, Network 19+9] [novel "The Almost-through Male Wants to Kill Me"]

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,240
Shamans.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,800
I'm in the South.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,120
Bring Laya to me.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,760
Nam-kook is a nice place.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,800
I put on their clothes

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,560
I became more beautiful.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,320
I don't believe you won't be tempted.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,920
Godfather.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,800
Since you saved me,

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,400
I want to be yours.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,160
Laya.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,800
Look at you.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,080
compared with me?

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,600
Well,

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,000
after you came back from the North,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,360
after you came back from the North.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,040
Why is it mixed with assassination?

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,960
It's a secret.

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,920
The less you know, the better.

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,080
Be elegant.

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,440
You're holding a fan.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,960
not a sword.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,560
Don't you know my background?

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,520
If you want to be elegant, find another girl to draw.

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,640
Are you angry?

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,840
Don't pull a long face. Smile.

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
Why should I be angry?

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,760
You still have the mood to draw when my identity is about to be exposed?

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,840
Drawing is to protect you.

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,840
I bought all the paintings of Princess of the North.

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,560
Of course I need to draw some and send them out.

33
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,760
to prove your identity as a princess.

34
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,880
Get closer.

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,520
Closer.

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,240
You know so much

37
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,880
It seems that you've been in touch with famous children since you came back to South Korea

38
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,640
Of course.

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,320
But I don't like either of them.

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,479
Who do I like?

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,479
Didn't my mother tell you yesterday?

42
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,520
Who wants to know this?

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,759
No one asked.

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,840
I can't help it.

45
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,160
Look.

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
Young master and princess are so lovely.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,240
They look good together.

49
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
What painting?

50
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,800
When did you arrange me to assassinate the Crown Prince?

51
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,880
Don't worry.

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,600
I've arranged everything.

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,960
We're leaving tonight.

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,480
Tonight?

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,120
Laya,

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't want to sacrifice you to achieve my great cause.

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,240
If you know I killed your parents,

58
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
you will raise your sword to me.

59
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,800
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,040
Godfather.

61
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,760
Why are you here alone?

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,960
Where's Laya?

63
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,480
Father.

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,640
Laya

65
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,000
has been a traitor for the man in Wen's mansion.

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,640
Why don't you trust me?

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm the most loyal to Godfather.

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,200
I won't let you down.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,040
I watched you grow up.

70
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,240
I know

71
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
your feelings.

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,600
But...

73
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,520
Don't try to ruin my plan.

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,520
How dare you ruin my plan!

75
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,120
Do you know what will happen?

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,160
Did you hinder Laya's mission again?

77
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,920
Reflect on yourself.

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,880
why I put Laya

79
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,040
not you.

80
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,720
Laya.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,880
It's all your fault.

82
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
It's all your fault.

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,160
I must kill you.

84
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,400
The lantern festival is coming up.

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,160
The Crown Prince will go on a secret trip to see lanterns today.

86
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,760
We're on guard. We might run into him.

87
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,360
Little fool.

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,440
The Crown Prince is noble, so he won't come.

89
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,560
Is it good?

90
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,960
No.

91
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,280
Aren't we here for that?

92
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
We're doing that right now.

93
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,920
You're eating and playing.

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,360
Why is that

95
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,320
The real professional

96
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,520
are hidden in the world.

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,160
Then no one will know

98
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,480
By then,

99
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,720
without anyone knowing.

100
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,520
Got it?

101
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,200
Are you talking nonsense?

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,519
Fine.

103
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,480
Put down the lights and flowers.

104
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,519
Come on.

105
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,680
Take out all the bats

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,920
We're sneaking around

107
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,600
and look around secretly.

108
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,840
Let me see if I can finish it today.

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,320
Here.

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
Take the weapon.

111
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,800
Take it.

112
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
All right.

113
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,840
I'll follow your arrangement.

114
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,440
Let's go.

115
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,320
Let's continue.

116
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,960
Silly girl.

117
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,840
Just spend the festival with me.

118
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,280
Do you want it?

119
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
No.

120
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,160
The mission is the most important.

121
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,240
Let's go.

122
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,800
Sister is so beautiful

123
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,520
I saw you staring at the bird.

124
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,760
If you like it so much,

125
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,960
I'll give it to you if you're right.

126
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,680
No, no.

127
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,360
I don't read much.

128
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,840
I can't guess.

129
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,520
It's easy.

130
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,880
I'll give it to you if you're right.

131
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,520
It's very cheap once.

132
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,640
Young lady.

133
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,120
Give my wife

134
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,280
for my wife.

135
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,360
Okay.

136
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,240
Listen carefully

137
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,320
One is green and the other is red.

138
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,520
One is joyful rain while the other is joyful.

139
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,080
What red and green?

140
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,000
Qiu.

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
You're so smart.

142
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,440
Next question.

143
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,360
Put a window link happily.

144
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,440
Play the gong, play the drum and smile.

145
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,440
Nian.

146
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,760
Bingo.

147
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Since you're right,

148
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
you can have these two lanterns.

149
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
Little girl,

150
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
Didn't you realise

151
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
we were lying to you?

152
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,960
I bought

153
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,800
these two lanterns.

154
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,960
Pay.

155
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,080
Oh, right.

156
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,920
Pay up.

157
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,880
Take a look.

158
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,480
Guess lantern riddles for 20 copper cash.

159
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,840
Even illiterate can guess it right.

160
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,120
If you drink like this,

161
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,080
if the stall owner hears you,

162
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,280
if she hears you.

163
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,920
She needs to go to the toilet.

164
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,720
What's wrong with me taking care of the stall?

165
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
You can do whatever you want.

166
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,360
Unfortunately, I didn't meet the Crown Prince today.

167
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,400
It's a waste of time.

168
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,280
Maybe the Crown Prince changed his schedule.

169
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,400
But I don't think it's good

170
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
to not meet him.

171
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,240
I mean,

172
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,760
At least you were happy today.

173
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
Me too.

174
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,040
Don't always tell me this.

175
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
Let me tell you one last thing.

176
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,080
Without this,

177
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,680
will you stay with me?

178
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,560
What are you doing?

179
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,840
I want you to answer me today.

180
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,120
Without this,

181
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,680
will you stay with me?

182
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,600
If what you want is to be together,

183
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,560
I can't afford it now.

184
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,520
The Crown Prince is over there.

185
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:11,880
Eunuch.
