00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,960
You're here.

3
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,120
I thought I wouldn't have to come in person.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,080
It seems

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,760
it's not as simple as I thought.

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,960
It's not easy to assassinate the Crown Prince.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,760
Besides, the girl you chose

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,440
who needs to be disciplined.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,400
What do you mean?

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,760
I sent the Crown Prince to Wen Mansion several times.

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,200
but your men didn't do anything.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,840
I helped her clear the obstacles and get rid of Wen Ruyu.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
but she came to make a scene and saved her.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,480
Is this the person you chose?

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,200
I will discipline my people.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,160
Let me remind you.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,080
to assassinate the Crown Prince as soon as possible.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
so that you can claim credit in the North.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,920
It's not your turn to remind me.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,840
By the way,

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,560
that letter

22
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,200
was targeted.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,039
But don't worry.

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,080
The letter is still in my hands.

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,479
I'll keep it for you.

26
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,080
and keep it for you forever.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,360
Okay.

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,600
Thank you.

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,600
A bunch of losers.

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,320
I don't know what I'm capable of.

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,039
Lian Cheng.

32
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,520
We can use the portrait of the real princess.

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,920
Paintings!

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,039
Come and take a look.

35
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,240
Paintings!

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,320
Guard Lin introduced me here.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,320
I heard

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,360
you have paintings from the palace of the North.

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,200
Yes.

40
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,760
The Princess of the North is really...

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,440
Yu'er,

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,040
I think you and the princess love each other.

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,120
Don't think about the girl you used to like.

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,760
And burn the portrait you drew for her.

45
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,040
There's nothing trivial between a couple.

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,880
It's all about experience.

47
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,079
Princess.

48
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,480
Princess.

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,000
That was when I was young. It doesn't count.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,480
Don't take it to heart.

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,760
It's okay, Mother.

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,440
I heard nothing.

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,880
I'm going back to my room.

54
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,880
Go and coax her.

55
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,720
This is also an experience.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,280
You said we should follow the plan.

57
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,720
If you have time to paint your portrait,

58
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,160
and no time for assassination.

59
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,760
Let me see

60
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,280
who made you worry.

61
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,760
What are you looking for?

62
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,040
The vase was dirty.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,240
Wipe it.

64
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,160
I think you're looking for a girl's portrait.

65
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
What portrait?

66
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,200
What girl?

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,000
The girl I liked when I was young.

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,560
That painting is right behind you.

69
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,440
How about

70
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,680
I show you?

71
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,440
Keep it for yourself.

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
Don't waste my time.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
Why is the princess so grumpy today?

74
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,160
Young Master.

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,480
General Yuchi is here.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,880
Yuchi is here.

77
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,080
What? You don't welcome me?

78
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,960
Yuchi of Wen's Mansion came and came whenever he wanted.

79
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
It's been a few days.

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,680
I still miss you.

81
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,120
It's because you're not used to not fighting for days.

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,640
But I'm here to give you the treasure.

83
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,200
What treasure is worthy of you sending me?

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,680
Princess Hai.

85
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,400
Your portrait.

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,320
Please take it.

87
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
General.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,160
Why do you have

89
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,480
Why do you have it?

90
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,240
I heard that

91
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
in the North Palace.

92
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,200
and the princess's.

93
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,600
I'll buy it and give it back to you.

94
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,040
Have you seen this painting?

95
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,760
Of course I'll read it when I see the princess.

96
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,280
This is the portrait of the real princess.

97
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,720
If I open it,

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,360
I'll be exposed.

99
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,280
I can't let Yuchi open the painting.

100
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,560
Why is this vase broken?

101
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,080
Is it the one I gave you?

102
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,360
Don't worry, it's not yours.

103
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,680
It's safe.

104
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,640
I'll ask the servants to clean it up later.

105
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,200
and be safe.

106
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,240
Yuchi.

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,720
Let's continue to look at the painting.

108
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,360
This...

109
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,320
Why is she a little girl?

110
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,600
This must be the princess's childhood.

111
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,159
Yes.

112
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,960
His eyebrows

113
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,800
look exactly the same.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,640
Looks like the painter is really thoughtful.

115
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,360
Mr. Wen,

116
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
I've presented the gift.

117
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,720
I have some work to do.

118
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,159
I'll take my leave.

119
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,159
Yuchi.

120
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,960
Let me see you off.

121
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
I think you're looking for a girl's portrait.

122
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,840
What portrait?

123
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,480
What girl?

124
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,120
The girl I liked when I was young.

125
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,920
It's really him.

126
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,920
How could it be you?

127
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,480
You finally recognized me.

128
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,040
I thought we would never meet again.

129
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,360
All these years,

130
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,280
I've never given up looking for you.

131
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,640
Laya.

132
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,520
Wait for me.

133
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,080
When I grow up,

134
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,800
when I grow up?

135
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,000
Eunuch,
