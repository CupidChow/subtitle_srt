00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,120
Your Highness.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,760
Linyuan kidnapped the princess of the North

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,000
It's a capital crime

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,880
is a capital crime.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,280
Please investigate.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,960
Give me an explanation.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,120
Where is the princess?

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,520
The princess is here.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,920
This is my imperial decree.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,480
Princess Helan.

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,160
Did Linyuan kidnap you?

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,160
You can tell me the truth.

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,200
Thank you for saving my life.

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,920
Your Highness.

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
Lord Linyuan didn't kidnap me.

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,400
She just happened to save me.

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,960
She's talking nonsense.

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,280
If it's true,

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,800
why did he hide you in Wen Mansion?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,479
Because Lord Linyuan found out

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,520
my real identity

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,560
is an assassin.

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,960
Wen Ruyu.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,000
You're wrong.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,320
Lian Cheng is not the only living evidence.

28
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,840
I am.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
For me,

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,560
for me.

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
As long as I acknowledge myself as an assassin,

32
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,360
there's nothing to be afraid of.

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
Thank you for saving me.

34
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,240
You let me know

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,360
I can't start another war.

36
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm lucky

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,520
I'm so lucky to meet you. I'm glad to meet you.

38
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,040
Your Highness.

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,560
I was an assassin from the North.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,160
but I was bribed by Eunuch Zhu.

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,840
and tried to assassinate His Highness in the name of the marriage.

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Nonsense! You're slandering me!

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,360
If what I said is not true,

44
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,960
why would I expose myself?

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,680
Don’t I want to live?

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,720
Please investigate, Your Highness.

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,000
This woman clearly colluded with Linyuan

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,160
to frame me.

49
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,920
Please investigate, Your Highness.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,760
Guards!

51
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,640
Take this woman and Eunuch Zhu away.

52
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,920
and interrogate them separately.

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,720
Your Majesty.

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,440
The assassin is loyal to the South.

55
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,000
She has no intention to harm you.

56
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,520
Please spare her life.

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,520
His Highness doesn’t want to see you now.

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,200
Don’t interfere

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,240
before we find out the truth.

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,040
Yuchi.

61
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,760
Wen Ruyu.

62
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,400
What's going on?

63
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,720
Why is she an assassin from the North?

64
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,360
You want me to trust you and help you,

65
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,760
but you don't tell me anything.

66
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,240
What are you planning?

67
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,200
I can’t explain.

68
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,120
but she has no intention to harm you.

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,200
Do you believe me?

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Report!

71
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,400
Lord Linyuan.

72
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
You guessed right.

73
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,120
Rumor has it that

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,200
Eunuch Zhu bribed them

75
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,360
and went to the Shadow Sect.

76
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
This is not a prison.

77
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,120
Do you think I'll let you go to jail alive

78
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,880
and kill me?

79
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,600
If you kill me,

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
if you kill me?

81
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,880
You colluded with Linyuan to kill me.

82
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,480
As for the rest,

83
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,640
the rest.

84
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,320
Since I dare to admit it,

85
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,560
I'm not afraid of death anymore.

86
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,320
It's just that you tried so hard to get me here.

87
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,440
but you killed me when you arrived.

88
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,240
If you want to kill the Crown Prince so badly,

89
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,880
why don't you do it yourself?

90
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,040
How much effort

91
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,960
to get my life back.

92
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,720
Do it yourself.

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,920
Are you stupid?

94
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:57,280
I'll leave it to you North Dogs.

95
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,800
Even if they find out,

96
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,320
it will only be a war for the two states.

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,320
Burning fire

98
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,720
The corpses are everywhere.

99
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,760
That's interesting.

100
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,960
What will you gain

101
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,880
[between the two countries?]

102
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Or

103
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,760
someone behind you wants to start a war?

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,240
Your problem.

105
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,760
too many questions.

106
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,880
You...

107
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,040
Why are you here?

108
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,960
Eunuch Zhu.

109
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
The Crown Prince has heard

110
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,360
the Crown Prince has heard it.

111
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,600
Since he knows you're going to assassinate him,

112
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,040
I've already changed the guards

113
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,040
I've already changed to someone reliable.

114
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,720
Your Highness.

115
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,720
Your Highness, please spare my life!

116
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,920
Your Highness.

117
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,240
I was just confused.

118
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,360
I've served you for so many years.

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,720
I've worked hard even without contributions.

120
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,480
Your Highness.

121
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,440
Your Highness, please spare my life!

122
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,840
Your Highness.

123
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,720
I'm the son of Imperial Physician Xiao.

124
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,040
We played together when we were young.

125
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,920
Your Highness.

126
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,120
Have you forgotten?

127
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,920
Physician Xiao's son?

128
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,640
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,600
I was sick when I was young. I thought the medicine was bitter.

130
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,520
Did you give me a candy?

131
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
It's me.

132
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,120
Your Highness.

133
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,240
You finally

134
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,000
remember now.

135
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,760
If I had known this,

136
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,560
I should have

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
give you a poison.

138
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,560
Mother.

139
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,240
My lord.

140
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,440
I want to take a day off tomorrow.

141
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,440
What is it? Tell me.

142
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,800
I'll ask someone to arrange a matchmaker.

143
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,920
Since I allowed you Shadow Guards to get married,

144
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,520
you all took leave.

145
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
I'll propose to you three times tomorrow.

146
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,159
No leave.

147
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,240
Approved.

148
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,880
Greetings, Mrs. Linyuan.

149
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,840
Thank you, Mrs. Linyuan.

150
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,200
Nothing is more important than my wife.

151
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,120
You...

152
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,280
I'll take the shift for you tomorrow.

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,080
And you.

154
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,280
Come home with me for dinner.

155
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,360
Yes, madam.

156
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,520
Wen Ruyu.

157
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,320
Yes.

158
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,360
When are we going to bring Mother back?

159
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,640
When we find the person behind Eunuch Zhu,

160
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,680
after we find the person behind Elder Zhu.

161
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,200
Then we can

162
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,680
do whatever we want

163
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,120
and leave the Shadow Sect.

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,280
Our family

165
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,680
and have fun every day.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,040
and have fun.

167
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,280
and free.

168
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,840
Okay?

169
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,200
Okay.

170
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,320
Anyway, every time I was born,

171
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,600
a cinnabar mole on my arm will be missing.

172
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,280
Anyway, whoever I see before I die

173
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,200
I'll be reborn until the first time I saw her.

174
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,240
If you can't see anyone's face before you die,

175
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,560
will be reborn in the Reincarnation Temple.

176
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,720
Laya.

177
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,920
Help me!

178
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,000
Laya!

179
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,280
Laya.
