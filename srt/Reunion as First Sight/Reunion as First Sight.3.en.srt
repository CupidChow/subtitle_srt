00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,320
Laya.

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,800
I must protect you this time.

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,080
What is your plan?

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,120
How should we kill the Crown Prince?

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,480
I'll tell you when it's time for you to act.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,720
Just stay in your room.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,880
and don't leave me.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,840
I think you have no plan.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,560
I'll kill the Crown Prince now.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,120
You...

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,520
You ignored the orders of the higher-ups.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,280
Who taught you that?

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,280
I'll tell you again.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,520
It's your mission

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,640
is also your mission.

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Don't worry.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,040
I won't do anything against you.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,640
It's all for the big picture.

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,680
Fine.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,360
Let's focus on the overall situation.

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,440
Whether his identity is real or not,

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
I have to find a way to sneak out

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,760
to find out the truth.

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,720
Laya, wait for me.

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,920
When I grow up,

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,200
when I grow up, okay?

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,200
Laya.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,039
I didn't expect

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,560
to keep my promise in this way.

31
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,200
Humph.

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,440
You think you can trap me?

33
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,160
Are you hurt?

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,840
He didn't lie to me.

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,640
Someone really wants to kill me.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,079
I told you someone wanted to kill you.

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,440
Why didn't you stay with me?

38
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,600
I...

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,200
I...

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,840
I'm just hungry.

41
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,600
I want to find something to eat.

42
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,480
Before we catch the assassin,

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,720
before we catch the assassin.

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,320
Stay with me wherever you go.

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,840
Tell me if anything happens.

46
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,440
Wait for me.

47
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,120
Why does he care so much about me?

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,560
He tried so hard to protect me just now.

49
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,600
Is he really my superior?

50
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,960
He went to get me food.

51
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,080
What are you thinking?

52
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,760
Are you hungry?

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,800
Try it.

54
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,120
I'll make something else if you don't like it.

55
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760
Why are you so nice to me?

56
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,840
Why do you care so much about my life?

57
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,680
Because your life is important.

58
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,560
Laya.

59
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,840
It's dangerous.

60
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,200
Just pretend that you're dead.

61
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,440
Godfather.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,320
it's going to be dangerous.

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
If I can't come back alive,

64
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,040
I'll say goodbye today.

65
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,600
No one has ever cared about me.

66
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,280
Is my life

67
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,800
really that important?

68
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,760
And...

69
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,880
I really care about you.

70
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,000
What are you talking about?

71
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,520
I'm not.

72
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
Since I was a kid...

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,120
Stop it.

74
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,440
Get out!

75
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,840
How could you say that?

76
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,840
Do you really think I'm Madam Wen?

77
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,120
Laya.

78
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,520
You liar!

79
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,280
One day,

80
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,080
I will kill you.

81
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,000
Senior.

82
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,520
I'll go to the South in a few days to carry out my mission.

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,560
There's no chance of survival.

84
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,000
If I die,

85
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,720
you'll be my priority.

86
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,680
It's dangerous.

87
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,760
Don't follow me.

88
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,840
Bah!

89
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,720
I believe you.

90
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,600
You said it was dangerous.

91
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,200
You're the wife of the Wen family.

92
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,880
You ungrateful traitor.

93
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,520
You really let Godfather down.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,760
Why did Laya assassinate the Crown Prince?

95
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,880
Why did someone try to kill Laya?

96
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,360
What's behind this?

97
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,720
What does

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,600
have to do with my rebirth?

99
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,040
Once I die,

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,480
The mark will be missing.

101
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,200
Don't tell me...

102
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,840
Do I only have four chances left?

103
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,240
Why am I trapped in such a dangerous trap?

104
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
Why me?

105
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,080
Yu'er.

106
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,400
What are you doing with these?

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,600
All the men of the Wen family died on the battlefield.

108
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,159
Mother forbids you to touch these things.

109
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,000
Mother.

110
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,960
I'm just taking it out for a look.

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,680
Don't worry.

112
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,240
Drink the soup.

113
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,480
and live a good life.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Madam.

115
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,520
Doctor Lin suddenly asked for you.

116
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,240
He said he got the wrong soup for Young Master.

117
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,440
I got it.

118
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,640
Love.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,920
This is love.

120
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,320
I'll get the antidote for you.

121
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,520
Hang in there.

122
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,400
Let's go.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,880
Wen Ruyu.

124
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,320
I ran into your mother and said I'd get you the antidote.

125
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,320
What happened?

126
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,080
Nothing.

127
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,919
You go out first.

128
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,120
You're poisoned.

129
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,480
Who did it?

130
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,040
You're poisoned.

131
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,880
Who did it?

132
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,760
Young Master.

133
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,160
His Highness has sent a message

134
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,760
that he's coming

135
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,640
to visit the princess.

136
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,960
Why are you here, Your Highness?

137
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,560
Prepare some tea.

138
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
Let's go and greet them right away.

139
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,560
Yes.

140
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll assassinate you, you cover me.

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,280
We must take the lead.

142
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
I'll go back to my room and prepare the weapons.

143
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,000
Wait.

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,120
What now?

145
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,280
I...

146
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,560
My mother said she was looking for the antidote for me.

147
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,400
because I was poisoned.

148
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,920
The arrow I took for you last night

149
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,160
the arrow was poisoned.

150
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,480
Only the Crown Prince can save me.

151
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,480
My mother went to ask for medicine from the Crown Prince.

152
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,960
If you kill him today,

153
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
I will die for sure.

154
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,000
There's still a chance to assassinate the Crown Prince.

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,280
But my life

156
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,800
to save me.

157
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,360
He was poisoned because he risked his life to save me.

158
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,280
How can I ignore his life?

159
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,120
Young Master. Princess.

160
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,440
The Crown Prince is here.

161
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,040
Help me.

162
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,280
I'm not feeling well.

163
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,040
I'll see Young Master later.

164
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,920
Yes.

165
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,360
Go get the medicine.

166
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,640
I'll let him go today.

167
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,360
and assassinate him another day.

168
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,520
I'll seal your acupoints

169
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,600
to infiltrate your heart.

170
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,160
Yu'er.

171
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,720
The antidote for love.

172
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,520
Go on.

173
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,320
Go on.

174
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,000
Well...

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,720
Your Highness is going to receive His Highness.

176
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,640
Love lingers.

177
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,400
You're in love.

178
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,960
I...

179
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,240
Why did you lie to me?

180
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,920
Why didn't you let me assassinate His Highness?

181
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,880
This is Wen Mansion.

182
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
My mother has nothing to do with this.

183
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,200
If anything happens to the Crown Prince in Wen Mansion,

184
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,560
no one in the Wen family will survive.

185
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,760
Eunuch.

186
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,160
Eunuch.
