00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,320
I'm sorry, Young Master.

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,120
Luckily, I didn't spill your tea.

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,040
I'm fine.

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,840
I've never seen you before.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm a new maid, Momo.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,040
I've never seen you before, Young Master.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,160
I offended you.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,360
Please forgive me.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,520
It's fine.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,680
Laya! Laya!

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,240
Laya.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,480
I failed to protect you.

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,640
This time,

15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,480
who wants to kill you this time.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,320
Princess.

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,120
Young Master!

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Young Master!

19
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,720
Young Master, wake up!

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,479
Young Master!

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,320
Young Master!

22
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,479
Young Master!

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,640
Why am I back here?

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,240
Shouldn't it be a wedding house?

25
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,440
I'm sorry, Young Master.

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,600
If I watch someone die,

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,360
I'll go back to the time I first met him.

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,720
Oh no, Laya.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,400
Stop drinking.

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,960
What are you doing?

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,320
Someone wants to kill you.

33
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,120
Someone poisoned the tea.

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,680
It's not poisonous this time.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,400
Are you too nervous?

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,800
Did I come early this time?

37
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,680
In such a short time,

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
the murderer must still be in the mansion.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,960
Who is it?

40
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,240
I’ll go after him.

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
Shamaness.

42
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,560
Why did you hurt me?

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,360
Instead of seeing you dragging on,

44
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
I'd rather end it as soon as possible.

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,000
and let me kill you traitor.

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,920
Please go back and tell Godfather

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,079
I will assassinate him as soon as possible.

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,560
How dare you mention Godfather?

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,760
Your parents betrayed the North and colluded with the South.

50
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,520
Godfather even let a traitor's daughter

51
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,640
to carry out the mission.

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,440
In my opinion,

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
you should be beheaded with your parents

54
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,960
and be despised by the North Clan forever.

55
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,720
Enough, Senior.

56
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,960
I will atone

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
for my parents.

58
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,480
I've met with Nam-kook's informant.

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,320
Follow the plan.

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,640
South China.

61
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,480
What?

62
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,440
My husband

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,160
isn't Nam-kook's boss?

64
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,480
You slut.

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
Aren't you smart?

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,519
You were fooled by a weak scholar.

67
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,360
I'll play along.

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,079
Just wait to be punished by Godfather.

69
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,920
Godfather did ask people from Wen Mansion to help you secretly.

70
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,960
So,

71
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,520
is your husband.

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,280
Since you've revealed your identity,

73
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,159
then listen to him.

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,840
I wish you all the best.

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,000
Your parents betrayed the North and colluded with the South.

76
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,240
Godfather even let a traitor's daughter carry out a mission.

77
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,440
In my opinion,

78
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,720
you should be beheaded with your parents

79
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,600
and be despised by the North Clan forever.

80
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,159
Laya.

81
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,080
Are you okay?

82
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,800
Are you hurt?

83
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,720
Where is the assassin?

84
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,920
He left.

85
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,400
She's my senior.

86
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Senior.

87
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
They are in cahoots.

88
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,000
Did I expose myself?

89
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,880
I can't talk here.

90
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Let's go back first.

91
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,520
She knows the truth.

92
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,160
Why did she come back?

93
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,160
Her senior killed Laya.

94
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,320
Why did Raya come back safely this time?

95
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,800
Why didn't her senior expose me?

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,960
No.

97
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,800
She must be up to something.

98
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,200
Laya, what kind of situation

99
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,480
in the North?

100
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,320
Okay.

101
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,680
Since we've identified him,

102
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,320
let's be honest.

103
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,760
I'll listen to you

104
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,280
I'll listen to you.

105
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,640
I need to figure out

106
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,000
who your senior is.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why did she kill you?

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,880
She was the first killer adopted by my foster father.

109
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,920
She's always been like this to me.

110
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,000
Why?

111
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,200
You don't need to know.

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
I already taught her a lesson.

113
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
Forget it.

114
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,080
What do you mean?

115
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,800
It's not like she did anything to me.

116
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,040
If someone wants to kill you,

117
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,400
You don't even take it seriously.

118
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,040
Do you know how worried I was?

119
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Wen Ruyu.

120
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,640
I have three rules.

121
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,520
I can listen to you in the future.

122
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,520
But don't worry about me.

123
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,120
We're just strangers.

124
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Leave me alone.

125
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,840
Okay.

126
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,640
I'll sleep in the study from now on.

127
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,040
so that you won't be upset.

128
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,040
No need.

129
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,960
I'll sleep in the study.

130
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
What's wrong?

131
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,200
Who let you in?

132
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,000
What are you doing?

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,880
Don't touch me.

134
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,880
Don't move.

135
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,600
Hang in there.

136
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
I'll get you the medicine later.

137
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Sorry.

138
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,400
I was too harsh just now.

139
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,159
If you don't want to tell me,

140
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,559
I won't ask.

141
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
Tell me.

142
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,640
I'll listen.

143
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,560
my parents were treacherous.

144
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,080
Ten years ago,

145
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,520
they colluded with Nam-kook

146
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,480
causing the whole city to be slaughtered.

147
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,280
The whole family

148
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,720
died that night.

149
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,840
Northerners hate me.

150
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,680
I deserve it.

151
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,400
This assassination

152
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,440
to atone for my parents.

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,800
Even if I have to pay it back with my life,

154
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,320
I won't back down

155
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,960
Everything you carry

156
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,760
because of that slaughter.

157
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,840
So that's why you became an assassin.

158
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,600
There might be a reason behind what your parents did.

159
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,120
I want to know why they betrayed our country.

160
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,000
Laya.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No matter what happens,

162
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,040
we'll face it together.
