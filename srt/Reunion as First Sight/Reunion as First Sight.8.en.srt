00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9 novel "The Almost-through Male Wants to Kill Me".

2
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,640
Mr. Wen,

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,040
Why did you steal the letter?

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,720
Do you remember?

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,880
This medicine

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,440
can make people unconscious.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,560
I think Mr. Wen

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,600
you will tell me everything.

9
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,160
I'll say it once.

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,720
Get lost.

11
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,320
You want to kill yourself?

12
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,759
I'll kill you!

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,840
Let's see who dares to touch him.

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Who are you?

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,600
How dare you torture my husband?

16
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,360
I'll kill you today.

17
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,800
Princess Hai.

18
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,320
Long time no see.

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,240
you still have such a temper.

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,280
Please accept it.

21
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,760
Let me take my husband back.

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,840
There's still room for this.

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,240
The princess doesn't seem to understand.

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,440
Mr. Wen stole confidential documents from the Shadow Sect. The evidence is solid.

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,079
This is a serious crime in the South.

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,720
As a princess,

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,320
I can't afford it.

28
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
If I die in the Shadow Sect,

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
in the Shadow Sect?

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,360
Princess, don't be impulsive.

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,040
This is related to the laws of the Southern Kingdom.

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,000
Please give me some time to think about it.

33
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
Okay.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,440
I'll give you one joss stick.

35
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,240
Now,

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,320
All of you, get out!

37
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,600
Calm down, Your Highness.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,320
I'll go out now.

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,760
Wen Ruyu!

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,800
Wen Ruyu, wake up!

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,600
Wen Ruyu!

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,079
Eunuch.

43
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,480
News from the palace

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,120
that Madam Wen went to the palace to plead.

45
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,240
and asked His Majesty to come to the Shadow Sect.

46
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,200
Eunuch.

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,680
Did Helan really give an incense stick to stall His Majesty?

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,800
Tell everyone to leave the Shadow Sect.

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,840
Yes.

50
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,720
Wait.

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,920
Pick some useless ones.

52
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,680
Yes.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
You're awake. How are you?

54
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,760
Can you hold on?

55
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you doing here?

56
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,520
Don't worry.

57
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,560
Her Highness has entered the palace to beg for mercy.

58
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,880
His Majesty will be here soon.

59
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,600
I will let you out

60
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,040
I'll let you out.

61
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Idiot.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,320
How do you explain that letter?

63
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,520
Aren't you afraid that the Crown Prince

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,960
according to the clues?

65
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,640
I don't care anymore.

66
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,680
You've done so much for me.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,519
I only care about your life now.

68
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,800
Wait.

69
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,680
Where did the smoke come from?

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Help!

71
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,159
Help!

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,960
There's someone here.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,320
Someone!

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,560
Hurry!

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,400
Follow me.

76
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Here's the water.

77
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,880
Eunuch.

78
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,680
If they were burned to death inside,

79
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,040
will His Majesty blame us?

80
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,920
The Shadow Sect caught fire in an accident.

81
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,600
We couldn't save him.

82
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,720
His Majesty

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,440
will understand.

84
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you doing?

85
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,160
I can't leave.

86
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,200
Leave now.

87
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,320
I can't take you out.

88
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,640
Hurry up.

89
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,840
Why should I go out alone?

90
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,040
Laya.

91
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,200
Listen to me.

92
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,760
I got that secret letter.

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,640
But I can't recognize the signature of it.

94
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,640
When they dragged me here,

95
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,760
I hid the letter behind the flower pot in the corridor.

96
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,120
You'll find it when you get out.

97
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,159
You want to prove that your parents are not traitors.

98
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Go now.

99
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
It'll be too late if you're late.

100
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,400
I'm not leaving.

101
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,840
I'm not going.

102
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,320
I don't care.

103
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,640
Laya.

104
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,520
Wen Ruyu.

105
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
Don't try to kick me out.

106
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,360
In this world,

107
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,800
no one cares about me as much as you do.

108
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,000
Only you.

109
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,240
Only you love me.

110
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,040
You asked me that day

111
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,480
if I wanted to stay with you.

112
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,440
I'm willing to stay with you.

113
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,080
Laya, don't be afraid.

114
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,560
I'll take you home.
