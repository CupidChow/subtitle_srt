00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[It's adapted from the online April novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,440
Stop!

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,480
Who dares to hit my husband?

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,560
Darling!

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,720
Are you okay?

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,640
I'm fine.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,520
You...

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,840
What did you call him?

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,600
Husband.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,280
Your Highness.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,280
This is a marriage bestowed by His Majesty.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,680
The emperor is a man of his word.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,760
Don't mess around.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,960
Your Highness.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,800
I...

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,240
I'm

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
Wen Ruyu's man.

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,160
General Yuchi.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,120
That day,

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,959
I ran to Wen Mansion,

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,720
I couldn't help it.

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,960
everything will happen.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
My appetite has increased.

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,520
I always want something sour.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,160
I don't know if I'm pregnant.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,000
How about

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,560
take it out on me?

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,160
Yuchi.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,840
It's not easy for Wen family to have a child.

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,160
No, no.

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,800
At this point,

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,640
I will tell Father the truth.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and marry the Wen family.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,160
General Yuchi,

38
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,320
Do you have any objections?

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,720
No.

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,320
Whose child is it?

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,400
who will raise it.

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,160
Thank you, General Yuchi.

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

44
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,200
My husband and I

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,920
will leave now.

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,479
You may leave.

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,440
Yuchi.

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Just now in front of everyone,

50
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,920
in front of everyone.

51
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,320
Thank you.

52
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,840
But I should

53
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
I should apologize to you.

54
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,400
But you didn't show me mercy.

55
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,040
Wen Ruyu.

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,960
Do you really treat me as your friend?

57
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,120
My mother has been strict with me since I was young.

58
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,360
Everyone laughed at me for not joining the army.

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
Only you are close to me.

60
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,320
I naturally treat you as my brother.

61
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,079
At this point,

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,600
Stop nagging.

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,000
Laya and I have no intention to hurt you.

64
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,040
The situation is complicated.

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,080
I had no choice.

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,200
You're here.

67
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,720
Bitch!

68
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,200
What are you up to?

69
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,040
You let the Southern Kingdom catch Godfather?

70
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,320
The letter of betrayal has been announced.

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,000
You must have known.

72
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,600
Alb killed our parents.

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,960
How would I know?

74
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,760
if you forged the letter?

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,360
If I did,

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,440
how can I hide it from the Shadow Sect?

77
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,600
How can I fool the Crown Prince of South?

78
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,400
If you don't believe me,

79
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,400
when the North King receives the letter,

80
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,240
you'll know I'm not lying to you.

81
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,320
Senior.

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,720
Stop being stubborn.

83
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,720
Live well.

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,920
Your life is important.

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,800
You must cherish your life.

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Why are you here?

87
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,880
It's unnecessary.

88
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,760
Leave now.

89
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,760
Godfather.

90
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,880
I'm not here to save you.

91
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,320
It seems that

92
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,360
that letter.

93
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,280
Godfather.

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,600
The arrow is heavily poisoned.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,720
You will suffer thousands of arrows piercing your heart

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,440
and die little by little.

97
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,920
I've been lonely since I was young.

98
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,160
You adopted me

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,280
and taught me martial arts and protected me.

100
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,120
From now on, I only have Godfather in my heart.

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,400
But you lied to me for so many years.

102
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,880
I will

103
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,760
right now.

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,360
You can't do it.

105
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,040
You bastard!

106
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,159
I thought you were here to save him.

107
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,920
I didn't expect you're here to kill him.

108
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,720
Interesting.

109
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,000
Gosh.

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,320
You crazy disciple.

111
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,240
resembles my temper.

112
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,800
Unfortunately,

113
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,680
You don't know how to treat girls.

114
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,520
Let her go.

115
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,280
Since you're here,

116
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
let us go.

117
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,240
Let you go?

118
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,760
What about the traitor who wants to kill you?

119
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,200
Let her go.

120
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,000
I promise.

121
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
she won't show up in Nam-kook.

122
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,440
Let her go too.

123
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,520
How can I report to her?

124
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,800
Think about it yourself.

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,840
This was conspired by us.

126
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,240
Let us go.

127
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,560
and let this matter go.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
Otherwise,

129
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,920
I won't let you go.

130
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,200
Goodness.

131
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,280
Why can't you do anything?

132
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,800
If you don't do anything extreme,

133
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
if you don't do anything?

134
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,120
I never intended to let you go back alive.

135
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,600
Only the dead

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,480
is the safest.

137
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,680
Let her go.

138
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,680
Do you really think you can get out of the Shadow Sect?

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,840
As long as I give the order,

140
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,960
you will be shot to death by arrows.

141
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,400
But...

142
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,320
since you're in such a hurry,

143
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,880
I'll send you off early.

144
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,640
Get lost!

145
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,560
Godfather.

146
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Eunuch.

147
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,240
When the news is over,

148
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,520
find another batch of assassins.

149
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,880
Yes.

150
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,840
But...

151
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
the fake princess is still alive.

152
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,320
What should we do?

153
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
It's troublesome to keep it.

154
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,000
In two days,

155
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,440
Kill him.

156
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,480
Yes.
