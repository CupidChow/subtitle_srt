00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,600
The North Assassin Helan

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,240
and sneaked into our country through marriage.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,440
The Crown Prince was murdered. The Crown Prince was killed.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,920
It's a heinous crime.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,520
Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,680
Time's up.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,160
Execute!

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,680
Wen Ruyu!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,240
Don't come to save me again.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,120
Live on.

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,600
Another one died.

13
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,080
What happened?

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,880
This is suicide.

15
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,800
If you can't see anyone before you die,

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,960
I'll return to the Reincarnation Temple.

17
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,960
I knew it.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,560
This is my last chance.

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,120
I must change everything.

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,560
Your Highness.

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,800
Is Wen Ruyu really willing to join the Shadow Sect?

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,120
Please grant my wish, Your Highness.

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,960
Nonsense.

24
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,200
If I agree,

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,000
if I agree?

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,320
Join the Shadow Sect?

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,400
I want to erase my identity and name.

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,600
No family.

29
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,880
without family.

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
You're the only one in the Wen family.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
How can you face the ancestors of the Wen family?

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,480
Report to the government. There's a body.

33
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,280
The Southern Kingdom Court seems to be prosperous,

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,360
In fact, I formed a clique for personal gains.

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,480
It will be inconvenient for Your Highness to ascend the throne.

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,800
I joined the Shadow Sect

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,360
to help you

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,680
I can do more for you.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
I've made up my mind.

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,600
Please grant my wish, Your Highness.

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,160
The body has been made like Mr. Wen.

42
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,040
Wen Ruyu is no longer in this world.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,920
Welcome to join the Shadow Sect.

44
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,000
Raya!

45
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,600
<i>Reincarnation.</i>

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,800
I didn't expect that we're doomed.

47
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,880
I've chosen to fall into the darkness.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,040
I only wish for you

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,240
to get out of danger forever.

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,800
Wen Ruyu is loyal and righteous.

51
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,120
From now on,

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,240
will be conferred as Linyuan

53
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,000
in charge of the Shadow Sect.

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,079
Welcome, Lord Linyuan.

55
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
to join the Shadow Guards

56
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,080
to fight against Eunuch Zhu.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,760
Eunuch

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,760
It's done.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,200
They're arriving in Nam-kook.

60
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,880
Yes.

61
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,160
Did you leave any trace behind?

62
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,960
Don't worry.

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,000
The only evidence is those assassins.

64
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,920
Just kill them when it's done.

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,760
But

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm afraid it's inappropriate

67
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,519
I'm afraid it's inconvenient for him to act.

68
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,240
Keep away from him.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,560
Be careful.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,880
Are you used to it?

71
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,040
Of course.

72
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
I just don't know

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,880
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,000
Where?

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,760
I'm talking about the Princess of the Northern Kingdom's marriage. It's a pity that I'm here. I'm here to discuss about the Princess of the Northern Kingdom's marriage.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,840
Unfortunately,

77
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,360
Unfortunately, if you didn't join the Shadow Sect,

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,800
His Majesty wanted to marry you.

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,360
I'm loyal to His Highness.

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,200
That's enough.

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,520
You are so loyal.

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
You should learn from him.

83
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,920
Yes.

84
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,720
Godfather.

85
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,680
it's going to be dangerous.

86
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,720
If I can't come back alive,

87
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,200
I'll say goodbye today.

88
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,480
Don't worry.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
I'll be here

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,080
waiting for your success.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Who released the poison?

92
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,240
Godfather!

93
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,560
Who are you?

94
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,760
You don't need to know.

95
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,960
Listen carefully.

96
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
You're just a pawn.

97
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,040
I'll spare your life today.

98
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,240
Leave Nam-kook if you want to live.

99
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,560
Don't ever come back.

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
[If we meet again,]

101
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,080
I will kill you.

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
I'll kill you!

103
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,800
Laya.

104
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,640
Live well.

105
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,520
Don’t come back.

106
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,520
There’s a girl named Xiaobaru.

107
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,560
Take her back to the North after you find her.

108
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,520
Don't hurt her.

109
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,920
Yes.

110
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,680
No one

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,440
what happened today.

112
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,560
Our ancestors were from the Wen family's army.

113
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,800
We will follow you to the death.

114
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,640
I won't betray you.

115
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,080
I have another thing for you.

116
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,680
His Highness needs someone reliable.

117
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,720
I will recommend you

118
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,720
to guard the Crown Prince's mansion.

119
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,280
Yes.

120
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,040
Let's go.

121
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,840
Let go of me!

122
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,040
Let go of me!

123
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,560
Don't move.

124
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,160
Let go of me!

125
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,600
Don't move.

126
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,200
Open your mouth.

127
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,960
Open your mouth.

128
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,040
Are you done?

129
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,680
Go back to North if you're done.

130
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,280
Do you hear me?

131
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,480
Laya!

132
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,480
Alb has been eliminated.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,560
We'll take the barbarian back to the North.

134
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,800
You don’t need to be involved in the rest.

135
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
After we part today,

136
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,640
we never met again.

137
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Who are you?

138
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,920
Why didn't you kill me?

139
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,160
I will never be a deserter.

140
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,200
My lord, she jumped into the lake.

141
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,679
Laya!

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,400
Laya!

143
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,000
Laya!

144
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,320
Wake up.

145
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,720
You can't die.

146
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,040
I have no chance.

147
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,320
You must live.

148
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,280
Laya.

149
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,600
Wake up.

150
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,720
Laya!

151
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,920
Laya.
