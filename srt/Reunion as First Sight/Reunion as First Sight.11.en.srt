00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,680
[Adapted from online April's novel, Network 19+9]

2
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
I'm still dreaming.

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,920
Where is Laya?

4
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,000
Yu'er.

5
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,240
You're awake.

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Mother.

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,080
Why are you in my room?

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,800
Mother.

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,400
Yes.

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,840
Where is my wife?

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,200
Honey.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,800
Where did you get a wife?

13
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,760
My wife is the Princess of the North, Helan.

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,400
Hush.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,760
You've been in a coma for so long.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,840
Why are you still thinking about someone else's wife?

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,840
What coma?

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,560
What other woman?

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Do you remember

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,400
you went to a Reincarnation Temple at the border?

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,480
I remember.

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,080
Then I found you unconscious inside.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,480
and couldn't wake up.

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,039
Why is it missing once?

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,880
Is that not a dream?

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,960
I died again.

27
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,800
The Princess of the North came to get married.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,440
His Majesty wanted to marry you,

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,160
but you couldn't wake up.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,039
so I gave it to General Yuchi.

31
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,960
I'm afraid

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm afraid the wedding is about to begin.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,840
Yuchi just...

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,280
Princess.

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,000
Today, you and I are married.

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,120
I will treat you well in the future.

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,680
Princess.

38
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,400
Have we met before?

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,760
Stop talking nonsense.

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,440
Let's drink.

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,960
Wait.

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,200
According to Nam-kook's custom,

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,520
Cross wine.

44
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,800
That should be it.

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,880
Yuchi and Princess are old friends at first sight.

46
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,000
May we grow old together.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,240
What are you doing?

48
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,040
Wen Ruyu.

49
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,360
Today is my wedding day. Why did you barge into my bridal chamber?

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,200
I...

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,520
Yuchi.

52
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,000
I have something to tell you.

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,840
Come with me.

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,200
Wen Ruyu.

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,600
What's the matter?

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
to drag me out of the bridal chamber?

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,280
Yuchi.

58
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,760
I have someone I love very much now.

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,160
will be taken away by Hengdao.

60
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,920
Do you think I should try my best?

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
That's it?

62
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
Why are you hesitating?

63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,920
You can't even protect the one you love.

64
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,680
What kind of hero is he?

65
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,280
What if

66
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
harmonious and dignified?

67
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,240
That depends on

68
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,640
is more important

69
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,720
or Jiaren?

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Of course she is.

71
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,360
So what?

72
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,360
How can a false name compare to the one you love?

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
That's it.

74
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,400
Don't worry.

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,840
Don't be afraid.

76
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,240
Yuchi.

77
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,520
Today,

78
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,760
please forgive me.

79
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,680
Wen Ruyu.

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,000
Wen Ruyu!

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,600
Wen Ruyu, open the door!

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,880
Wen Ruyu!

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,760
Who is he?

84
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,600
I seem familiar.

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,320
Who are you?

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,080
You'll know later.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
What kind of jerk are you?

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,880
How dare you come to the wedding house to bully me?

89
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,880
I'll beat you to death today.

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
I'm not Hailan Zhen.

91
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,200
Hush.

92
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Lower your voice.

93
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,760
Listen to me first.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,360
I know you want to assassinate the Crown Prince.

95
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,720
What else do you know?

96
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,880
I also know

97
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,920
your godfather is the North General Alber.

98
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,960
He's at the station at the border.

99
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,920
I've arranged men there.

100
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,440
If you don't listen to me,

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,000
Alb will be under arrest.

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,920
What are you doing?

103
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,120
Kiss me.

104
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,840
I'm going to kill you today!

105
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,880
Fine.

106
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,960
Fine, kill me.

107
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,200
I can start over.

108
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
Anyway,

109
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,520
either kill me

110
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,640
or kiss me.

111
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,440
Who are you?

112
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,840
Choose one.

113
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,960
There's no time.

114
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,280
Wen Ruyu!

115
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,400
You tricked me out

116
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
to harass my wife.

117
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,640
Yuchi.

118
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,840
What I just told you

119
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
is not a lie.

120
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,200
Princess

121
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,560
is the person I love.

122
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,480
We've known each other for a long time.

123
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:54,880
I...

124
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,400
will never change.

125
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,360
Deal.

126
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,760
How dare you talk nonsense?

127
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,080
Honey.

128
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,640
He's not very smart.

129
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,720
How about

130
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,000
kick him out?

131
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Today is my wedding day.

132
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,640
I'll get even with you tomorrow.

133
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,560
Guards!

134
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,920
Kick him out.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,520
Mr. Wen,

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,640
This is a marriage bestowed by His Majesty.

137
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,320
If you keep making trouble,

138
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm afraid Madam Wen will be implicated.

139
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,680
Please.

140
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,080
What's wrong with me?

141
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
I keep thinking of him.

142
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,160
Princess.

143
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,560
Princess.

144
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,440
Princess.

145
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,920
You must be scared today.

146
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,640
Let's rest early.

147
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,920
Who are you?

148
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,880
Wen Ruyu.

149
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,240
I remember you.

150
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
You remember me?
