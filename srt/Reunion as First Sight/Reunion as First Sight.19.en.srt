[Adapted from online April's novel] [Network 19+9] [novel "The Almost-through Male Wants to Kill Me"]

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,400
Yuchi.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,120
How is Lian Cheng now?

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,040
Lian Cheng can't take it anymore.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,920
He is willing to accuse Eunuch Zhu in public.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,600
But before that,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,960
he wants to see you.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,640
Okay.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,440
General.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,080
Miss.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,840
Who are you?

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,640
Have we met before?

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,960
Why did you tell me to leave first yesterday?

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,080
General.

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,440
I work for Wen Ruyu.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,480
There are things

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,400
that you don't know.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,360
Lian Cheng.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,480
Why do you want to see me?

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,640
Lord Linyuan.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,400
I did so many things for Eunuch Zhu.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,560
I know this day will come.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,280
I can be your witness.

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,280
But

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,920
I have a condition.

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,039
Go ahead.

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,840
I will help you.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,600
I have a daughter.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,920
She's three years old.

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,000
I like to fly kites.

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,479
Shadow Guards can't get married and have children.

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,840
I can only keep her outside the city.

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,360
Only when she's safe,

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,800
I won't have any worries.

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,440
I can testify for you.

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,920
Okay.

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,280
I'll get your daughter back.

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,680
I'll protect her.

39
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,560
Thank you.

40
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,400
If you take this kite,

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,000
she will believe you.

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,720
When you see your daughter,

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,200
come with me to see His Highness.

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,760
Okay.

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,040
Did you put the kite?

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,320
Eunuch, we've already placed kites everywhere in the city.

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,360
and made that kid draw on it.

48
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,320
Look.

49
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,480
Why is there a strange kite?

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,840
But...

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,600
can we find Lian Cheng?

52
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
No need.

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
No matter where he is,

54
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,960
when he sees that kite,

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,880
he will understand

56
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,240
The child

57
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,600
is in our hands.

58
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,640
Lian Cheng.

59
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,120
Use your life to prove your wish.

60
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,400
A life for a life.

61
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,480
Don't blame me.

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,480
Eunuch,

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,600
I have something important to report.

64
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,640
I found this

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
I found this.

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,800
But I saw the girl in Linyuan meeting

67
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,480
wearing the same one.

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,960
It looks like

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,040
it's the Beijing dowry rule.

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,920
Do you think

71
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,480
that woman

72
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,360
is the princess of marriage.

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
Linyuan

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
kidnapped the princess.

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,600
What are you thinking?

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
The only alive evidence is dead.

77
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
I thought

78
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,800
there will be good results.

79
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:57,920
I didn't expect

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,800
I still can't get anything on him.

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,480
Laya.

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,040
will you blame me?

83
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,840
Why should I blame you?

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,600
I could have used my last chance

85
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
to run away with you.

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,240
But now,

87
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,840
I have no chance.

88
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,360
If you take me away,

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,600
you won't be my lover.

90
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,080
By then,

91
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,159
Eunuch Zhu

92
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,600
will put down a group of people to assassinate the Crown Prince.

93
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,920
More people will lose their parents if the war reigns.

94
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,960
This is not what I want.

95
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,520
Wen Ruyu, His Highness wants you

96
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
to see him.

97
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,280
Did His Highness tell you

98
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,160
why he summoned me?

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
This is bad.

100
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,640
I'll go with you.

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,560
We'll see.

102
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,000
Wait here.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,920
Don't go out.

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,520
Before Master Zhu is executed,

105
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,920
before Elder Zhu is executed.

106
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

107
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,280
Stand up.

108
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Master Linyuan.

109
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,159
How did you find out

110
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,560
How is it going?

111
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Your Highness.

112
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,880
We are still investigating.

113
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,480
Eunuch Zhu found the hairpin the princess left behind.

114
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,960
He said there was a woman in your Wen Mansion.

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
is the princess of this marriage.

116
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,920
Give me an explanation.

117
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,960
Your Highness.

118
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,520
Linyuan kidnapped the princess of the North

119
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,800
It's a capital crime

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,960
is a capital crime.

121
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,640
Please investigate, Your Highness.

122
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,720
Give me an explanation.

123
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,600
Where is the princess?

124
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,240
The princess is here.

125
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,160
Eunuch.
