00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,420
directly concerns her promotion.

187
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,420
I can't hide anything from you.

188
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,740
OK. I agree.

189
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,220
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

190
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:57,900
Tong.

191
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,180
Is all the information ready?

192
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,820
It's all here.

193
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,580
Tong, we made efforts for so long.

194
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,860
Should we just quit like this?

195
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,500
Previously, I felt

196
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,140
Gan had courage and strategy,

197
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,500
and I admired him very much.

198
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,740
Unexpectedly, he just kicked us
out of the group.

199
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,340
I really made a wrong judgment.

200
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,500
A reminder.

201
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,620
I'm the only one who got kicked out.

202
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,380
You'll continue this project.

203
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,660
Mr. Zhang has agreed.

204
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,980
Really?

205
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,060
Tong.

206
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,620
Alright.

207
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,620
Prepare the information well.

208
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,140
Do your best.

209
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,340
Don't embarrass me.

210
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,340
Otherwise, I won't spare you.

211
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,100
Thank you, Tong.

212
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,340
I will work hard

213
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,780
and never let you down.

214
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,860
Go on.

215
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,340
I didn't expect
that you made a precise prediction.

216
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,220
That was just to comfort you.

217
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,100
You really believe it?

218
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,060
The project has already been negotiated.

219
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,820
Why are you still sighing?

220
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,900
The negotiation is completed.

221
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,140
But they required me
to get out of it.

222
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,940
I just worked all in vain.

223
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,180
Hello, your food is ready.

224
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,020
Thanks.

225
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,420
Thanks.

Enjoy your meal.

227
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,100
Hold on.

228
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,620
I almost forgot this.

229
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,980
Could you help me decant this?

230
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,100
Wait a moment.

231
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,300
This wine is very expensive.

232
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,380
How expensive is it?

233
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,420
You can only find it at auctions.

234
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,220
There aren't many of them.

235
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,460
Are you sure you'll treat me to it?

236
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,860
Then please decant it now.

237
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,940
I'm afraid I'll regret it later.

238
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,580
OK, Miss.

239
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,140
I didn't expect you to be so generous.

240
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,220
I've been telling you about my matters.

241
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,900
I don't know what your name is yet.

242
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,660
Is the name that important?

243
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,980
Just call me Wilson.

244
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,140
Nice to meet you.

245
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,500
Me, too.

246
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,900

250
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,660
I can't tell. Let's eat.

253
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,660
Sorry.

254
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,420
I made you quit Training Box's case.

255
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,220
Don't you think

256
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,540
it's too late to apologize?

257
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,860
Or do you think you can erase everything

258
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,380
that happened before
simply by apologizing?

259
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,500
I dare not ask for your forgiveness.

260
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,460
I made you quit Training Box

261
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,620
in the hope

262
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,060
that you can live a happy

263
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,620
and peaceful life.

264
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,020
Happy?

265
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,780
How dare you say this?

266
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,700
I'll quit your life

267
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,460
and never disturb you again.

268
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,820
That'd be the best.

What took you so long?

283
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,700
You invited me for a meal at your place.

284
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,220
But you made me wait for so long.

285
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,940
I just had a stroll

286
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,340

It's been so many years,

291
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,940
but both of you
still share the same habits.

It was not until I met him again

296
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,020
that I realized
I had been lying to myself.

297

I told you

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,100
you should move to my place.

I've decided

304
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,500
to sell this house and leave Shanghai.

305

Wait, why would you sell it?

to our recommendations
of high-quality houses.

However, the price...

315
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,860
The price is not a problem.

such a disgusting person?

You threaten me
with Deng Yulin's custody

374

All thanks to your false information,

405
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,500
I got embarrassed in front of him.

406
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,140
I told him I had a happy
and harmonious family.

407
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
But then?

408
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,020
I was proven wrong
in the blink of an eye.

409
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,780
Can you even blame me for this?

410

413
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,140
would personally handle
such a minor project?

414
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,620
Is there a possibility that he came

415
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,540
to cheer you up because he heard

416
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,140
Deng Boting bullied you?

417
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,460
He came to cheer me up?

00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,180
It would be nice
if he didn't come to gloat.

Had I known you quit Training Box,

I'd have asked you to help me.

in front of him.

556
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,900
Mr. Zhang asked us to wait.

557
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,140
If LT fails to handle this incident,

558
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,220
the project may really get suspended.

559
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,780
Tong, come to think of it.

560
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,580
We've worked hard
on this project for so long.

561
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,540
Unexpectedly, it came to this.

562
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,100
Don't lose heart.

563
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,500
Gan Yang will figure out a solution.

564
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,820
I hope he will.

565
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,060
I gotta go. Talk to you later.

566
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,740
Sir, I'm not going to the airport.

567
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,500
- Great!
- Great!

568
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,180
It sounds amazing!

569
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,340
Good.

570
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,260
Hello.

571
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,860
Hello, what can I do for you?

572
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,900
I'd like to ask this.

573
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,820
A few days ago, I lost an earring here.

574
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,620
Have you found it?

575
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,220
Isn't that Ding Zhitong?

576
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,100
Do you want to say hello?

577
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,420
Do you remember when it was lost?

578
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,700
About last week.

579
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,580
I'm afraid not.

580
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,020
We've sorted this place out

581
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
and no earring was found.

582
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,780
I'm sure I lost it around here.

583
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,820
Could you check
the surveillance footage?

584
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,020
Sorry, Miss.

585
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,300
We can't do it without permission.

586
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
It is very expensive.

587
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,140
Please help me.

588
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,540
How about this, Miss?

589
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,580
You can go to the second floor

590
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,700
and find our manager.

591
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,460
He will help you.

592
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:14,980
Thank you.

593
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,220
It's here.

594
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,180
Wait, please wind it back.

595
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Just a little more.

596
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,460
Stop.

597
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,100
Zoom in...

598
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,020
Miss, you are not in the footage at all.

599
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,500
Are you here to catch someone cheating?

600
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,620
You should leave now.

601
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,780
You can't check the surveillance
for no reason.

602
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,260
My stuff was lost here.

603
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,060
Please zoom in.

604
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,740
We have regulations.
We can't do it.

605
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,580
- Nonsense.
- Please just leave.

606
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,580
What are you doing?

607
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,740
Do you know

608
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,700
this lady is Mr. Wang's friend?

609
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,300
Mr. Wang is our major shareholder.

610
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,940
Do whatever you are asked to do!

611
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,060
Sorry, Miss.

612
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,020
You can check it any way you want.

613
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,980
We'll do our best to cooperate with you.

614
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,500
Thanks.

615
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,900
Just this frame.

616
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
Zoom in a bit, thanks.

617
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,180
Yes...

618
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,460
[Inbox. You have a new email]

619
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,340
What's going on?

620
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,620
What's wrong?

621
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,580
I received a surveillance video of a bar

622
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,900
in my mailbox.

623
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,060
Who sent it?

624
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,980
An unknown account.

625
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,100
Who will it be?

626
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,460
Look.

627
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,700
What's wrong, Wu Xun?

628
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,940
Are you alright?

629
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,980
Are you okay?

630
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,180
Great, LT will survive.

631
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,580
Who is helping us?

632
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,180
Not only did they go
to the bar Wu Xun often goes to,

633
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,300
but they also found
the surveillance video.

634
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,260
Now Wu Xun can never argue.

635
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,780
Hurry and call an ambulance.

636
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,780
Send me the video quickly.

637
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,780
I'll post it online

638
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,340
and let everyone see the truth.

639
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,100
No rush.

640
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,340
Shuchi won't be exposed that way.

641
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,820
What's your idea then?

642
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,260
What are you doing?

643
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,860
Waiting for Wu Xun to take the bait.

644
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,900
[Wu Xun]

645
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,820
Hello?

646
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,220
Wu Xun.

647
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,180
Mr. Zhan.

648
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,060
What's up?

649
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,500
I already told you.

650
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,660
Don't contact me if not necessary
for the time being.

651
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,900
It's an emergency.

652
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,860
Gan Yang found out
I was injured in a bar.

653
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,220
He has a video on his hands now.

654
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,100
What are you afraid of?

655
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,220
Just don't admit it,

656
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,740
saying the video was edited
by LT maliciously.

657
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,980
Pin everything on LT.

658
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,500
Now LT has lost all credibility.

659
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,740
Nobody would trust them.

660
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,340
Gan Yang is smart.

661
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,260
He will definitely send the video
for identification!

662
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,180
That's your business.

663
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,860
What does it have to do with me?

664
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,780
Fine, but don't forget

665
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,340
you were the one
who asked me to frame Gan Yang

666
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,420
with your cash.

667
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,580
Can you get away with it
if something happens to me?

668
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,740
Is there any evidence?

669
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,540
Is there any transfer record?

670
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,260
Or do you have a surveillance video

671
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,900
like Gan Yang?

672
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,700
None, I guess.

673
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,340
Then just shut up.

674
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,820
Or I'll sue you for slander!

675
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,460
Mr. Zhan, it's indeed clever of you.

676
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,060
Why are you here?

677
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,220
You two are on the same side,
aren't you?

678
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,900
Did he ask you to lure me here?

679
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,940
It turns out you and Shuchi

680
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,780
have been playing tricks
behind the scenes.

681
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

682
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,900
You just won't admit it, right?

683
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:20,900
Fine.

684
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,500
Anyway, I have just

685
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,780
recorded your conversation.

686
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,660
You can check this out.

687
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,940
Fine, but don't forget

688
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,540
you were the one
who asked me to frame Gan Yang

689
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,660
with your cash.

690
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,780
Can you get away with it
if something happens to me?

691
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,140
Sir, how much longer
until we get to the airport?

692
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,060
Half an hour.

693
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,380
You guessed it right.

694
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,420
The surveillance video
was indeed sent by Ding Zhitong.

695
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,260
The IP address

696
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,540
shows your neighborhood.

697
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,260
So it's really her.

698
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,100
It seems she still cares about you.

699
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,900
I just met Li Jiaxin.

700
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,180
She said Ding Zhitong would fly
to Hong Kong, China in a while.

701
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,780
I'll send you her flight information.

702
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,700
At least you should thank her in person.
