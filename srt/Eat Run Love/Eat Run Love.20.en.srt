00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,740
Just a moment, please.

190
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,620
Mr. Qin,

191
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,100
thank you for teaching me
all those workplace efficiency hacks.

192
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,340
They're really helpful.

193
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,580
It's because you're a quick learner.

194
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,820
It's really Mr. Qin.

195
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,340
Not at all.

196
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,500
Credit goes to you.

197
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,100
Thank you for your guidance.

198
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,940
Mr. Qin? Thank you
for saving me last night.

199
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,340
After six years,
you're still so popular.

200
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,980
And you are...?

201
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,620
Age must be catching up.

202
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,620
No surprise you don't remember.

203
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,820
Well, let me introduce myself again.

204
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,340
I'm Song Mingmei. Nice to meet you.

205
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,740
Nice to meet you.

206
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,180
Who is it?

207
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,660
Hello?

208
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,660
You just woke up now?

209
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,940
I met a client
and then took a short nap.

210
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,220
Had all these dreams.
My head is killing me.

211
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,820
Well, you need the right cure
for your heartache.

212
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,820
Let's not talk about my mess.

213
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
You didn't call me

214
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,820
just to check

215
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,500
if I woke up, did you?

216
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,300
I ran into Mr. Qin.

217
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,500
Mr. Qin?

218
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,780
There was a young girl with him,

219
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,340
calling him Mr. Qin this and that,

220
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,500
just like I used to.

221
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,820
I even greeted him,

222
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,300
but he acted like he didn't know me.

223
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,620
Well, it has been years.

224
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,820
That's understandable.

225
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,580
So, what do you think?

226
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,340
Any sparks seeing him again?

227
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,220
That ship sailed long ago.

228
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,860
No idea if he heard

229
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,620
about my divorce.

230
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,820
I don't want him to know
that I'm not doing well.

231
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,060
I even bought this huge diamond ring.

232
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,020
Seriously? That's so exaggerated.

233
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
It's not expensive.

234
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,460
By the way, have you finalized
your divorce?

235
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,900
Still sorting out

236
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,100
the equity split and transfer.

237
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,580
If you've got time,
help me look over it.

238
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,780
No problem.

239
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,020
Hello?

240
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,940
Could you send me a thermometer

241
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,020
and some febrifuge.

242
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,380
I'm not feeling well.

243
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,020
Just key in.

244
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,540
Why you? How did you get in?

245
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,820
I came to take your temperature.
Then I'll go.

246
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,020
After all these years,

247
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,300
how did you become a hotel manager?

248
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,140
My friend owns this place.

249
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,540
He knows we know each other.

250
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,060
He told me specially

251
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,780
when he heard you had a fever.

252
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,540
Please leave now.

253
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,780
Don't stay here.

254
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,420
Alright, let me just
take your temperature.

255
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,780
Should we go to the hospital?

256
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,180
No need. I'm not that fragile.

257
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,780
Just give me the pills.

258
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,700
Mr. Qin, it seems like
you don't care much

259
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,740
about your girlfriend after all.

260
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,900
Or do you already have a wife?

261
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,660
Asking about my personal life.

262
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,620
Are you still interested in me?

263
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,860
Mr. Qin,

264
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,220
I'm married now.

265
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,620
That's a huge diamond ring.

266
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,980
Looks like you got everything
you wanted.

267
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,060
Of course.

268
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,620
I once said I'd become
a successful woman

269
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,820
by 35.

270
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,860
Now I'm five years ahead of schedule.

271
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,260
Remember Matching Tech?

272
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:03,980
Used it.

273
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,980
It was founded by my husband and me.

274
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,420
It's now worth three billion.

275
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,260
Impressive.

276
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,820
But why isn't he

277
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,380
vacationing with you?

278
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,100
This is a friends' gathering.

279
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,780
It wouldn't be appropriate
for him to come.

280
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,780
I thought you might have had
a fight and got divorced,

281
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,700
and came here to relax and party.

282
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,700
Mr. Qin, he's not like you.

283
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,540
He treats me well.

284
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,980
And we never fight.

285
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,140
We have an adorable daughter.

286
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,980
Here are the three of us.

287
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,460
Well?

288
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,220
Isn't she cute?

289
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,860
Takes after me.

290
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,100
Yeah, she is.

291
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,540
But the husband is just average-looking.

292
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,340
Alright, you've taken your medicine.

293
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,340
Just get some rest.

294
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,860
If your fever doesn't go down,

295
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,900
remember to go to the hospital.

296
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,780
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

297
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,140
Then I'll leave.

298
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,660
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

299
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,740
Nobody leaves
until we're properly drunk.

300
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,540
Deal.

301
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,460
Let's see who can't drink up.

302
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,780
Wu Xun.

303
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,300
Wu Xun.

304
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,580
You're participating

305
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,780
in the Hangzhou Marathon next week,

306
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,580
and you're drinking?

307
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,540
I've been training all day.

308
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,900
It's okay to have a little drink
and relax.

309
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,860
Let's play dice.

310
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,860
Again.

311
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,340
You lost. Drink up.

312
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,700
Everyone, relax. Have fun.

313
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,300
Come on.

314
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,060
Yeah, right.

315
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,620
- Come on.
- Let's have a toast.

316
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,140
Come on.

317
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Let's exchange WeChat accounts later.

318
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,660
Come on.

319
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,500
Keep going.

320
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,100
Waitress.

321
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,340
Four twos. Call or fold?

322
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,300
Four twos?

323
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,100
I call!

324
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,860
Enough games.

325
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,580
Send over the Martell

326
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,500
I have stored here to him.

327
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,500
Come on.

328
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,660
Tell him it's from an admirer.

329
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,740
Yes, sir.

330
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,420
Who?

331
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,100
Who is it?

332
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,260
Some big shot?

333
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,180
An old friend.

334
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,460
Come on.

335
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,020
- No?
- Mr. Wu.

336
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,340
Drink up.

337
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,860
That gentleman gave you this drink.

338
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,500
Drink up.

339
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,100
For me?

340
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,300
Yes, he said he's your admirer.

341
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,020
This is really expensive.

342
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,620
- Never had anything this expensive.
- How generous.

343
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,780
Cheers.

344
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,100
Finish it. All of it.

345
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,820
- Okay.
- Finish it.

346
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,260
Mr. Gan, if Wu Xun wins
the championship again,

347
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,460
our sales will double for sure.

348
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,100
LT relies on its own strength.

349
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,340
But as a friend,
I hope he comes in first.

350
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,380
Gan Yang! Bad news.

351
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,660
Wu Xun has had an accident.

352
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,540
What happened?

353
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,460
Look.

354
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,780
He sprained his ankle
right after the start.

355
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,840
In interviews,

356
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,100
[Wu Xun injured wearing LT shoes]
he blamed our shoes,

357
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,940
saying there was a problem
with the sole elasticity

358
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,620
and he noticed

359
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,460
something was off during the training.

360
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,820
It's now trending
on all major platforms.

361
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,620
Someone must be behind this.

362
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,100
Where is he now?

363
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,140
Can't reach him.

364
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,020
Phone's off.

365
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,860
Not at home either.

366
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,500
Have you seen the news about Wu Xun?

367
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,300
I'm watching it now.

368
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,220
It's causing a stir online.

369
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,660
Some say they also sprained their ankles
wearing these shoes.

370
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,720
Returns are flooding in.

371
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,820
Some even claim

372
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,660
the data from the launch event
was faked.

373
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,180
Keep following up.

374
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,900
This might be the breakthrough

375
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,140
for Training Box.

376
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,140
Got it.

377
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,700
Mr. Wang, while you were abroad,

378
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
the situation with LT running shoes
has been escalating.

379
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,460
The domestic market has been affected,

380
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,780
and even overseas sales

381
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,820
have dropped by 30%.

382
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,180
The monthly active count
for Training Box

383
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,420
has plummeted by 10%.

384
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,460
It seems more than one party

385
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,380
is using this ankle sprain incident
to target LT.

386
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,740
They've been too prominent
in recent years,

387
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,100
capturing nearly 20%
of the national market share.

388
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,820
Plenty of people
are keeping an eye on them.

389
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,860
We just wanted Wu Xun
to drink a bit more

390
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,540
and run slower in the marathon.

391
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,980
Who knew he'd sprain his ankle

392
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,140
and blame the running shoes he endorses?

393
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,500
The public outcry erupted immediately.

394
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,940
What a pleasant surprise.

395
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,380
How's Ding Zhitong handling it?

396
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,180
According to Mr. Zhang,

397
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,020
Ms. Ding has flown to five cities
in three days.

398
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,140
She's already leveraged public opinion

399
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,900
to secure
two minority shareholders' signing

400
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,500
on the Letter of Intent for Financing.

401
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,060
Good. Bold and decisive.

402
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,620
I knew I wasn't wrong about her.

403
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,260
Mr. Wang,

404
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,700
Mr. Zhan from Shuchi Sports

405
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,060
has been trying to meet with you.

406
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,020
Not interested.

407
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,700
He's incompetent.

408
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,860
The way he blocked
Gan Yang's R&D funding

409
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,660
became a laughingstock in the industry.

410
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,460
Understood. I'll turn him down.

411
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,740
By the way,

412
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,260
have Public Relations fan the flames
regarding the ankle sprain incident.

413
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,660
Help Ding Zhitong
close the Training Box deal faster.

414
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,540
Stop writing. Look at this.

415
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,180
What's wrong?

416
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,640
[Data fraud runs in the family]

417
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,120
[LT's CEO's father was a fraudster]

418
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,780
I'm never buying LT shoes again.

419
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,740
[LT's CEO's father released from prison]
No wonder their launch data was so good.

420
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,460
Turns out it was all fake.

421
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,260
If Wu Xun hadn't worn LT shoes,

422
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,180
he could have won
the triple crown this time.

423
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,380
Eco-friendly materials, my foot.

424
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,020
Just trash synthetics.

425
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,860
My feet got injured like this

426
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,740
because I wore their shoes.

427
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,940
I'm never buying their shoes again.

428
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,380
Trash!

429
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,800
[LT's midsole material
is actually made from trash]

430
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,360
[No wonder people are getting hurt!]

431
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,260
I'm suing them for defamation!

432
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,580
We've paid them lots of advertising fees

433
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,660
but they're reluctant to take down a video
when we ask them to.

434
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,300
Exactly, they call it trash.

435
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,020
They don't know anything.

436
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,460
That's an eco-friendly synthetic.

437
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,220
What do they know?
They're just talking nonsense.

438
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,020
We fix problems as they come.

439
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,540
It can't be worse than six years ago.

440
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,460
So what should we do?

441
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,020
Seeing this kind of news every day
is really frustrating.

442
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,700
I've already had people look for Wu Xun.

443
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,460
We should have news in a few days.

444
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,420
Ms. Ding,

445
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,900
I've made my pledge

446
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
to the Wang's.

447
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,140
We're in the same boat now.

448
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,620
We can't let it fail.

449
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,380
Rest assured.

450
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,860
The strength of the Wang's
is undeniable.

451
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,500
Had they stepped in earlier,

452
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,860
LT's crisis wouldn't have escalated

453
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,060
to this point.

454
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,780
After all, the Wang's holds stakes

455
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,460
in all these media platforms.

456
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,660
Understood.

457
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,300
I've never doubted

458
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,180
the strength of the Wang's.

459
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,740
They can also provide high liquidity
for Training Box

460
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,540
and drive up the stock price.

461
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,420
Just wait for your equity value

462
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,340
to soar.

463
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,060
That's what I wanted to hear.

464
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,220
Ms. Ding, I'll await your good news.

465
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,580
I'll update you at every step.

466
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,660
Do you think Ding Zhitong

467
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,060
is behind the Wu Xun incident?

468
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,380
No.

469
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,820
She'd never resort
to underhanded tactics.

470
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,420
Mr. Gan, Ms. Xu.

471
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,820
What a coincidence.

472
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,540
You guys go ahead.

473
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,220
I'll be leaving.

474
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,260
Ms. Ding, it looks like

475
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,500
you haven't been sleeping well lately,

476
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,860
busy persuading
our minority shareholders.

477
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,300
You look haggard.

478
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,980
Can't be helped.
Business is like a battlefield.

479
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,220
I thought the financing was hopeless.

480
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,900
Now that there's a sudden opportunity,

481
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,780
of course, I'm seizing it.

482
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,940
What opportunity?

483
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,340
You are behind all this,

484
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,460
aren't you?

485
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,900
So what if I am?

486
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,740
See? I told you it was her!

487
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,740
She admitted it herself.

488
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,140
Now will you believe me?

489
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,660
I benefit from this too.

490
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
Mr. Gan, why are you so sure

491
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,860
I wouldn't do this?

492
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,020
I haven't forgotten.

493
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,220
The matrix is your dream.

494
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,540
I just want to destroy it.

495
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,020
Ding Zhitong, don't celebrate too soon.

496
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,380
Without our approval,

497
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,580
you'll never get your chance.

498
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,380
Since when do you have a say

499
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,580
in Training Box, Ms. Xu?

500
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,300
- She's also a shareholder.
- You...

501
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,980
She has the right to say that.

502
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,020
The video platform execs are arriving.

503
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,700
I'll greet them.

504
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,820
Alright.

505
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,900
Ding Zhitong,

506
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,580
whether you meant to destroy it or not,

507
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,620
I'm glad

508
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,540
you remember my dream.

509
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,540
Tong, are you unwell?

510
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,860
Let's go.

511
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,700
Take care.

512
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,380
Mr. Gan is truly impressive.

513
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,300
He has such a strong presence.

514
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,420
I couldn't even speak

515
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,540
when he stood there.

516
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,860
Later, you should organize

517
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,060
our company's media resources

518
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,500
and have them

519
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,500
publish positive news

520
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,060
about LT online in a few days.

521
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,140
Tong, you're not going soft, are you?

522
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,300
What are you thinking?

523
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,900
We just got the signatures
from some shareholders.

524
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,780
LT is an important shareholder
of Training Box.

525
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,500
The aftermath of this scandal

526
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,420
will definitely affect Training Box.

527
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,980
The Wang's won't invest

528
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,300
in a company with a bad reputation.

529
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,220
You're right.

530
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,540
But our media reach is limited.

531
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,980
Mr. Gan mentioned

532
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,180
they were meeting
with video platform execs.

533
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,500
What we can do is just a drop
in the bucket.

534
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,660
We'll do what we can.

535
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,420
Let's meet the next shareholder.

536
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,100
Got it.

537
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,220
[Gutong Securities]

538
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,140
Here, Tong.

539
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,980
With this one,

540
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,780
we've convinced half the shareholders.

541
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,740
Now

542
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,300
we can force Gan's hand.

543
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,740
After all this work,
we finally have a breakthrough.

544
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Does this mean

545
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,260
we can celebrate tonight?

546
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,300
There's a new trendy entertainment place
near the office.

547
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,300
They have board games,
billiards, archery,

548
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,180
and everything.

549
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,380
You guys go ahead.

550
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,540
I'll pass.

551
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,660
But it's on me.

552
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,260
Do whatever you want.

553
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,900
Thanks, Tong.

554
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,780
Why aren't you coming, Tong?

555
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,540
You seem a bit unhappy.

556
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,340
Is something wrong with the project?

557
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,940
I'm not unhappy.

558
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,660
It's nothing. I'm just a bit tired.

559
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,900
I'm going home to rest.

560
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,860
You guys go ahead.

561
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,540
Unless you all want
to stay and work overtime.

562
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,300
Have fun. I'm leaving.

563
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,100
- Bye, Tong.
- Bye.

564
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,620
Yeah.

565
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,740
I had already let go.

566
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,940
I was ready to move on

567
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,620
and start a new life.

568
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,060
But then he had to show up
at this moment.

569
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,260
Why does it have to be like this?

570
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,180
Why did he have to appear?

571
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,620
I hate him.

572
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,820
But I hate myself even more

573
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,740
for still being so unhappy
because of him.

574
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,300
Mr. Gan, we found him.

575
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,140
Keep an eye on him.

576
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,140
I'm on my way.

577
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,740
You've already shifted the blame.

578
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,180
You didn't expect the public opinion
to turn out like this.

579
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,220
I feel guilty towards Gan Yang.

580
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,420
Without him, I wouldn't be
where I am today.

581
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,620
Oh, come on.

582
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,860
He's a big boss
worth hundreds of millions.

583
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
He used you because you were valuable.

584
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,820
Look,

585
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,820
you helped him make a lot of money.

586
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,820
If you clarify now,

587
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,740
LT will definitely crush you

588
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,220
and leave you with no way to recover.

589
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,660
Why...?

590
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,180
I'll get the door. Think carefully.

591
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,100
Who is it?

592
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:46,940
Gan Yang?

593
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,900
Mr. Gan?

594
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,260
Go clarify on all major platforms now.

595
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,620
Why should he?

596
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,980
He got injured wearing your shoes...

597
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,980
You should publicly apologize to him
and compensate him.

598
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,420
Wu Xun,

599
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,060
the night before the marathon,
you went to a pharmacy

600
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,660
for bandages and medicine.

601
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,020
I have the surveillance footage.

602
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,060
Need me to show more evidence?

603
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,500
I've held back from suing you

604
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,100
for the sake of our friendship.

605
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,900
But if you keep this up,

606
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,020
you'll ruin not only your career

607
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,260
but your whole life.

608
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,380
Mr. Gan.

609
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,860
At the same time, I hope that consumers

610
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,580
will continue to support
LT's running shoe business.

611
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,540
I sincerely apologize to everyone.

612
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,380
Tong, just like you said,

613
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,980
Mr. Gan resolved this fast.

614
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,060
Good thing we secured

615
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,500
those minority shareholders early.

616
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,460
With Wu Xun's clarification,

617
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,020
this matter is settled.

618
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,260
Did he bribe Wu Xun

619
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,100
to change his statement?

620
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,700
Shoes are like Gan Yang's life.

621
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,300
He wouldn't fake something like this.

622
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,500
We've already convinced
some of the minority shareholders.

623
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,780
Even if Gan Yang wants to veto it,

624
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,020
he'll have to think twice.

625
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,940
I'll get back to work.

626
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,740
[Feng Sheng]

627
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,980
My girlfriend and I are in Shanghai.

628
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,460
Free to meet tonight?

629
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,820
Sure, I happen to have some time.

630
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,380
Buddy,

631
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,940
your fridge is empty.

632
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,660
Why is there nothing in it?

633
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,740
Come running with me.

634
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,940
Cut me some slack.

635
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,860
I'm too tired. Can't move.

636
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,780
Run with me,

637
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,380
and dinner's on me.

638
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,740
What are you waiting for?

639
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,220
Latecomers won't get a table.

640
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,260
- Okay?
- Sure.

641
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,780
Feng Sheng.

642
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,580
To Maldives.

643
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,420
Ding Zhitong.

644
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,860
Let me introduce you.

645
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,860
This is my fiancée, Yu Shangna.

646
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,900
Hello, nice to meet you.

647
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,100
I'm Ding Zhitong, his college classmate.

648
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,700
- I see.
- Shall we head in?

649
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,180
Let's go.

650
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,140
- I've made a reservation.
- Let's go.

651
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,780
- Sure.
- Go.

652
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,420
I just cooked some tripe.

653
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:10,940
Okay.

654
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,220
You two should have some more.

655
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,100
The food here is delicious.

656
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,900
Authentic flavors.

657
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,500
Get her a marinated egg.

658
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,540
So you're having the wedding abroad?

659
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,820
Because my family is all abroad.

660
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,380
You have to come.

661
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,900
Of course.

662
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,780
I'm telling you in advance,
you have to come.

663
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,660
Absolutely.

664
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,900
The custom-made wedding dress thing.

665
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,780
Them again? I'll take it.

666
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,540
It's okay. You two can catch up.

667
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,180
Okay.

668
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,940
You two make a great couple.

669
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Good for you.

670
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,620
I've had enough of all this PDA.

671
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,940
Stop teasing me.

672
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,580
Tell me about you. How have you been?

673
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,140
I'm doing well.

674
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,540
I've been working
on the Training Box financing deal.

675
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,900
The LT Group

676
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,740
that caused such a stir recently, right?

677
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,220
I read the news.

678
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,860
Their CEO

679
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,740
is Gan Yang, right?

680
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,980
Never thought his dad was a fraudster.

681
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,740
Has he ever mentioned it to you?

682
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,260
I've only heard him talk
about his mother before,

683
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,980
never his father.

684
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,780
I thought we had no secrets.

685
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,780
Turns out there were things
I never knew.

686
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,900
Have you seen him since?

687
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,260
Let's not talk about him.

688
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,660
Fair enough.

689
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,300
I've forgotten what happened.

690
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,660
Tell me how you two met.

691
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,660
Who would go for hot pot after running?

692
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,780
I ran here mainly for the hot pot.

693
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,020
They're having a promotion today.

694
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,500
Check-in rewards, you know.

695
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,500
Hey, where are you going?

696
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,020
This is the place. We're here.

697
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,140
What are you doing?

698
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,980
[Marital Status: Unmarried]
You're not married.

699
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,940
Your company profile
says you're unmarried.

700
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,060
During your five years
at Gutong Securities,

701
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,180
no one has ever seen Feng Sheng.

702
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,780
And he's in the United States,
not in Hong Kong, China!

703
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,140
No one has ever seen his girlfriend!

704
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,380
We're in a secret marriage.

705
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,780
Do I need to explain that to you?

706
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,300
I need to get to the bottom of this.

707
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,820
Of what?

708
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,100
Her parents are abroad.

709
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,140
Right, her family is abroad.

710
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,260
So we bought a place there,

711
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,300
planning to settle down.

713
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,140
It's been a while.

714
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,700
It's been ages, Gan Yang.

715
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,140
Are you here to eat too?

716
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,580
Yeah.

717
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,780
How have you been?

718
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,260
When did you get back to the country?

719
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,340
I flew to Hong Kong, China
the other day

720
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,580
and then flew back with my wife...

721
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,980
We just got back
from Hong Kong, China together.

722
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,180
This place gives free yogurt
for check-ins.

723
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,780
Long time no see.

724
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,420
You guys go ahead.

725
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,340
We've got things to do. We'll leave.

726
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:29,940
Sure.

727
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,700
What about my hot pot?

728
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,860
The hot pot here isn't that great.

729
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,780
Don't come back.

730
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,580
I came out to eat and run with you.

731
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,460
Can you cheer up a bit?

732
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,780
You saw it yourself.

733
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,060
Ding Zhitong is only engaging
with you for work.

734
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,180
But if it affects you this much,

735
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,100
if it makes you this unhappy,

736
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,180
maybe you should keep your distance.

737
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,780
I know.

738
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
I was thinking the same.

739
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,860
What do you know? What are you thinking?

740
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,540
She's doing well.

741
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,100
I shouldn't bother her.

742
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,860
Tong.

743
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,420
Well, Gan Yang came to Hong Kong, China
to look for you four years ago.

744
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,380
I didn't tell you

745
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,140
because I was jealous.

746
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,860
I didn't tell him and even lied,

747
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,660
saying we had already gotten married.

748
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,300
I'm sorry.

749
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,100
It's fine.

750
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,140
Whether you lied or not,

751
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,340
there's no chance for me and him.

752
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,540
That's not what I meant.

753
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,500
What's wrong?

754
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,020
Haven't been sleeping well?

755
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:20,980
I'm alright.

756
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,060
Want me to drive?

757
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,140
It's okay. We're almost there.

758
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,420
Tong, what's going on?

759
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,060
Why did you start
taking sleeping pills again?

760
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,900
I'll stop after finishing this project.

761
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,540
Tell me

762
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,260
what really happened in Beijing.

763
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,140
I didn't play the emotional card
with him.

764
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,620
I knew

765
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,580
you couldn't bring yourself to do it.

766
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,580
And what else?

767
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,100
I think

768
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,300
I softened a bit.

769
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Did he explain

770
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,420
what happened after your breakup?

771
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,620
He tried. I stopped him.

772
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,420
I didn't let him explain.

773
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,100
I didn't want to give him the chance.

774
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,260
I was afraid I'd fall for him again.

775
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,780
I can't be with him anymore,

776
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,180
so I want to push him away.

777
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,820
Yesterday, Feng Sheng and I ran into him
at the hot pot restaurant.

778
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
I let him keep believing

779
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,780
Feng Sheng and I are married.

780
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,500
Wait.

781
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,820
Why are you two
torturing each other like this?

782
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,740
I just want him to give up completely

783
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,940
and leave my life for good.

784
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,420
You know what,

785
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,100
Part of me really wants

786
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,620
to secure the Training Box deal

787
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,900
and become MD.

788
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,020
But part of me

789
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,140
wants his dream to come true more.

790
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,020
Tong,

791
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,980
his dream of making shoes

792
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,580
has already come true.

793
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,140
Back in college,

794
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,780
he told me about his dream
of the shoe matrix.

795
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,340
In Beijing, I accompanied him
to meet many clients.

796
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,980
At that time, watching him
move towards his dream,

797
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,540
I was truly happy for him.

798
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,580
That's why forcing this financing now

799
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,260
feels less like helping him

800
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,620
and more like destroying his dream.

801
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
It's okay. Don't worry about me.

802
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,540
I'll sort myself out.

803
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,020
Don't worry.

804
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,820
Who is it?

805
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,820
Why are you here?

806
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,180
To talk to you about Tong.

807
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:25,940
Come in.

808
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,140
I'll keep it short.

809
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,020
After you broke up with Tong,

810
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,780
she couldn't sleep all night,

811
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,820
suffering from insomnia and depression
until she was hospitalized.

812
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,180
You should've seen her.

813
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,740
Skin and bones.

814
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,500
Nearly lost herself completely.

815
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,660
I failed her.

816
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,340
I'm not here to guilt-trip you.

817
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,700
Song Mingmei, actually...

818
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,980
Save it.

819
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,060
Whatever your reasons,

820
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,060
the harm is done.

821
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,940
For so many years,

822
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,060
she's struggled to get through it.

823
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,500
Before you reappeared,

824
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,700
she finally started eating
and sleeping well.

825
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,140
Focusing on her work,

826
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,460
she was soon promoted to director.

827
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,980
When she first found out
that you were behind

828
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,820
the Training Box project,

829
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,500
she didn't want to take it on at all.

830
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,700
But her boss said

831
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,140
she had to take this project

832
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,500
to be promoted to MD.

833
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,060
Is there anything I can do for her now?

834
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,380
I hope you'll stay out of her life.

835
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,340
Since meeting you,

836
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,260
she's been back on sleeping pills.

837
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,260
Gan Yang, Tong can live well
without you.

838
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,180
Please, let her quit your project.
