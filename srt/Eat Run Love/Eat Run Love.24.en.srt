Mr. Wang, I didn't expect you
to personally fetch someone.

190
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,060
No time for others.

191
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,300
But Ding Zhitong is my friend.

192
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,060
By the way...

193
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,220
I heard

194
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,460
you moved your office

195
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,620
to Training Box recently.

196
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,740
Let me remind you,

197
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,900
Ding Zhitong will be very busy lately.

198
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,420
Please don't

199
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,220
disturb her life or work.

200
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,380
What are you making today?
You've prepared so much.

201
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,020
Northeastern specialty,
combined cooking.

202
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,660
Who got you so worked up?

203
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,060
You're seething with anger.

204
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,940
Wang Sen from Wang's.

205
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,140
He just picked up Tong
at the office entrance.

206
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,180
He warned me not to disturb
her work or life.

207
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,820
He's clearly declaring war!

208
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,340
Wang's?

209
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,660
The one trying to invest
in Training Box?

210
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,980
Yeah, who else?

211
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,900
The head of Wang's.

212
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,620
Your rival this time is formidable.

213
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,540
Tong isn't vain.

214
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,540
So what if he's rich?

215
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,060
Proximity brings privilege.

216
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,700
Well,

217
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,180
he could use his position

218
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,340
to get close to Ding Zhitong.

219
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,860
Does Ding Zhitong know
that Wang Sen is pursuing her?

220
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,580
Judging by her expression,

221
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,420
probably not.

222
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,500
Then give it your all.

223
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,780
There's not enough food here.

224
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,820
I'll go get some more for you.

225
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,820
Get plenty!

226
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,620
Got it.

227
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,780
The camping base has had
a compound annual growth rate of 39%

228
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,900
over the past five years.

229
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,900
So, both data

230
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,100
and trends show

231
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,060
young people are increasingly fond
of camping.

232
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,740
I've never camped.

233
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,900
I don't get the appeal.

234
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,500
So I need to experience it

235
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,740
to decide whether to invest.

236
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,620
Wang's has stakes
in over a dozen industries.

237
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,420
I thought you just went by data.

238
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,500
I have a principle.

239
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,020
I never invest
in what I don't understand or enjoy.

240
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,820
This barbecue setup must be for us.

241
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,220
Can you grill?

242
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,300
A little.

243
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,460
Shall we give it a try?

244
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,580
Look.

245
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,500
Fireflies.

246
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,380
So beautiful.

247
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,140
There are some over there too.

248
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,700
How interesting.

249
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,500
So pretty.

250
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,540
Look.

251
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,340
You like fireflies?

252
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,060
Not really.

253
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,460
Just reminds me of something.

254
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,740
Their lifespan
is barely three to seven days.

255
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,100
Glowing is their peak.

256
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,860
Then their life comes to an end.

257
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,100
Just like love, I guess.

258
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,980
Once you miss it, it's gone forever.

259
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,860
Are you referring

260
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,180
to you and Gan Yang?

261
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,060
Yeah.

262
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,780
It should be ready.

263
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,060
Give it a try.

264
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,420
Be careful. It's hot.

265
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:22,860
Sure.

266
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,460
I learned how to grill

267
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,620
during a summer job.

268
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,460
Not pro-level, though.

269
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,700
It's delicious.

270
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,620
Really.

271
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,260
Good job.

272
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,100
Stop flattering me.

273
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,420
It's nowhere near as good

274
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,300
as my favorite barbecue place.

275
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,460
Which one?

276
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,380
The one near our school.

277
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,980
It's called Ma's Barbecue.

278
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,060
Well,

279
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,620
is that place still around?

280
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,220
It was still there when I was
on a business trip in Beijing last year.

281
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,260
I don't know about now.

282
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,300
[Gan Yang]
Dinner buddy,

283
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,100
the late-night snack is ready.

284
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,020
When are you coming back?
Let's eat together?

285
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,980
I brought some late-night snack.

286
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:30,820
Join me?

287
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,580
Sure.

288
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,060
By the way,

289
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,380
I'm going to Beijing on Friday.

290
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,460
I know.

291
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,140
You're going back to Qingbei
as a guest lecturer.

292
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,540
I saw all that in the alumni group.

293
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,140
The equity transaction for Matching
is complete.

294
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,660
Thanks for your hard work.

295
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,540
I mainly assigned Qin Yu

296
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,220
to handle the new investment projects
for Matching

297
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,620
that you entrusted to Hetai.

298
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,420
A company of Matching's size

299
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,660
doesn't need your attention anyway.

300
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,300
No need to personally update me

301
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,700
on your plans.

302
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,340
Or

303
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,020
do you want me to go to Beijing too?

304
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,060
You're welcome to listen

305
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,140
anytime if you want.

306

[Deng Boting]

307
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,660
What's wrong?

308
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,860
Are you not feeling well?

309
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,340
I'm so mad at that jerk.

310
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,300
I've grown some nodules.

311
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,060
Deng Boting?

312
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,620
You know what? The other day

313
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,020
I went to him to get a document signed.

314
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,740
He was drunk

315
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,300
and kept crying to me,

316
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,300
saying he regretted divorcing you

317
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,940
and wanted you back.

318
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,060
I don't go looking for headaches.

319
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,460
And after his cheating,

320
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,580
I realized

321
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,540
we were never compatible.

322
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,700
His personality really
wasn't right for you.

323
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,860
Then who do you think is right for me?

324
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,060
Have you ever thought

325
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,820
that the right one might be someone
you've kept missing?

326
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,380
What about you?

327
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,980
Does your little girlfriend suit you?

328
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,500
She's my friend's daughter.

329
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,340
I'm just mentoring her.

330
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,740
I've only had one relationship
since you went abroad.

331
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,740
But I'm single now.

332
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,060
Congratulations.

Of course.

You must have manipulated
the equity split.

565
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,580
Right?

566
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,540
You went to him yourself.

567
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,380
Are you insane?

568
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,340
Me? Insane?

569
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,820
Am I insane?

570
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,900
You went to the hotel with him
the day after our divorce.

571
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,900
Accused me of cheating?

572
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,180
You're the one who cheated first!

573
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,500
We just happened to stay
at the same hotel.

574
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,100
Two separate rooms!

575
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,700
We're all adults here.

576
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,740
Who's gonna buy that?

577
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,940
Coincidence, my foot.

578
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,060
Fine.

579
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,220
There's no point
in me saying anything now, is there?

580
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,740
Might as well give you something
to accuse me of.

581
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,940
Happy now?

582
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,220
Song Mingmei, you...

583
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,100
If you think Song Mingmei
and I scammed you,

584
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,100
you can go to any agency to review it,

585
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,500
or sue me.

586
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,660
Investigate all you want.

587
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,820
If you find any evidence of me cheating,

588
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,140
I'll leave with nothing!

589
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,660
Deng Boting,

590
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,060
can you stop making a scene?

591
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,540
I can kick you out

592
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,860
of the company anytime.

593
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:08,820
Threatening me.

594
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,380
Threatening me, huh?

595
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,460
You've been hands-off for years.

596
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,660
Do you even know
what the company's structure is like now

597
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,620
or who our clients are?

598
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,420
Let's go.

599
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,460
Final warning,

600
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,460
I want that agreement signed
by noon tomorrow.

601
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,420
Or you won't get a penny.

602
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,540
I always keep my word.

603
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,620
Mr. Qin,

604
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,580
that kiss

605
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,380
was purely out of anger.

606
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,060
Sorry.

607
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,940
Apology accepted.

608
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,700
How will you make it up to me?

609
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,660
Let me treat you to dinner.

610
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,060
How about that?

611
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,100
I'm hungry anyway.

612
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,860
I'll pick the place.

613
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,020
Of course.

614
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,220
Whatever you say.

615
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,420
Then hold on tight.

616
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,860
Ma!

617
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,860
Beer on draft, please.

618
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,500
Alright.

619
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,020
Do you need anything else?

620
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,980
That's all for now.

621
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,860
Alright.

622
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:48,400
[Ma's Barbecue]

623
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:48,860
Here.

624
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,380
Despite all the changes,

625
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,380
it's great that Ma's Barbecue
is still here.

626
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,740
How is it?

627
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,100
Still delicious.

628
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,460
Try some.

629
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,340
Here.

630
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,100
Today, we're reuniting on campus.

631
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,340
Such a meaningful day.

632
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,100
And you helped me out big time

633
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,780
by getting rid of Deng Boting.

634
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,060
Cheers.

635
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,700
This feels great.

636
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,580
Come on.

637
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,340
Tell me,

638
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,620
do you hate Deng Boting?

639
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,300
No.

640
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,780
Why would I?

641
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,660
We were once

642
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,140
perfect partners.

643
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,660
We even have a daughter.

644
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,940
There were so many wonderful moments.

645
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,060
If you were given the choice again,

646
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,060
would you still have left

647
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,260
six years ago?

648
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,180
Remember

649
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,380
that party we attended?

650
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,220
If it weren't for you,

651
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,300
I wouldn't even have gotten in.

652
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,060
Seven years ago,

653
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,940
I had to beg to get in.

654
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,780
But look at now, seven years later,

655
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,020
they're begging me to come.

656
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,260
I go if I want,

657
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,100
and skip if I don't.

658
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,180
What do you think I'd choose?

659
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,620
Figured that'd be your answer.

660
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,100
Alright.

661
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,060
To all the choices we've made.

662
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,980
To all the choices

663
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,860
that have made me who I am today.

664
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,300
Come on, have some more.

665
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,780
No more drinks.

666
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,540
You've had too much.

667
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,340
I thought

668
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,340
becoming a successful woman

669
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,860
would bring money and happiness.

670
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,020
Turns out it doesn't work that way.

671
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,460
But what can I do?

672
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,260
I...

673
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,620
I still seek lasting happiness.

674
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,100
Mr. Qin,

675
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,100
am I being too greedy?

676
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,700
Mingmei.

677
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,140
You'll be happy.

678
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,660
Hello, Wang Yi.

679
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,340
Did Tong schedule an interview

680
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,460
with your R&D team next week?

681
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,500
Yeah.

682
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,860
Let's have our team-building
at the archery range that day.

683
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,260
Have her do the interview there.

684
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,500
It's barely been days since you last
saw Ding Zhitong.

685
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,300
Getting antsy?

686
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,060
I know she's avoiding me.

687
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,060
Although we've cleared up the past,

688
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,140
it's not easy...

689
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,340
to just move on from those things.

690
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,820
I know her.

691
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,660
I want to spend more time with her

692
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,500
until she's ready to accept me.

693
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,240
[Beijing]

694
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,500
You're up.

695
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,020
Have some water.

696
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,140
Thanks.

697
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,940
I'll make breakfast.

698
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,140
We'll head back to Shanghai after.

699
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,300
Freshen up first.

700
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,500
You're so nostalgic.

701
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
You haven't thrown away this tie.

702
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,900
I like this style.

703
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,180
Why take out this dress suddenly?

704
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,100
Got plans?

705
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,580
I just suddenly felt like

706
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,700
wearing an old dress.

707
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,580
I remember now.

708
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,540
It was right before graduation.

709
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,740
You specifically prepared this dress

710
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,300
because you wanted Mr. Qin
to take you to a party.

711
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,140
Sharp memory.

712
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,460
Spill it.

713
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,820
Why are you here?

714
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,660
Avoiding Gan Yang?

715
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,820
I'm juggling multiple projects.

716
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,940
Swamped doesn't even begin to cover it.

717
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,540
No time to see him.

718
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,500
But it's probably for the best.

719
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,300
Every encounter

720
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,860
means pretending we're just friends

721
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,980
when I actually like him.

722
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:00,980
Exhausting.

723
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,940
This state won't last long.

724
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,980
What can I do

725
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,500
to make Gan Yang give up completely?

726
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,700
Let me think.

727
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,980
Why don't you start seeing someone new?

728
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,020
Wang Sen seems perfect.

729
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,300
He's a top-tier eligible bachelor.

730
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,220
Aren't you even a little tempted?

731
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,740
Now, just because a guy is around me,

732
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,980
you think there's something going on
between us?

733
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,500
Wang Sen and I are just friends.

734
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,220
Strictly client-vendor.

735
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,740
Well,

736
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,180
keep lying to yourself.

737
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:34,940
Remember who he is.

738
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,660
He's the chairman of Wang's.

739
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,140
Personally overseeing every project?

740
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,420
That's him creating excuses
to get close to you.

741
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,140
I've never thought about it that way.

742
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,020
Apart from Gan Yang,

743
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,020
no man interests you.

744
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,060
So

745
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,180
how did Gan Yang react

746
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,980
when this big shot

747
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,940
appeared around you?

748
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,740
Listen,

749
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,460
tomorrow I'm interviewing

750
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,300
LT's R&D team.

751
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,040
Wang Yi said it's a team-building day
at the archery range

752
