00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,580
Hope you won't regret your decision.

194
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,780
Don't worry.

195
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,300
I'd never let go

196
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,900
of what truly matters to me.

197
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,260
Funny.

198
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,900
I always get what I want.

199
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,660
Sir,

200
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,580
I've contacted all the companies

201
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,540
Ms. Ding reached out to.

202
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,940
They've agreed not to purchase
LT's materials.

203
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,620
Got it.

204
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,860
Sir,

205
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,020
there's one thing I don't quite get.

206
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,740
You're wondering

207
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,340
why I'm still targeting LT

208
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,260
after they withdrew from Training Box

209
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,700
and had no further involvement
with Wang's?

210
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,620
Yes.

211
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,620
Do you know

212
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,020
why Gan Yang left Ding Zhitong
seven years ago?

213
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,860
Because his company owed 200 million

214
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,100
and was on the verge of bankruptcy.

215
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,500
If...

216
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,700
I put him in the same position
as seven years ago,

217
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,740
no...

218
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,060
even worse than seven years ago...

219
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,500
what choice do you think he'll make?

220
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,780
I see.

221
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,940
He left her once.

222
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,420
He'll do it again.

223
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,300
I'm leaving.

224
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,620
These companies seem
to have coordinated.

225
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,980
They were all interested before,

226
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,140
but now suddenly no one's buying.

227
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,180
Is someone targeting LT?

228
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
You noticed too.

229
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,300
Wang's?

230
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,180
Why would he come after you?

231
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,660
You've already withdrawn
from Training Box.

232
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,020
He wants something more precious
from me.

233
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,180
Something more precious?

234
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,820
He won't get his way.

235
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,700
That's good.

236
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,700
I'm moving the company out of Shanghai.

237
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,580
Really?

238
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,620
Then, where to?

239
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,500
Putian.

240
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,020
My hometown.

241
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,500
LT's shoe factory is there.

242
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,780
That's where LT started.

243
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,140
When are you moving?

244
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,580
I'll announce the move

245
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,020
today.

246
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,660
But Putian is too far from Shanghai.

247
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,140
Will this spark a mass exodus of staff

248
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,020
and trigger widespread resignations?

249
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,980
This is the most cost-effective solution

250
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,180
I can think of right now.

251
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,900
The production line must keep running
no matter what.

252
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,940
Maybe you should reconsider.

253
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,060
I've reached out to other buyers.

254
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,660
I should hear back soon.

255
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,420
Don't bother.

256
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,980
The funding gap this time is too large.

257
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,900
Regardless of whether we can
sell the materials or not...

258
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,780
we have to move out of Shanghai.

259
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,020
But...

260
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,180
Don't worry.

261
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,380
I believe we'll be back soon.

[LT Capital]

263
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,620
What's going on?

264
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,020
Looks like everyone's here today.

265
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,700
Why did they

266
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,460
suddenly gather everyone here?

267
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,900
No idea. With such a big turnout,

268
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,820
it must be something important.

269
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,340
Obviously.

270
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,020
But what exactly?

271
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,420
Right, what's the important thing?

272
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,300
Exactly.

273
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,380
Are there layoffs coming?

274
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,700
- Layoffs?
- Layoffs?

275
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,580
No way.

276
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,620
Why not?

277
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,100
Everyone, quiet down.

278
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,660
Listen up.

279
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,180
I believe you all know

280
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,700
the situation of the company.

281
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,980

After discussion,

To Putian?

286
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,380
That's so far. It's in Fujian.

287
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,860
Exactly.

288
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,180
That's so far.

289
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,940
Right. Why is it so sudden?

290
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,180
Exactly.

291
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,700
Will we get pay cuts if we move?

292
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,780
Right.

293
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,900
Yeah, why is this happening?

294
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,540
I understand your concerns.

is entirely up to you.

00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,740
Should we go?

298
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,180
We promise that everyone

299
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,180
who goes will have their salary
and benefits unchanged.

But my family is all in Shanghai.

301
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,660
What if we don't go?

And we'll provide recommendation letters

305

at other companies.

to move to Putian with us.

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,500
Coming to see me?

I'll go with you.

No, thanks.

What I'm going to do is pretty wild.

338

00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,060
Absolutely.

Hello, a glass of water, please.

Hey beautiful,

343
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,260
I've been watching you all night.

344
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,140
May I have the honor
of having a drink with you?

345
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,060
Sure.

346
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,980
Cheers.

347
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,060
Sorry.

She doesn't drink.

349

What are you doing?

350
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,420
I'm not done having fun yet.

351
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
I booked the whole place.

00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,660
Let me dance some more.

Hey, what are you doing?

355
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,540
I'm not done having fun yet.

356
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,660
I want to go back and have fun.

357
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,460
Mingmei,

358
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,060
you're not actually enjoying this.

359
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,780
Everyone else is having a blast,

360
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,860
but you're not happy at all.

361
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,020
I am.

362
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,180
Remember what I told you last time?

363
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,900
Yes.

364
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,500
You said you regretted it.

365
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,420
What?

366
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,060
You regret not stopping me
six years ago?

367
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,900
No.

368
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,700
Then what?

369
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,380
At the airport back then,

370
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,700
I wanted to tell you I'd wait for you.

371
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,260
But in the end, I didn't say anything.

372
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,180
I've never regretted letting you go.

373
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,100
I wanted you
to become who you always wanted to be.

374
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,540
If I had another chance,

375
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,100
I'd tell you

376
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,020
I'd wait for you forever.

377
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,540
No matter what happens,

378
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,780
I'll always be there for you.

Yes.

do you want me to wait?

That attitude

509
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,500
proves she didn't love the wrong man.

510
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
Can you tell me now?

511
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,500

00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,780
a lot of things happened to Tong.

521
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,740

522
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,820
No.

523
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,060
She's in her hometown

524
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,260

525
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,860

Remember

527
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,340
when she came to Putian to find you?

528
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,340
The day you broke up with her,

529
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,300
her mother passed away.

530
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,260
She didn't even get to see her mother
one last time.

531
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,980
Losing her closest family destroyed her.

532
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,340
She locked herself away,

533
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,860
starving and silent for days.

534
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,980
I was stuck overseas, helpless.

Feng Sheng

536
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,180
was her lifeline then.

537
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,980
When she fainted at home,

538
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,380
he found her in time

539
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,820
and took her to the hospital.

540
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,340
Later, she said yes to his proposal,

541
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,940
out of thanks.

542
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,940
But when she realized
she couldn't love him,

543
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,100
she broke off the engagement

544
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,500
and left for Hong Kong, China alone.

545
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,700

I'm sorry

549
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,780
I only came to see you now.

550
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,260
Back then, I thought breaking up
with Tong...

551
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,980
was for her own good.

552
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
But I didn't know so many things
had happened...

553
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,620
making her blame herself...

554
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,420
and feel guilty until now.

555
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,620
I'm sorry.

556
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,340

563

I was going to go straight home.

564
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,860
But it was too late

565
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,980
and there were no return buses.

566
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,260
I had to stay in Putian for the night,

567
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,660
planning to catch the first bus
the next morning.

568
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,300
Then I spiked a fever.

569
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,140
Hey, Mom?

570
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,340
Tong!

571
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,260
You said you were coming home.

572
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,460
Why didn't you
answer the phone all night?

573
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,700
I was worried sick.

574
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,620
I've got a fever.

575
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,780
How did you get a fever?

576
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,260
Where are you?

577
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,140
It's okay.

578
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,620
I'll be home soon.

579
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,220
Tong?

580
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,260
Tong!

581
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,700
She must have been really worried.

582
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,900
She couldn't reach me
when she needed me the most.

583
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,420
Mom.

584
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,960
I'm sorry.

585
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,580
She was found by the neighbor
the next morning.

586
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,100
Then she was taken to the hospital.

587
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,900
But when I woke up,

588
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,060
it was already noon the next day.

589
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,780
Hey, girl,

590
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,260
thank goodness you're awake.

591
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,940
You scared me to death.

592
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,660
I thought something terrible
had happened.

593
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,460
Are you okay?

594
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,060
What's the date today?

595
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,060
Well, the 13th.

596
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,420
You were supposed to check out
yesterday.

597
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,940
I'm glad I came in to take a look.

598
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,700
When I came in, I saw you fainted here.

599
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,260
It scared me to death.

600
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,540
Where's my phone?

601
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,980
It's charging right here.

602
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,980
I was going to call your family,

603
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,300
but your phone was off.

604
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,460
Okay, I'm glad you're awake.

605
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,460
I'll get back to work.

606
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,260
Remember to extend your stay later.

607
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,280
[Feng Sheng]

608
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,180
Hello?

609
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:19,980
Ding Zhitong,

610
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:20,700
come to the hospital now.

611
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,580
Something happened to your mother.

612
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,540
Tong.

613
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,020
Your mother...

614
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,780
Mom!

615
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,540
Mom.

616
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,580
I rushed to the hospital

617
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,740
as fast as I could,

618
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,980
but I still didn't get to

619
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,900
see her one last time.

620
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,380
Tong.

621
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,820
I just learned all this.

622
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,700
If I had been...

623
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,260
honest with you

624
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,900
instead of breaking up with you...

625
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,420
none of this would have happened.

626
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,140
I did blame you for a time.

627
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,780
If you hadn't suddenly
broken up with me...

628
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,780
none of this would have happened.

629
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,660
But then I realized

630
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,140
that blaming you

631
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,980
was just me avoiding the truth.

632
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,340
It had nothing to do with you at all.

633
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,180
In the end,

634
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,860
it's all my fault.

635
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,900
Ding Zhitong,

636
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,660
this wasn't on you.

637
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,540
You can't keep shouldering
all the guilt.

638
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,580
The year after we broke up,

639
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,940
I avoided everything related to you,

640
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,900
afraid of triggering memories.

641
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,900
Until we met again later,

642
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,020
I repeatedly told myself to hate you,

643
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,060
but I just couldn't do it.

644
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,820
I also tried convincing myself
to let go of my grudges

645
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,820
and give us another chance,

646
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,140
but I still couldn't do it.

647
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,100
So you kept this from me

648
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,300
to spare me the same guilt you carried.

649
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,300
Tong.

650
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,500
Does this mean
we really can't go back now?
