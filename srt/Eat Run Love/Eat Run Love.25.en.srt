25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,820
So, Mr. Wang, what would you say

26
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,140
are LT's competitive edges

27
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,940
in the market?

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,020
I believe competitive edges

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,340
mainly lie in two aspects.

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,020
First, we have a professional

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,700
and highly skilled team

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,980
with extensive industry experience

33
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,300
and sharp market insight.

34
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,180
Second, we are people-oriented

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,420
and customer-centric.

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,300
We continuously strive to meet
our customers' expectations and needs.

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,780
These two factors

38
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,220
give us a strong core competitiveness.

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,140

of hundreds of billions.

91
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,060
it'll drive users away,

92

Even though I founded Training Box,

94
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,220
most shareholders side with him now.

95
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,940
If I force an expansion,

96
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,980
I'm afraid they'll sideline me.

97
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,060
Gan Yang wants
proportional capital increase.

98
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,580
That won't dilute his stake
in Training Box.

99

You can't get rid of him.

100

lands on your chosen number, you win.

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,820
Mr. Wang specifically

191
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,220
asked me

192
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,340
to bring everything from Beijing.

193
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,460
He said it  was a must
to keep the original flavor.

194
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,260
Try it.

195
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,420
It's the same taste as before.

196
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,380
There are also some skewers.

197
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,300
I'll be right back.

198
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,540
Mr. Wang, thanks for your kindness.

199
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,020
But I don't deserve
such a reward for my work.

200
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,900
I still need to push harder.

201
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,380
No shop talk at dinner.

202
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,220
Try it.

203
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,860
See if the taste is different.

204
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:57,780
Here.

205
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,740
Let me know if you need anything.

206
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,700
Alright.

207
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,260
Come on.

208
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,580
Eat this while it's hot.

209
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,380
Thanks,

210
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,900
but I'm not really hungry.

211
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,340
Mr. Wang,

212
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,780
if this isn't about work,

213
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,260
I should head back.

214
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,060
Let's meet at the office tomorrow.

215
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,420
I'll take you home.

216
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,700
Don't bother.

217
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,260
I'd like to walk alone.

218
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,500
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

219
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,620
Fang Ying.

220
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,300
To Manhattan Neighborhood.

221
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,620
I'll drop something off
for Ding Zhitong.

222
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,060
Why are you eating instant noodles here?

223
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,740
Because I'm hungry, of course.

224
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,940
Perfect. I'm starving too.

225
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,260
Here, have some meat.

226
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,940
No. I would've bought it myself
if I wanted it.

227
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
It's almost midnight.

228
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,020
Buy one sausage, and get one free.

229
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,340
Here.

230
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,020
Thanks.

231
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,020
Turn around.

232
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,900
Okay, I got it.

233
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,460
I'll handle it at the office soon.

234
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,420
About half an hour.

235
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,300
Alright.

236
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,180
Let's talk later.

237
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,180
Hello, Mr. Gan.

238
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,140
The chairman would like
to have a word with you in the car.

239
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,380
Please.

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,220
[Oriental Manhattan]

241
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,020
Mr. Wang.

242
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,460
What do you want to talk to me about?

243
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,340
Simple.

244
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,500
If you agree to give up Ding Zhitong,

245
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,620
and disappear from her life completely,

246
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,940
I'll help you achieve your dreams.

247
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,780
And if I refuse?

248
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,580
I can bankrupt LT.

249
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,500
You know I have that power.

250
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,820
Then my answer is no.

251
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,580
Don't refuse so quickly.

252
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,980
Think about it.

253
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,900
It wasn't easy for you
to get where you are

254
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,100
from being in 200 million worth of debt.

255
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,620
Are you sure you want to give up LT
for Ding Zhitong?

256
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,340
Who said I'm giving it up?

257
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,740
I want both Ding Zhitong and LT.

258
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,900
By the way, Mr. Wang.

259
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,940
There's something
I should thank you for.

260
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,020
If it weren't for you,

261
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,820
Ding Zhitong and I
wouldn't have reunited.

262
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,580
And I wouldn't have had the chance
to pursue her again.

263
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,620
So thank you.

264
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,340
If you can prevent Gan Yang

265
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,180
from having enough funds
for proportional capital increase,

266
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,540
I'll buy out all his shares.

267
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,620
The decision is yours.

268
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,660
Deal.

269
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,660
Intellectual Property just called.

270
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,260
When applying for a patent
for the new material,

271
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,460
they found it
had already been registered.

272
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,300
They provided

273
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,700
data and research videos

274
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,580
almost identical to ours.

275
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,060
Our data has been leaked.

276
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,580
Wang Yi, notify the factory

277
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,620
to stop producing all materials
for the new shoes now.

278
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,620
But we've invested

279
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,980
so much in R&D

280
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,380
and stockpiled raw materials.

281
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,660
Now we don't have the patent,

282
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,900
and we can't produce the shoes.

283
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,020
We don't have the money

284
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,420
for proportional capital increase
in Training Box.

285
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,140
Notify all directors
to attend a meeting. Now.

286
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,020
- Alright.
- Got it.

287
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,620
I heard about the patent issue.

288
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,900
What happened?

289
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,260
Have you eaten?

290
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,740
Not yet.

291
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,900
Then let's go grab a bite.

292
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,620
We can talk while we eat.

293
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,380
Okay.

294
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,180
I've developed a habit over the years.

295
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,540
Whenever I hit a wall

296
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,100
and can't find

297
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,420
a solution,

298
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,180
I tell myself something.

299
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,420
What?

300
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,860
"It is what it is.

301
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,860
let's eat first."

302
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,380
Or "It is what it is,

303
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,420
let's go for a run."

304
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,580
After eating or running,

305
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,780
I'll think about how to fix things.

306
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,660
Is LT's situation this serious?

307
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,900
Wang Yi and his team

308
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,060
spent years on this patent.

309
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
As it stands,

310
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,860
all the funds and time we've invested

311
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,260
have gone to waste.

312
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,860
And all the raw materials
we've purchased

313
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,820
are also wasted.

314
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,260
You've already purchased the materials?

315
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,060
Yes.

316
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,420
The whole company

317
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,700
was very confident

318
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,420
about the new sneakers.

319
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,540
Here.

320
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,060
After multiple rounds of discussions

321
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,420
with Production and Sales,

322
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,020
we decided on mass production.

323
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,100
So we ordered materials in bulk.

324
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,900
Will there be
a lot of financial pressure?

325
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,900
Will it affect daily operations?

326
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,260
That's why we need a solution fast.

327
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,020
What if you sell the materials?

328
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
Would that help?

329
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,260
I've already contacted buyers.

330
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,060
Hope we can sell them soon.

331
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,620
Gan Yang,

332
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,700
can you be honest with me?

333
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,700
Don't worry.

334
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,140
We'll figure it out.

335
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
This is nothing

336
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,100
compared to six years ago.

337
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,380
Tong,

338
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,140
I've made it through the past.

339
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,900
I'll get through this too.

340
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,340
Have you found out who did it?

341
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,500
No concrete evidence,

342
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,540
but it's not hard to guess.

343
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,700
Think about

344
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,220
who would benefit the most from this?

345
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,940
The Wang's.

346
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,180
That's basically

347
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,580
the situation.

348
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,340
The funding gap is that large?

349
00:20:59,220 --> 00:20:59,860
Everyone,

350
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,020
due to my negligence
and poor management,

351
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,940
the company has suffered heavy losses.

352
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,660
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,340
Business is like that.

354
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,700
Ups and downs are normal, right?

355
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,580
Don't blame yourself too much.

356
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,220
But what's the plan now?

357
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,260
I've contacted buyers.

358
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,220
We'll sell the backlog of materials
as soon as possible

359
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,900
to recoup some funds.

360
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,260
Over the years,

361
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,980
I've weathered worse storms than this.

362
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,740
Right?

363
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,500
- Right.
- Exactly.

364
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,140
Don't worry.

365
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,180
We believe in you.

366
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,220
Just go ahead and do it.

367
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,340
Yes, Mr. Gan, we believe in you.

368
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,820
Yeah, Gan,

369
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
just go ahead. We all believe in you.

370
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,260
Thank you all.

371
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,460
I won't

372
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,380
let you down.

373
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,100
You just said you believed in me.

374
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,900
Why are you sighing now?

375
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,420
If I had known this would happen,

376
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,220
I wouldn't have

377
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,220
donated my entire fortune.

378
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,700
At least it could've

379
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,180
covered our losses today.

380
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,620
Well, why don't you call

381
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,220
and see if you can get the money back?

382
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,500
You punk, are you messing with me?

383
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,220
I...

384
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,220
Please don't throw that.

385
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,620
We can't afford replacements.

386
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,780
The company is broke.

387
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,660
Okay.

388
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,060
You can still joke around.

389
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,220
That's good.

390
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,820
It means you've got a plan.

391
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,860
This

392
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,700
was supposed to be my nest egg.

393
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,900
It's not much,

394
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,620
but it can help a little.

395
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,900
Just take it.

396
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,060
Mr. Chen.

397
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,540
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

398
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,340
Don't give me this hugging stuff.

399
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,220
It's disgusting.

400
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,380
Get off.

401
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,420
Mr. Chen, we're broke

402
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,180
but we won't dig into your savings.

403
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,700
With me here, LT won't fall.

404
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
You're pretty arrogant, kid.

405
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
I like it.

406
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,740
But listen,

407
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,860
you have to tell me
about anything that happens.

408
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,580
Don't shoulder everything yourself.
Got it?

409
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,700
Alright.

410
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,780
Enough lecturing.

411
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,940
I'll walk you out.

412
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,740
It's fine.

413
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,740
- Get back to work.
- Let me see you out.

414
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,940
Don't bother. I'm leaving.

415
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,100
Alright, Bye.

416
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,700
Bye.

417
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,540
Gan Yang!

418
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,220
Have you found Wang Yi?

419
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,060
No, I've searched the whole company.

420
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,420
He's not answering his phone
or replying to messages.

421
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,820
I'm worried sick.

422
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,700
Is he thinking
of doing something drastic?

423
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,100
No.

424
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,020
If anyone's the last to crack,

425
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,220
it's not him.

426
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,860
Then where could he be?

427
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,380
I know where he is.

428
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,060
Wang Yi.

429
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,180
What are you doing here?

430
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,820
Why did you drink so much?

431
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,500
We were all worried sick.

432
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,420
What happened to you?

433
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,740
Actually...

434
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,660
Actually, Gan Yang

435
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,180
had been reminding me
to register sooner.

436
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,980
But I kept putting it off,

437
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,580
thinking I'd finish my tasks first.

438
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,300
Just one day.

439
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,420
Just one day late.

440
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,340
Now our work has become others'.

441
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,180
It's all my fault.

442
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
Sorry, everyone.

443
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,740
Wang Yi, this isn't on you.

444
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,260
It's on me.

445
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,340
I knew you were swamped.

446
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,980
I should've had someone else do it.

447
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,620
So it's not your fault.

448
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,220
Don't blame yourself.

449
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,340
No, it's my fault.

450
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,580
I should've reminded you all the time.

451
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,420
Don't comfort me.

452
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,700
Now you're drinking?
You can't handle it.

453
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,940
Gan Yang, let me drink.

454
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,820
I'm feeling

455
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,580
really bottled up.

456
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,620
I need this.

457
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,580
Gan Yang.

458
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,660
Fine.

459
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,220
You want to drink, huh?

460
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,580
I'll join you.

461
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,780
What are you doing?

462
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,260
Your stomach can't take it!

463
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,140
You'll end up in the hospital again.

464
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,740
Are you insane, Gan Yang?

465
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,660
You wanted to drink.

466
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,420
So I'll drink with you.

467
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,820
I didn't ask you to!

468
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,900
I'm drinking alone!

469
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,980
Alone!

470
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,740
You two still at it?

471
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,940
Xu Chenxi!

472
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,940
What do we do?

473
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,020
Hello?

474
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,620
Okay, I got it.

475
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,140
Something came up at work.

476
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,860
I have to go.

477
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,980
Xu Chenxi is in your care.

478
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,220
Wait, that's not right.

479
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,860
I should be the one who's drunk.

480
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,020
I feel so awful.

481
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,140
Don't drink so much again.

482
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,660
Am I on a boat?

483
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,380
Why is everything spinning?

484
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,740
Easy there.

485
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,220
Promise me you won't
drink so much again.

486
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,740
Wang Yi.

487
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,500
Yes?

488
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,860
Wang Yi.

489
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,780
Yes?

490
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,700
Wang Yi.

491
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,940
I'm here.

492
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,380
I don't want you to be unhappy.

493
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,220
I hope you come to me first

494
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,620
when you're sad.

495
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,780
I'll always be there for you.

496
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,500
Alright.

497
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,580
I want pig intestines.

498
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,620
Let's go home and eat.

499
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,700
I'm leaving.

500
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,780
I'm off work.

501
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,420
Bye.

502
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:12,940
Come in.

503
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,220
You haven't left yet.

504
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,060
You look a bit tired.

505
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
I bought you some coffee.

506
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,940
I'm leaving.

507
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,340
Don't work too late.

508
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,860
Okay.

509
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,020
Thanks.

510
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,420
Eat well,

511
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,740
sleep well,

512
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,220
and everything will work out.

513
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,500
Mr. Qin,

514
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,900
thank you so much.

515
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,180
You're so busy
but still made time to join me

516
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,900
at Yulin's school parent-child activity.

517
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,620
It's nothing.

518
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,980
I should be thanking you.

519
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,380
It's been ages since I had
such a relaxing break.

520
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,700
Mom,

521
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,180
I like Mr. Qin.

522
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,940
Can he be my dad?

523
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,860
Well, tell him yourself.

524
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,940
I like you too.

525
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,020
What's wrong?

526
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,980
You've been yawning a lot.

527
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,220
Since Deng left,

528
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,540
work's been piling up.

529
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,420
I'm exhausted.

530
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,740
Let's go to the hospital for a check-up?

531
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,660
Already scheduled.

532
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,580
I'll go tomorrow.

533
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,460
I'll come with you.

534
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,940
No, just a routine check-up.
It'll be fine.

535
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,340
The car is here.

536
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,220
I'll take you home.

537
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,180
Mom,

538
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,700
can Mr. Qin come home

539
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,180
for dinner with us?

540
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,300
He's too busy with work.

541
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,220
Let's not bother him, okay?

542
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,700
What do we do?

543
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,900
Your mom said I can't come.

544
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,940
Then I'm inviting you
to dinner tomorrow?

545
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,060
Is that okay?

546
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,660
Is that okay?

547
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,620
Alright.

548
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,420
See you tomorrow.

549
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,580
Push with me.

550
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,580
Let's go.

551
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,300
It's so late.

552
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,260
He's still not back.

553
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,300
Gan Yang!

554
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,380
Gan Yang.

555
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,180
Gan Yang?

556
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,580
Gan Yang!

557
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,260
Why are you making such a racket?

558
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,740
People are trying to sleep!

559
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,500
Sorry.

560
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,700
His lights have been on,

561
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,780
but no one has answered the door.

562
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,220
I'm worried
something might have happened.

563
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,580
Gan Yang!

564
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,420
Gan Yang, come out!

565
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,660
Why don't you call him?

566
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,940
Maybe he's not home?

567
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,020
I tried.

568
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,060
But no one answered.

569
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,780
Could something really have happened?

570
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:05,940
Gan Yang.

571
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,020
Gan Yang!

572
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:07,660
If it's that serious,

573
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,780
should I call the police?

574
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,420
Yes, please.

575
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,380
Thank you.

576
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,100
- Come on, call them.
- Alright.

577
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,980
Gan Yang, I'll call the police
if you don't come out!

578
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,820
Gan Yang!

579
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,700
Gan...

580
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,780
Tong, why are you here?

581
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,220
You finally came out.

582
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,660
Your girlfriend was worried sick.

583
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,460
Sorry about that. False alarm.

584
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,140
Let's go.

585
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,220
What happened?

586
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,420
You scared me.

587
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
What took you so long to open the door

588
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,140
and why didn't you answer your phone?

589
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,020
I accidentally fell asleep
while taking a bath.

590
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,580
My phone was charging outside.

591
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,100
Do you know how dangerous that is?

592
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,740
I thought something happened to you.

593
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,060
Sorry, sorry.

594
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,700
You must've been frantic.

595
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,300
You're so worried about me?

596
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,220
Of course not.

597
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,860
How did you hurt your foot?

598
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,380

647
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,620

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,660
Have some more.

650
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,060
Gan Yang.

651
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,620
I know LT is struggling.

652
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,300
But you really need rest.

653
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,140
You can't ruin your health.

654
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,140
Do you remember me saying

655
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,580
the same thing to you seven years ago?

656
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,860
Didn't expect it
to be the other way around now.

657
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,380
It's all my fault.

658
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,460
If it weren't for me,

659
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,420
you wouldn't have agreed
to the financing,

660
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,340
and none of this would have happened.

661
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,980
Sorry.

662
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,500
Tong.

663
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,420
This has nothing to do with you.

664
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,660
I didn't agree to the financing
because of you.

665
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,020
LT didn't end up in this situation

666
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,500
because of you.

667
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,580
Don't blame yourself.

668
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,860
Have some more.

669
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,020
Okay.

670
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,620
This is the first time
you've asked me out.

671
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,300
Honestly, I'm quite happy.

672
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,620
Was the LT patent issue your doing?

673
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,060
Is that why you asked me out today?

674
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,380
Yes.

675
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,500
Fine.

676
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,380
Then before I answer,

677
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,900
I want to ask you in what capacity
are you questioning me.

678
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,140
As Gan Yang's ex-girlfriend

679
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,460
or my financing consultant?

680
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,980
Does it make a difference?

681
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,500
If it's the former,

682
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,660
I have no obligation to tell you.

683
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,060
And the latter?

684
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,220
If it's the latter,

685
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,860
then we're in this together.

686
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,900
I'll tell you the truth.

687
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,020
So you admit you did it?

688
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,820
Business is like a battlefield.

689
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,220
If you want to blame someone,

690
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,980
blame Gan Yang's poor management.

691
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,140
Good excuse, Mr. Wang.

692
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,980
If this

693
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,900
had happened to anyone

694
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,660
other than Gan Yang,

695
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,220
would you have cared as much?

696
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,820
Of course I would.

697
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,140
I can't accept my client
acting so despicably

698
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,220
or playing dirty.

699
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,980
I thought we got along

700
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,060
and shared many similar ideas.

701
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,660
I even considered you a friend.

702
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,780
Clearly I was wrong.

703
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,740
We're nothing alike.

704
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,540
What's that supposed to mean?

705
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,620
I'm withdrawing from Training Box.

706
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,620
I won't be working on it.

707
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,700
Do you know

708
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,860
how important this project is

709
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,860
for your promotion to MD?

710
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,580
Are you sure you want to quit now?

711
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,300
That is my business.

712
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,060
Not your concern.

713
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,620
The results are in.

714
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,780
It's breast cancer.

715
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,420
Breast cancer?

716
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,500
Although the cancer cells
have spread to the lymph nodes,

717
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,180
there's still hope
with prompt treatment.

718
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,340
Hello?

719
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,500
Are the results out?

720
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,380
How is it?

721
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,820
They're out.

722
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,860
Everything's fine.

723
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,500
I just finished up here.

724
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,780
I'll come get you.

725
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,340
Don't bother.
Let's meet at the restaurant later.

726
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,460
I'm hanging up.

727
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,140
Do you remember this place?

728
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,740
Mingmei.

729
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,420
Mingmei?

730
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,660
Are you okay?

731
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,100
You seem distracted today.

732
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,260
Yeah.

733
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,260
It's still the same
as it was six years ago.

734
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,900
Hasn't changed a bit.

735
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,380
We sat right here,

736
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,660
and you told me

737
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,620
you wanted to become
a successful woman before 35,

738
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,060
then move to the United States.

739
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,220
You actually remember all that.

740
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,260
It's been six years.

741
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,660
You've achieved your dream.

742
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,900
I know you've never regretted

743
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,860
that decision.

744
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,020
But I have.

745
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,140
Mingmei...

746
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,820
I'm not feeling well.

747
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,500
