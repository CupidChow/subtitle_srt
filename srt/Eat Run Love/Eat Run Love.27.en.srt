192

Don't worry about me.

193
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
I'm in good shape.

194
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,420
I can't stop thinking about the design,
R&D and the production line.

195
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,540
I'm just too hyped up

196

199

200
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,580
Really, no need.

201
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,820

202
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,340

203

I can't win against you two.

207
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,540
I'll take one

208
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,700
and nap on the couch for a bit.

209
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,780
Wake me up before the meeting.

210

Come in.

211
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,660

212

213
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,700
Alright.

214
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,460
Didn't sleep well again last night?

215
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,380
Heard semen ziziphi spinosae
helps with sleep.

216
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,500
Why don't you try them?

217
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,300
I've tried all kinds of sleeping pills.

218
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,380
They only let me sleep for two hours.

219
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I daren't take too many.

220
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,740
With all that coffee during the day,

221
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,900
no wonder you can't sleep at night.

222
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,580
This vicious cycle

223
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,380
can't continue.

224
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,580
Maybe you should try
traditional Chinese medicine?

225
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,300
I've seen both TCM and Western doctors.

226
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,660
It's okay. It's a mental thing.

227
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,900
It'll get better.

228
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,260
Go ahead with your work.

229
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,420
Alright, I'll be leaving.

230
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,580
Let's talk.

231
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
Do you have feelings for me?

232
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,500
Yes.

233
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,660
But I don't feel the same way.

234
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,820
I know you don't like me now.

235
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,380
But that doesn't mean you never will.

236
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,220
Hello, ma'am.

237
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,940
Here's your coffee.

238
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,700
Enjoy, sir.

239
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,700
This is the very coffee
you ordered last time.

240
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,380
I remembered.

241
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,340
Actually, I never liked coffee before.

242
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Too bitter.

243
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,620
It seemed useless except

244
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,780
for keeping me awake.

245
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,020
I started drinking it

246
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,340
because Gan Yang once prepared

247
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,540
a surprise for me at a café.

248
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,980
I started to like coffee because of him.

249
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,460
So

250
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,700
if I give you enough time,

251
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,260
maybe you will

252
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,700
start to like something else

253
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,980
and replace coffee.

254
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,820
Not just coffee,

255
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,860

and learning to live well,

259
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,220
Gan Yang taught me all these things.

260
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,340
So I think a relationship
isn't just about memories,

261
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,740
but about becoming more like
that person.

262
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,580
But those memories are in the past,

263
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:12,860
aren't they?

264
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,180
Even so,

265
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,140
I still like Gan Yang now.

266
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,140
And I'll always like him.

267
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,980
Have I made myself clear?

268
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,580
Thanks for the coffee.

269
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,500

378
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,940
Be careful.

379
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,660
Tong, what do you want to eat?

380
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,380
I'll order.

381
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,460
Anything is fine.

382
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,500
Alright.

385

Hello?

386
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,180
Mingmei,

387
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
can you do me a favor?

388
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,220
What's up? Just tell me.

I want you to do
a marketing promotion for him.

392
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,780
Can you give me a mate's rate?

393
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,940
You're this worried about Gan Yang?

394
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,780
Why don't you just be with him?

395
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,700
Stop struggling.

396
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,980
Worrying is one thing.

397
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,580
You know we can't be together.

398
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,300
You haven't moved on

399
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,980
and he still likes you.

400
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,580
How is that impossible?

401
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,860
Besides,

402
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,420
your mother definitely hopes

403
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,500

Anyway, you can't blame me

407

for whatever I say or do now.

408
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,260
Why not?

409
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,860
Because I have cancer.

410
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,300
What are you talking about?

411
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,340
Don't say such things.

The surgery
was supposed to be next week.

416
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,900
I wasn't going to tell you.

417
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,180
But what if the surgery fails?

418
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,340
Then you wouldn't even
get to see me one last time.

419
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,940
Which hospital are you in?

420
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,180
I'll come back today.

421
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,580

Don't you dare disturb me.

Stop that.

Send me the hospital address, now.

428

Yes.

436

437
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,180
may I take two weeks off?

438
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,220
My friend is sick and needs care.

439
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,540
Don't worry. I'll make sure all my work

440
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,340
is covered.

441
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,260
Have some soup.

442
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,620
Here.

443
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,860
- Mom, I want more of this.
- It's okay.

444

Why didn't you tell me earlier?

450

It's okay.

If you keep this up,

453
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,180
I'll feel bad too.

454
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,140
The doctor told me

455
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,460
not to have
too many emotional fluctuations.

456
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,740
I've looked up a lot

457
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,860
about your illness.

458
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,740
The cure rate is quite high.

459
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,380
Let's treat it as a chronic disease.

460
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,020
You'll definitely get better.

461
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,900
You can't even say the word "cancer".

462
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,860
I've fully accepted it.

463
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,260
Yulin doesn't know yet, does she?

464
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,700
No.

465
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,660
I want to protect her.

466
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,980
But if the surgery fails,

467
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,980
I'm counting on you to look after her.

468
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
What are you talking about?

469
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,020
The surgery will succeed.

470
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,140

Well, it's all right now.

475
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,380

focus on herself

491

instead of meddling?

The doctor just called me
for an examination. You two go ahead.

498
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,180
Don't.

499
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,300
I can manage on my own.

500
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,940
Have a good chat.

Don't mind her.

506
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,460
I thought it was you who was sick.

507
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,220
You scared me to death.

508

I'm glad you're okay.

509
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,500
I'm fine.

510

She had some check-ups the other day

511
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,420
and dragged me along too.

gotten any better recently?

515

Much better.

516
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,660
I don't even need to
take sleeping pills.

517
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,900
How about you?

You wouldn't believe me if I said no.

521

But it's okay.

522
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,860
We can handle it.

Mingmei is having surgery
the day after tomorrow.

524
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,060
We'll talk after that.

always waiting.

536
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,500
He left.

537
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,740
Don't do that again.

538

It makes me feel really bad.

to stay like this.

540

Alright.

546

I won't push you.

547
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,940
I was actually thinking of asking you

548
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,740

to take wedding photos with me.

549
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,940
Wedding photos?

00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,460
I was just thinking downstairs

551
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,260
that if the surgery fails,

552
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,820
these would be the days
when I'm at my best.

553
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,500
Qin Chang and I never even

554
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,940
took proper photos together.

555

We want to have a set of wedding photos
as a keepsake.

556

The surgery won't fail.

557
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,060
You two

558
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,660
are both so confident.

559
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,740
Alright.

560
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,740
Whether it fails or not,

561
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,260
I want to do it.

562
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,660
