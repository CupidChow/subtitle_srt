Just take it as I'm pitching here today.

185
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,300
Mr. Gan, you are already a PE now.

186
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,380
Why do you come to pitch at our agency?

187
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,340
Before we start talking about business,

188
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,260
you have to know our company first.

189
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,060
Our pitch book

190
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,900
contains introductions
of our company and team.

191
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,820
[Gutong Securities]

192
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,980
But I don't have ready-made information.

193
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,820
So I can only talk

194
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,540
about how we got to where we are today.

195
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,500
Please sit.

196
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,340
In 2018,

197
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,300
I returned to Putian.

198
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,860
The company run by my family

199
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,900
failed because of IPO,

200
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,940
and was on the verge of bankruptcy.

201
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,460
With various debts
and holes in repurchasing shares,

202
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,940
[Fangshi Capital]
the debt was 200 million in all.

203
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,380
Hello.

204
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,580
Is your manager, Fang here?

205
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,860
I'll give you a reply within three days.

206
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,860
Hello, Mr. Cai.
I am Gan Yang from Yongjuan Shoes.

207
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:04,620
What did you say?

208
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,780
Please do pay the money
you owe our company.

209
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,060
I can't hear...

210
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,540
We have no choice.

211
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,700
Go away! I can't hear it clearly.

212
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,860
I didn't mean you, He...

213
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,180
Not you, He. Okay.

214
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,740
Cai.

215
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,300
Every day, I received
various debt collection calls.

216
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,220
But I still couldn't bear

217
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,700
to break up with you.

218
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,420
Right at that time,

219
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,900
my father sued me in court.

220
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,700
My filial son.

221
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,420
See how seriously your dad is hurt.

222
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,220
It's very simple.

223
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,140
Give me the official seal

224
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,780
and this matter is over.

225
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,020
Otherwise,

226
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,020
don't blame me for being merciless.

227
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,220
I've checked the law.

228
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,420
Intentionally causing bodily harm
to others

229
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,420
can lead to imprisonment.

230
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,340
Chenxi.

231
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,020
Take the official seal. Give it to him.

232
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,780
Gan Yang.

233
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,420
Go.

234
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,180
Gan Yang, are you crazy?

235
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,020
I'll leave alone all this mess.

236
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,260
Let it be.

237
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,700
You'll never live up to your mom!

238
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,900
My mom didn't want me to handle this.

239
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,020
You won't solve this, right?

240
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,420
OK, I won't either.

241
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,260
Kunliang.

242
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,740
Don't spare him mercy this time.

243
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,500
This is settled, you know?

244
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,580
It's all done now.

245
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,780
Kunliang...

246
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,780
What are you doing, brat?

247
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
What do you want to do?

248
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,580
Aren't you quite agile?

249
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,580
Even faster than my second uncle.

250
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,780
It turns out you're pretending.

251
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,500
Fine.

252
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,140
You guys trick me together, right?

253
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,820
You did so many things

254
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,460
just for money, didn't you?

255
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,620
Name a price.

256
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,940
How much can we buy your equity?

257
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,580
You want to force me out, right?

258
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,340
It's not that easy.

259
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,940
It's okay if you don't agree.

260
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,860
I'll see you at the police station.

261
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,220
I've checked.

262
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,900
Forge evidence to falsely accuse others

263
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,100
will lead to criminal charges.

264
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,260
So you can choose.

265
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,900
Do you want money

266
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,980
or go back to prison
for a few more years?

267
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,180
Kunliang.

268
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,780
Even if the lousy company
gets the official seal,

269
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,300
they may not be able
to make money in the market.

270
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,660
Why don't we take the money and leave?

271
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,020
Brat.

272
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,300
You win.

273
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,580
Ten million, and we are even.

274
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,020
Gan Kunliang.

275
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,900
You're taking advantage
of our misfortune!

276
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,780
Don't you know the factory's situation?

277
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,980
Where can we get ten million?

278
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,540
The factory doesn't have that much.

279
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,260
I know.

280
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,940
But he has.

281
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,140
I believe Ms. Liu

282
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,220
must have left a way out
for her own son.

283
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,860
Have you lost your conscience?

284
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,340
Isn't he your son?

285
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,420
Right, he is my own son!

286
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,100
But he has never

287
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,580
kept me in his heart!

288
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,980
You can force me out.

289
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,220
But you must pay the price.

290
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:00,980
Ten million.

291
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,420
Deal.

292
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,620
But mark my words.

293
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,780
From now on,

294
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,380
there are no more ties

295
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,780
between you and us,

296
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,220
Yongjuan Shoes.

297
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,620
Fine.

298
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,180
The property you asked me
to deal with before

299
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,860
were sold at a total of 39.6 million.

300
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,260
Part of it was paid back to the bank.

301
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,900
Some urgent debts were also paid off.

302
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,460
There are 9.37 million left now.

303
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,860
Yang, how about...

304
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,140
Mei, I know what you want to say.

305
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,060
Gan Kunliang is a poisonous tumor.

306
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,220
Keeping him here
will never benefit the company.

307
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,660
We might as well give him some money
and let him quit.

308
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,620
But...

309
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,820
I'll find a way with the money.

310
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,980
Mei, thanks for the hard work.

311
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,980
Go back early and rest.

312
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,500
You should rest early, too.

313
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,380
Gan Yang.

314
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,620
Chenxi, you're still here.

315
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,060
This is the pocket money I saved.

316
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,540
You can take it for emergency first.

317
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:03,980
No way.

318
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,020
You've helped me enough.

319
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,220
I can't take the money.

320
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,180
Just take it as a loan for me.

321
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,060
Gan Kunliang asks for ten million
the day after tomorrow.

322
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,660
Mei said there wasn't enough money
in the company's account.

323
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,380
Where can you get the money
in such a short time?

324
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,460
Mei helped me

325
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,820
sell ​​all the properties under my name.

326
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,260
I'll receive the money recently.

327
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,460
Chenxi.

328
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,740
Help me sell this tomorrow.

329
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,300
What's this?

330
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,620
I planned to keep it
for a proposal to Ding Zhitong.

331
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,900
But now it's useless.

332
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,380
Sell ​​it for me.

333
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,580
I used to tell you

334
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,460
that health is the capital
of all matters.

335
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,620
It was not until then did I realize

336
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,060
that in desperate situations,

337
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,660
one cares the least about their body.

338
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,900
And then?

339
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,420
Gan Kunliang's matter has been resolved.

340
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,220
But we still didn't get enough money.

341
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,740
At that time, I went
to dinner parties every day,

342
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,900
drinking and eating
with all kinds of people.

343
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,500
Finally, in October, 2018,

344
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,140
there was a turnaround.

345
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,820
Good.

346
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,460
Good.

347
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,500
Young man, you are straightforward.

348
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,020
You feel like your mother back then.

349
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,860
You flattered me.

350
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,140
Gan.

351
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,500
Is your family all right recently?

352
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,140
Thank you for your care.

353
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,420
Everything went well.

354
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,580
Mr. Zhang, why do you whisper to Gan?

355
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,580
You can't just let Gan

356
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,380
take good orders alone.

357
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,300
That's it.

358
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,260
Wan is joking with me again.

359
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,500
I have never forgotten you
when there are orders.

360
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,260
- Oh, you...
- Right.

361
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,500
All of us here rely on you.

362
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,500
Guys, am I right?

363
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,140
Mr. Wang, you are right.

364
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,220
Enough of the praise.

365
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,180
Today, I really have an order.

366
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,500
I just wonder
if you are bold enough to take it.

367
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,980
A new upper material
was released recently.

368
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,020
But the foundries are required
to buy the machines,

369
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,300
which should be exclusive
for the material.

370
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,860
What is such a delicate material?

371
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,380
Can it be promoted
on a large scale in the future?

372
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,180
I can't guarantee this.

374
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,220

whether to take it or not.

If you ask me,

380
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,980

But there is bad news.

410
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,340
To produce it,
special machines must be used.

411
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,140
Currently, I haven't found any method

412

to produce it with existing machines.

413
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,620
But this type of shoe

414
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,260
is technically innovative indeed.

415

and most durable running shoes

is our goal.

418
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,340
But the technological advancement
of a pair of shoes

419
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,420
doesn't necessarily mean
success in the market.

420
