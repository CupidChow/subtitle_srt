00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,180
Got it.

189
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,100
Mr. Gan.

190
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,540
Just send me the financial statements

191
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,500
for the past three years.

192
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,060
Mr. Gan.

193
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Alright, cake time!

194
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,500
Really?

195
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,060
Thanks.

196
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,300
And here's some coffee.

197
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
- And these.
- Thanks.

198
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,260
- And these egg tarts.
- Thank you.

199
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,140
Here, take this.

200
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,580
It looks good.

201
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,900
It's insanely hard to get.

202
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,980
Do you want to try this?

203
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,980
I'd rather have that.

204
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,060
Here, take this one.

205
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,340
This rainbow one looks prettier.

206
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,180
Agreed. It does look good.

207
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,820
Tong, want some coffee?

208
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,540
Who ordered all this?

209
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,660
Mr. Gan did.

210
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
I remember this pastry

211
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,900
is only available in Xujiahui.

212
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,940
You can't order it here.

213
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,900
I heard from the Training Box people

214
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,900
that Mr. Gan rarely comes to this floor.

215
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,740
Why is he suddenly working here?

216
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,900
Probably for due diligence.

217
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,980
I think it's for Tong.

218
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,260
Don't say that.

219
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,060
Not enough work to keep you busy?

220
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,380
Still have time for gossip?

221
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,420
In that case,

222
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,700
give me
the Training Box's revenue report

223
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,580
before tomorrow. I'll review it.

224
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,460
Tong, have mercy.

225
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,180
Get back to work.

After all these years,

228
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,100
your taste hasn't changed.

229
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,380
You still like cakes from that place.

230
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,460
I was just hungry.

231
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,380
Mr. Gan, don't read too much into it.

232
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,520
[Tong]

233
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,500
I'm glad you're back...

234
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,900
to work on this project.

235
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,260
I'm only back

236
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,580
to wrap things up properly.

237
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,540
I'll say it again,

238
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,020
there's no chance for us.

239
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,580
We're just friends.

Just friends.

241
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,100
Hey, my friend,

242
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,380
there's a restaurant near Yishan Road
that serves

243
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,500
amazing bamboo shoot soup with pork.

244
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,820
Want to go together tonight?

245

But we're in a hurry...

254
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,060
No overtime tonight.

Guys,

256
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,020
sorry about that.

257
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,420
We don't encourage overtime here.

258
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,340
In response to the national call,

259
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,580
we're saving energy.

260
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,100
Lights out.

261
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,300
Xu Chenxi, I heard something funny.

262
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,380
Gan Yang actually

263
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,860
said no to overtime

264
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,220
and that we should
respond to the national call.

265
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,660
Everyone, save your work

266
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,740
and get some rest early.

267

272
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,380
I'm fine.

273
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,860
Did you sprain your ankle?

274
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,380
No.

275
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,020

No need to be so precise.

With the spray painting,

300
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,860

314
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,260
And you're skipping meals?

315
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,820

There's a supermarket just ahead
on the left.

321

We can buy some food there.

322
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:36,900
Alright.

323
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,860
Does your stomach still hurt?

324
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,580
How about getting some bread?

325
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,900
Don't bother.

326
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,380
I'm feeling better.

327
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,180
Really?

328
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,460
Then...

329
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,180
Well, since we're here,

330
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,060
shall we buy something?

331
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
I'll grab some groceries

332
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,660
and cook at home.

333
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,540
You barely ate either.

334
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,900
Would you like to join me?

335
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,980
One of these.

336
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,620
And this one.

337
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,420
This too. Do you need anything else?

338
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,540
- I don't need anything...
- Out of milk, right?

339
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,740
Let me check. Okay.

340
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,020
- I still have some at...
- Let's get two.

341
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,180
Let's get three.

342
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,700
Do you want anything else?

343
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,100
No, I'm good.

344
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,060
Let's check that aisle.

345
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,740
I was thinking
that after paying off the debts,

346
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,820
I want to

347
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,260
eat with you, run with you,

348
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,980
watch movies with you,
and enjoy life with you.

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,340
Tong,

350
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,460
where's the oyster sauce?

351
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,340
Should be on the right side
of the fridge. Check there.

352
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,900
I'll get it.

353
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:25,980
Gan Yang.

354
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,660
I feel like you tricked me.

355
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,980
What did I trick you out of?

356
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,620
First you faked a stomachache
to get in my car,

357
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,100
then refused to go to the hospital,

358
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,100
insisted on the supermarket,

359
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,180
and ended up making me
buy all this stuff.

360
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,220
That's unfair.

361
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,460
You picked every single item yourself.

362
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,460
Remember?

363
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,260
You wanted ten packs of instant noodles.

364
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,180
I talked you out of it.

365
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,060
I mean you lured me into buying so much

366
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,020
that I can't carry it alone.

367
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:51,980
So when we got downstairs,

368
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,220
you said I couldn't carry it all,

369
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,460
and insisted on helping me bring it up.

370
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,620
It's normal for me
to help you with that.

371
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,180
You're welcome.

372
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,300
And then you started having
stomachaches again at the door,

373
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,900
and insisted on making noodles.

374
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,540
I really thought you wanted to
have noodles.

375
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,420
Now look,

376
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,460
you're making soup.

377
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,460
I'm talking to you.

378
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,740
It's a bit bland.

379
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,020
You know

380
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,980
how particular I am about food.

381
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,300
Homemade noodles deserve homemade soup.

382
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,780
Makes perfect sense, right?

383
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:27,900
Yeah.

384
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,620
Everything makes sense.

385
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,100
Then kicking out a liar like you

386
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,900
also makes sense.

387
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,340
Stop chopping.

388
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,620
- Go away.
- Tong.

389
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,700
- Out.
- Tong.

390
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,340
Tong.

391
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,660
Get out or I'm calling the police.

392
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,020
Tong.

393
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:44,860
- Bye.
- Tong.

394
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,220
Tong.

395
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,380
I haven't even changed my shoes.

396
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,940
And I'm wearing your apron.

397
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,700
Your shoes.

398
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,460
Give me back my apron.

399
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:55,820
Okay.

400
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,460
Tong.

401
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,860
The soup needs ten more minutes.

402
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,220
You bought so many things at once.

403
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,220
Refrigerate what you can't finish,

404
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,060
especially the veggies...

405
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,900
I know.

406
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,780
Just go.

407
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,300
Tong,

408
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,820
are you really not inviting me back
for a bite?

409
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,820
I put work into this meal, you know.

410
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,620
No way.

411
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,540
You wish.

412
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,660
Go away.

413
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,860
Tong.

414
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,500
I've been waiting for so many years.

415
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,940
One meal won't make a difference.

416
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,700
Come on, Gan Yang, you...

417
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,460
What Gan Yang?

418
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,780
It smells so good.

419
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,700
So many dishes.

420
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,260
Gan Yang made these?

421
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,860
You brought wine?

422
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,660
What did Deng Boting do to upset you?

423
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,060
No idea what's gotten into him.

424
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,700
He already agreed
to the division of property,

425
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,700
but now he suddenly wants
an extra ten million.

426
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,460
Fine.

427
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,420
Ten million it is.

428
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,140
Don't you want to
think about it some more? This is huge.

429
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,860
You're right about one thing.

430
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,100
I do love my career
more than I love you.

431
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,460
Take the ten million

432
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,620
and run off with the mistress.

433
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,300
Stay out of my sight.

434
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,020
I've already broken up with her.

435
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,340
I couldn't care less about you two.

436
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,660
Ten million isn't enough.

437
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,820
I want twenty million.

438
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,460
Deng Boting,

439
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,340
you think this is a flea market?

440
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,660
Since when do we negotiate like this?

441
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,260
I don't want a divorce anymore.

442
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,580
Let's get back together.

443
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,660
Think about the time

444
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,700
we built Matching in college...

445
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,460
You were the one who forgot that.

446
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,660
Reconciliation is off the table.

447
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,820
Alright then.

448
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,420
Then at least think about our daughter.

449
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,500
She needs her father.

450
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,620
Where was that thought
when you were cheating?

451
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,260
Deng Boting,

452
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,940
don't make me despise you.

453
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,780
Twenty million.

454
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,820
Or I'm not signing.

455
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,620
You know what?

456
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,420
He dared to use Matching and Yulin
to threaten me.

457
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,700
He knows they're your weak spots.

458
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,820
And Matching and Yulin

459
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,300
were created by both of you.

460
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,500
What was he thinking before?

461
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,700
Now that we're getting a divorce,

462
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,740
he suddenly wants to cherish them.

463
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:21,980
Exactly.

464
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,340
People only feel regret
after losing something.

465
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,820
What was he thinking before?

466
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
What about you and Gan Yang?

467
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,220
What's the story there?

468
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,620
Bankruptcy.

469
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,500
Debt. Restricted spending.

470
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,420
Not everyone can handle
that kind of pressure.

471
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,820
And back then,

472
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,740
he was facing potential jail time.

473
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,660
Think about it.

474
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,380
With your personality,

475
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,580
what would you choose?

476
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,660
I would face it with him.

477
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,460
But who knows if we'd have ended up
supporting each other

478
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,340
or just making each other miserable.

479
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,020
I might've actually lost my mind.

480
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,700
So now that you're back...

481
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,260
Same thought as before.

482
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,020
I'll wrap up this project and leave.

483
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,340
I'm almost thirty.

484
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,380
There's more to life

485
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,140
than romance.

486
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,420
Once Gan Yang

487
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,540
realizes I'm not reciprocating,

488
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,780
he'll give up pursuing me.

489
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,520
[Gan Yang]

490
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,680
[Made noodles the way you taught me.
Still just as good.]

491
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,820
You can start eating

492
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,540
when the cheese melts.

493
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,140
I specially developed this method.

494
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,700
Try it.

495
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,580
Then I'll try it.

496
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,020
Be happy.

497
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,340
Ding Zhitong.

498
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,100
What a coincidence.

499
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,140
You also go for night runs?

500
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,060
Yeah.

501
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Just started recently.

502
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,460
Want to join me?

503
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,060
Sure.

504
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,580
I've never told you

505
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,180
what I do.

506
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,340
Actually, I...

507
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,500
What's wrong?

508
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,300
That's Mr. Lin from Qidu Tech.

509
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,540
My boss has always wanted to meet him.

510
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,420
Can't believe I just ran into him here.

511
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,620
Should we go say hi?

512
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,740
Dressed like this to say hi?

513
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,060
And that's obviously a private club.

514
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,020
We can't just walk in.

515
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,740
Let's give it a shot.

516
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:10,820
Thank you.

517
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,540
See?

518
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,860
We're in.

519
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,100
Hand over
the real estate project entirely

520
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,380
to Mr. Zhang.

521
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,180
It's beneficial for both them and us.

522
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,060
A win-win situation.

523
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,580
- Right?
- Sure, no problem.

524
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:30,940
Whoa, look who's here.

525
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,620
To what do we owe the pleasure?

526
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,380
Just out running with a friend
and passed by.

527
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,140
This is my friend, Ding Zhitong,

528
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,020
the best manager at Gutong Securities.

529
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,180
I'm Ding Zhitong from Gutong Securities.

530
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,300
Mr. Wang's friend

531
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,740
looks young and promising.

532
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,340
Mr. Wang,

533
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,300
you brought a friend?

534
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,140
Mr. Wang.

535
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,540
This is Mr. Zhang from Youyi.

536
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,060
And this is Mr. Lin from Qidu.

537
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,260
They're both big shots
who usually keep a low profile.

538
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,380
Is he

539
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,340
Wang Sen?

540
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,660
Send it to me later.

541
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,500
Sure, thank you.
Make sure to check it out.

542
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,500
So if I'm not mistaken,

543
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,620
Mr. Wang, you must have investigated

544
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,860
my history with Gan Yang

545
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,180
before assigning me
to the Training Box project.

546
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
I was right about you.

547
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,300
You're very smart.

548
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,580
And our first chance meeting
was staged too, right?

549
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,100
I admit, at first,

550
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,380
I wanted to take advantage
of your connection with Gan Yang.

551
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,580
But then I realized

552
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,180
you're even smarter and more capable
than I thought.

553
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,780
So, I believed that even
without your connection to Gan Yang,

554
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,620
you could still secure
the Training Box project.

555
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,700
Flattered you think so highly of me.

556
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,660
Actually, I wanted to
confess my identity to you today.

557
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,660
I sincerely want to be friends with you.

558
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,740
So,

559
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,460
is there anything else
you've lied to me about?

560
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:53,980
Nothing.

561
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,860
Thanks for the honesty.

562
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,980
But if there's a next time,

563
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,340
you can only be my client,

564
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,300
not my friend.

565
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,540
I don't think

566
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,300
anyone has dared to talk
to me like this in years.

567
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,420
But anyway,

568
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,940
thank you for helping me

569
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,140
meet so many potential clients tonight.

570
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,460
Don't mention it.

571
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,340
Then I'll be going.

572
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,540
Why aren't you asleep yet?

573
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,760
[Gan Yang]

574
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,340
Hello?

575
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,060
Why aren't you asleep?

576
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,140
Why did you send those?

577
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,220
Even though I got full marks
in advanced mathematics in college,

578
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,580
this stuff still puts me to sleep.

579
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,980
So I sent it to you to see

580
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,380
if it could help you too.

581
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,340
Sorry.

582
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,820
I also got full marks in it.

583
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,980
This stuff gets me too excited

584
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,140
to sleep.

585
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,380
Then maybe
an English original philosophy book

586
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,380
can put you to sleep.

587
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,780
Hold on.

588
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,860
You can go to bed. Don't worry about me.

589
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,420
I can't sleep either.

590
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,020
And

591
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,700
since I'm the one who kept you up...

592
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,380
I should take responsibility.

593
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,580
Here we go.

594
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,060
Chapter One.

595
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,780
The Rise of Greek Civilization.

596
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,260
In all history,

597
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,540
nothing is so surprising
or so difficult to account for

598
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,700
as the sudden rise
of civilization in Greece.

599
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,940
Much of what makes civilization

600
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,820
had already existed

601
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,940
for thousands of years in Egypt,

602
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,460
and had spread thence
to neighboring countries.

603
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,340
What they achieved in art and literature

604
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,420
is familiar to everybody,

605
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,260
but what they did
in the purely intellectual realm

606
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,660
is even more exceptional.

607
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,060
Good morning.

608
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,540
Morning.

609
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,660
I brought you doufunao
and pan-fried jiaozi from Baozheng Road.

610
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,900
Your old favorites.

611
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,740
No free lunches.

612
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,740
You should eat them yourself.

613
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,300
Actually,

614
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,540
I want to hitch a ride with you
to the office.

615
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,660
We're going the same way.

616
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,340
Give me a lift, please?

617
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,100
Sure, then let's finish eating
and get in the car.

618
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,580
Alright.

619
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,900
I'll go get some tissues from the car.

620
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,620
Okay.

621
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,580
Gan Yang.

622
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,740
Bye.

Tong,

626
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,820
you looked so adorable just now.

627
