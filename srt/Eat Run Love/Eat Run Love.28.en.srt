00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
I will bring LT back to Shanghai!

228
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,980
Ms. Qin,

229
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,580
you got "promoted" pretty fast, huh?

230
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,380
We'll treat you to dinner
when you're back in Shanghai.

231
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,580
Sure.

232
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,580
You and Gan Yang better hurry up.

233
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,300
Actually, we're back together.

234
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Really?

235
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,180
It's only right for you two
to be like this.

236
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,100
Make sure you're happy this time.

237
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,420
Don't worry. I will.

238
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,140
But

239
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,060
speaking of Gan Yang, I'm annoyed.

240
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,860
Why?

241
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,180
No idea

242
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,340
what toxic motivational nonsense

243
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,500
he's posting.

244
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,540
Qin Chang saw them

245
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,940
and now drags me
to go running every day.

246
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,500
- Wait.
- I'm exhausted.

247
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,020
Running is good for you.

248
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,580
And Mr. Qin is the one

249
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,740
making you run.

250
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,860
Why blame Gan Yang?

251
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,620
Since when did you
become this traitorous?

252
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,980
Now you're speaking up for him

253
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,700
and leaving me behind?

254
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,620
If only it were that simple.

255
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,860
It would be even more annoying

256
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,460
if he just sent running shoes to us.

257
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,740
That's something he would do.

258
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,020
It seems like he's back.

259
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,420
Don't hang up then.

260
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,020
I'll make him
apologize to you in person.

261
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,420
No.

262
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,620
I don't want to see him.

263
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,220
I'm hanging up.

264
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,620
In a minute.

265
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,620
You...

266
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,780
You must be Tong.

267
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,500
Yes.

268
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,460
You're Ms. Liu, right?

269
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,020
Yes, I'm Yang's mother.

270
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,940
Take a look at this.

271
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,620
Ms. Xu.

272
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,060
Why are you here?

273
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,260
Duh.

274
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,180
Where else would I be during work hours?

275
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,820
But I just ran into your mother

276
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,980
on my way here.

277
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,140
She said she was going to your place.

278
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,100
Thought you were introducing
Ding Zhitong to your mother.

279
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
You saw my mom?

280
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,340
Yeah. Why would I lie?

281
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,420
Looks like they're really meeting
the parents now.

282
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,340
They're meeting the parents.

283
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,700
What about us?

284
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,340
My parents want to meet you.

285
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,180
[My baby's 100th day]
His eyes were so big

286
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,140
even when he was this small?

287
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,220
Look, they're like black grapes.

288
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,140
Every time we went out,

289
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,820
people thought he was a girl.

290
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,380
Funny, right?

291
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,340
This was him in fifth grade.

292
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,740
He participated in a 5,000-meter race

293
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,140
and won the championship.

294
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,300
He loved running even back then?

295
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,260
He was always athletic.

296
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,500
He still is.

297
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,700
This was him at sixteen.

298
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,260
Right after his senior high school
entrance examination.

299
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,300
Oh, you know,

300
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,260
time really flies.

301
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,020
Oh,

302
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,620
let me show you this.

303
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,620
Look.

304
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,060
This is the stuffed toy I bought for him

305
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,220
when he was born.

306
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,340
He loved it.

307
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,340
He had to hold it like this

308
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,460
every night to fall asleep.

309
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,740
Once, I took him out

310
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,540
and forgot to bring this puppy,

311
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,500
and he

312
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,900
cried all night.

313
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,140
Neither of us

314
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,900
got any sleep.

315
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,460
Total nightmare.

316
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:16,980
Ms. Liu,

317
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,660
I had the exact same stuffed toy

318
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,100
when I was little.

319
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,580
Really?

320
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,940
Then you two are really meant to be.

321
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,700
You even like the same things.

322
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,700
Tong,

323
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,580
to be honest...

324
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,980
I used to urge Yang to get married.

325
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,900
I even had relatives and friends

326
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,860
set him up on blind dates.

327
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,820
But every time, he would make trouble.

328
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,860
Once, he even

329
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,380
went on six blind dates in one day.

330
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,940
Six?

331
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,460
What happened after?

332
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,220
Yang, perfect timing.

333
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,700
I was just talking about you with Tong.

334
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,300
Mom, why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

335
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,860
You came just in time.

336
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,900
Or were you eavesdropping outside

337
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,580
and only came in
when you heard "blind dates"?

338
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,780
Yang,

339
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,620
now that I've met Tong,

340
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,660
I understand why you never

341
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,460
cooperated with the blind dates.

342
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,340
Mom, you should've led with that.

343
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,740
You scared me.

344
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,820
Tong,

345
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
this is the first time
Yang has brought a girl home.

346
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,660
I'm so happy and excited,

347
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,700
so I might have said a lot.

348
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,380
If I said anything inappropriate,

349
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,100
please don't take it to heart.

350
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,700
Ms. Liu, I'm really glad

351
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,900
you told me so much.

352
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,300
Tong.

353
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,220
Yang.

354
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,660
Mom.

355
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,260
After seven years apart,

356
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,740
you two are back together.

357
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,100
I'm really happy for you.

358
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,340
Tong,

359
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,460
I'm entrusting Yang to you.

360
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,500
If he ever upsets you,

361
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,980
just tell me.

362
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,620
I'll deal with him.

363
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,460
Alright.

364
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,260
Don't you dare upset me.

365
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,620
I won't.

366
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,740
Honestly, if I were an investor,

367
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,580
I'd invest in LT too.

368
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,140
Oh?

369
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,220
Aside from the clear profit model

370
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,860
and impressive past achievements,

371
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,660
just look at how united your team is.

372
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,020
That's the most precious thing.

373
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,180
You're all on the same page.

374
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,620

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,420
You'd let me sleep on the streets?

Of course not.

455

You did.

00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,580
Before, I thought making money
was the most important thing,

465
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,860
because I thought having money
would definitely bring happiness.

you love.

00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,740
I'm begging you.

564
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,020
No matter what,

565
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,620
please save Training Box.

566
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,780
Please.

567
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,740
Gan Yang?

568
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,820
Yuan Chao,

569
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,620
Training Box was beyond saving long ago.

570
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,980
Go turn yourself in.

571
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,860
You have to take responsibility...

572
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,900
for your mistakes.

573
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,540
A week later,

574
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,260
Training Box filed
for bankruptcy liquidation.

575
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,460
Yuan Chao turned himself in

576
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,460
and was sentenced
to five years in prison

577
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,340
for infringing on trade secrets.

578
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,300
Thank you, everyone.

579
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,100
I hereby announce

580
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,940
that Ding Qin Investment Co., Ltd.

581
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,260
is officially established today!

582
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,160
[Ding Qin Investment Co., Ltd.
is officially established]

583
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,820
Remember what you want to
say to Ms. Ding?

584
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,380
Ms. Ding,

585
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,340
this is for you.

586
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,580
Thank you, Yulin.

587
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,460
Wishing Ms. Ding and Mr. Qin

588
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,180
booming business

589
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,740
and prosperity!

590
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,380
Good girl.

591
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,500
Thank you, Yulin.

592
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,180
Congratulations, Ms. Ding.

593
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,300
Thank you, Mr. Gan.

594
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,660
Ding Zhitong.

595
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,580
Let's go somewhere

596
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,580
to celebrate later.

597
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,500
I know a great place.

598
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,580
I'll send you the details.

599
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,300
Good job.

600
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,540
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

601
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,060
Congratulations.

602
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,260
You won.

603
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,300
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

604
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,220
Hope we'll have another chance
to work together.

605
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,180
Looking forward to it.

606
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,300
Absolutely.

607
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,020
Bye.

608
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,820
Bye.

609
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,820
Gan Yang,

610
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,580
your dream is finally coming true.

611
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,980
Now more and more people

612
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,460
are falling in love with running
because of your shoes.

613
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,460
Congratulations.

614
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,020
But where I am today

615
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,940
came at the cost of your career dreams.

616
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,420
You could've been

617
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,700
Gutong's MD by now.

618
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,500
That's not it.

619
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,620
Helping you achieve your dream

620
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,820
showed me what I really want.

621
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,740
I want to help those with dreams

622
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,860
realize them.

623
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,900
I guess that's why
I started Ding Qin Investment.

624
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:13,940
Tong,

625
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,060
I've always regretted it.

626
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,460
If I hadn't broken up with you,

627
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,020
if we had stayed together,

628
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,100
maybe things
would've turned out the same.

629
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,980
They wouldn't have.

630
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,140
Now I can stand beside you
as your equal.

631
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,540
From now on,
we'll move forward together.

632
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,780
Tong,

633
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:44,940
wait for me.

634
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,860
Wait for me!

635
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,180
Where are you going?

636
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,780
Tong.

637
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,460
Why are you all here?

638
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,700
To go running together.

639
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,740
Ding Zhitong.

640
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,220
And you guys too?

641
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,900
Tong.

642
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,500
Jiaxin?

643
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,300
Why is everyone here?

644
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,220
What's going on?

645
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,540
Since when do you all run?

646
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,660
Of course, we have to.

647
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,140
Exhausted?

648
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,220
Yes.

649
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,740
Right?

650
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,940
Where did you go?

651
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,700
Tong.

652
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,780
Do you remember what I promised you?

653
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
What?

654
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,700
Will you marry me?

655
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,060
I do.

656
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,500
Let's give a warm round of applause

657
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,620
to welcome the bride!

658
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,740
Tong.

659
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:42,980
Will you...?

660
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,140
Will you run with me?

661
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,420
Tong.

662
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:01,980
Do you remember

663
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,180
when we first met?

664
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,420
I was clueless back then.

665
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,220
All I could do was ask you
over and over again

666
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,260
if you would run with me.

667
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,580
Later, we got together.

668
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,300
But you had to go to Shanghai for work.

669
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,580
You were worried

670
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,900
that the distance would break us.

671
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,180
But we held on.

672
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,980
I know

673
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,300
we've been through a lot these years.

674
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,460
We almost drifted apart.

675
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,220
But thankfully,

676
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,340
here we are.

677
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,540
Meeting you

678
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,980
and being with you

679
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,940
is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

680
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,860
Gan Yang,

681
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,260
before I met you,

682
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,060
I didn't know how to live properly.

683
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,180
I didn't know
how to take care of myself,

684
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,660
let alone take care of others.

685
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,980
You patiently taught me

686
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,660
how to love myself,

687
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,140
love others,

688
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,500
and be loved in return.

689
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,220
