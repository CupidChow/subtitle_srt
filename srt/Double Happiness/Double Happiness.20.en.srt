Sir.

17
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,666
Someone picked up the phone.

18
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:48,865
What did they say?

19
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:51,546
It's a woman.

20
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:52,865
She said,

21
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:54,065
"Song, the Big Fool!"

22
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:55,026

Xiaoxiao,

00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:20,466
I love you.

34
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:22,106
I'm coming right now.

35
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,545
Xiaoxiao, where are you?

36
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,305
I'm coming right now.

37
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:31,465
I'm getting married.

38
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:38,385
I can't believe you.

39
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:40,105
Are you giving me a heart attack?

40
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:41,586
Before, I was in the dark.

41
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,625
I didn't even know

42
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:43,546
who Mei Chengyi was.

43
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:45,425
You said you'd propose and remarry him.

44
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:46,187
I was scared

45
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,706
and took some

46
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:48,946
heart condition meds.

47
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:50,386
Now I've seen him

48
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:51,665
and think he's good.

49
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:52,506
I thought you two

50
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:53,785
had a serious relationship,

51
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:54,945
and you'd settle down

52
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:55,707
within a year

53
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:56,866
if it went on smoothly.

54
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:57,946
Who would have thought

55
00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:59,266
you'd make such a fuss?

56
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,266
Family partnership system?

57
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:02,665
Do you know what it is?

58
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:04,106
Illegal cohabitation.

59
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:04,866
You...

60
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:05,867
If that young man

61
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:06,945
finds out you

62
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,185
are so quirky,

63
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:09,706
he'll definitely run away.

64
00:03:09,786 --> 00:03:10,905
What will you do then?

65
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,826
If he runs, so be it.

66
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:14,585
I have plenty of suitors.

67
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:16,186
At worst, I'll be with Li Xiaoxiao.

68
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,266
You'll be...

69
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,586
Be with Li Xiaoxiao

70
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,666
for a lifetime.

71
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:22,226
Stop hitting me.

72
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,745
You've asked for this.

73
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,946
You always do foolish things.

74
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,187
If you're not serious,

75
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,585
break up now.

76
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:29,505
I won't.

77
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,345
Or I'll lose such a handsome boyfriend.

78
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:32,066
You...

79
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:33,585
You are so infatuated.

80
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:36,986
Why bother?

81
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:10,808
(Kitten)

82
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:17,818
Hello, honey.

83
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:19,178
Where are you?

84
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:24,018
In the garage.

85
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:24,938
Don't move.

86
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:26,018
Don't move the car.

87
00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:26,979
My friend and I

88
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,537
are shopping near your company.

89
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:29,858
I got a call from Dad.

90
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:30,858
You can't drive now.

91
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:31,737
Let me drive.

92
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,138
Tell me where you are.

93
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:34,458
I'm downstairs.

94
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:36,178
In the garage downstairs.

95
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:36,938
Okay.

96
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:37,859
Honey, don't move.

97
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:38,897
Don't move. I'll drive.

98
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:39,977
Wait for me there.

99
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:24,537
Sir, please hurry up.

100
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:25,697
While ensuring safety,

101
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:26,697
let's go faster, okay?

102
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:27,777
Alright.

103
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:45,018
Honey.

104
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:54,498
I'll accompany you.

105
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,458
Honey.

106
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:01,897
Chengyi, right?

107
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:03,498
Well,

108
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,577
yes, ma'am.

109
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,379
No,

110
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,018
Ms... Ms. Lili.

111
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:08,137
It's your first visit.

112
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:09,538
I just bought some groceries.

113
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:11,098
Let's have lunch at home.

114
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:12,818
I'll make some home-cooked dishes. Okay?

115
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:14,498
Sure.

116
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:15,618
How about I cook?

117
00:07:15,698 --> 00:07:16,577
I'm good at cooking.

118
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:17,257
No.

119
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:17,979
You're a guest.

120
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,818
How can I let you do the work?

121
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:20,739
I actually came

122
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,217
to apologize.

123
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:23,179
Let me do something.

124
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,337
Or I won't feel at ease.

125
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:25,299
Just let him cook.

126
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,498
He's great at cooking.

127
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:27,098
Alright.

128
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:28,178
You two take a rest.

129
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:31,417
Let's go.

130
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,818
Let's sit down.

131
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,178
Don't bother him later.

132
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:36,857
Or else we won't have dinner.

133
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,458
Okay.

134
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:43,138
Let me help you.

135
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,059
Ms. Lili

136
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,178
is so strict with you.

137
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,297
How come you've become a female lecher?

138
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,537
Where did she hit you?

139
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,138
Rub it.

140
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:56,578
She should've hit harder.

141
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:58,337
I'm great at saying sorry

142
00:07:58,417 --> 00:07:59,417
but never at changing.

143
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:00,658
Alright.

144
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:01,817
Don't distract me.

145
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:02,739
If you stay here,

146
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,137
I don't know when we will get

147
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,017
to eat the dinner.

148
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:05,897
Leave.

149
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:06,977
Go accompany Ms. Lili.

150
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:08,458
I'll leave it to you.

151
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:10,138
Just go. Don't worry.

152
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:13,880
(Someone mentioned me)

153
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:20,440
(82 messages from 6 contacts)

154
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:27,097
Ms. Li.

155
00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:57,938
What do you think

156
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:59,137
is going on with Mei?

157
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:00,378
As a senior employee,

158
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,137
it's his first time being like this.

159
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:03,537
Ms. Li is so anxious

160
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:04,417
that she's fuming.

161
00:09:04,497 --> 00:09:05,497
How pitiful.

162
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:06,898
Given Mei's temper,

163
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,658
he wouldn't act like this easily.

164
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:10,138
He doesn't show up

165
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:11,898
or answer the bosses' calls.

166
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:13,379
Oh no.

167
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:14,938
I feel something big is happening.

168
00:09:15,497 --> 00:09:16,857
It's over.

169
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,418
But don't you guys feel

170
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:20,977
a strange sense of relief?

171
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:22,378
What relief?

172
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,738
As a silver-spoon kid intern,

173
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:24,537
what do you know?

174
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:25,578
Listen to me.

175
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:27,857
Gods clash, mortals suffer.

176
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:29,618
If you want to stay out of it,

177
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:30,379
don't hang around

178
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:31,938
Ms. Li's office.

179
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,538
Fair point.

180
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:35,938
Makes sense.

181
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:38,418
I'm offering 100 yuan.

182
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:39,538
Who will

183
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:41,098
deliver it to Ms. Li's office for me?

184
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:41,897
I'm not going.

185
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:42,818
- I...
- Goodman Jia.

186
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:44,137
Mr. Jia, Mr. Jia.

187
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,057
You're aged

188
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:46,137
and not in good health.

189
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,337
I'll go.

190
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:48,938
How is this related to health?

191
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:50,937
Who just said

192
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:52,418
not to hang around Ms. Li's office?

193
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:54,898
Ms. Li is indeed scarier,

194
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,818
but being poor is even scarier.

195
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:58,058
I'm going.

196
00:09:58,217 --> 00:09:58,777
I'm off.

197
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:01,337
If you ask me,
our team's values are rock solid.

198
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:02,618
This is really something.

199
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:03,338
Ms. Li,

200
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:04,418
someone is coming.

201
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,698
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

202
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:12,458
You can rest for a while.

203
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:14,978
I've called the doctor.

204
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:15,619
Mom is

205
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,057
in the ICU right now.

206
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:18,137
Many people have been

207
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:18,619
in ICU.

208
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:19,698
And many

209
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:20,898
have come out standing up.

210
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:22,538
Mom is blessed by the heavens.

211
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:27,818
Right, she'll be fine.

212
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:30,857
The doctor told me she has half a year.

213
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:33,497
I've been keeping her happy recently.

214
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:37,538
She'll be fine.

215
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,617
She'll definitely be fine.

216
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:41,498
Nothing will happen to him.

217
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:42,578
Yes.

218
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:47,418
Qian Hao,

219
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:48,178
how about

220
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:50,298
we call Dami and Xiaomi over too?

221
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:54,538
Yes.

222
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:57,298
My phone.

223
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:01,499
He's handsome,

224
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:02,658
and he does housework.

225
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:05,737
Just these two aspects
will make him qualified.

226
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,578
I'm just afraid
that he's being too handsome.

227
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:10,938
He might become the second Qian Hao.

228
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:16,377
The real Qian Hao is calling.

229
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:19,257
He should have stayed abroad.

230
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:20,777
Now that he's back,

231
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:22,737
he's like a fly
annoying you every now and then.

232
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:23,977
It's quite annoying.

233
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:25,257
Don't answer his call.

234
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:26,938
Forget it, I'll answer it.

235
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:28,378
At the class reunion earlier,

236
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,657
I bumped into his car.

237
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:30,938
What if it's about that?

238
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,337
What's the matter?

239
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:37,217
Kaixin.

240
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:37,819
Kaixin,

241
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,097
my mom is in the ICU now.

242
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:40,499
Wasn't she

243
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:41,737
doing fine a few days ago?

244
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:43,137
What happened?

245
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:44,339
Qian Hao's mom

246
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:45,538
is in the ICU.

247
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:48,058
Actually, she was already

248
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:50,497
at the end of her strength.

249
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:52,257
She was in daily pain.

250
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,938
She was holding on.

251
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:57,857
Kaixin, can you...

252
00:11:58,497 --> 00:11:59,018
Can you

253
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:00,458
bring the kids to the hospital?

254
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:02,458
Send the address

255
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:03,538
and ward info to me.

256
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:05,257
It's the People's Hospital.

257
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,177
Head straight

258
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,257
to the ICU on arrival.

259
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:08,578
Thank you.

260
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:09,378
Thank you.

261
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,458
I will wait for you.

262
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:14,137
His mom is in ICU

263
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:15,217
and not doing well.

264
00:12:16,097 --> 00:12:16,658
Well,

265
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:17,937
I'll go pick up the kids first

266
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:19,177
to take them to the hospital.

267
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,218
I'll go pick up Xiaomi.

268
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:21,378
You go pick up Dami.

269
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,459
Forget about it. I'll go.

270
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:23,777
Let's not turn everything

271
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:24,657
upside down

272
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:25,737
over their family drama.

273
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:26,978
You're right.

274
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:28,177
That woman is a nuisance.

275
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:29,778
I really don't want to see her.

276
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,857
Then what about him?

277
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:33,617
I'll go tell him.

278
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:36,417
What?

279
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:37,497
Distracting me again?

280
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:39,538
We can't have this meal today.

281
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:41,378
My ex-husband called,

282
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,738
saying his mom is in the ICU.

283
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:43,498
He wants me

284
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:44,578
to take the kids over.

285
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:45,977
I have to pick them up now.

286
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:47,938
It's the right thing to do.

287
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:49,417
Your car is at the dealership.

288
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:50,258
I'll take a taxi

289
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:51,538
and accompany you.

290
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,378
Aren't you going to work today?

291
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,057
Well,

292
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:55,698
I'm like

293
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:56,459
a part

294
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:57,738
on a machine,

295
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,377
and no one knows how important it is.

296
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,858
But when it's missing,

297
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:02,338
it may show its value better.

298
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:03,418
Don't you agree?

299
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:04,938
Well,

300
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:06,297
it's late now.

301
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:07,377
Come on.

302
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:08,818
Try a bite first.

303
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:16,737
Amazing.

304
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:21,257
Qian Hao, slow down.

305
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:28,938
What's wrong with him?

306
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:40,338
Dad. Dad.

307
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:41,098
Where's my mom?

308
00:13:41,178 --> 00:13:42,017
What happened to her?

309
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:42,819
What's going on?

310
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,257
I don't know either.

311
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:45,578
She was fine.

312
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:47,098
She bought groceries this morning.

313
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:48,537
So I made her a dish.

314
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:50,497
She said the dish I made was not tasty.

315
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:52,657
Having said that, she still ate it.

316
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:54,458
Just when I was pouring her water,

317
00:13:54,538 --> 00:13:56,017
I heard plates and bowls behind me

318
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:57,098
clattering.

319
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:58,698
Then I saw she was on the ground.

320
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:00,137
Dad, you're a doctor.

321
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:01,938
What happened to my mom?

322
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,137
It's highly likely
that the tumor has ruptured,

323
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:10,217
causing hemorrhagic shock.

324
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,337
There might also be acidosis.

325
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:13,737
When she first arrived here,

326
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:14,538
she also had

327
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:16,257
a sudden stop
in breathing and heartbeat.

328
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,338
But don't worry.

329
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:20,058
The conclusion isn't out yet.

330
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:21,578
She's on a blood transfusion.

331
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:23,298
Don't worry.

332
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:27,458
Miss, what's wrong?

333
00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:28,537
Are you okay?

334
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,617
I'm fine.

335
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:30,937
Thank you.

336
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:31,458
Sure.

337
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,538
Be careful.

338
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:38,578
Doctor,

339
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:39,578
please save my mom.

340
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:40,297
Save her.

341
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:41,018
Calm down first.

342
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:42,057
Calm down first, okay?

343
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:42,858
Listen to me.

344
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:43,458
I'm sorry.

345
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:44,538
I'm sorry.

346
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,737
The patient's condition is now critical.

347
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:51,218
Let's first see if she

348
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:52,658
can get through tonight.

349
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:54,417
Also, I need to discuss

350
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:56,578
the necessity
of further treatment with you.

351
00:14:56,658 --> 00:14:57,977
If the treatment continues,

352
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,137
rescue measures will be

353
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:00,177
implemented one by one.

354
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:01,498
But during the procedure,

355
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:02,657
it may lead to respiratory

356
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:03,818
and cardiac arrest

357
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:04,898
and damage to the airway.

358
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,497
Even if she is resuscitated,

359
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:08,458
as you know,

360
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:09,459
her cancer

361
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:10,777
is in the terminal stage.

362
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:11,937
The situation

363
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:13,218
will likely repeat soon.

364
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:14,017
You know

365
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:14,619
the costs

366
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:15,738
of ICU treatment.

367
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:16,498
Ordinary families

368
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:17,578
can't bear it.

369
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:18,857
So you should

370
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:21,257
think about it carefully.

371
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,217
Honey,

372
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,378
the doctor is right.

373
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,178
Mom's illness...

374
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:32,778
Shut up, Hu Xiaojiao!

375
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:35,458
You're just hoping for my mom to die.

376
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:36,177
Listen to me.

377
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:36,978
I put up with you

378
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:37,979
all because of my mom.

379
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:39,257
You'd better pray for her

380
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:40,099
to be alright.

381
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,458
Otherwise, just you wait,

382
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:42,138
Hu Xiaojiao.

383
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:43,337
Qian Hao, have you gone mad?

384
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:45,698
How can you speak to her like that?

385
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:09,897
We're here.

386
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:10,499
Dami,

387
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:11,738
wait with Mr. Mei.

388
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:12,738
I'll go pick up Xiaomi.

389
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:14,298
Okay, don't worry.

390
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,257
So you are my stepdad?

391
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:39,418
I'm still trying.

392
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:41,417
Not bad.

393
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:43,698
You're good
at showing my mom respect in public.

394
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,259
But you're handsome.

395
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,817
So it must be my mom who pursued you.

396
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:50,017
You do know your mom well.

397
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:23,698
Dami,

398
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:25,537
did you say anything bad about me?

399
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:27,658
No.

400
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:29,058
Dami is very polite

401
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:30,698
and very sincere, right?

402
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:35,217
Xiaomi,

403
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:36,297
say hello.

404
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:37,577
Hello, Mr. Mei.

405
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:38,938
Good boy.

406
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:44,977
Mom, will Grandma die?

407
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,578
If she dies,

408
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:47,299
can we

409
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:49,138
see her again in the future?

410
00:17:56,057 --> 00:17:57,057
Xiaomi,

411
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:59,577
when a person dies,

412
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:01,577
they disappear from this world.

413
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:02,977
You can only see her again

414
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:04,338
in your dreams.

415
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,019
So,

416
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:07,378
you must cherish every day she is alive.

417
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,217
But after everyone

418
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:09,938
passes away,

419
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:10,977
they leave behind

420
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,537
a special gift in this world.

421
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,297
A special gift?

422
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:17,297
Where is it?

423
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:19,538
That's up to you

424
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:21,257
to find it on your own.

425
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:28,778
How about we play

426
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,577
a dare game?

427
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:30,538
A game?

428
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:31,618
Okay.

429
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:33,777
When you see Grandma,

430
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,618
as long as you don't say the word 'die,'

431
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,778
you win.

432
00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:38,177
Then I will reward you

433
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:39,177
with a big gift.

434
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:39,778
Okay?

435
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:41,378
Okay, Mom, pinky swear.

436
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:42,497
Mom, pinky swear.

437
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,178
Pinky swear,

438
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,577
no take-backs.

439
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:48,578
Whoever backs their words is a pig.

440
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:49,938
You know so much?

441
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:00,178
Ms. Li, look at this girl.

442
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:01,299
(A Second Chance)
She is divorced,

443
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:02,458
and she doesn't have kids.

444
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:03,458
Moreover, her hobbies

445
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:05,257
are listening to music and traveling.

446
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:06,217
So I think

447
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:07,217
we can put her

448
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:08,297
in our VIP client group.

449
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:18,258
Look at the two clients yesterday.

450
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:19,497
The man has a kid.

451
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:20,618
The woman wants no kids.

452
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:23,217
I suddenly realized

453
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:25,098
I have an important email

454
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:26,897
to reply to. I'll go reply to it.

455
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:27,977
A very important email.

456
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:29,057
I must...

457
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:31,497
You're here.

458
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:33,217
You guys chat.

459
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:38,297
He's quite sensible.

460
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:40,539
What's up?

461
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:42,057
So eager to see me, did you miss me?

462
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:43,698
Was breakfast good?

463
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,418
Song Ran,

464
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:49,098
what's the point

465
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:50,178
of your relentlessness?

466
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:52,498
Well,

467
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,098
I find it quite meaningful.

468
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:56,137
I'll refund you.

469
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:57,217
Don't come again.

470
00:19:58,257 --> 00:19:59,338
I won't take a refund,

471
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:00,698
even if I'm beaten up.

472
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:06,577
Song Ran,

473
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,217
I will make it clear

474
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:10,537
with you today.

475
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:12,338
I admit when I

476
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:13,858
first saw you,

477
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:14,938
I did fall for you.

478
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:16,698
But since I knew

479
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:17,858
you married and divorced

480
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:18,579
during your

481
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:19,898
three-year disappearance,

482
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:23,258
I've given it serious thought.

483
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:24,259
I was thinking

484
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:25,777
in the 10 minutes before you came.

485
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:27,777
There is only one conclusion.

486
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:30,497
It's not going to happen.

487
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:38,298
Xiaoxiao, I know you too well.

488
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:39,098
Alright?

489
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:40,417
After all this time,

490
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:41,897
the more seriously you speak,

491
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:42,977
the more I won't listen.

492
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:44,098
Moreover,

493
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:45,537
I'll have to contradict you.

494
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:47,898
(Bank card, household registration)
I'll leave these

495
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:48,819
to you.

496
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:49,897
Keep them for me.

497
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:50,977
Later in our family,

498
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:52,018
you'll be the boss.

499
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:53,098
I'll do

500
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,418
whatever you say.

501
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:58,057
Song Ran.

502
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:00,017
Are you moved?

503
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:03,297
Moved?

504
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,898
I look down on you.

505
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:13,698
Is it really necessary

506
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:15,098
for you to be so mean,

507
00:21:15,178 --> 00:21:16,178
Li Xiaoxiao?

508
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:17,577
Song Ran,

509
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:18,977
are you still treating me

510
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:20,898
as that silly girl in her twenties?

511
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:23,177
You thought all these

512
00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:24,497
would make me burst into tears

513
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:25,577
and go with you?

514
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:27,658
If you dare, give them to me.

515
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:29,098
Transfer the money

516
00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:30,338
and your property to me.

517
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:30,937
Not the car.

518
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:32,577
I don't want it. It's not worth much.

519
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:33,778
If you can do it,

520
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:35,977
I'll marry you
as soon as the procedures are done.

521
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,458
Li Xiaoxiao,

522
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:39,418
why do you now

523
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,458
keep talking about money?

524
00:21:41,737 --> 00:21:42,579
Can our relationship

525
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,018
simply be measured by money?

526
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:44,698
Li Xiaoxiao,

527
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,177
why can't we completely cut ties

528
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:47,458
for such a long time?

529
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:48,418
It's because

530
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:49,618
we have mutual feelings,

531
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:50,698
alright?

532
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:52,378
Give me a chance.

533
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,658
I promise I can bring you happiness.

534
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:57,177
Why are you going against happiness?

535
00:21:57,257 --> 00:21:58,257
Aren't I right?

536
00:21:58,658 --> 00:22:01,257
Stop making empty promises, okay?

537
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:02,497
I know

538
00:22:02,577 --> 00:22:04,297
your so-called true love all too well.

539
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,618
You're always surrounded
by pretty girls,

540
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:08,777
but you keep me
as a regret in your heart.

541
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,817
One day, when you think of me,

542
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:12,457
I need to be full of anticipation

543
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:13,618
and gratitude

544
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:15,737
to thank you for your affection, huh?

545
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:17,298
But what gives, Song Ran?

546
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,657
Why should I be stuck

547
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,338
to make up for your regrets?

548
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:21,737
It's because you love me

549
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:23,418
and I happen to love you too.

550
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:27,417
Youthful love

551
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:28,777
may hold some value.

552
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:30,698
But middle-aged love

553
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:33,138
is better off with money.

554
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:34,937
Li Xiaoxiao, I'm telling you.

555
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:35,497
Money is...

556
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:36,577
Give me money.

557
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:37,858
We can't use money...

558
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:38,938
Transfer the ownership.

559
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:39,977
Stop that.

560
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:40,457
Money.

561
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:41,137
Seriously...

562
00:22:41,217 --> 00:22:41,858
Ownership.

563
00:22:42,138 --> 00:22:42,657
Listen...

564
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:43,297
Money.

565
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,378
Ownership.

566
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:46,458
Give me money. Transfer the ownership.

567
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:51,497
Alright.

568
00:22:53,777 --> 00:22:54,777
Forget it.

569
00:22:55,698 --> 00:22:56,698
Give me money.

570
00:23:04,938 --> 00:23:06,977
How can someone be like this,

571
00:23:07,338 --> 00:23:08,977
keeping talking about money?

572
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,938
- Dad.
- Dad.

573
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:56,497
Well...

574
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:58,859
I won't go over.

575
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,818
It's not appropriate for me to go over.

576
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:01,539
If you need me,

577
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:03,178
just call me.

578
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:05,017
Okay.

579
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:07,098
Are you going back
to the company directly?

580
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:09,497
I still have some time.

581
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:10,259
I want to see

582
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:11,657
Yu'an and Yule's mom.

583
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:12,938
It's been a while.

584
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,578
And I want

585
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:15,938
to tell her about us.

586
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:18,777
Say hi for me.

587
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:20,898
Okay.

588
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:25,698
Be good.

589
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,338
Alright.

590
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:41,418
Take care.

591
00:24:41,577 --> 00:24:42,577
Go ahead.

592
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:52,418
Thank you.

593
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,658
It's fine.

594
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:54,977
What did the doctor say?

595
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:57,817
She's in critical condition.

596
00:24:59,217 --> 00:25:00,538
I know my mom can't see the kids

597
00:25:00,618 --> 00:25:01,618
even if they are here.

598
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:03,618
It's just in case...

599
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:05,817
I understand.

600
00:25:06,378 --> 00:25:07,577
Today I'll stay here

601
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,178
to keep Dami and Xiaomi company.

602
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:10,737
It's too chaotic here.

603
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:11,977
The kids need better care.

604
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:13,378
I don't want anything

605
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,458
to happen to them.

606
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:16,537
I can take care of them.

607
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:20,737
They have their own mother.

608
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:22,937
Qian Hao,

609
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:24,417
if you can't accept this,

610
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:25,778
I'll take them back.

611
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:26,818
It's not your business.

612
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:27,898
Sit down.

613
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:32,858
Thank you.

614
00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:38,898
Dami, Xiaomi,

615
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,698
go there and do your homework.

616
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:46,858
I don't know

617
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:48,538
what exactly happened between you two.

618
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:49,937
My duty here

619
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,537
is to take good care of my kids.

620
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:52,817
Call me if you need me.

621
00:25:56,217 --> 00:25:57,217
Thank you.

622
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:02,858
Mom,

623
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,657
Dad looks very upset.

624
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,178
I want to go accompany him.

625
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:08,257
Go ahead.

626
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:26,098
Master,

627
00:27:26,257 --> 00:27:26,898
why do I feel

628
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,777
they are not sad at all?

629
00:27:29,178 --> 00:27:29,819
You registered

630
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,698
the tombstone inscription yesterday.

631
00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:33,338
Did you forget it so soon?

632
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:36,577
Tell me.

633
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:38,338
How old

634
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:39,777
was our new client?

635
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:42,777
He was 102 years old.

636
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:44,538
Yes, 102 years old.

637
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:46,138
What's there to be sad about?

638
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:48,338
It's called a happy funeral.

639
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:49,498
In a while,

640
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:50,817
they will set off firecrackers.

641
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:53,098
But he died.

642
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:54,417
What's there to be happy about?

643
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:55,817
And the firecrackers?

644
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:57,378
Nobody wants to get old.

645
00:27:57,817 --> 00:27:59,017
But do you know

646
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:00,338
how many people

647
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,938
never live to be old at all?

648
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:03,497
To be able to smoothly

649
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,017
live to 102,

650
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:06,938
isn't it

651
00:28:07,057 --> 00:28:08,577
a lifetime worth celebrating?

652
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:12,178
The legendary old helmsman

653
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:14,777
sets sail today for his last voyage.

654
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:15,938
For the last time,

655
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:19,338
he embarks on that journey of no return.

656
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:21,938
So

657
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,777
this is not an ordinary funeral.

658
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:27,938
It's a celebration and farewell.

659
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:30,698
Makes some sense.

660
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:33,098
Let alone 102,

661
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:36,138
if I could live to half the age of him,

662
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:38,497
I'd be content.

663
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:40,858
That's only 51.

664
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:42,098
That's too little.

665
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:43,418
Quick, spit.

666
00:29:00,858 --> 00:29:01,858
What's wrong?

667
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,098
Not to your taste today?

668
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,057
No.

669
00:29:08,577 --> 00:29:09,937
If you don't want to eat, go away.

670
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:11,017
Don't disturb me.

671
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:15,817
You've been upset

672
00:29:16,217 --> 00:29:17,338
since Youyou has been away.

673
00:29:17,418 --> 00:29:18,737
Didn't Youyou say?

674
00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:20,698
She'll come back next week.

675
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:22,178
So stop that.

676
00:29:22,938 --> 00:29:23,777
So pretentious.

677
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:25,618
There are still six days
until next week.

678
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:30,299
So you can't be

679
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:31,618
without your daughter now.

680
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:33,378
When she is home,

681
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,577
can't you see

682
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:35,777
your face?

683
00:29:36,217 --> 00:29:37,418
You're so annoying.

684
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:38,938
Alright, I am.

685
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:42,297
How about

686
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:44,138
you call Youyou

687
00:29:44,297 --> 00:29:45,817
and ask her to come back for dinner?

688
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:46,898
She's busy.

689
00:29:46,978 --> 00:29:47,937
You think she's

690
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:49,017
retired like you are?

691
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,497
You won't call?

692
00:29:53,977 --> 00:29:55,138
If you won't call, I will.

693
00:30:06,497 --> 00:30:07,777
I need to take this, Master.

694
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:11,658
Dad.

695
00:30:13,257 --> 00:30:14,257
Youyou,

696
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:15,898
it's nothing.

697
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:17,017
I just want to know

698
00:30:17,777 --> 00:30:20,217
how your work is going now.

699
00:30:20,297 --> 00:30:21,417
I'm doing well.

700
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:23,297
The ceremony is about to start.

701
00:30:28,777 --> 00:30:29,339
Is there

702
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:30,977
anyone setting off firecrackers?

703
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:31,898
No.

704
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:34,058
Someone next door
is opening a new business.

705
00:30:34,138 --> 00:30:35,577
This has been going on all morning.

706
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:38,817
Bow once.

707
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:44,537
Bow twice.

708
00:30:46,098 --> 00:30:47,938
Why is someone bowing?

709
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:49,057
No.

710
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,217
There's a funeral

711
00:30:50,297 --> 00:30:51,338
in the community opposite.

712
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:53,297
A funeral?

713
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:55,577
Won't your company

714
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:57,297
be disturbed there?

715
00:30:57,418 --> 00:30:58,618
It's fine. We're used to it.

716
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:00,217
Used to it?

717
00:31:02,057 --> 00:31:04,898
I mean, our company

718
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:06,378
is in a busy area.

719
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:07,938
It's usually a bit chaotic.

720
00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:13,818
Youyou, your dad misses you.

721
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:15,217
Come back for dinner tonight.

722
00:31:15,577 --> 00:31:16,977
Okay, I'll go back

723
00:31:17,057 --> 00:31:17,579
after work.

724
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:19,338
Hardworking and kind...

725
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:22,418
I'm in a meeting, Dad.

726
00:31:22,938 --> 00:31:24,497
Alright, I need to go.

727
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:28,817
She hung up.

728
00:31:30,777 --> 00:31:31,498
Don't you think

729
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:32,578
Youyou's company

730
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:33,777
is a bit strange?

731
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:35,538
Don't be so paranoid.

732
00:31:35,618 --> 00:31:36,618
Believe it or not,

733
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:38,338
I'll call the psychiatric hospital

734
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:39,259
to take you in.

735
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:40,898
Well, think about it.

736
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:41,938
What kind of company

737
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:43,418
assigns a dormitory upon hiring?

738
00:31:43,658 --> 00:31:44,339
And there are

739
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:45,777
strange noises coming from it?

740
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,137
Also, when Youyou spoke,

741
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:50,698
wasn't she a bit evasive?

742
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:54,138
It is a bit odd.

743
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:56,577
Then what do you mean?

744
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:57,777
Make it clear.

745
00:31:58,777 --> 00:31:59,977
Could she have been tricked

746
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:01,577
into a pyramid scheme?

747
00:32:02,257 --> 00:32:03,418
No way.

748
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:05,338
Youyou studied abroad.

749
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:06,059
She couldn't

750
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:07,737
be fooled by such trivial tricks.

751
00:32:08,817 --> 00:32:10,258
She wouldn't be if she takes my IQ.

752
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:11,698
But with yours, it's hard to say.

753
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:16,138
I announce

754
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:18,297
our family is going to start

755
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,537
a special operation.

756
00:32:20,098 --> 00:32:22,297
The Investigation Group
for Youyou's Work

757
00:32:22,698 --> 00:32:24,098
is officially established.

758
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:27,858
Let's eat.

759
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:29,977
A full belly fuels a good fight.

760
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:04,497
Youyou, what are you doing?

761
00:33:04,577 --> 00:33:05,538
The work isn't done yet.

762
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:06,137
Why did it

763
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,059
take you so long?

764
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:08,417
You scared me to death.

765
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:09,817
I saw my brother-in-law.

766
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:11,539
So what?

767
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:12,977
Go over and say hello.

768
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:14,339
No way.

769
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:15,378
No one in my family

770
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,577
knows I'm here.

771
00:33:17,057 --> 00:33:18,378
If the truth blows up,

772
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,217
the consequences are unimaginable.

773
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:21,057
What's up?

774
00:33:21,138 --> 00:33:22,977
Do you look down on our profession?

775
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:24,498
No.

776
00:33:24,578 --> 00:33:26,777
I just don't want
to hear my dad's nagging.

777
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:28,259
That old man

778
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,577
will make a big fuss over it.

779
00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:31,258
He's such a spoiled dad.

780
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:32,977
Fussing is his thing.

781
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:34,259
Well,

782
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:35,697
you can run,

783
00:33:35,777 --> 00:33:37,338
but you can't hide forever.

784
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:39,738
At least I can

785
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:41,378
have some peace for a while.

786
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,960
(You Xin)

787
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:11,224
(You Xin)

788
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,657
Xin,

789
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:42,378
before you died, I promised you,

790
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:46,017
if I were to be with someone else,

791
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:47,497
I would definitely tell you.

792
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:51,938
Yes, that's right.

793
00:34:53,298 --> 00:34:55,137
I have indeed had feelings for a woman.

794
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:02,258
But it's not

795
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:03,577
to the degree of love yet.

796
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:05,898
Or rather,

797
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:08,697
I'm not sure

798
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:11,178
how much capacity for love

799
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:12,418
is left in me.

800
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:17,258
She has

801
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:21,818
a daughter

802
00:35:21,898 --> 00:35:22,938
and a son.

803
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:24,537
And she's taught them well.

804
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:26,738
She is very interesting.

805
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:29,017
She doesn't want to marry me

806
00:35:30,657 --> 00:35:31,977
but wants to sign a family

807
00:35:32,057 --> 00:35:33,458
partnership agreement with me.

808
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:35,938
She doesn't want to live together.

809
00:35:36,057 --> 00:35:38,057
She wants to live near my place

810
00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:41,258
to keep a distance.

811
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:42,617
But

812
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:43,537
don't worry, Xin.

813
00:35:43,617 --> 00:35:44,259
I'll absolutely

814
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:45,977
not let Yu'an and Yule

815
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:47,338
be mistreated.

816
00:35:48,137 --> 00:35:49,898
No matter who I'm with in the future,

817
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:51,378
Yu'an and Yule

818
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:52,497
are my bottom line.

819
00:35:55,617 --> 00:35:57,057
I know you won't be mad,

820
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:00,697
but I still want to say

821
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:04,497
sorry to you.

822
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:13,697
Xin, do you know now Yu'an and Yule

823
00:36:14,617 --> 00:36:16,258
look more and more like you?

824
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:17,977
They look so much like you.

825
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:18,897
Right,

826
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:19,578
I took

827
00:36:19,658 --> 00:36:20,897
many photos and videos of them.

828
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:22,097
You can have a look.

829
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:25,738
Look.

830
00:36:32,298 --> 00:36:33,218
(Look at the camera.)

831
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:34,058
(Hurry up.)

832
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:35,138
(It's so much fun.)

833
00:36:35,218 --> 00:36:37,338
Look, haven't they grown a lot?

834
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,778
(Okay.)

835
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:40,738
(Dad, did you capture me?)

836
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:41,818
(Capture me.)

837
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:43,177
(Quick, look at the camera.)

838
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:45,458
(Did you capture me?)

839
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:47,097
(Capture me.)

840
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:47,779
(Okay, we can)

841
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:48,938
(show this to Mom.)

842
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:50,058
Well,

843
00:36:50,138 --> 00:36:51,138
these two little ones

844
00:36:51,218 --> 00:36:52,418
are particularly naughty.

845
00:36:53,898 --> 00:36:55,778
Your parents have been pampering them.

846
00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:58,017
Well,

847
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:01,338
I've also edited a family photo.

848
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:07,017
Isn't it great?

849
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:08,977
And there's little surprise

850
00:37:09,057 --> 00:37:09,778
to show you.

851
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:10,977
I'll show you a magic trick.

852
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:12,577
One.

853
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:13,298
Two.

854
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:14,378
Three.

855
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:17,738
Isn't it interesting?

856
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,738
What do you think?

857
00:37:22,298 --> 00:37:23,858
Don't you love comics the most?

858
00:37:23,938 --> 00:37:25,577
Since you were gone,

859
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,778
there have been huge changes.

860
00:37:27,938 --> 00:37:29,258
Now there's a software,

861
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:30,259
an AI software,

862
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:31,858
that can instantly turn your photos

863
00:37:31,938 --> 00:37:33,497
into a comic.

864
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:35,137
You'd be amazed if you saw it.

865
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:39,550
♪Sometimes calm and composed♪

866
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:47,768
♪Sometimes I think of that young me♪

867
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,145
♪And say goodbye to me♪

868
00:37:51,346 --> 00:37:55,114
(You Xin)

869
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:23,218
You...

870
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:25,137
Where is your usual calmness?

871
00:38:26,298 --> 00:38:28,378
Master, I can't expose myself.

872
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:30,338
A true man can yield to rise again.

873
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:31,537
I'm just a woman.

874
00:38:31,617 --> 00:38:33,697
I can yield and yield.

875
00:38:35,657 --> 00:38:36,818
What if you speak louder?

876
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:37,618
He is so far away.

877
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:39,057
He won't hear us.

878
00:38:40,977 --> 00:38:42,218
When my brother-in-law leaves,

879
00:38:42,298 --> 00:38:43,457
give me a call.

880
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:44,537
Okay, Master?

881
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:52,299
The restaurant

882
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:53,977
you liked to eat at nearby

883
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:55,738
also moved.

884
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:58,097
Anyway, these three years,

885
00:38:58,738 --> 00:39:00,097
the changes have been quite big.

886
00:39:08,017 --> 00:39:10,218
Alright, I'm leaving.

887
00:39:11,097 --> 00:39:12,057
I have to pick up

888
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:14,378
Yu'an and Yule from school.

889
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:18,378
Xin,

890
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:22,418
this time,

891
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:28,137
I want to take another step forward.

892
00:39:30,738 --> 00:39:31,977
Alright, that's it.

893
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:34,418
I'm leaving now.

894
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:46,738
I'll come again to see you in a while.

895
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:21,458
Hello?

896
00:40:21,577 --> 00:40:22,378
Hello.

897
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:23,537
He has left.

898
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:24,617
Come out.

899
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:26,298
Look at you.

900
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:28,617
Got it, Master.

901
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:48,738
I bought the kids

902
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:49,898
some food.

903
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:51,417
Eat some.

904
00:40:51,497 --> 00:40:52,098
Okay.

905
00:40:52,178 --> 00:40:53,537
Eat something.

906
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,697
Eat properly.

907
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:19,097
Right?

908
00:41:20,017 --> 00:41:21,017
Is it this one?

909
00:41:24,778 --> 00:41:25,778
You...

910
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:30,858
Tidy up your homework.

911
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:35,537
Mom,

912
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:36,458
I feel my dad

913
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:37,577
and his new wife

914
00:41:37,657 --> 00:41:38,657
aren't doing well.

915
00:41:39,738 --> 00:41:40,498
Can't you see

916
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:41,697
I stay far away from them?

917
00:41:42,057 --> 00:41:42,738
I don't want

918
00:41:42,818 --> 00:41:43,818
to get involved.

919
00:41:44,258 --> 00:41:46,378
Mom, why am I not sad at all

920
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:47,898
as Grandma is hospitalized?

921
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:53,218
This is called a heart for a heart.

922
00:41:53,738 --> 00:41:55,057
You'll know why when you grow up.

923
00:41:56,657 --> 00:41:57,657
Qian Hao,

924
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,697
I'm bleeding.

925
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,298
Focus your mind.

926
00:42:10,378 --> 00:42:11,617
Remember to smile.

927
00:42:23,378 --> 00:42:25,298
Hello? What's the matter?

928
00:42:28,258 --> 00:42:29,497
Xiaojiao is hospitalized?

929
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:33,458
You continue.

930
00:42:33,657 --> 00:42:34,898
