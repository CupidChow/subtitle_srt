How is Youyou?

18
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:49,796
If she doesn't eat,

19
00:01:50,316 --> 00:01:52,036
her body will be bad.

20
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:55,355
If she keeps going,

21
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,355
her body will really be bad.

22
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:02,636
We might as well allow...

23
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:03,716
No.

24
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:05,236
Don't spoil her.

25
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:06,915
If she doesn't eat, she'll starve.

26

Take it or leave it.

27
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:09,836
Chengyi, let's eat.

28
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:16,596
Even mother's love can also change.

what else won't change?

31
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:24,596
So big!

32
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:25,396
Very big.

33
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:27,516
Mom, the balcony
of the new house is so big.

34
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:28,796
I really like this balcony.

35
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:30,156
I like it too.

36
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:33,596
Let me take a look at this balcony.

37
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:34,996
It's so big.

38
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:37,355
Great.

39
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:38,955
These two kids are quite adaptable.

40
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:40,797
Look!

41
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:42,116
They have toys too.

42
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:44,355
There should be children
in their house, right?

43
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:47,556
- Didn't I tell you?
- Tell what?

44
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:48,755
The opposite is Mei's house.

45
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:49,956
Who?

46
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,036
Here.

47
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:51,956
Have fruit.

48
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,355
Okay, okay, alright, Lili.

49
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:54,556
Who, Mei Chengyi?

50
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:56,715
And this balcony.

51
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:57,396
Are you two

52
00:02:57,476 --> 00:02:58,795
playing Romeo and Juliet?

53
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:00,755
Romeo.

54
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:01,517
Juliet.

55
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:02,595
Why climb the balcony?

56
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,515
We have a front door.
Can't use the front door?

57
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:06,077
Yes.

58
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,036
There's Super Wings,
Funny Little Chicks

59
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:09,596
and also Iron Man.

60
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:12,516
There should be kids too, right?

61
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:14,115
Otherwise, they wouldn't put dolls.

62
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,596
Mom, Mom.

63
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:16,675
Keep it down.

64
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:17,755
Avoid disturbing others.

65
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:19,636
Okay,

66
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:20,275
four of you

67
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:22,635
will argue together.

68
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,756
Good luck to you and Mei Chengyi.

69
00:03:24,836 --> 00:03:25,836
Dear.

70
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:26,916
It doesn't sound like

71
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:27,676
a blessing

72
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:29,195
but a threat.

73
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:30,236
Here.

74
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:30,996
Eat fruit.

75
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,116
Alright.

76
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:33,596
Here, have one.

77
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:36,395
I think we can put flowers

78
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:37,237
or toys

79
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,515
on this shelf.

80
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:40,556
I agree with the toys.

81
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:42,116
I don't really recommend flowers.

Go get a set of cutlery.

107
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:45,555
Alright, alright.

108
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:46,795
I'll eat by myself.

00:06:24,956 --> 00:06:25,956
Okay.

118
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:34,276
Kids,

119
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:35,836
why are you copying us?

120
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:38,636
Who's copying you?

121
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:39,557
This is our balcony.

122
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:40,995
We do whatever we want.

123
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:42,116
So rude.

124
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:42,836
Yes.

125
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,995
You're the rude kids.

126
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:45,835
Annoying.

127
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:46,636
Annoying.

128
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:47,596
I find you annoying.

129
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:48,915
You're the annoying ones.

130
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:49,676
Annoying person.

00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:50,517
You are annoying.

132
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:51,636
What are you arguing?

133
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:53,716
Stop arguing.

134
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:54,995
What are you doing?

135
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:55,995
You guys...

136
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:57,196
Don't you remember

137
00:06:57,276 --> 00:06:58,516
the story of Bears I told you?

138
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:00,116
- I don't like it.
- I don't like it.

139
00:07:00,196 --> 00:07:01,115
Rude.

140
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:02,235
I don't like you.

141
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,024
- I don't like you.
- I don't like you.

143
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:05,756
Alright, alright, alright.

144
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:06,956
Alright, stop arguing.

145
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:07,995
Rude.

146
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:09,035
Annoying.

147
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:10,076
Alright, alright.

148
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:10,716
Quick, quick.

149
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,196
Alright, alright, come in quickly.

150
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,116
Alright.

151
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:14,076
Let's go home.

152
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:14,677
Stop arguing.

153
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:16,036
Time to go home.

154
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:16,996
Go home.

155
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:18,076
Annoying.

156
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,275
Alright, go in quickly.

157
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:19,915
Rude.

158
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:20,677
Rude.

159
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:22,275
- Let's go inside.
- Annoying.

160
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:23,116
Alright, alright.

161
00:07:23,196 --> 00:07:24,595
- Annoying.
- Alright, don't.

162
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:25,675
Great.

163
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:27,396
We didn't lose in terms of momentum.

164
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,196
You're not worried at all.

165
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,115
No worries.

166
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:34,836
Children are having a disagreement.

167
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,116
It'll be fine.

168
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:37,555
They have their own rules.

169
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:38,995
We shouldn't interfere.

170
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,555
Are you not afraid it'll affect

171
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,115
relationship with Mei Chengyi?

172
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:46,117
Middle-aged people

173
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:47,795
don't live only on love.

174
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:49,395
If he doesn't understand this,

175
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:50,396
then

176
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:51,956
we shouldn't be together.

177
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:54,636
Young people feel intensely

178
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:56,516
the extreme highs and lows of love.

179
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,036
Middle-aged people dating

180
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:00,036
depends on brains and reason.

181
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:01,355
Otherwise, life will hit you,

182
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:03,196
battered and beaten.

183
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:06,315
Love in middle age is so difficult.

184
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,036
It's not really that hard.

185
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,795
Hold back a little strength.

186
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:12,875
Reserve three parts for self-love,

187
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,796
three for life,

188
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,036
three for family,

189
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:16,636
and just one

190
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:17,715
for romance.

191
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:18,795
So little?

192
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,956
It's not little.

193
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:21,235
So

194
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:22,077
if Chengyi wants to

195
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:23,116
stay with me,

196
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:25,235
he cannot rely solely on love.

197
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:27,716
He must also use brains and loyalty.

198
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,836
But for me,

199
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:32,036
what do I rely on?

200
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:33,915
You are different.

201
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:35,996
You definitely have to rely on luck.

202
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:38,835
Because you don't have brains at all.

203
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:42,116
Xu Kaixin!

204
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:57,236
Lie down and sleep.

205
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:06,835
Didn't I tell you

206
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:08,636
to be friendly to other kids,

207
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:09,795
and not to argue?

208
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:17,915
Alright,

209
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,476
if you don't like them,

210
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,276
don't play together.

211
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:21,276
Is that okay?

212
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,195
Okay, Dad.

213
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:24,595
Alright, go to sleep.

214
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:25,277
Goodnight, Dad.

215
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,516
Okay, hurry up and sleep.

216
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:45,955
Hello, hi.

217
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:48,595
Hello, good evening.

218
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:51,595
How's my mom?

219
00:10:52,156 --> 00:10:53,115
She's fine.

220
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,195
She's already asleep.

221
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:55,875
The doctor just came to check,

222
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:56,876
and said she's stable.

223
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,115
Don't worry.

224
00:10:58,195 --> 00:10:59,195
Okay.

225
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:01,236
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

226
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:02,795
It's so late.

227
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:06,835
I'll transfer you another

228
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:08,356
red envelope.

229
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:10,316
Money has been given.

230
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:11,115
No need, no need.

231
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:12,195
No way.

232
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:14,195
You must take it.

233
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:16,835
I have just one request.

234
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:19,835
Take good care of my mom.

235
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:26,516
Such a big red envelope.

236
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:29,115
Don't worry.

237
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:30,715
I'll definitely take good care of her.

238
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:31,756
Okay.

239
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:35,115
How old are you?

240
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,195
It's not important.

241
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:29,277
Sir,

242
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:31,116
you can just wait for me downstairs.

243
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,676
Yes, I have quite a few suitcases.

244
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:34,115
I guess I have to make two trips.

245
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:35,475
Alright, you are downstairs.

246
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:36,555
Okay, goodbye.

247
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:45,356
Where are you going?

248
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:47,397
Anywhere is fine,

249
00:13:47,397 --> 00:13:48,955
just not here.

250
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:53,876
Which man are you off

251
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:55,396
to meet this time?

252
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:58,235
I am to meet another man.

253
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:00,356
At least other men are real men.

254
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,276
What are...

255
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:05,795
I'm not a man?

256
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:08,555
I'm not a man?

257
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:11,715
Let go of me, what are you doing?

258
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,236
I'm not a man?

259
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:16,995
I'll prove to you

260
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:18,876
if I am a man.

261
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:20,755
Qian Hao, you...

262
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:22,595
Let go of me, Qian Hao.

263
00:14:27,996 --> 00:14:28,996
I'm not a man?

264
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:30,516
Say that again.

265
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:34,555
You brute.

266
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:37,356
Help...

267
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:48,715
I've recovered.

268
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,648
I've reclaimed my manhood.

269
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,075
Xiaojiao, I've reclaimed my manhood.

270
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,756
We have a chance, Xiaojiao.

271
00:14:58,876 --> 00:14:59,876
Xiaojiao.

272
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:00,996
Xiaojiao.

273
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:02,195
Xiaojiao.

274
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:03,876
Xiaojiao.

275
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:05,316
Xiaojiao.

276
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:06,396
Xiaojiao.

277
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:07,795
Xiaojiao, wake up.

278
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,116
Xiaojiao.

279
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:10,915
Xiaojiao.

280
00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:13,656
(Honey)

281
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:19,595
You can't even handle your own sister.

282
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:20,984
What are you coming to me for?

283
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:23,992
(Honey)

284
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,048
(Honey)

285
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:39,235
Hello, what's up?

286
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:40,916
Honey, Xiaojiao is in trouble.

287
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:42,315
You should hurry to the hospital.

288
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:43,996
What happened?

289
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:46,795
Hurry up and make it clear.

290
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:48,636
That Qian Hao...

291
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:50,196
Xiaojiao got pregnant and he...

292
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:51,595
He raped her.

293
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:53,076
Xiaojiao miscarried.

294
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:54,636
And there was massive bleeding.

295
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:56,436
Probably the entire uterus

296
00:15:56,516 --> 00:15:57,236
has to be removed

297
00:15:57,316 --> 00:15:58,316
to save her life.

298
00:15:58,396 --> 00:15:59,595
Oh my god.

299
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:00,635
I...

300
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:02,636
I... I will come right away.

301
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:10,476
Chungeng,

302
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,276
will Xiaojiao be okay?

303
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:14,236
Will she not make it out?

304
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:15,995
Chungeng...

305
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,075
Stop.

306
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:18,156
Chungeng.

307
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,277
Chungeng, don't.

308
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:20,835
Qian Hao, you beast.

309
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:22,835
If anything happens to Xiaojiao,

310
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:24,115
I'll kill you.

311
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:25,715
You beast.

312
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:27,236
You beast.

313
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:28,795
You beast.

314
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:30,036
You beast.

315
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,715
Stop it, he's going to get killed.

316
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:35,876
- Are you okay?
- Honey.

317
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:37,156
Honey, honey.

318
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:37,916
Sorry, sorry.

319
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:38,996
It's okay.

320
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:40,436
How is Xiaojiao?

321
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:41,077
She's here.

322
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,196
Here, here.

323
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:43,595
Look, she...

324
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:45,515
How is she?

325
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:46,197
I don't know.

326
00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:47,955
Do you think she'll be okay?

327
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:49,076
She will be fine.

328
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:50,516
There will be no problems.

329
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:51,917
I really don't know.

330
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:53,635
What should we do about Xiaojiao?

331
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:55,996
Sis, don't worry, don't worry.

332
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,195
What will happen to Xiaojiao?

333
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:05,236
Will she be okay?

334
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:13,555
Don't worry.

335
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:20,835
Xiaojiao.

336
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:33,436
What should we do?

337
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,075
Did they fall asleep?

338
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,236
A bad start, isn't it?

339
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:47,155
A low start enables improvement.

340
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:48,595
Still stubborn, huh?

341
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:50,155
Where's Xiaoxiao?

342
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:51,355
Just returned.

343
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:53,516
You should rest soon as well

344
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:55,516
after a day of hard work.

345
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,316
Okay.

346
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:58,155
I'll sleep with the kids.

347
00:18:58,355 --> 00:18:59,276
On this first day,

348
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:00,916
I'm afraid they won't adjust,

349
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,196
making noise at night.

350
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:03,676
No, I sleep with them.

351
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:04,795
Hurry back to sleep.

352
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:06,835
Go out. Go out.

353
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:09,035
Mei Chengyi helped you all day.

354
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,395
You still haven't thanked him.

355
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:13,756
It's not urgent to do this today.

356
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,155
Incoming call.

357
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:19,676
Then I'm going.

358
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:25,676
Hello.

359
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:26,996
You are still up?

360
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,155
Balcony. Balcony.

361
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:30,996
Alright.

362
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:40,355
Yu'an and Yule are both asleep?

363
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:42,875
Yes.

364
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:46,395
Why aren't you asleep yet?

365
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:49,996
I said...

366
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:58,555
Why aren't you asleep yet?

367
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:02,635
Why aren't you asleep yet?

368
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,515
I'm afraid if I fall asleep,

369
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:08,916
I'll be woken up by someone.

370
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:12,636
I'm afraid if I fall asleep,

371
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:14,155
I'll be woken up by someone.

372
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:19,832
(Xu Kaixin, annoying.)

373
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:21,595

413
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:42,355
they both came out.

00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:45,395
No.

415
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:47,236
No.

Wait a moment.

421
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:56,536
Not suitable for children.

422
00:24:03,315 --> 00:24:04,236
(If I knew)

423
00:24:04,316 --> 00:24:05,995
(the ex-husband's family)

424
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:08,035
(was in the verge)

425
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,635

(nor is there a need to be connected.)

430
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,275

(my conversation

(If a middle-aged person)

435
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:25,715
(still want to greedily)

436
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:27,875
(use love to guide their life,)

437
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:30,236
(sooner or later
they will crash headfirst.)

438
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,035
(And my feelings)

439
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:34,036
(are without a trace of sympathy.)

440
00:24:35,315 --> 00:24:36,555
(I, Xu Kaixin,)

441
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:37,916
(am nothing but a speck of dust)

442
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:40,155
(in the mundane world,)

443
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,156
(striving to live upwards.)

444
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:43,236
(No one)

445
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:45,395
(can drag me back into the mire.)

446
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:03,035
How is she?

447
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:03,876
Doctor, how is she?

448
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:04,716
How's my daughter?

449
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:05,636
- How is she?
- She's fine.

450
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:06,597
The result is

451
00:26:06,677 --> 00:26:07,916
not too bad.

452
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:08,836
She can keep her life.

453
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:10,156
That's considered lucky.

454
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,035
But next,

00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:11,995

459
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:17,756
After all, she hasn't given birth yet.

460
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:18,876
And in the future,

461
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:20,555

to wake me up?

00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:25,996
In this way,

506
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:27,155
I'll go out first

507
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:28,715
and block them in the bathroom.

508
00:29:28,795 --> 00:29:30,036

No one is there.

523
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:14,595
Then I'm leaving.

524
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,155
Uh, tonight...

525
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:17,676
Got it.

526
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:18,795
Goodbye.

527
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,115
I didn't mean that.

528

Mom, why are you dressed like that?

534
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:42,355
I went jogging.

535
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:44,715
Jogging in slippers?

536
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:45,636
Good for the knees.

537
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:46,716
You just got up?

538
00:30:46,996 --> 00:30:48,440
Brush your teeth and wash your face!

539
00:30:48,756 --> 00:30:49,756

540
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:52,036

You're here again.

Come on, let's have breakfast.

547
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:48,436
No, no need.

548
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:49,875
I've already eaten.

549
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:51,315
Where's your boss?

550
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:52,395
She...

551
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,516
Boss, you came at the right time.

552
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:56,197
Why are you nervous?

553
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:57,355
Register Mr. Song

554
00:31:57,752 --> 00:31:58,757
and give him a discount.

555
00:31:58,757 --> 00:31:59,956
We're classmates.

556
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:04,315
Li Xiaoxiao, listen.

557
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:05,835
Here we go again, right?

558
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:07,315
Haven't you had enough acting?

559
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:09,276
Is it interesting?

560
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:16,956
Yes.

561
00:32:26,436 --> 00:32:28,436
Alright, I'll play along with you then.

562
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:29,956
Do you think this is interesting?

563
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:32,075
Last time, you told me

564
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:35,075

566
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:37,716

and my money to you.

567
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:48,517
I've thought it through.

568
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:50,355
I'll transfer my money

569
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,035
and my house to you.

570
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:53,115
Satisfied now?

571
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:55,516
Can we register for marriage now?

572
00:33:05,595 --> 00:33:06,515
Haven't you

573
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:07,957
sobered up? Here.

574
00:33:07,957 --> 00:33:09,276
Don't distract me from business.

575
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:10,436
Li Xiaoxiao.

576
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:13,516
You don't admit what you said yourself.

577
00:33:13,716 --> 00:33:14,756
Are you scared?

578
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,236
You're serious, Song Ran?

579
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:41,516
Why are you so cute?

580
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:27,916
What's wrong?

581
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:30,917
You old lady,

582
00:34:30,997 --> 00:34:32,715
why not call me if you want water?

583
00:34:36,316 --> 00:34:37,595
Why overexert yourself?

584
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:40,437
What? You think

585
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:41,715
I will ignore you?

586
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:44,236
I wasn't asleep at all.

587
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:45,076
Call my name,

588
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:46,396
and I'll hear you.

589
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:48,635
Look!

590
00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:50,277
What? You think

591
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:51,715
I won't help you?

592
00:34:52,316 --> 00:34:53,316
Okay, take it.

593
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,555
Slowly.

594
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:08,956
What did you say?

595
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:13,755
This lifetime,

596
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:17,796
it's the first time
you've treated me so well.

597
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,516
Sounds like

598
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:24,956
I'm particularly inhuman.

599
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:26,516
Okay, rest well.

600
00:35:27,316 --> 00:35:28,516
Call me if you need anything.

601
00:35:36,516 --> 00:35:37,516
What are you looking for?

602
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,436
Don't worry.

603
00:35:39,715 --> 00:35:41,235
Hao is with Xiaojiao.

604
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,755
I'm sorry.

605
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:10,675
I know that whatever I say now,

606
00:37:10,755 --> 00:37:12,316
you won't forgive me anymore.

607
00:37:15,476 --> 00:37:16,516
I drank too much.

608
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,836
I...

609
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,236
I really drank too much.

610
00:37:22,316 --> 00:37:23,996
I don't know why I acted that way.

611
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:26,675
I don't know.

612
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:27,396
I just...

613
00:37:27,476 --> 00:37:29,635
I... I've suddenly recovered.

614
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:33,916
I'm sorry.

615
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:38,956
I know that child

616
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:39,956
has always been a thorn

617
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:41,036
between us.

618
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:43,155
Now,

619
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,916
perhaps fate

620
00:37:48,115 --> 00:37:49,516
made the decision for us.

621
00:37:58,635 --> 00:38:00,115
We've both been wrong once.

622
00:38:01,075 --> 00:38:02,276
Let's call it even this time.

623
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:03,356
Alright?

624
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:04,516
From now on,

625
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:06,036
I will never hurt you again.

626
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:08,155
I only just realized

627
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:13,115
that I truly love you.

628
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,316
I really, really love you.

629
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:34,595
Don't worry about the child.

630
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:37,036
I will bring Xiaomi back

631
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:37,957
and

632
00:38:38,037 --> 00:38:39,235
we'll live abroad together.

633
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:41,516
He will be your child from now on.

634
00:38:42,008 --> 00:38:43,115
I'll make him call you mom.

635
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:44,115
Thank you.

636
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,516
Thank you for everything you've done.

637
00:38:49,956 --> 00:38:51,755
I don't even

638
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:55,235
feel the pain anymore.

639
00:38:57,675 --> 00:38:58,675
Qian Hao,

640
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:02,595

Xiaoxiao,

654
00:40:08,555 --> 00:40:09,755
what's with your attitude?

655
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:12,956
Song Ran,

656
00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:15,635
did you trick me again?

657
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,997
When I went out this morning,

658
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:20,436
I was still a middle-aged single female.

659
00:40:20,555 --> 00:40:21,437
How did I turn into

660
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:23,316
a middle-aged married woman already?

661
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:26,396
Li Xiaoxiao.

662
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:28,516
Be conscious, okay?

663
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:30,236
I'm saving you,

664
00:40:30,316 --> 00:40:31,075
you know?

665
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:31,837
From now on,

666
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:32,916
say goodbye

667
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:33,826
to toilet paper

668
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:35,715
emergencies.

669
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,316
You have a husband now.

670
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:42,516
Wait a moment.

671
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:44,515
I need to go find Xu Kaixin.

672
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:45,756
- No.
- Sorry.

673
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:46,836
Wait.

674
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:48,555
Xiaoxiao.

675
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:50,876
You can't go

676
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:52,316
empty-handed.

677
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:53,675
Come on.

678
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:54,916
Take this

679
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:55,836
and show it off to her.

680
00:40:55,836 --> 00:40:56,836
Go.

681
00:40:57,356 --> 00:40:58,356
Let's go.

682
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:21,112
(Marriage Certificate)

683
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:31,755
It's okay, girl.

684
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:33,035
What era is it now?

685
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,356
Divorce isn't a big deal.

686
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:35,357
A frog with a few legs

687
00:41:35,437 --> 00:41:36,635
can be found everywhere.

688
00:41:37,436 --> 00:41:38,555
I just got married.

689
00:41:41,595 --> 00:41:44,555
I haven't eaten anything delicious yet.

690
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:47,916
I don't want to have children.

691
00:41:48,235 --> 00:41:50,396
I also haven't gone to Tibet.

692
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:51,555
Xu Kaixin!

693
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:54,356
I'm going to find Xu Kaixin.

694
00:41:54,876 --> 00:41:56,515
Drive faster, sir.

695
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:58,836
I want to find Xu Kaixin.

696
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:00,195
What should I do?

697
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:02,916
My mom doesn't know yet.

698
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,755
Song Ran, you big liar.

699
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:18,151
(Mei Chengyi, they want to lay off our team)

700
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:19,471
(and deny our commission and bonus.)

701
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:21,195
(I want 2N+1 and annual leave,
do you agree?)

702
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:22,396
They are all

703
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:24,475
truly patient.

704
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:26,232
They haven't kicked me out of the group?

705
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:33,595
Hey, Chengyi.

706
00:42:34,316 --> 00:42:35,316
Ms. Qin.

707
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:36,796
What's the situation?

708
00:42:36,876 --> 00:42:38,195
Has President Lin changed?

709
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:39,796
Yes, of course.

710
00:42:40,796 --> 00:42:42,115
Don't fool me.

711
00:42:42,195 --> 00:42:43,475
President Lin

712
00:42:43,555 --> 00:42:44,635
keeps asking me

713
00:42:44,715 --> 00:42:45,836
if you

714
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:47,397
have changed your mind

715
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:48,436
and if you'll back out.

716
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:49,916
If it doesn't work,

717
00:42:49,996 --> 00:42:51,316
we can loosen the conditions.

718
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:52,876
Negotiation, you know.

719
00:42:52,876 --> 00:42:55,075
If you feel it's inappropriate,
we can discuss it again.

720
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:56,555
You really scared me.

721
00:42:57,115 --> 00:42:58,516
Please pass this on for me.

722
00:42:58,715 --> 00:43:00,316
I'll try to handle it

723
00:43:00,396 --> 00:43:01,356

00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:02,156
