16
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:39,507
It really is Qian Hao

17
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:40,307
who's behind it.

18
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:41,068
He wants

19
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:42,307
the custody of Xiaomi

20
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:43,748
and wants to ruin my store,

21
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:45,067
leaving me penniless,

22
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,387
unable to support two kids.

23
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:47,228
Then he's really

24
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,708
shooting himself in the foot.

25
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,507
Since he won't stop,

26
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,068
then we won't be polite either.

27
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:53,468
What do you want to do?

28
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:55,227
Sue him.

29
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,748
Redistribute marital assets.

30
00:01:57,908 --> 00:01:59,828
This stingy rooster, Qian Hao,

31
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:01,628
I'll pluck his feathers one by one

32
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,387
from him.

33
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,707
What's going on?

34
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:07,108
How did it become 2.7 yuan?

35
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:07,868
Why stare at me?

36
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:08,988
I didn't monitor it.

37
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:09,829
The backend is...

38
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:11,068
Who put up the link? Yao?

39
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,387
Yao, you were monitoring the backend.

40
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:14,307
Yes, but I locked the orders promptly.

41
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:15,068
Why?

42
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:16,028
Locked to this price?

43
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:17,068
Ten thousand orders!

44
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:17,829
What's the cost?

45
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:19,468
Alright, stop arguing.

46
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:20,587
What's the point?

47
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:21,828
Think of a solution.

48
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,948
How to solve this price?

49
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:24,312
Cheaper than wholesale price.

50
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:25,828
Quickly call Mei.

51
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:26,427
Let me.

52
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:27,348
Tell him to come.

53
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:28,428
Get him back.

54
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:29,348
What's going on?

55
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:30,428
Hurry up.

56
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,256
(Incoming call, Yao.
Answer, Reject)

57
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:39,147
Hello, what's up?

58
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:40,587
Mei, where are you now?

59
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:41,947
The project has a problem.

60
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:44,188
I'm almost there, just a bit of traffic.

61
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:45,747
The livestream link

62
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:46,627
was put up wrong.

63
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:47,708
It's supposed to be 27 yuan.

64
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,948
But now it's 2.7 yuan.

65
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:50,987
Over 10,000 orders have been placed.

66
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:02,348
Mei, what happened?

67
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:03,787
Nothing. Let's go upstairs.

68
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:05,188
- Rest assured.
- We'll...

69
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,188
- We'll come up with a solution today.
- Confirm the issue again.

70
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:08,827
Mei, you're finally here.

71
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:10,508
Alright, don't worry.

72
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:11,348
Mei, you're back.

73
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:12,427
What exactly is going on?

74
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:13,188
Mr. Chen blames

75
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:14,548
our new assistant broadcaster's

76
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:16,188
unclear communication with the platform.

77
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:17,508
The product was originally 40.

78
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:18,268
Livestream price

79
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:19,348
should have been 27.

80
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:20,548
Now suddenly, somehow...

81
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:22,428
- It has suddenly dropped to 2.7.
- Yes.

82
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:23,508
All the fans went crazy.

83
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:24,308
In one minute,

84
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:25,427
10,000 orders were placed.

85
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:27,192
When we realized it
and locked the orders,

86
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:28,856
over 300,000 yuan had been lost.

87
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:30,308
But...

88
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:31,747
Have they given an explanation?

89
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:32,387
Yes.

90
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,187
But they only agree to cover half.

91
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:35,508
They said when the link was up,

92
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,508
we didn't notice

93
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:37,188
immediately.

94
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:38,588
We share some responsibility.

95
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:39,949
Alright.

96
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,307
I'll contact the manufacturer.

97
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,588
No need, Mei.

98
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:43,429
The manufacturer

99
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:44,627
is surely overjoyed.

100
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:46,188
Someone covers the price difference.

101
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:47,069
And they got high sales

102
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,027
and gained advertising.

103
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:49,107
Exactly.

104
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:50,748
Mei Chengyi,

105
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,348
come to my office.

106
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:56,787
What should we do, Mei?

107
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:00,428
Alright.

108
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,787
I'll handle that old fellow.

109
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:03,428
Do you need me to come?

110
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:04,787
There are no vegetables.

111
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:06,148
No eggs, either.

112
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:08,588
I'll order some in a while.

113
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:09,387
Don't.

114
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:11,108
I'll just go to the market.

115
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:12,307
It's fresh and cheap.

116
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:13,107
Mr. You.

117
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,148
Grocery shopping.

118
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:16,267
That's a misconception
of your old ideas.

119
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:17,307
Foods sold on the apps

120
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:18,427
are fresh and convenient.

121
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,788
It can also save time.

122
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:20,628
If any issues,

123
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,827
you can contact them.

124
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:23,788
Save time?

125
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:26,347
For what?

126
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:27,587
Games?

127
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,548
As if your time

128
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:30,868
is so valuable.

129
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:32,467
I mean...

130
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:34,348
Youyou, you drive.

131
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:35,587
You come shopping with me.

132
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:38,068
Just think of it as
spending some casual time with me.

133
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:40,068
You're the customer
and you have the final say.

134
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:42,467
You...

135
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:46,147
Why are you stepping on my foot?

136
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:57,907
Smells good.

137
00:04:58,707 --> 00:04:59,707
Then buy one of these.

138
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:00,827
Here to buy groceries?

139
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:03,108
You too?

140
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:05,187
Isn't this Youyou?

141
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:06,267
Didn't go to work?

142
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,947
Accompany your mom here?

143
00:05:08,147 --> 00:05:08,668
Hi, auntie.

144
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:09,748
Youyou is beautiful.

145
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:11,507
Back in the country, still adjusting.

146
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:12,708
I let her stay at home

147
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,027
to spend more time with me.

148
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:15,947
I'm going over there to buy meat.

149
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:17,148
- Alright
- Talk later.

150
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:18,108
- Alright.
- Go ahead.

151
00:05:18,188 --> 00:05:19,188
Goodbye.

152
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:23,109
Let me tell you.

153
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,747
It's a pity for Mr. You's family.

154
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:25,947
The eldest daughter

155
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:27,747
was both capable and sensible.

156
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,307
She fell ill and died early.

157
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:30,348
They spent lots of money

158
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:31,747
on this second child

159
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:32,588
to send her abroad

160
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:33,867
for a mediocre university.

161
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:34,828
It's of no use at all.

162
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:36,228
Now she is staying at home.

163
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:37,508
When

164
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:38,627
playing chess downstairs,

165
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:40,347
Mr. You always complained to others.

166
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:41,628
So young.

167
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,988
Living off parents at home.

168
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,588
Wasn't studying in vain?

169
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:45,267
Do you know?

170
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:45,868
Now many

171
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:47,028
young people

172
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,067
are all lying flat.

173
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,147
What do you want to eat?

174
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:53,068
Let me try it.

175
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:56,708
That one.

176
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:57,788
Okay.

177
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:00,989
Don't tell me

178
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,387
that you have no responsibility.

179
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:04,228
Two groups put forward
so many proposals.

180
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:06,028
The company trusts you.

181
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,028
I have the thought
of wanting to help you.

182
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,067
Such an important proposal

183
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:10,147
was handed over to you.

184
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:11,627
Your chosen partner erred.

185
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:12,708
It's your mistake.

186
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:13,788
Understand?

187
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:15,387
I understand, Ms. Li.

188
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,387
I won't shirk responsibility.

189
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:18,628
But now I think

190
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,428
it's not the time
to pursue responsibility.

191
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:21,589
I'll have the team

192
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:22,867
come up with a PR plan quick

193
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:24,387
and a plan to recover losses.

194
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,347
Is that okay?

195
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:26,627
Later,

196
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,788
I can take responsibility
or pursue accountability.

197
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:29,868
What do you say?

198
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:32,308
Now there's a problem with one client.

199
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:33,948
Then aren't other

200
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:35,068
clients afraid?

201
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:37,548
Let me tell you.

202
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:38,668
I only give you one day

203
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:39,467
to solve this.

204
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:40,988
For all subsequent losses,

205
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,228
the company isn't liable.

206
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:43,308
Keep that in mind.

207
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:45,267
If not handled well,

208
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:47,147
I can't protect you this time.

209
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:51,068
I know, Ms. Li.

210
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,068
Thank you, Ms. Li.

211
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:02,907
Mom.

212
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:06,707
Hello, I'll have this piece.

213
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:08,188
Chop it finer.

214
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:11,147
Angry?

215
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:14,387
What I mean is,

216
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:15,827
after Xu left,

217
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:17,427
we notice you have

218
00:07:17,507 --> 00:07:18,668
some emotions to Mei Chengyi.

219
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:20,788
We have also reflected a bit.

220
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:22,827
Did we overlook your feelings?

221
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:25,187
We've been discussing it for ages.

222
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,468
Keep the best in the family.

223
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:28,788
We've always wanted to match you two up.

224
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:30,068
But who would've thought

225
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:31,307
that Xu

226
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:32,427
would suddenly appear.

227
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:33,507
Though,

228
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:35,028
we think she's nice,

229
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:37,027
but we definitely support you.

230
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:38,348
As long as you're happy,

231
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:39,029
then we can

232
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:40,507
break up any couple.

233
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,027
Mom, I was wrong.

234
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:42,788
I was wrong.

235
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:43,428
I don't like

236
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:45,387
Chengyi at all.

237
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:46,709
I'm angry

238
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:47,908
because I feel Mei Chengyi

239
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:48,988
is lying.

240
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:50,908
He seemed so set

241
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:51,668
on mourning

242
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:52,507
my sister forever,

243
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:53,109
that I wanted to

244
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:54,264
give him a chastity arch.

245
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,428
He even said Xu Kaixin is just...

246
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:58,027
Just what?

247
00:07:58,188 --> 00:07:59,747
It's done, 68.

248
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:00,827
68.

249
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,188
Okay.

250
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:03,788
Just playing.

251
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:05,348
And now look,

252
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:06,707
they've quickly gotten together.

253
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:08,308
I just feel pity for my sister.

254
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:10,427
I know

255
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:11,507
he has to move on.

256
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:12,988
But knowing and seeing it

257
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,387
are two different things.

258
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,267
When you were with street boys,

259
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:19,109
we've seen you

260
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:20,788
kissing and hugging many times.

261
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:21,628
Now you let

262
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,947
a man in his thirties engage in

263
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:24,387
a spiritual relationship?

264
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:26,228
Don't mention street boys.

265
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:27,507
Mom, I'm sorry.

266
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:30,988
Let me take it.

267
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:32,068
Let me take it.

268
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:35,227
Go, go, go. Let's go.

269
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:37,308
Seriously.

270
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:41,949
Ms. Xu,

271
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,388
you got divorced three years ago.

272
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:44,309
And now you remembered

273
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,428
to pursue the re-division
of divorce assets?

274
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:48,708
In these three years,

275
00:08:48,788 --> 00:08:50,387
my ex-husband has never contacted me.

276
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:51,308
But recently,

277
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:52,547
their whole family

278
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:53,188
wants to get

279
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:54,189
the custody of my son.

280
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,908
They often make their presence known.

281
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:58,107
They've also
done many despicable things.

282
00:08:58,308 --> 00:08:59,667
Since they won't stop,

283
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,469
then let it be so.

284
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:02,028
Yes, take the initiative.

285
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:03,907
They're addicted
to bullying good people.

286
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:04,788
Moreover, Kaixin

287
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,227
isn't someone they can bully.

288
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:07,707
She was kind of blind back then.

289
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:09,627
If you can't praise, don't.

290
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,627
Legally speaking,

291
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:14,428
if one spouse hides,

292
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:17,108
transfers, sells, or damages

293
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:18,947
and squanders
the couple's joint property,

294
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:20,108
during divorce,

295
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:21,747
this party can receive less or nothing.

296
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:22,748
After the divorce,

297
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:24,747
once the above behavior is discovered,

298
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:25,987
the other party can file a lawsuit

299
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:28,027
within the statute of limitations,

300
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:29,627
that is three years from the day

301
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:31,428
they know or should know it,

302
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:32,627
and request once again

303
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:34,828
to divide the couple's joint property.

304
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,867
That's even better.

305
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:37,228
Let's let go of three years'

306
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:38,308
resentment all together.

307
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:40,028
But there's an issue.

308
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:42,108
Legally speaking, there's no such thing

309
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:43,188
as a fake divorce.

310
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,627
So, the agreement you signed

311
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:47,308
to buy a cheaper house

312
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:48,828
in a good school district

313
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:49,987
is not valid.

314
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:52,588
But the two children are yours.

315
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:54,548
You, however, left with nothing.

316
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,388
Unless your children and your ex-husband

317
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,667
have no blood relationship,

318
00:09:57,747 --> 00:09:59,508
this is indeed unusual.

319
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:01,468
So, we have a chance of winning.

320
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:03,107
A paternity test is necessary.

321
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:04,028
Additionally,

322
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,108
if there's evidence

323
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,588
to prove that during the marriage,

324
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:07,907
your ex-husband indeed used

325
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:09,667
improper means to gain profits

326
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:10,907
and invaded your property,

327
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:13,028
then it would be even better.

328
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:14,548
Are you saying

329
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:16,027
that we need to gather more

330
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:17,507
evidence to file a lawsuit?

331
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:19,027
That's right, but I want

332
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:20,267
to remind you that

333
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:22,027
if it's audio evidence,

334
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:23,827
it must be obtained legally.

335
00:10:23,987 --> 00:10:24,628
Do not infringe

336
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,148
on other people's personal privacy.

337
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:26,989
Otherwise, it can't

338
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:28,388
be used as evidence.

339
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:30,588
You can record in public places,

340
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,428
as well as in your home or car,

341
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,588
using legal devices

342
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:35,147
to make normal audio and recordings.

343
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:36,508
These can be used as evidence.

344
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:39,267
Alright, we'll discuss it.

345
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:39,949
Thank you.

346
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:41,548
Okay, then discuss it yourselves.

347
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,227
It's been three years already.

348
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:51,707
Where to find the evidence?

349
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:54,268
Qian Hao is as cunning as a monkey.

350
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,188
He won't easily

351
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:56,268
leave evidence to you.

352
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,668
We must absolutely not alert him.

353
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,048
At the class reunion,
I have to endure him?

354
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,268
No, don't.

355
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,027
If you

356
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:03,908
speak gently

357
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:05,028
to them,

358
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:06,267
then Qian Hao and Xiaojiao

359
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:07,229
will be so scared,

360
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,388
that they can't sleep.

361
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:11,467
Makes sense.

362
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:12,627
These despicable people,

363
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,587
if not scolded a bit,
would overthink at home.

364
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,507
So, you see.

365
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:18,028
Just do whatever needs to be done.

366
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:19,468
Just don't mention the word

367
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:20,068
"lawsuit".

368
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:20,668
As long as we

369
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:21,867
collect all the evidence,

370
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,227
we'll file a lawsuit right away.

371
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:24,627
Didn't the lawyer just say,

372
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:25,429
public recordings

373
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:26,827
don't constitute an invasion of privacy,

374
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,268
and those done at home and in the car

375
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:30,227
are considered legal surveillance?

376
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:32,028
In this case,

377
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:34,227
there are still many opportunities.

378
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:35,667
This is good for us.

379
00:11:35,747 --> 00:11:36,988
You seem quite carefree.

380
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,908
Not worried at all.

381
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,308
What's there to be upset about?

382
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:42,508
Think about it.

383
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,468
I originally didn't have these assets,

384
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:45,148
and I have been

385
00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:46,827
living happily.

386
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:48,708
If I win this case

387
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:49,867
and get that money back,

388
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:51,707
it will bring me a fortune.

389
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:53,867
Life is already tough.

390
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:54,907
People at our age,

391
00:11:54,987 --> 00:11:55,868
middle-aged beauties,

392
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,428
shouldn't make life more difficult.

393
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,227
Our cheekbones will sag.

394
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:00,429
Who's middle-aged?

395
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:01,627
I'm not even married yet.

396
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:03,588
Do you know why

397
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:04,548
I love you so much?

398
00:12:04,628 --> 00:12:05,907
You're like a walking

399
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,428
emotion converter.

400
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:09,588
No matter how upsetting
things are to you,

401
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:10,388
you're positive

402
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:11,627
and output emotional value.

403
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:12,707
You can love,

404
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:14,587
but please don't love deeply.

405
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,188
I won't tease you.

406
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:18,148
You and Mei Chengyi,

407
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,548
what's going on between you two?

408
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:21,988
A twice-divorced man of his level

409
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:23,387
is sought-after

410
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:24,708
in my field.

411
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:25,508
I'm telling you.

412
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:27,068
He'll attract many female clients.

413
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:28,348
If you miss this chance,

414
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:29,309
I might take him away

415
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:30,707
to earn my membership fees.

416
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:31,788
You give it a try.

417
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,788
See if I dare to try.

418
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,467
Yes.

419
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:38,867
That's right.

420
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:39,547
You're right.

421
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:40,267
You're right.

422
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:40,868
Well...

423
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:41,907
We can't

424
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:43,668
shirk responsibility
onto each other now.

425
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:44,709
We need to think

426
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:46,627
how to minimize this loss.

427
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:48,069
Please.

428
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:49,708
Just apologize in the live stream.

429
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:50,787
Call to request a refund.

430
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,228
I believe many netizens

431
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:53,948
won't take advantage of this benefit.

432
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:55,028
Isn't that right?

433
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:56,268
And I

434
00:12:56,348 --> 00:12:58,188
am going to apologize
to the manufacturer now

435
00:12:58,188 --> 00:12:59,269
and see if they can accept

436
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:00,547
our latest compensation plan.

437
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:01,627
Okay?

438
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:03,188
Alright.

439
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:03,948
Thanks.

440
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,028
Thank you.

441
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:08,467
Mei, how is it going?

442
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,348
What can be done about it?

443
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:11,547
The anchor said,

444
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:12,349
before listing it,

445
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:13,467
they confirmed it with us.

446
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:14,827
Who was coordinating at that time?

447
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:17,428
Mainly because it was

448
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:18,429
past 2 a.m.

449
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,188
Everyone was groggy

450
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:20,989
and didn't expect

451
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:22,147
to make such a mistake.

452
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:23,308
Alright, stop.

453
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:24,627
Don't cry.

454
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:27,268
Sorry, Mei.

455
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:28,467
Stop.

456
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:30,948
I've troubled you.

457
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:31,787
I know.

458
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:32,867
You go busy yourself.

459
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:34,227
Go be busy.

460
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:35,987
Go.

461
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:43,349
Last night,

462
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:44,867
he just sent me a question mark.

463
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:46,627
I was asleep and missed it.

464
00:13:46,788 --> 00:13:47,828
I came here in a hurry

465
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:48,548
this morning.

466
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,908
I forgot about that.

467
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:51,268
Just send a question mark?

468
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:52,788
Is he

469
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:53,987
playing hard to get?

470
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:55,788
You know, ever since I saw

471
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,068
such a scumbag like Qian Hao,

472
00:13:57,148 --> 00:13:57,829
I don't even

473
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,068
think my dad is innocent.

474
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,707
Why are you thinking so much?

475
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:02,868
About dating.

476
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:04,068
You have to date first.

477
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:05,547
I got divorced,

478
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:06,508
and I'm fine.

479
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:07,708
How did it stress you out?

480
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:09,227
Afraid of men and marriage.

481
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:10,988
There are many scumbags

482
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,267
and scumbag women.

483
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:13,348
If you stay clear-eyed,

484
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:14,428
then you're fine.

485
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:15,747
That actually rhymes.

486
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:17,547
Besides,

487
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:18,469
if we're still

488
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:19,867
troubled by love right now,

489
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:21,428
that proves we're still young.

490
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,907
Do you know the biggest audience

491
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,707
for these idol dramas?

492
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:26,228
It's us,

493
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:27,428
middle-aged beauties,

494
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:28,867
who are dreaming of romance.

495
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:31,828
In this world,

496
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:33,068
these women are scolding men.

497
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:33,989
If there were no men,

498
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:35,107
and all women,

499
00:14:35,548 --> 00:14:36,627
then how boring is it?

500
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:39,068
Look at me. These past three years,

501
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:40,188
I've been vegan.

502
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:41,467
I've become out of shape.

503
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:44,108
I used to worry about you,

504
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:45,908
but now I'm worried about Mei Chengyi.

505
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:46,947
Middle-aged worker,

506
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:47,708
abused by the boss,

507
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:48,788
two kids,

508
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:49,788
parents

509
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:51,027
and former in-laws.

510
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:51,709
And now you

511
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:53,188
are staring with tiger-like focus.

512
00:14:53,987 --> 00:14:54,709
No idea if he

513
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:55,987
has enough energy.

514
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,068
I hope he has a good gym routine.

515
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,080
(Xu Kaixin)

516
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:14,392
(Xu Kaixin)

517
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:18,627
Five, four, three, two, one.

518
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:19,757
(Xu Kaixin
You have withdrawn a message.)

519
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:20,988
What's this trick?

520
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:22,068
Why did you redraw it?

521
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:23,828
This is playing hard to get.

522
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:24,589
Tease and run,

523
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:25,908
making him anxious.

524
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:32,508
Childish.

525
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:40,268
Every time

526
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:41,828
I come to this store,

527
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,468
sees everyone with bags big and small,

528
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:44,469
buying and leave,

529
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:45,788
I'm very envious.

530
00:15:46,908 --> 00:15:47,987
I have to say.

531
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:49,227
That master

532
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:50,908
was actually quite accurate.

533
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:53,788
The things for good luck

534
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,188
were there for under a day,

535
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,708
and Hu Xiaojiao actually got pregnant.

536
00:15:57,788 --> 00:15:59,428
This money was well spent.

537
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:01,587
I'm thinking about

538
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,707
finding him again in a couple of days.

539
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:05,227
Spend a little more money.

540
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,028
Maybe my illness will even be cured.

541
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:08,988
Mom, stop messing around, okay?

542
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,227
That's just a coincidence.

543
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:11,349
Coincidence.

544
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,188
Let's save some money
for medical expenses.

545
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:14,987
Why did you buy it anyway?

546
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:16,987
The child is still just a cell nucleus.

547
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:18,788
Talk about it later.

548
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:20,107
Son.

549
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:21,627
What's been wrong with you lately?

550
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,147
You've been glum

551
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:24,148
and easily irritable.

552
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:25,707
Are you hiding something from me?

553
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:27,388
No.

554
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,027
I don't want Hu Xiaojiao

555
00:16:29,107 --> 00:16:29,708
to be too smug.

556
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,027
Why tie her worth to

557
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:31,868
having children?

558
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:33,068
What if

559
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:34,747
she'll be arrogant?

560
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,428
Look at you, son.

561
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:37,989
I know

562
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:39,867
that you're a filial son.

563
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:41,589
Hu Xiaojiao

564
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,027
does have a lot of faults.

565
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:44,548
But she'll pregnant for ten months.

566
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:45,667
It's not easy, is it?

567
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:47,388
Let's accommodate her if we can.

568
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,627
For the child's sake.

569
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:54,907
This illness of mine...

570
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:55,988
I could land

571
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:58,068
in the hospital any day now.

572
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,148
I'm thinking

573
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,107
that when my body could still move,

574
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:03,268
I can prepare things for my grandson.

575
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:05,107
Come.

576
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:06,028
Buy it.

577
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:07,228
This one.

578
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,427
This one is also good.

579
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:10,667
This one is also good.

580
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:30,508
(N ways of natural miscarriage)

581
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,508
Oral medication.

582
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:43,028
It has no side effects.

583
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:48,068
Luckily, Hu Xiaojiao

584
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:49,708
is able to conceive.

585
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:51,348
If Xu Kaixin

586
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:53,427
really doesn't give Xiaomi back to us,

587
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:55,468
then with this baby,

588
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:56,827
I can also rest assured.

589
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,468
I even thought of a nickname.

590
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:00,867
Call him Duoduo.

591
00:18:01,228 --> 00:18:02,427
Qian Duoduo.

592
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:04,547
I still want to do

593
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:05,708
a heritage certification.

594
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:07,388
Half of the inheritance

595
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:08,468
will definitely be yours.

596
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:09,907
The other half is Duoduo's.

597
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:11,827
I want to infuriate Xu Kaixin

598
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:12,748
and make her regret

599
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:13,988
losing the mountain of gold.

600
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:15,427
Mom, this money can't be his.

601
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,108
Why?

602
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:20,668
Isn't this your son?

603
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:21,748
Who knows

604
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:25,027
whether if it's a boy?

605
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:26,107
Right?

606
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:29,387
That's true.

607
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,148
I was too excited.

608
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:32,429
Right,

609
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:33,587
if it's a girl,

610
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:34,708
then what should we do?

611
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:37,027
Right, Mom, Xiaomi

612
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:38,827
is your grandson for sure.

613
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:40,188
Just consider Hu Xiaojiao's

614
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:41,827
kid as a backup.

615
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:43,587
Okay, don't take it too seriously.

616
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:45,827
But you were right about one thing.

617
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,468
We must take advantage of this,

618
00:18:47,548 --> 00:18:49,028
to knock some sense into Xu Kaixin.

619
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:49,827
Let her

620
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:50,747
give back

621
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:51,827
Xiaomi's custody.

622
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:53,388
Right, she must know

623
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:54,787
Qian family's money

624
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:55,907
is all Xiaomi's.

625
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:57,147
Right?

626
00:18:58,228 --> 00:18:59,228
Yes.

627
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:01,147
What should we do now?

628
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,988
Stop talking nonsense.

629
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:44,788
Our demands are very clear.

630
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:46,468
Triple compensation.

631
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:49,268
The original listed price

632
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:53,067
plus the original price,

633
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:54,468
multiplied by three.

634
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,228
Send this to my company's account.

635
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:57,307
Then this is over.

636
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:58,387
Otherwise,

637
00:20:58,627 --> 00:20:59,867
see you in court.

638
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:01,867
Calm down.

639
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:03,307
Calm down for me.

640
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,507
Calm down, have some water.

641
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:05,389
- I'm furious.
- Come on.

642
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:06,907
Have some water.

643
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:10,187
I'm furious.

644
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:10,989
Do you think

645
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,587
it's simply these losses

646
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:13,788
on the books?

647
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,268
What's the situation now?

648
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:19,387
It's the peak sales period now.

649
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:21,107
If you don't want to cooperate,

650
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:23,307
then I can get other big influencers

651
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:24,627
to promote products.

652
00:21:25,228 --> 00:21:26,708
Sales will shoot up

653
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:27,908
rapidly.

654
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:30,067
This year's sales could also potentially

655
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,788
break records.

656
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:33,427
And what happened?

657
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:35,387
And what happened?

658
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,468
Triple compensation

659
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:39,427
is even going easy on you.

660
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,587
And you still try to bargain with me?

661
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:48,028
Such an ungrateful thing.

662
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:49,228
Such...

663
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:50,628
I got mad.

664
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,588
Come on, calm down.

665
00:21:51,668 --> 00:21:52,868
Calm down.

666
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:54,228
- Sit down.
- I'm furious.

667
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:55,387
Sit for a while.

668
00:21:55,468 --> 00:21:56,468
Calm down.

669
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:58,387
(When I was a kid
playing Street Fighter,)

670
00:21:58,387 --> 00:21:59,347
(defeating enemies,)

671
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:01,347
(I felt like the hero
of the entire world.)

672
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:03,308
(Only after growing up did I know)

673
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,708
(that was just)

674
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:05,709
(projection and outlet)

675
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,548
(for adults' failures
in the real society.)

676
00:22:08,268 --> 00:22:09,988
(Being abused yet powerless to resist.)

677
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:11,667
(Hanging on.)

678
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:13,667
(Smiling while being maltreated.)

679
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:15,908
(This is often the adult world's)

680
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:17,268
(cruel truth.)

681
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:18,787
Class one go.

682
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:19,508
(Bindong Sunshine Kindergarten Kunde Campus)
Let's wait.

683
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,068
Wait until class one has left.

684
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,188
Catch up.

685
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:24,508
Has he come out yet?

686
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:26,307
Yes. Over there.

687
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:26,907
There.

688
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:28,028
Let's go.

689
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,147
Wang Ziyi.

690
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:31,787
Wang Ziyi, your mom?

691
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:32,867
I see him.

692
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:34,587
Yes, the second one.

693
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:35,908
Goodbye.

694
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:36,988
Goodbye.

695
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:39,068
Alright, goodbye.

696
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:40,468
Wang Yuexin.

697
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:41,548
Great-aunt.

698
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:43,548
Are you happy?

699
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:44,788
Xiaomi.

700
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:49,308
- Xiaomi.
- Great-aunt.

701
00:22:49,427 --> 00:22:50,427
Grandma.

702
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:51,348
Great-aunt.

703
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:53,107
- Xiaomi.
- Xiaomi.

704
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:55,548
Xiaomi.

705
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:57,787
I know you, you're Dad.

706
00:22:57,867 --> 00:22:58,988
Sister secretly gave me

707
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:00,587
a look at your photo.

708
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:03,468
Yes, I'm Dad.

709
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:04,667
Your dad.

710
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:09,347
Lili.

711
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:13,788
- Bye.
- Xiaomi.

712
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:15,748
We're leaving.

713
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,627
You can't just take him away like that.

714
00:23:27,147 --> 00:23:28,147
How's it going?

715
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:30,907
Sorry.

716
00:23:31,147 --> 00:23:32,347
Did I hurt you?

717
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:34,587
Sit down and let's talk.

718
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:36,308
You've been struggling all day.

719
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:38,347
Alright, it's fine.

720
00:23:39,347 --> 00:23:40,347
That's how it is, Ms. Li.

721
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,228
About the live streaming.

722
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:43,387
Sixty-seven percent

723
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:44,627
effective refund.

724
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,027
I'm still continuously

725
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:47,147
communicating with them.

726
00:23:47,347 --> 00:23:48,708
The original manufacturer

727
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:50,708
insists that we pay triple compensation.

728
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:52,827
I really negotiated the whole afternoon.

729
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:57,308
They've temporarily agreed

730
00:23:57,427 --> 00:23:58,428
our live streaming team

731
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:00,748
will work double shifts
for three days straight.

732
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:03,148
The original slot fee
also remains unchanged.

733
00:24:03,228 --> 00:24:05,508
It's effectively
triple compensation as well.

734
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:08,788
If the company stays profitable,

735
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:10,228
then it's easier to explain.

736
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:11,907
But this isn't considered settled.

737
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,107
Okay, I understand.

738
00:24:14,347 --> 00:24:15,948
We need to watch the next three days

739
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:17,027
for our erroneous orders'

740
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:18,107
refund situations

741
00:24:18,228 --> 00:24:19,827
and the sales results

742
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:21,107
of this double working time.

743
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:23,428
I'm currently working

744
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:24,788
on a new promotion plan.

745
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:25,948
Okay.

746
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:27,427
This overtime is justified.

747
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:29,907
But don't expect any overtime pay.

748
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:33,427
Where are your group members?

749
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:35,347
Live streaming room and platform.

750
00:24:35,427 --> 00:24:36,188
I'll send the plan

751
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,228
to the group in a bit.

752
00:24:37,468 --> 00:24:38,428
Alright.

753
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:39,948
Better late than never.

754
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,147
Keep it up.

755
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:42,667
You...

756
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:44,548
Your back is bad.

757
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:45,548
Get it checked promptly.

758
00:24:45,827 --> 00:24:47,028
Don't blame others.

759
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:50,708
Come on, be good.

760
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:51,587
Eat and play.

761
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:52,667
Let's eat a bit.

762
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:54,228
Come over and have some.

763
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:55,388
Come on, Yule.

764
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:57,228
Listen to me, have a bite.

765
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:58,708
Be obedient.

766
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:00,187
After eating, you can play.

767
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:01,189
I'm telling you,

768
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,827
I'll complain to your dad.

769
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:03,907
Did you hear that?

770
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:05,267
That's a good.

771
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:05,908
Come.

772
00:25:05,988 --> 00:25:06,908
Let's eat.

773
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:07,787
So good.

774
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:09,708
Look, your sister is eating.

775
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:10,787
She's eating too.

776
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,107
Right, let's have a bite too.

777
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:13,187
No.

778
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:14,867
Eat if you want, forget it if not.

779
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:16,228
What's wrong with you?

780
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:17,468
You two spoiled them.

781
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:18,988
Let his dad manage the kid himself.

782
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:19,748
He's off the hook,

783
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:20,429
dumping the kids

784
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:21,548
and going out to have fun.

785
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:23,787
Bad auntie, you're wrong.

786
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,027
Dad is working overtime.

787
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:25,828
It's very tiring.

788
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:27,107
Bad auntie.

789
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:28,627
Yes, bad auntie.

790
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:30,867
Working overtime every day?

791
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,628
Your dad is the only busy person.

792
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:33,708
Alright?

793
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:37,107
Okay.

794
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:38,068
Don't cry.

795
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:38,988
Okay.

796
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:41,187
What are you doing? Alright.

797
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:41,827
Don't cry.

798
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:42,788
I'll talk to her.

799
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:43,908
Don't cry.

800
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:44,988
Don't cry.

801
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:45,908
Don't cry.

802
00:25:45,908 --> 00:25:46,748
Is this how you work

803
00:25:46,748 --> 00:25:47,748
as the household manager?

804
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,228
Is this the family you manage?

805
00:25:50,328 --> 00:25:51,148
Can't care for kids.

806
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,507
Made all the kids cry.

807
00:25:52,587 --> 00:25:53,988
Caused chaos.

808
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:55,388
You do anything all day

809
00:25:55,468 --> 00:25:56,748
but cause trouble for me.

810
00:25:57,427 --> 00:25:58,308
This month's salary

811
00:25:58,388 --> 00:25:59,428
is zero for you.

812
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:01,387
Don't think about scamming money
from me again.

813
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:04,468
What?

814
00:26:05,387 --> 00:26:06,387
Are you rebelling?

815
00:26:06,587 --> 00:26:07,628
Alright.

816
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,148
Isn't it like this every day?

817
00:26:09,228 --> 00:26:10,988
Why make a fuss today?

818
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:12,387
Stop it.

819
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:20,147
You...

820
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:21,228
Fine.

821
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:22,267
Don't come back

822
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,480
if you step out this door.

823
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:24,708
Support yourself.

824
00:26:31,228 --> 00:26:32,228
It's okay.

825
00:26:32,308 --> 00:26:34,147
Let's eat, stop crying.

826
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:37,228
- Come.
- Why not stop her

827
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:38,547
and chase her?

828
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:40,267
You just toss out

829
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:41,307
"stop arguing"

830
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:42,387
and that's all?

831
00:26:42,508 --> 00:26:44,308
Is she your daughter or not?

832
00:26:44,788 --> 00:26:46,388
I bet you two are relieved now.

833
00:26:46,468 --> 00:26:47,827
You just leave me to suffer alone.

834
00:26:48,068 --> 00:26:49,347
I think I understand now.

835
00:26:49,427 --> 00:26:50,668
None of you two

836
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:51,708
are good people.

837
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:52,587
Serves you right.

838
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:53,469
Listen to me.

839
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:54,907
I won't intervene today.

840
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:56,188
Without my intervention,

841
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:57,827
I want to see how you two vent.

842
00:26:58,988 --> 00:26:59,988
You...

843
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:03,628
Fine.

844
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:04,708
Fine.

845
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:51,667
Aren't you capable?

846
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:53,068
Why come back?

847
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:54,708
Dad.

848
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:58,507
Come, take a look.

849
00:27:58,587 --> 00:27:59,867
What did I buy for you?

850
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:01,107
Come.

851
00:28:01,627 --> 00:28:02,427
Do you like it?

852
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:03,627
- Yes.
- Yes.

853
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:04,788
Mom.

854
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:06,028
Dad.

855
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:06,869
Did you see anyone

856
00:28:06,949 --> 00:28:08,347
downstairs?

857
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:10,028
Who?

858
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:11,627
My auntie.

859
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,428
She argued with Grandpa

860
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:15,468
and ran out.

861
00:28:15,548 --> 00:28:16,868
Grandpa's very angry.

862
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:19,068
He asked Auntie never to come back.

863
00:28:20,107 --> 00:28:21,307
Isn't that because of you two

864
00:28:21,387 --> 00:28:22,508
don't eat properly?

865
00:28:22,627 --> 00:28:23,548
It's not that.

866
00:28:23,628 --> 00:28:25,548
Auntie spoke ill of Dad.

867
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,107
Yes, Auntie is bad.

868
00:28:27,187 --> 00:28:28,347
I don't want Auntie anymore.

869
00:28:29,347 --> 00:28:30,307
Auntie didn't mean that.

870
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:31,028
Come on.

871
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:32,147
You two go play.

872
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:33,268
Come, play.

873
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:36,107
I'll call Youyou.

874
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:40,427
Build blocks.

875
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:48,988
She left her phone

876
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:50,068
in her room.

877
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:52,068
Then...

878
00:28:52,228 --> 00:28:52,949
When she went out,

879
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:54,347
she was very emotional.

880
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:55,948
So, what should we do now?

881
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:57,027
What do you mean?

882
00:28:57,107 --> 00:28:58,428
Isn't it caused by you?

883
00:28:58,508 --> 00:28:59,587
Caused by me?

884
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:01,508
- You.
- Don't, dad.

885
00:29:01,788 --> 00:29:02,668
She can't go far

886
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:03,587
without her phone.

887
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:04,307
I'll find her.

888
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:05,948
Don't worry, she's not a child.

889
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:06,828
Not your daughter,

890
00:29:06,908 --> 00:29:08,188
of course, you're not worried.

891
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,787
Did you forget when her sister left,

892
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:11,507
she swallowed many sleeping pills

893
00:29:11,587 --> 00:29:13,107
and was sent to for a stomach pump?

894
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:14,787
Dad, that was an accident.

895
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:15,588
Accident?

896
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:17,308
If something happens, then it's real.

897
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:19,507
Are you a mad dog?

898
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:20,988
Isn't it always because of you?

899
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:21,708
Me?

900
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:23,147
Why me?

901
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:24,708
Dad.

902
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:26,788
I'll go find her.

903
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:27,948
I'll go find her.

904
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:31,468
- I want to go too.
- I want to go too.

905
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:32,708
You two stay here.

906
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:33,508
- No.
- No.

907
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,347
- I want to go.
- I want to go.

908
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:35,108
- I want to go.
- I want to go.

909
00:29:35,188 --> 00:29:36,347
Don't make me repeat it.

910
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:39,587
Go back.

911
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,347
You see, as the saying goes,

912
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,628
parents' words,

913
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,268
are the feng shui of their children.

914
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:07,428
Can't you give the kids

915
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:08,508
some verbal blessings?

916
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:10,068
Well, now it's good.

917
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:11,907
Chengyi is even angry.

918
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:13,427
You...

919
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:14,429
You've done a lot

920
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:15,748
and gets no good out of it.

921
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,667
Just because of your foul mouth.

922
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:33,868
Sorry.

923
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:34,948
It's fine.

924
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:42,708
(Only three seconds in the elevator)

925
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:43,669
(are when adults)

926
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:45,068
(show their truest emotions.)

927
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:46,587
(What's funny)

928
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,587
(is that most of us)

929
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:49,988
(even find these three seconds)

930
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:51,147
(a luxury.)

931
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:35,587
Let's play a game.

932
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:42,068
Dami, do you like it when I come?

933
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:47,147
Xiaomi.

934
00:31:47,347 --> 00:31:48,347
Want to fly on a plane?

935
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,308
Come on, take off.

936
00:31:52,548 --> 00:31:54,107
Flying.

937
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:56,427
Fly up.

938
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,824
(Happiness)

939
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,228
(It must be the way)

940
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:11,028
(I opened it.)

941
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:12,147
(Or, did I)

942
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:13,068
(enter another)

943
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,468
(parallel universe?)

944
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:26,308
You are back.

945
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:33,587
(This is my daughter.)

946
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:38,867
(This is my son.)

947
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,148
(And this is Lili.)

948
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,228
(That's right.)

949
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:46,308
(But these two...)

950
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:47,908
(Why are they here?)

951
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:49,068
(Can anyone tell me)

952
00:32:49,308 --> 00:32:49,988
(in this space,)

953
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:50,988
(what's our relationship?)

954
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:51,988
- Mom.
- Mom is back.

955
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:53,468
Kaixin.

956
00:32:53,627 --> 00:32:54,587
Why come back so late?

957
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:56,308
I called you and you didn't answer.

958
00:33:06,627 --> 00:33:08,507
I picked up Xiaomi from school today.

959
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:09,988
I saw Qian Hao with his mom.

960
00:33:10,068 --> 00:33:11,907
I didn't want to pay attention
to him at all.

961
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:13,867
But Xiaomi saw his dad

962
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:15,548
and seemed very happy.

963
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:18,988
I thought I was in

964
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:20,308
a parallel world.

965
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:22,228
Nonsense.

966
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:23,107
I mean...

967
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:23,869
But you can't

968
00:33:23,949 --> 00:33:25,308
let them come here.

969
00:33:26,827 --> 00:33:28,267
Qian Hao and his mom

970
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:30,347
said they want to talk to you

971
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:32,587
about the future inheritance issues.

972
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,548
I've called you, but you didn't answer.

973
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:36,387
I recalled

974
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:38,068
Dami said before

975
00:33:38,347 --> 00:33:40,107
"Do you want money or face"?

976
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:42,068
My mind got confused

977
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:43,468
and I brought them back.

978
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:44,548
You old lady.

979
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:45,788
Always about money.

980
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:47,068
Then I...

981
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:48,667
Did I make a mistake?

982
00:33:49,347 --> 00:33:50,988
It's okay, I'm here.

983
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,068
Well,

984
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,747
we've had enough fun, right?

985
00:33:58,827 --> 00:33:59,709
There's not much food.

986
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,308
So, I won't keep you for dinner.

987
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:03,188
Kaixin, can you let the kids

988
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:04,468
stay with my mom a bit longer?

989
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:05,867
Let's go out and talk.

990
00:34:06,468 --> 00:34:07,468
Kaixin.

991
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:10,028
You know my condition, right?

992
00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:11,587
Let me spend more time with them.

993
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:12,667
How about it?

994
00:34:13,348 --> 00:34:14,548
(Really a good actor.)

995
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:15,868
(If I hadn't found out)

996
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:17,587
(the filthy things you did secretly,)

997
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:18,188
(maybe)

998
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:19,908
(you would have fooled me again.)

999
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,267
Okay, let's talk.

1000
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:23,667
Let's go.

1001
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:27,307
Xiaomi.

1002
00:34:27,988 --> 00:34:28,988
We can play now.

1003
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,388
Your mom has left.

1004
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,248
(Joy)

1005
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:41,908
Go ahead.

1006
00:34:48,147 --> 00:34:49,227
How have you been lately?

1007
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:52,988
Just be straight.

1008
00:34:56,707 --> 00:34:58,028
Hu Xiaojiao is pregnant.

1009
00:34:58,187 --> 00:34:59,187
Congratulations.

1010
00:35:01,948 --> 00:35:03,028
I don't know why

1011
00:35:04,307 --> 00:35:05,747
but I just can't be happy.

1012
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:09,028
I keep thinking about

1013
00:35:09,948 --> 00:35:11,707
you with Dami.

1014
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:15,108
That was one of the

1015
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:16,348
happiest times of my life.

1016
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:18,787
When you had Xiaomi,

1017
00:35:19,388 --> 00:35:21,107
you were so beautiful.

1018
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:23,668
Qian Hao.

1019
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:24,748
Your desire to perform

1020
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:25,349
is strong.

1021
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:26,507
But don't do it

1022
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:27,389
in front of me.

1023
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:28,828
Lili told me

1024
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:29,667
you need

1025
00:35:29,747 --> 00:35:31,627
to talk about our property distribution.

1026
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:34,428
Kaixin.

1027
00:35:37,388 --> 00:35:38,388
Xu Kaixin.

1028
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:40,107
Or Ms. Xu.

1029
00:35:41,787 --> 00:35:42,587
Alright.

1030
00:35:42,747 --> 00:35:44,187
Xu Kaixin, okay.

1031
00:35:44,348 --> 00:35:45,348
I know.

1032
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:46,828
I know in your heart,

1033
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:47,429
I'm just

1034
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:48,948
a complete scoundrel.

1035
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,107
But I regret it

1036
00:35:53,187 --> 00:35:54,307
very much now.

1037
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:55,269
Especially today,

1038
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:56,868
I spent an afternoon with the kids.

1039
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,428
I truly realized

1040
00:35:58,508 --> 00:36:00,508
what I've really missed over the years.

1041
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:01,988
My mom wants a grandson.

1042
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:03,388
She's gone crazy, you know?

1043
00:36:03,468 --> 00:36:04,908
She's even going to make a will now,

1044
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:05,749
to leave everything

1045
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:07,308
to the child in Hu Xiaojiao's belly.

1046
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:09,107
Can I agree to this?

1047
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:09,869
Impossible.

1048
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:10,908
I have to stop her.

1049
00:36:10,988 --> 00:36:12,187
We need to chat.

1050
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:12,789
Right?

1051
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:14,307
In my heart,

1052
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:15,547
Hu Xiaojiao's kid

1053
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:16,828
will never compare

1054
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:17,908
to Dami and Xiaomi.

1055
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:21,068
Qian Hao.

1056
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:21,708
I think

1057
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:23,388
you're really outstanding.

1058
00:36:24,227 --> 00:36:25,308
You keep refreshing

1059
00:36:25,388 --> 00:36:27,627
my understanding of the word shameless.

1060
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:30,028
I suggest you go to the hospital,

1061
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,027
to get treated

1062
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:31,668
well

1063
00:36:31,748 --> 00:36:33,388
for your schizophrenia.

1064
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:34,627
I don't know what

1065
00:36:34,707 --> 00:36:35,469
happened between

1066
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:36,587
you and Hu Xiaojiao.

1067
00:36:36,587 --> 00:36:37,188
However,

1068
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:39,508
it is you who tripped up my cake shop

1069
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:40,948
and show loyalty here,

1070
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:42,627
my ex-husband.

1071
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:43,268
I wonder does

1072
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:43,989
Hu Xiaojiao know

1073
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,027
she has such

1074
00:36:45,107 --> 00:36:46,147
an excellent husband?

1075
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:47,707
We're talking about us.

1076
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:48,908
Why mention Hu Xiaojiao?

1077
00:36:48,988 --> 00:36:49,988
Hu Xiaojiao.

1078
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:51,187
Did you hear that?

1079
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:53,067
(Hu Xiaojiao)
Please manage your own husband

1080
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:55,548
stop him from trying to
make him presence in front of me.

1081
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,348
Say hello.

1082
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:02,548
Xu Kaixin.

1083
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:04,707
You have no sense of chivalry.

1084
00:37:05,548 --> 00:37:06,868
This is called shamelessness.

1085
00:37:06,948 --> 00:37:08,388
But I learned it all from you.

1086
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:09,747
What a joy!

1087
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:14,348
I...

1088
00:37:16,508 --> 00:37:17,787
She has improved.

1089
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:24,508
I think I should also go find her.

1090
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,428
Stop.

1091
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,548
If you can't find my daughter,

1092
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:32,348
then don't come back.

1093
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:17,307
(Come on, sis, you go first.)

1094
00:39:22,948 --> 00:39:23,948
Good.

1095
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:24,908
Look at me.

1096
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:25,988
Okay?

1097
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:32,948
Sis, you're amazing.

1098
00:39:33,587 --> 00:39:34,787
See, like this.

1099
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,429
Not bad.

1100
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:40,988
I hit two this time.

1101
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:42,707
Two!

1102
00:39:43,068 --> 00:39:44,068
Come on, again.

1103
00:39:46,908 --> 00:39:47,948
Great job, sis.

1104
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,667
I'll find another one for you.

1105
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:50,948
Okay.

1106
00:39:58,348 --> 00:39:59,348
Youyou.

1107
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:03,908
Youyou.

1108
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:08,508
Where did she run off to?

1109
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:11,948
Youyou.

1110
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:25,548
Youyou.

1111
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:27,547
Youyou.

1112
00:40:27,627 --> 00:40:28,627
Chengyi?

1113
00:40:29,787 --> 00:40:30,948
I'm here.

1114
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:32,107
Where?

1115
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:33,548
Chengyi.

1116
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:34,787
I'm here.

1117
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:39,508
Oh my.

1118
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:42,508
Oh my.

1119
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:46,227
I finally found you.

1120
00:40:46,948 --> 00:40:47,948
I mean...

1121
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:49,028
Without a phone,

1122
00:40:49,108 --> 00:40:50,147
you run away from home.

1123
00:40:50,707 --> 00:40:52,508
Do you know that your mom and dad
are worried?

1124
00:40:53,028 --> 00:40:54,107
They won't be.

1125
00:40:54,348 --> 00:40:55,028
They can't wait

1126
00:40:55,108 --> 00:40:56,388
to get rid of me, this burden.

1127
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:01,747
I'm afraid the burden isn't you.

1128
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:03,147
It's the three of us.

1129
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,747
Alright, let's go back.

1130
00:41:05,627 --> 00:41:06,349
I'll try my best

1131
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:08,348
to trouble your parents less.

1132
00:41:08,828 --> 00:41:10,508
They're getting older.

1133
00:41:10,747 --> 00:41:11,747
And it's quite hard.

1134
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:12,628
Let's go.

1135
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:13,948
That's not what I meant.

1136
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,147
Chengyi, do you

1137
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:19,348
want to cut ties with us,

1138
00:41:20,508 --> 00:41:21,309
because

1139
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:22,627
of your new girlfriend?

1140
00:41:26,388 --> 00:41:28,107
I know women can be unreasonable.

1141
00:41:29,348 --> 00:41:30,068
I didn't expect

1142
00:41:30,148 --> 00:41:31,747
they can be this unreasonable.

1143
00:41:32,147 --> 00:41:33,627
You were afraid that your parents

1144
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:34,707
would meddle in this

1145
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:35,868
and told me a girlfriend

1146
00:41:35,948 --> 00:41:37,027
would break their hopes.

1147
00:41:37,107 --> 00:41:37,628
Why are you

1148
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,107
blaming me now?

1149
00:41:39,187 --> 00:41:40,268
I have no feelings

1150
00:41:40,348 --> 00:41:41,348
for you.

1151
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,428
I'm just standing up for my sister.

1152
00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:45,988
You changed your heart too fast.

1153
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:47,507
You kept telling me that you

1154
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:49,187
were only on a blind date with Kaixin,

1155
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,787
and just asking her for help.

1156
00:41:52,107 --> 00:41:53,587
But you got involved so quickly.

1157
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:56,587
Don't you feel sorry for my sister?

1158
00:41:57,587 --> 00:42:00,028
Once people leave,
feelings fade quickly.

1159
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:01,948
At least transition a bit.

1160
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,187
I know your feelings for your sister.

1161
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:07,908
I don't want to lie.

1162
00:42:07,988 --> 00:42:09,627
I did indeed have some feelings

1163
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:10,948
for Xu Kaixin.

1164
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:13,789
However,

1165
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,508
I didn't feel I did wrong
by your sister.

1166
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,747
Your sis left
three and a half years ago.

1167
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:19,307
No matter who I'm with in the future,

1168
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:20,548
your sister

1169
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:22,508
is the irreplaceable love of my life.

1170
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:24,268
On the other hand,

1171
00:42:24,348 --> 00:42:25,428
I'm not a saint.

1172
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:26,228
I'm not some kind

1173
00:42:26,308 --> 00:42:27,787
of idol drama male protagonist.

1174
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,227
I'm just an ordinary,

1175
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:31,508
middle-aged man.

1176
00:42:32,707 --> 00:42:33,468
How could I live in

1177
00:42:33,548 --> 00:42:34,787
widowerhood for a lifetime?

1178
00:42:35,348 --> 00:42:37,067
No, if you...

1179
00:42:37,147 --> 00:42:38,187
Help!

1180
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:39,509
Someone jumped into the river.

1181
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:40,948
Hurry, help!

1182
00:42:47,627 --> 00:42:48,627
I can't swim.

1183
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:50,107
I'm afraid to go in.

1184
00:42:50,587 --> 00:42:51,349
Help!

1185
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:52,507
Did anyone call the police?

1186
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:53,869
- Go down there.
- Find a pole.

1187
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:55,307
Pull him up.

1188
00:42:55,627 --> 00:42:56,908
I'll call.

1189
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:58,067
- Well...
- Save him.

1190
00:42:58,147 --> 00:42:59,147
