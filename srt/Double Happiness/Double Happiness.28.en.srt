How did it go?

17
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:42,039
We'll visit the notary.

18
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:43,998
What for?

19
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,239
To sign an agreement.

20
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:47,158
Qian Hao said that

21
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,798
if he ever takes Xiaomi away
without my permission,

22
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:51,159
he'll give me my share

23
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,239
of the apartment.

24
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,479
I...

25
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:55,438
I can't believe it.

26
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:56,599
I can't, either.

27
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,438
People don't change.

28
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,558
Then why are you signing it?

29
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:01,600
I can't keep his son

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,998
away from him forever.

31
00:02:03,278 --> 00:02:05,158
This is an extra security.

32
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,358
I've made up my mind.

33
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:07,798
If it happens again,

34
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:09,279
we'll take back the apartment.

35
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,838
H-He accepted our WeChat friend request.

36
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,759
That's why I'm the leader.

37
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,879
It's all about the insight.

38
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,479
You said it yourself.

39
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,279
They're getting

40
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:22,479
a divorce, aren't they?

41
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,878
Their family is falling apart.

42
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:24,998
That's the basic fact.

43
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,318
One way didn't work.

44
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:28,358
So we had to try something else.

45
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:30,558
It's only natural for the husband

46
00:02:30,638 --> 00:02:31,758
to repay his wife's debts.

47
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:32,480
That's right.

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,358
Do your job properly

49
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,279
or the fine doubles.

50
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,078
Okay.

51
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:41,678
I have a photo of his wife.

52
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,159
This woman is so full of

53
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:44,200
herself

54
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,958
and posts selfies every day.

55
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,279
I can use AI to swap faces.

56
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:49,319
Listen.

57
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,639
I'll download a porno.

58
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,640
Do a face-swap

59
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,798
and send it to her husband.

60
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,038
Even scammers have to keep up

61
00:02:55,118 --> 00:02:55,839
with the times,

62
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,398
or we'll be left in the dust.

63
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,680
I have so many pornos

64
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,838
in my folder.

65
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:01,359
This one.

66
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,439
Open it.

67
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,279
This one.

68
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:04,479
Open it. Yeah.

69
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,319
Get up.

70
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,439
Get up.

71
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:10,199
What's wrong with you?

72
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:12,238
Get up.

73
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:14,118
Look at you.

74
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,318
You don't want

75
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:17,239
to get divorced now?

76
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,118
Fine.

77
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,479
I'll take you to him.

78
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:20,878
Come on.

79
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,078
I'm divorcing him.

80
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,999
Only a fool wouldn't divorce him.

81
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,358
That's right.

82
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:26,759
It's just a divorce.

83
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,518
Why do you look so beaten up

84
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,719
as if you're heartbroken?

85
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:31,959
Listen.

86
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,519
Your aunt went to buy

87
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,199
particularly tasty Shumai.

88
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,758
Get up and get dressed.

89
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:38,038
Let's have Shumai.

90
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,479
Mom, I won't have it.

91
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,118
Eating is no fun.

92
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,999
Drinking is no fun.

93
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,319
Life is no fun.

94
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:47,199
Shumai is so tasty.

95
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,519
Start over.

96
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,598
Let go of the past.

97
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:51,678
Get up.

98
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:53,518
I won't have it.

99
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:02,359
Shumai is so tasty.

100
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,159
You can't find it abroad.

101
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,279
Are you sure?

102
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,879
Then I'll have them all.

103
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,279
- Go ahead.
- I'm leaving.

104
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,518
Eat more.

105
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,078
Shumai is so tasty.

106
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,518
You don't want to have it.

107
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:22,359
You can't find it abroad.

108
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:55,998

What are you doing?

117
00:05:57,838 --> 00:05:59,198
A hundred thousand is no joke.

118
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:00,398
Three hundred thousand?

119
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,438
They are getting divorced.

120
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:04,759
What fool would pay 300,000 yuan
for his ex-wife?

121
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,998
Did you forget

122
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:07,359
what the teacher said?

123
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,479
You get less than

124
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:10,598
what you expect.

125
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,038
We want 100,000 yuan.

126
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,519
We must allow him

127
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:14,838
(High EQ Training)
to bargain.

128
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,278
What are these?

129

I'm impressed.

130
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,198
So professional.

Guide books.

132
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:23,839
Take a look.

133
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,518
Let me see.

134
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:25,598
Let me see.

135
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,278
That's money well spent.

136
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:50,278
Hello, there.

Mom and Dad

139
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,679
have been so quiet these days.

140
00:06:58,038 --> 00:06:59,518
They don't text me

141
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,158
or chase after me.

142
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,319
The serenity

143
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,598
is giving me the creeps.

144
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:09,319
And my mentor

145
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,758
said he was sick

146
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,278
and just quit.

147
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:14,599
It's been almost two weeks.

148
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,638
He didn't answer calls
or reply to WeChat.

149
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:17,919
I'm here

150
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,359

I suspect that he's out for fun,

154
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,879
But, Xin.

155
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,958
I sleep very well

156

157
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:36,598
It feels like

158
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,759
you are watching over me.

159
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:14,558
I'm going back to work.

160

169
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,199
May I have a word with you?

170
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,439
Yeah, sure.

171
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,519
Let's go.

172
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,679

175

She's still very weak.

176
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,158
How about this?

177
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:05,039
I'll send the kids over after school.

178
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,118
Transfer 5,000 yuan to me.

179

What?

180

Again, I want a deposit.

182
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:12,240
come home happy,

183
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,358
I'll refund you.

186
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,199

00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,559
I also brought you

194
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,158
a helper to distribute flyers.

195
00:09:32,158 --> 00:09:33,358
(Blooming business)
Song Ran, say hi.

196
00:09:33,878 --> 00:09:34,878
Ms. Xu.

197
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:36,839
Could you please hurry?

198
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,119
Don't make us anxious.

199
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:38,798
Okay?

200
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:39,639
Hurry up.

201
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,399
Okay, I'll be right there.

202
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,519
Okay.

203
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,679
Who is it?

204
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,799
Song Ran and Xiaoxiao.

205
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,559
They got married.

206
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:50,078
What?

207
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:55,439
Life is unpredictable.

208
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:12,798
(Ms. Li.)

209
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,639
(Mei Chengyi went to the HR office.)

210
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,639
(Non-compete clause.)

211
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:29,358
(Make sure he signs it.)

212
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,798
Don't be shy.

213
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:31,399
Just

214
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,798
make yourself at home.

215
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:33,878
(Make sure he signs non-compete clause.)
Relax.

216
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:35,039
Come on.

217
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,319
I'll get you some snacks.

218
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,358
Help yourself, alright?

219
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,240
So,

220
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,878
did you enjoy your annual leave?

221
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,360
It was alright.

222
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,599
Those were the happiest days

223
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,878
since I started working.

224
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,878
You had fun

225
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,958
while we were in a chaos.

226
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,239
Are you going to

227
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:56,598
talk about the layoffs?

228
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,758
Didn't Ms. Li tell you?

229
00:10:58,838 --> 00:10:59,838
So spicy.

230
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,118
Why is it so spicy?

231
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,079
It's about the layoffs.

232
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,278
But it may not be

233
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:06,519
what you have in mind.

234
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,839
We're going to lay off

235
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,078
Ms. Li

236
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:11,319
and make you take her place.

237
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:15,519
Wait, that's not funny at all.

238
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:16,839
I'm not joking.

239
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,878
I'm very serious.

240
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,319
How can I joke about that?

241
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:20,119
Want some?

242
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:20,998
No, thanks.

243
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,519
Alright then, it's all for me.

244
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:23,878
You see.

245
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,239
My uncle just gives orders,

246
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,199
and I end up

247
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,239
offending people.

248
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,439
In the end,

249
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,119
if I lay off people he likes,

250
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,080
I must

251
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,439
beg them to stay.

252
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,918
Right? We're all just employees.

253
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:35,720
Let's have some

254
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,919
mutual understanding.

255
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,238
Wait.

256
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:39,518
Weren't you going to

257
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,638
disband our team?

258
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:41,838
Is that possible?

259
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,358
While you were on leave,

260
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:44,998
your team stopped working.

261
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,959
The sales numbers of branch office

262
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,479
on the weekly and monthly reports

263
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,559
became so disappointing.

264
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,878
You think the head office

265
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,159
can't see the problem?

266
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,319
My uncle just returned from abroad.

267
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,398
He's serious about

268
00:11:55,478 --> 00:11:56,519
establishing authority.

269
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:57,838
If you ask me,

270
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,559
Ms. Li is just

271
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,398
too young and naive

272
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:02,518
with too many tricks.

273
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:03,758
She wants to take credit

274
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:05,078
for the work

275
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,479
you guys do for her

276
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,038
while hiding your contributions

277
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:08,720
and pinning

278
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,238
all the problems on you.

279
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,038
That's why the head office

280
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:13,919
misunderstood your team.

281
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,320
Don't blame us

282
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,758
for laying her off.

283
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:18,118
She's a bad influence.

284
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,798
But

285
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:20,919
no matter what,

286
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,398
she is my mentor.

287
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:23,079
Yeah.

288
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,838
I never said she wasn't.

289
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,758
Your mentor said

290
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:26,679
that she could

291
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,238
cover for you when you took leave.

292
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:30,158
But she can't replace you

293
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:31,799
if the company lays you off.

294
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,320
Rest assured.

295
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,358
Everything is under my control.

296
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,159
I have re-evaluated the situation.

297
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:41,199
Your mentor is a senior executive.

298
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,959
Her annual salary, bonus,

299
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,199
and social security fund are top-notch.

300
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,159
We almost offered her equity incentives.

301
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:47,960
Fortunately,

302
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,599
this problem occurred.

303
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,439
She finally admitted to me

304
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,200
that your team

305
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,199
was the main artery of the department,

306
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:55,638
which was completely different

307
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:56,878
from the annual reports

308
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,199
she submitted before.

309
00:12:58,439 --> 00:12:59,320
I have double-checked

310
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,559
the situation.

311
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,159
Firing her is the best way

312
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:04,399
to reduce costs and increase

313
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,199
efficiency.

314
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,639
Sorry.

315
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,919
(My ex-husband is here again.
We signed a new agreement.)

316
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,199
Of course.

317
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,878
It's a small business circle.

318
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,199
I know who you've been

319
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:25,960
in touch with.

320
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,598
I know them by name.

321
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,998
Listen.

322
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:30,038
Once Ms. Li leaves,

323
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:31,399
you'll take her place.

324
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,480
The base salary

325
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,839
and authority level will

326
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,359
far exceed your current position.

327
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,878
But let me make it clear.

328
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:37,678
After she leaves,

329
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:39,519
we need to lay off two more people.

330
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,958
(Is Kaixin in trouble?)

331
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,559
(Not tempted at all?)

332
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:49,159
(Other companies)

333
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,279
(made better offers.)

334
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,359
(This is bad.)

335
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,279
(We're going to incur a major expense.)

336
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:55,958
How about this?

337
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:57,838
We can discuss the commission rate

338
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,720
to make sure

339
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,919
you're happy with it.

340
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,559
Sorry.

341
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:02,719
Listen.

342
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,479
I have something urgent to attend to.

343
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,278
I see what you're

344
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:05,999
offering.

345
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,158
I'll think about it.

346
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:08,238
I have to go.

347
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,319
Wait.

348
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,758
It's over.

349
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:13,639
This is bad.

350
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,719
If we can't keep him,

351
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,559
we will suffer great losses.

352
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:18,998
Wasn't I

353
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:20,078
sincere enough?

354
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,679
No way.

355
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:22,560
The problem

356
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,679
lies in the snacks.

357
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:26,878
Am I too inexperienced?

358
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,439
Why is it so spicy?

359
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,039
Dad.

360
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,279
You're back.

361
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,519
How's my mom?

362
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:44,319
She had a noodle

363
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,519
and fell asleep again.

364
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:01,878
Dad.

365
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:04,839
Forget it if you can't do it.

366
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,678
I'll get an auntie

367
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:06,758
to do the chores.

368
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:11,238
Do you want to make your mom angry?

369
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,279
You'll hire a woman to cook for me?

370
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:14,519
Imagine

371
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,159
how she's going to react.

372
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:17,878
I'll hire a guy.

373
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,958
Alright?

374
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,519
Forget it.

375
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,998
It's weird to have

376
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:23,159
a strange man at home.

377
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,718
I-I'll get used to it.

378
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,998
Before I retired, I realized

379
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:31,519
that people have to embrace changes.

380
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:38,358
I'll take a nap.

381
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:50,776
(Give me 300,000 yuan.
Or I'll release this video.)

382
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:27,559
(It was you that night?)

383
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,639
He replied.

384
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:36,758
He replied.

385
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,358
It really got him fooled.

386
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,718
He thought it was me in that video.

387
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,399
This fool

388
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,959
thought he got cheated on.

389
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,878
That's why he's getting a divorce.

390
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,439
You annoying woman.

391
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,439
You could have let us

392
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,080
scam you

393
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,278
for 5,000 yuan.

394
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:55,838
But you had to get 10,000 from us.

395
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,159
Every cause has its effect

396
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:00,078
and your retribution is me.

397
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:04,718
What do we reply?

398
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:07,998
What do we reply?

399
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:08,959
Add fuel

400
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,679
to the fire and make it burn.

401
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:11,799
You do it.

402
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:12,879
Reply to him.

403
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:23,998
(Cut the crap.)

404
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,758
(Spend money to avoid disaster.)

405
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,359
(Give me the money)

406
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,199
(and I'll delete this video.)

407
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:30,399
(I swear)

408
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,159
(I won't keep a backup.)

409
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:33,919
(But if you don't pay,)

410
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:36,119
(I'll post it online)

411
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,638
(for everyone to enjoy)

412
00:17:37,718 --> 00:17:39,158
(your wife's seductive look.)

413
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:40,238
(Everyone will know)

414
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:41,718
(you've been cheated on.)

415
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:43,439
(Don't call the police.)

416
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:45,919
(They are too busy)

417
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,079
(to handle this trivial matter.)

418
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,679
(I'll post it on foreign websites.)

419
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,679
(Your reputation will be ruined.)

420
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,199
(And you can't catch me.)

421
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:55,478
(Think it through.)

422
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:56,159
(You only have)

423
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,679
(12 hours to think.)

424
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,518
(Pay me tonight.
Otherwise, see you online.)

425
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:21,528
(Are you there?)
(Hu Xiaojiao enabled friend request)

426
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,758
So much nagging.

427
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,478
Why did you reply so much to him?

428
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:37,559
That's not imposing.

429
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:38,718
It's just endless

430
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,079
and boring.

431
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:42,678
I would keep it simple

432
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:43,758
and domineering.

433
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,079
Pay me.

434
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:46,399
Or I'll ruin you.

435
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,278
Back to work.

436
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:56,879
Back to work.

437
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:00,878

Alright?

Over there.

445
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:08,439
Pretty lady.

446
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:09,319

It's free.

451
00:19:13,238 --> 00:19:14,520
- Really?
- Try the cakes.

452
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,678
Pretty ladies.

453
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:16,638
Nice to meet you.

454
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:18,198

456
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,718
Thank you so much

457
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:22,359
for lining up.

458
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:22,959
Hello.

459
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,119
Check out our cake shop.

460
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,198
We just opened.

461
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:26,478
We have everything.

462
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:27,999
Egg tarts and all kinds of bread.

463
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,318
Come on in.

464
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,238
Take a look.

465
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:31,238
Buy one, get one free.

466
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:32,039
It's a good deal.

467
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:32,639
Hello.

468
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:33,759
Everything is half-price.

469
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,199
Buy one, get one free.

470
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,079
Seventy-five yuan.

471
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,919
Okay, thank you.

472
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,718
Would you like something else?

473
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,398
Taro and meat floss sandwich.

474
00:19:42,478 --> 00:19:43,478
We have them here.

475
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:44,319
You're lucky.

476
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:45,199
It's the last one.

477
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,798
Let me get it for you.

478
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:49,879
Lili, pack it.

479
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,038
Give it to me. Okay.

480
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:52,878
- Anything else?
- That's it.

481
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,999
- Okay.
- The taro and meat floss sandwich

482
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:55,600
sells well.

483
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,919
Make more next time.

484
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:58,280
- Coming.
- Seventy-five yuan.

485
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,439
Coming.

486
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:00,600
Here.

487
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,718
Please come again.

488
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:02,558
Thank you.

489
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:03,639
Come on.

490
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,958
Give it to me.

491
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:05,958
Lili.

492
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:06,718
I'll restock.

493
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:07,798
Is it hot?

494
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,198
Want something to drink?

495
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:09,759
It's so hot.

496
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,239
Give her

497
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,279
a cold beverage.

498
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,359
Wait.

499
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,278
No, Lili.

500
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:16,079
No cold beverages for me.

501
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:16,958
Ms. Xu.

502
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:17,958
Xiaoxiao can't

503
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:18,839
have cold beverages.

504
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:19,919
You know?

505
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,839
Because we are

506
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,319
trying to have a baby.

507
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:24,759
We want a little fairy

508
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,839
of our own.

509
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:27,079
You know.

510
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:27,919
He said that

511
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:29,119
our daughter would be pretty

512
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,238
just like me.

513
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:31,878
Can you straighten

514
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,038
your tongue?

515
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:34,478
And why aren't you

516
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:35,519
going on a honeymoon?

517
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,678
What are you doing here?

518
00:20:36,758 --> 00:20:38,359
Didn't I give you the red envelope?

519
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,000
You think

520
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,079
I'd abandon you?

521
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,319
I'll help you

522
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:42,438
with the opening ceremony.

523
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:43,718
Don't worry, Xu Kaixin.

524
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:44,759
You are always

525
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,679
my "legitimate wife".

526
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,119
And Ran

527
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,359
is at most

528
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:50,798
a "concubine".

529
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:52,399
Wait.

530
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,558
Am I not the emperor?

531
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,478
Tired? Let me massage you.

532
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:56,280
Have some water.

533
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,079
Hello, did you miss me?

534
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:59,439
Is he bothering you?

535
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:00,478
I'll come over.

536
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:01,279
No.

537
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:01,959
We just

538
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,079
signed an agreement

539
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:03,760
that he'll

540
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,399
give me my share of the apartment

541
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:06,919
if he secretly takes the kids away

542
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,079
ever again.

543
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,519
I'm so clever.

544
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,839
We rushed to the notary office

545
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:11,919
to notarize it.

546
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:14,038
Alright, that's good.

547
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:15,679
How's business today?

548
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:17,999
The first three days are

549
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,840
for building buzz.

550
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,478
But the foot traffic is okay.

551
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:21,798
Alright then.

552
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:22,958
Go ahead.

553
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:24,438
I might go back early today.

554
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:25,918
I'll cook and wait for you.

555
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:26,998
Okay.

556
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:29,758
Alright, see you later.

557
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:31,039
Oh my.

558
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,119
Let's kiss, too.

559
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:37,558
Ms. Li.

560
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:42,758
Mr. Liu spoke to you?

561
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:46,478
Yeah.

562
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,399
You are

563
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:50,518
just stubborn.

564
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:53,558
Didn't I tell you a few months ago

565
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:54,799
that you were

566
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:55,998
on the layoff list?

567
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:57,998
If you had listened to me

568
00:21:58,278 --> 00:21:59,359
and wrapped things up,

569
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,799
I could have vouched for you.

570
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:02,599
But you just gave up

571
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:03,958
and took annual leave.

572
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,919
It's not easy for you

573
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:13,679
to take care of two kids.

574
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,359
What will you do?

575
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:23,478
I've been your mentor

576
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:24,558
for years.

577
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,639
Right?

578
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:28,719
If you have anything

579
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,958
that I can help with,

580
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,238
feel free to tell me.

581
00:22:31,478 --> 00:22:32,478
Do you hear me?

582
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:34,238
Don't be shy.

583
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:37,639
Go ahead.

584
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:51,558
Mom.

585
00:22:57,238 --> 00:22:58,958
Why didn't you tell me to give you

586
00:22:59,119 --> 00:22:59,679
a hand?

587
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:00,839
What if you fall?

588
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:03,079
It's okay.

589
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:04,158
Come on.

590
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:04,840
Hurry.

591
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,318
Sit down.

592
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:10,679
Why act tough?

593
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,839
Just call me.

594
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,079
I'm home, anyway.

595
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:16,040
It's okay.

596
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,198
Mom.

597
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:18,238
The kids will

598
00:23:18,318 --> 00:23:19,318
visit you tonight.

599
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,439
Really?

600
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:23,879
Yeah.

601
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:27,798
I get to see my grandson?

602
00:23:28,998 --> 00:23:29,998
Yeah.

603
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,599
Hang in there.

604
00:23:33,318 --> 00:23:34,318
Very soon.

605
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,198
Xiaomi will soon

606
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:37,798
be able to live with us.

607
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:40,839
W-Will Xu Kaixin

608
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,718
allow it?

609
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,600
I contacted

610
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,318
a foreign bioresearch institute.

611
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:48,159
They have a new medicine

612
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,319
that's effective.

613
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:50,919
I want to take you to try it.

614
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:53,039
And we can

615
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,798
take Xiaomi with us.

616
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,199
Once we're abroad,

617
00:23:58,038 --> 00:23:59,599
Xu Kaixin won't be able to find us.

618
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:03,879
Will...

619
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,038
Will it work?

620
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:07,718
But

621
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:10,038
as long as we go abroad,

622
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:11,398
we'll be beyond reach.

623
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:12,919
No one can find us, right?

624
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:14,399
And

625
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:17,038
it's not illegal for us
to take Xiaomi abroad

626
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,359
as his father

627
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:20,758
and his grandparents, right?

628
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,478
Right, it's not.

629
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:24,439
It's not.

630
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:25,639
It's okay.

631
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,919
Then we'd better hurry up.

632
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:32,558
Hurry up.

633
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,079
Don't worry.

634
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,278
I'm working on it.

635
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:37,119
I've already quit my job

636
00:24:37,758 --> 00:24:39,679
and I'm focusing
on selling the apartment.

637
00:24:41,518 --> 00:24:42,798
Once we leave,

638
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:45,639
we won't come back anytime soon.

639
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,079
Don't cry, please.

640
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,119
You can't cry tonight.

641
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:51,398
Dami is very clever.

642
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:52,759
She'll suspect something.

643
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:53,839
Okay?

644
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,199
I know.

645
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,439
Then

646
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,519
what about the child

647
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,599
Xiaojiao is carrying?

648
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:04,318
Maybe

649
00:25:04,478 --> 00:25:05,919
you shouldn't argue with her.

650
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,198
Once she gives birth,

651
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:10,079
we'll see what to do.

652
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:17,079
You'll have Xiaomi now.

653
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,439
I'll tell you the truth.

654
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,919
I divorced Hu Xiaojiao.

655
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,599
That baby she's carrying

656
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,839
is not mine.

657
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,678
How did that happen?

658
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:31,399
Mom.

659
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:32,679
Don't get worked up, Mom.

660
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:33,879
Mom.

661
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,279
Please don't cry.

662
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,159
I didn't tell you

663
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,879
because I was worried about you.

664
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:40,079
Mom.

665
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,918
- Don't get worked up.
- It's okay.

666
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:42,998
Calm down.

667
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,079
It's okay.

668
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:48,718
It's okay.

669
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,199
I knew from the beginning

670
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:54,918
that she was not someone

671
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:56,839
you could settle down with.

672
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,079
It's just...

673
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,079
It's just that you've suffered.

674
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:03,679
Oh my.

675
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,119
She wasted your time.

676
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:08,478
Don't say that.

677
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:10,998
It's partly my fault.

678
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:18,079
Your problem is that you're too kind

679
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,839
and sweet to her.

680
00:26:22,318 --> 00:26:23,519
What was the lyric

681
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,758
of that song?

682
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,238
The freedom you gave her

683
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:29,278
was too much.

684
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:31,919
Too much.

685
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:11,958
(Are you free these days?)

686
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,199
(Let's meet up.)

687
00:27:52,318 --> 00:27:53,318
It's exhausting.

688
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,999
You young people are worse than me.

689
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,558
You lack exercise.

690
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:01,238
I'm more energetic.

691
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:02,439
I'm exhausted.

692
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:03,198
Xu Kaijin.

693
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:04,998
Why didn't Mei Chengyi come to help?

694
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:06,080
He supervised

695
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,718
the renovation on my behalf.

696
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:08,438
That's why

697
00:28:08,518 --> 00:28:09,399
it's done in a week.

698
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,038
Besides, he has to work today.

699
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:12,159
As a couple

700
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:13,478
forming a new family,

701
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:14,958
we mustn't force the other one

702
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:16,439
to do our job.

703
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:17,439
It's hard enough

704
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,839
to look after two kids.

705
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:19,878
If we want to form

706
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:20,918
a new family,

707
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:22,958
we must each manage our own affairs

708
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:25,198
and never treat each other
as cheap labor.

709
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:25,840
Besides,

710
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,918
Mei Chengyi has

711
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:27,998
done a lot for me.

712
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:28,879
So I might be

713
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,399
a bit cheeky.

714
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:32,279
I just like being cheap labor.

715
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,000
I just like

716
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,518
carrying burdens for Xiaoxiao.

717
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:36,439
Good boy. Pat, pat.

718
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,798
You have found a nice husband.

719
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:40,718
Why don't you

720
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:41,918
pack up and get ready

721
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:43,079
for the honeymoon

722
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:44,478
to Antarctica?

723
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:45,840
Remember

724
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,599
to send me lots of photos.

725
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:49,439
Work hard.

726
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,038
Try to come back with a baby.

727
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:52,679
What's wrong with you?

728
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,879
We'll leave it to fate.

729
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,039
Alright.

730
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,119
Then we'll be off.

731
00:28:57,718 --> 00:28:58,759
Kaixin, I'll miss you.

732
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,319
Give me a hug.

733
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,519
Lili, hand me my bag.

734
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,759
So needy.

735
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,799
Give you a hug.

736
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:05,478
I'll miss you.

737
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:06,599
Alright, go ahead.

738
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:07,120
I'm off.

739
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,248
Song Ran, take care of her.

740
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,752
- You need to miss me.
- You owe us a meal!

741
00:29:09,752 --> 00:29:10,639
Once you come back.

742
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:11,759
Bye, Lili.

743
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,839
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

744
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:13,999
I'll bring you gifts.

745
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:14,958
Have fun.

746
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:16,038
Bye.

747
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:16,839
Be careful.

748
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:17,919
Let me do it.

749
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:19,159
Tired, huh?

750
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,519
Let's go. I'm exhausted.

751
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,599
I'll give you a massage.

752
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:31,119
(Alright, let's meet up.)

753
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:37,359
Wasn't your birthday last week?

754
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:39,879
It's today

755
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,558
according to the lunar calendar.

756
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,799
I haven't celebrated my birthday

757
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:45,918
for many years.

758
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:46,560
I...

759
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,079
We haven't gathered for a long time.

760
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,718
I want to treat you to a meal

761
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,119
with this opportunity.

762
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:55,238
Well...

763
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:56,040
Is this

764
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,518
our farewell dinner?

765
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:58,958
Don't say that.

766
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:00,799
Well, the thing is

767
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:02,599
HR just talked to me.

768
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,718
I'm not getting fired

769
00:30:04,998 --> 00:30:05,998
but promoted.

770
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:09,679
Promoted.

771
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,038
It's not a layoff, but a promotion.

772
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,878
We were worried for no reason.

773
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:15,958
Yeah.

774
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:17,718
Mei,

775
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,278
since you're getting promoted,

776
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,399
we won't be laid off, right?

777
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:22,839
T-That's for sure.

778
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,238
I see.

779
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:26,278
We've been slacking off lately

780
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,678
and they finally realized

781
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:29,478
the role we play in this company.

782
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:31,320
Mei,

783
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,119
you can't leave.

784
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,878
Otherwise, we'll be doomed.

785
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,798
It's hard to find a job now.

786
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:38,958
Look at you.

787
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,478
But if Mei gets promoted,

788
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,518
we'll definitely get our bonuses.

789
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:45,038
That's right.

790
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:46,758
But Mei,

791
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:48,678
what do you think?

792
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:49,758
Yeah.

793
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,558
I don't know.

794
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,238
They changed their mind so fast.

795
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:55,478
I'm a bit lost.

796
00:30:56,278 --> 00:30:57,278
I thought...

797
00:30:58,558 --> 00:30:59,599
Well... Let me

798
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,079
think about it.

799
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:02,518
Okay.

800
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:03,878
You can't leave.

801
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,119
No matter what,

802
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,158
it's good news.

803
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:07,918
Plus, today is Mei's birthday.

804
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,238
Two happy events at a time.

805
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:10,359
Let's toast to him.

806
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,158
Yeah.

807
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:11,839
Come on.

808
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:12,799
Happy birthday.

809
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:13,559
Okay, thanks.

810
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:14,279
Happy birthday.

811
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,040
Cheers.

812
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,159
Happy birthday.

813
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,119
Mei, since you're getting promoted,

814
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,918
will we all get a raise?

815
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:28,159
That's for sure.

816
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:29,919
See the big picture.

817
00:31:30,238 --> 00:31:31,038
Think about it.

818
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:33,119
What does it mean if Mei is promoted?

819
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,438
It means we are promoted too.

820
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,238
Right?

821
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,398
Exactly.

822
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,879
Mei, rest assured.

823
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:39,478
As long as you're here,

824
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:41,119
we will work hard

825
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,079
and show the company

826
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:44,718
where our strength lies.

827
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:45,798
Keep it up.

828
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:46,919
Keep it up.

829
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,119
Dig in.

830
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:57,679
Excuse me.

831
00:31:57,798 --> 00:31:58,399
Oh no.

832
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:00,238
I won't be able to enjoy my meal.

833
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:04,879
What's going on?

834
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,718
You told me you'd fire Mei Chengyi,

835
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:09,839
but told him he was getting a promotion.

836
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:10,958
I play the villain

837
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,639
while you're double-dealing.

838
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:14,678
That's why I said

839
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:16,919
you are young and naive.

840
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,238
Ms. Li, listen.

841
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,119
If Mei Chengyi leaves,

842
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,638
how well can you

843
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:22,718
take his place?

844
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:24,320
If you make him

845
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,079
sign a non-compete clause,

846
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,000
we can secure

847
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,758
half of the upcoming deals.

848
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:30,079
Of course,

849
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:31,478
there would be

850
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:32,958
no problems if he can stay.

851
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,079
That's right.

852
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,079
Imagine yourself as my uncle.

853
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:37,839
Facing such a situation,

854
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,999
what would you do to reduce costs

855
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,238
and maintain revenue?

856
00:32:45,718 --> 00:32:46,878
I'll lay off someone else.

857
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:48,039
Keep the profit maker.

858
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,359
Get rid of the valueless one.

859
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,998
You've finally come around to it.

860
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,679
Ms. Li.

861
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:58,518
You've grown up

862
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,958
and matured.

863
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:01,958
You've learned

864
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:03,919
to sacrifice yourself for others.

865
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:05,599
I really can't catch up

866
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,278
with you in terms of morality.

867
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:09,399
I was

868
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:10,599
in such a dilemma.

869
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:11,239
I didn't know

870
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,718
how to bring it up.

871
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,000
But now, I'm just

872
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,159
going to say it.

873
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:18,279
Considering our friendship

874
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,879
as colleagues for years,

875
00:33:20,238 --> 00:33:22,159
I will make every effort

876
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:23,080
to get you

877
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,518
the compensation you ask for.

878
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:26,038
Wait.

879
00:33:26,758 --> 00:33:27,758
What do you mean?

880
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:30,238
Are you firing me?

881
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:36,558
I was naive.

882
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,359
Well, I'll just eat

883
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:40,558
and stop talking.

884
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:42,359
I've said too much.

885
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:04,278
Lili,

886
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,759
I'm picking up the kids

887
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:06,519
and taking them

888
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,280
to their grandma.

889
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,559
I'll bring them home later.

890
00:34:09,238 --> 00:34:09,839
The thought

891
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:11,198
of the kids going over there

892
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:12,959
makes me restless.

893
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:13,920
Don't worry.

894
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,999
Dami is clever.

895
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:15,639
Besides,

896
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,798
she can call us

897
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:18,398
from her smartwatch anytime.

898
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,039
Wrap it up early.

899
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,119
Don't get tired.

900
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:26,119
Alright, go ahead.

901
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,199
Bye.

902
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,520
Their coffee

903
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,798
is quite tasty.

904
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:49,199
Once a dashing young man,

905
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:52,079
now an old geezer.

906
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,559
What is that nonsense?

907
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:56,838
What did you say?

908
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,718
Who's talking nonsense?

909
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,758
Look at you wallowing in self-pity.

910
00:35:02,798 --> 00:35:04,398
I'm not wallowing in self-pity.

911
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,318
I'm just lamenting

912
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,079
that time spares no one.

913
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,238
Didn't you get changed?

914
00:35:12,438 --> 00:35:13,919
Don't be so cynical

915
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,479
and sarcastic all the time.

916
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,559
Alright?

917
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,158
Does it make you happy

918
00:35:19,238 --> 00:35:20,638
if I wear an old man's outfit

919
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,838
and look scruffy?

920
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,039
Ever since

921
00:35:24,238 --> 00:35:26,439
Xu Kaixin and her kids came,

922
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,278
you've been helping them a lot.

923
00:35:29,398 --> 00:35:31,358
Families should help each other out.

924
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,199
You?

925
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,158
Have you ever done any chores?

926
00:35:36,238 --> 00:35:37,080
You don't even

927
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,758
pick up a fallen bottle at home.

928
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:40,318
You break the dishes you wash.

929
00:35:40,398 --> 00:35:41,040
Here we go.

930
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,838
When you tried to fix the pipes,

931
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:44,358
you flooded our apartment

932
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:45,758
and the apartment below.

933
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:47,039
You strained your lower back

934
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,599
and were hospitalized
because you moved something.

935
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,599
Were you helping
or being an embarrassment?

936
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,679
I'm warning you.

937
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,158
Don't disgrace me.

938
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,638
Don't cause them trouble

939
00:35:56,718 --> 00:35:57,999
under the guise of helping.

940
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,559
Come on, that's so last century.

941
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,119
Why would you bring it up?

942
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,638
My daughter is not talking to me,

943
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:15,238
but she's transferring me money.

944
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,479
It's the first time Youyou

945
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:19,000
(Youyou transferred 8,000 yuan)
transferred me money.

946
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:21,918
It's 8,000 yuan in total.

947
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,479
She didn't spend much

948
00:36:24,918 --> 00:36:26,119
and transferred it to us.

949
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,798
What could she buy there

950
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:35,999
even if

951
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:37,238
she wanted to?

952
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:38,999
That's true.

953
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,119
Darling.

954
00:36:44,438 --> 00:36:46,119
Regarding Youyou's job,

955
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,679
I'm thinking...

956
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,279
Considering

957
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,838
what happened to her mentor,

958
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,918
she must be in a bad mood.

959
00:36:53,398 --> 00:36:54,040
So,

960
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,358
let's try not to put

961
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,198
too much pressure on her.

962
00:36:57,278 --> 00:36:58,000
Just let it be.

963
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,278
Give her some freedom.

964
00:37:00,278 --> 00:37:01,718
She tends to overthink things.

965
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:04,238
What if she goes to extremes?

966
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:05,719
We can't

967
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,119
let that happen.

968
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:08,839
For now,

969
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:10,919
let's just make do with it.

970
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:11,799
Maybe one day,

971
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,838
after her enthusiasm wears off,

972
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:15,918
she will want to change jobs.

973
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:18,878
Alright.

974
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,959
Just let it be.

975
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:32,159
They took the money
and didn't urge me to go home.

976
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,039
So this is tacit consent.

977
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:40,999
Yiersan.

978
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:42,999
We have money for an extra meal today.

979
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,559
Yiersan.

980
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:50,479
Yiersan.

981
00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:55,878
Yiersan.

982
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,079
Yiersan.

983
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:20,568
(Hu Pei, Male, Jiang City)

984
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:31,959
National flag.

985
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:40,838
Mom, I got another A on my essay today.

986
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:42,238
Good job.

987
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:44,600
Mom.

988
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,079
I pooped by myself

989
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,758
at kindergarten.

990
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:48,999
You're amazing.

991
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:49,799
Mom, you'll

992
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:51,119
pick us up, right?

993
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,479
I'll pick you up at 9 PM.

994
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,079
What if Dad loses me

995
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,119
again?

996
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,199
No way.

997
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,638
Your grandma will be there.

998
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:00,959
Even if she loses herself,

999
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,199
she won't lose you.

1000
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,999
Do you know how to drive?

1001
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,039
Stop talking to me for now.

1002
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:08,639
I'm too nervous.

1003
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,599
Yiersan.

1004
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,519
I knew you'd be here.

1005
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:21,238
Yiersan.

1006
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,079
Yiersan.

1007
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:30,798
You don't want canned food.

1008
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,838
You don't even respond.

1009
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:35,999
What are you doing?

1010
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:37,520
It will be dark.

1011
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,798
I won't come looking for you.

1012
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:45,878
That spot is actually sold?

1013
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:50,759
Someone put

1014
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:52,079
Calabash Brothers there?

1015
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,400
Master Hu

1016
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,039
does have some business sense.

1017
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,159
But he will

1018
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,559
brag about it somewhere else.

1019
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:03,039
No, he'd better not brag about it.

1020
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,238
It will be noisy.

1021
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:07,718
It used to be

1022
00:40:07,798 --> 00:40:08,838
so loud and annoying

1023
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:10,398
when he was around.

1024
00:40:10,718 --> 00:40:12,639
How come I'm missing it a bit?

1025
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,479
What's wrong with me?

1026
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:18,358
Let's go.

1027
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:30,872
(Hu Pei's grave)

1028
00:41:11,758 --> 00:41:12,758
Xiaojiao.

1029
00:41:36,918 --> 00:41:37,918
Hello.

1030
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,878
I'm downstairs at your parents' place.

1031
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,199
Come and pick up the kids.

1032
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:42,798
Okay.

1033
00:42:05,086 --> 00:42:07,160
(Account number)

1034
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:20,479
Do you have any decency?

1035
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:21,758
Why are you hitting me?

1036
00:42:22,438 --> 00:42:23,718
Didn't we agree to give him

1037
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:25,238
12 hours to make up his mind?

1038
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:26,798
Time is not up yet.

1039
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,838
This guy is so miserable.

1040
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,158
His wife cheated on him.

1041
00:42:32,238 --> 00:42:33,398
We're scamming him.

1042
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:35,838
Even scammers

1043
00:42:35,918 --> 00:42:36,918
have sympathy.

1044
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:38,519
Well,

1045
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,198
let's ask for less.

1046
00:42:40,278 --> 00:42:41,278
No way.

1047
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,199
Business is business.

1048
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,719
Compared to our work ethics,
sympathy is worthless.

1049
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:47,278
You are so professional.

1050
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,398
