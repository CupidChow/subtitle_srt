16
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:38,947
Put on the cartoons

17
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:40,027
for them to watch.

18
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,628
Let them play while eating.

19
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:42,748
They both have

20
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:44,508
insufficient hyperopic reserve.

21
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:45,629
Chengyi won't let them

22
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:46,827
watch cartoons.

23
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:48,428
Nonsense.

24
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:50,068
When he can't hold on himself,

25
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:51,588
doesn't he also let them watch?

26
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:55,748
It's so late.

27
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:57,708
Why hasn't Chengyi come back yet?

28
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:05,708
He's probably working overtime.

29
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:14,027
(How come
all these plants are withered?)

30
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:14,869
(I once read)

31
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:16,148
(in a science magazine)

32
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:17,507
(that now in many rainforests,)

33
00:02:17,587 --> 00:02:19,027
(there is heavy metal pollution.)

34
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:20,468
(This should be it.)

35
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:21,987
Yu'an and Yule,

36
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:23,948
come here.

37
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:25,028
Listen to me.

38
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:28,987
Tomorrow, if your dad

39
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:30,467
brings a woman

40
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,827
here for lunch,

41
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:33,428
will you be happy?

42
00:02:33,508 --> 00:02:34,508
- Yes.
- Yes.

43
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:37,468
You will?

44
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,107
You'll be happy over such a thing?

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,264
(Skewers are the only truth.)

46
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:49,464
(I have barbecue and beer. Wanna join?)

47
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:53,176
(Happiness is the most important.)

48
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:54,587
What does Yu'an like?

49
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:56,507
Shrimp and broccoli.

50
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:57,587
Wrong.

51
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,908
It's Yule who likes shrimp.

52
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:01,428
Did you read

53
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:02,508
the profile I sent you?

54
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:04,267
You've gotten four questions wrong now.

55
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:06,188
You sent me

56
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:07,628
fifty questions.

57
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,267
Even though I got four wrong,

58
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:11,107
I still scored over 90 points.

59
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:12,587
I've already tried my best.

60
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:22,628
Do you know

61
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,508
(Chengyi)
who this woman is?

62
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:25,827
Of course.

63
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:27,387
She's Dad's girlfriend.

64
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:29,028
And you are still happy?

65
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:32,747
Do you know

66
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:33,748
that if she

67
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:35,747
and your dad really become a couple,

68
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:36,588
she will become

69
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:38,107
your stepmother?

70
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,427
Did you forget

71
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:44,308
the story

72
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:46,068
I told you when you were little?

73
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:49,028
Who wanted to harm Snow White?

74
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,228
The stepmother queen.

75
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:51,308
That's right.

76
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:54,268
Who wanted to harm Cinderella?

77
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:55,427
It's also the stepmother.

78
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:58,028
Then aren't you afraid?

79
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:00,788
How about this?

80
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,707
Tomorrow, the three of us

81
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,908
need to work together

82
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:06,428
to let the woman

83
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:07,667
your dad brings back

84
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:09,428
dare not be your stepmother.

85
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:10,508
Okay?

86
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:12,428
Then why can Auntie

87
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:13,788
become our stepmother?

88
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,108
Dad,

89
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:20,387
stop teaching them

90
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:21,467
such nonsense.

91
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:23,668
Mom, do something.

92
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:25,947
If you've finished eating,
go to your room.

93
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:27,067
Leave us alone.

94
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:28,467
This is our own business.

95
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:29,788
Don't tell the kids

96
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,068
such nonsense.

97
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:34,068
Auntie Youyou

98
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:35,787
is your mom's sister.

99
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:36,748
So even if she

100
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:37,908
becomes your stepmother,

101
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,587
she will be very nice to you.

102
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,108
Just listen to me. Tomorrow,

103
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:43,148
we'll work together

104
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:44,908
to defeat that witch

105
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:46,587
so that she dares not come again.

106
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:47,467
Okay?

107
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,267
- Defeat the witch.
- Defeat the witch.

108
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:50,227
Defeat the witch.

109
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:51,387
Come on.

110
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,467
Good girls.

111
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:06,988
(Chengyi,)

112
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:08,827
(I can only help you this far.)

113
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:11,908
Alright, I got it.

114
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:12,988
Thank you.

115
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:14,428
Wait.

116
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:15,108
Sit back.

117
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:16,188
Sit there.

118
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,428
What are you doing?

119
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:20,548
Is this your sense of commitment?

120
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:22,027
You're all talk.

121
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:25,428
That lunch is a complete trap.

122
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:26,747
And it's tricky.

123
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,907
Three against one?

124
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:28,869
I cannot

125
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:29,988
deal with them.

126
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:31,508
Alright, stop being modest.

127
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:32,669
We've

128
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,227
understood each other a bit.

129
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:35,827
I know what you can do.

130
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:37,387
Yu'an and Yule

131
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:38,468
are good kids.

132
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:39,988
I'll talk to them tonight.

133
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:40,948
Besides,

134
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:43,027
we aren't really a couple.

135
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:44,428
I played my part for you.

136
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:45,268
And now you want

137
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:46,387
to stand me up?

138
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:48,708
If I help you now,

139
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:49,948
what about next time?

140
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:52,788
There are challenges.

141
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:54,188
But we can beat them one by one.

142
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:55,668
Maybe it won't be long before

143
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:57,108
my sister-in-law gets a boyfriend.

144
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:59,027
That way, they'll stop this nonsense.

145
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:00,267
The most important thing now

146
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:00,869
is to cut off

147
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:02,747
their matchmaking ideas.

148
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:03,548
Just make it clear

149
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:04,507
with him.

150
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:06,628
Then he won't be matchmaking anymore.

151
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,587
You don't know my father-in-law.

152
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:10,947
Have you seen 'Country Love'?

153
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:11,908
Yes, I've seen it.

154
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:12,508
That's my

155
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:13,948
favorite sitcom.

156
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:15,707
I've always thought that Xie Guangkun

157
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:17,187
was based on him.

158
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:18,267
You know.

159
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:20,548
That's Zhao Si.

160
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,388
Never mind.

161
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:24,267
With his antics and stubbornness,

162
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:25,587
you... you...

163
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:27,027
You know, right?

164
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:32,628
You must be a good person.

165
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:33,748
What do you mean?

166
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,668
They say marriage is like

167
00:06:36,748 --> 00:06:37,868
jumping into a fire pit.

168
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:40,027
And your stubborn father-in-law

169
00:06:40,188 --> 00:06:40,948
wants to put

170
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:42,587
two daughters into one pit, you.

171
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:44,587
It means he approves of you.

172
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:47,748
Thank you.

173
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,548
Please help me out

174
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:50,908
by filling the 'pit'.

175
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:51,988
(Seize the Moment)
Here.

176
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:55,267
Consider it as me begging you?

177
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:56,748
The theme

178
00:06:56,828 --> 00:06:58,308
of our task this time

179
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:00,387
is to go against the stepmother.

180
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:02,227
That means

181
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:04,707
you don't like

182
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:06,267
whatever she likes,

183
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:07,868
and you have to do

184
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:09,428
whatever she hates.

185
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:11,188
Do you understand?

186
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:14,147
Good.

187
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:16,707
Let's rehearse.

188
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:18,108
Let's suppose

189
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:22,267
she wants some quiet.

190
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:23,908
Then we'll jump around

191
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:25,188
and shout loudly.

192
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:27,587
That's right.

193
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:30,588
If she wants to cling to your dad,

194
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:32,108
- what to do?
- We'll cling to Dad

195
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,868
and give no chance to the enemy.

196
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,508
You're so smart.

197
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:37,068
Great.

198
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:39,467
Well done, sweethearts.

199
00:07:40,508 --> 00:07:41,707
Let's try again.

200
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:45,428
Let's suppose she wants to eat

201
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,988
a dish on the table...

202
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:48,147
Then we'll eat that dish

203
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:49,068
all up

204
00:07:49,188 --> 00:07:50,827
and not leave her even a bite.

205
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,227
You're amazing.

206
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:53,308
Great.

207
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:55,627
Captain Grandpa now announces

208
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:58,108
that our squad will surely win.

209
00:07:58,428 --> 00:07:59,267
- We'll win.
- Win.

210
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:00,347
We'll win.

211
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:06,707
Then I'll call you Chengyi tomorrow.

212
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:07,508
To the seniors,

213
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,588
too much intimacy

214
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:09,668
annoys them.

215
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:10,907
It's more than that.

216
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:11,789
For him,

217
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:13,387
that's a blatant provocation.

218
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,627
Then I'll call you

219
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:15,467
Kaixin tomorrow.

220
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:16,587
- Okay.
- Okay.

221
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,387
Don't go over there further.

222
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:23,668
You're about to fall.

223
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:31,789
Well,

224
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:34,507
you need to get used to it a bit.

225
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:35,787
After all, we are a couple.

226
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,147
If you act like this,

227
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:39,028
we will definitely get exposed tomorrow.

228
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:42,349
It's a drill.

229
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,667
(Oh my, a shy man)

230
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:45,147
(is so cute.)

231
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:46,027
(Xu Kaixin,)

232
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:46,907
(God has sent)

233
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:47,748
(such a good man)

234
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,867
(to you.)

235
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,068
(Is it reasonable)

236
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:51,388
(if you don't hold him tight?)

237
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:53,628
(Although she)

238
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,028
(seems unreliable,)

239
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:56,507
(she is actually quite good.)

240
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:57,469
(As a woman,)

241
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:59,188
(she goes all out to help me.)

242
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:02,347
(I shouldn't judge her
by my own narrow mind.)

243
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:13,989
(Monitor)
(Next week)

244
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:15,188
(is the school anniversary.)

245
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:16,468
(Try to return to the school.)

246
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:17,988
(Those who are coming,)

247
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:18,869
(register.)

248
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,387
(It's ten years since we graduated.)

249
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:22,867
(It's worth a big celebration.)

250
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:37,028
Hello?

251
00:09:37,747 --> 00:09:39,147
The monitor suggested a reunion

252
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:40,588
for the school anniversary.

253
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:41,708
I didn't see it.

254
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:42,788
What's wrong?

255
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:45,787
What's with that flirtatious tone?

256
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:46,867
Speak properly.

257
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:48,867
Did I tell you I'm busy?

258
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:52,227
There's a man beside you?

259
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:54,867
Do I know him?

260
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,147
Okay, I'll take my leave.

261
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:58,627
I won't disturb Your Highness.

262
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:03,667
Everything okay?

263
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:04,747
Yes.

264
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:06,627
Then let me take you home.

265
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,349
Take me back

266
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:08,867
to the café from just now.

267
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:10,987
Well...

268
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,068
Okay, then.

269
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:28,349
Well,

270
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,428
how about we listen to the radio?

271
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:33,028
Okay.

272
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:34,588
(Between men and women,)

273
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,627
(affection)

274
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:36,948
(begins very subtly.)

275
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:38,188
(Sometimes it's a moment)

276
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:39,827
(of a seemingly absent touch.)

277
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:40,589
(Sometimes,)

278
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:42,467
(it's the sudden silence in the air.)

279
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:44,068
(They're the best breeding grounds)

280
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:45,268
(for a crush.)

281
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:51,267
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

282
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:52,948
Or any foods you can't eat?

283
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:54,108
I'm a foodie.

284
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,188
I eat everything.

285
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:57,948
That's great. You're easy to feed.

286
00:10:58,107 --> 00:10:59,107
Okay.

287
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,349
(Sudden silence.)

288
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:02,708
(Or suddenly racking brains)

289
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:03,828
(to find a topic.)

290
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:04,589
(In your)

291
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:05,907
(interaction with someone,)

292
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:07,787
(if these two scenarios occur,)

293
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,027
(congratulations.)

294
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:10,747
(Either you've got a crush,)

295
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,747
(or they've got a crush.)

296
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:14,907
(Of course, the most wonderful thing)

297
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:16,988
(is that you've both fallen
for each other.)

298
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:17,989
(Next, let's)

299
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:19,108
(listen to an old song)

300
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:20,747
(that makes the heart flutter:)

301
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:22,068
(There's Still Time.)

00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:28,188

00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:35,627

Well,

309
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,948
this song is a bit too old.

316
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:56,627
Well,

317
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:58,427
how...

318
00:12:58,507 --> 00:12:59,188
I'm leaving now.

319
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:00,268
See you tomorrow at noon.

320
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:01,987
Okay.

321
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:04,068
Bye-bye.

322
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:08,388
Bye-bye.

323
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:31,507
Where are you?

324
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,268
The studio, right?

325
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,068
I'll come over to get you updated.

326
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:43,348
(The weather is nice today.)

327
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:45,068
(There is a blue sky and white clouds.)

328
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:46,948
(Our music is also very pleasant)

329
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:48,227
(and touches the heart.)

330
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:49,747
(On such a day,)

331
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:51,228
(the name you're thinking of)

332
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:52,229
(is perhaps)

333
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:53,707
(the person you fall for.)

334
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:39,268
Why is this pole so crappy?

335
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:40,948
Just like someone.

336
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:45,467
I thought you wouldn't come.

337
00:14:46,788 --> 00:14:47,948
Of course, I'd come.

338
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,189
You seemed

339
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:50,668
unhappy on the phone.

340
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:51,627
I had to come to see

341
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:52,628
what upsets you

342
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,948
so I can be happy.

343
00:14:57,227 --> 00:14:58,188
Song Ran,

344
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:59,507
we've been old friends

345
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:00,868
for so many years.

346
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:01,948
You don't have to say

347
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:03,747
such harsh things to hurt me, alright?

348
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:05,548
Don't start.

349
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:07,907
You had been with Xu Kaixin for years.

350
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:08,988
You dated,

351
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:10,627
got married, and then had kids.

352
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:11,349
But look at

353
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:12,707
what you've done to her.

354
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:14,188
As your ex-wife,

355
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:15,069
she ended like that.

356
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,347
Let alone me.

357
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,308
You'd cheat me without any hesitation.

358
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:20,027
Well, look at you.

359
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:21,348
From whom exactly did you learn

360
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:22,228
to be so mean?

361
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:23,308
Li Xiaoxiao?

362
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:28,507
How dare you mention Li Xiaoxiao?

363
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:29,508
We broke up

364
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:30,667
all thanks to you.

365
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:31,468
She labeled me

366
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:32,388
as a scumbag like you

367
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:33,588
and has blocked me

368
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:34,387
for three years.

369
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,148
- Alright?
- Wait.

370
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:36,627
At least be honest when you talk.

371
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:37,948
You can't blame your breakup

372
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:39,468
entirely on me, alright?

373
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:40,787
I'm not fully responsible.

374
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:41,867
At most, I bear

375
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:43,347
a little bit of responsibility.

376
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:45,108
You're hopeless.

377
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:45,988
No, no.

378
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:46,708
I was wrong.

379
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:48,068
I am fully responsible. I am.

380
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,148
Let go.

381
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,268
I admit I did you wrong.

382
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,188
Alright?

383
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:58,308
I won't hide it from you.

384
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:00,188
I got transferred

385
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,268
months ago.

386
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:03,747
I didn't dare to contact you.

387
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:05,829
I know you all

388
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:07,148
really don't like me.

389
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,229
But I have been

390
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:11,908
in a terrible mood recently.

391
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:13,908
I just want to talk to someone.

392
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:17,467
I'm really glad you came.

393
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:19,588
So it's okay

394
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:20,468
if you want

395
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:21,469
to roast or scold me.

396
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,107
I'll accept it. I'll listen.

397
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:24,347
Alright?

398
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:30,707
Let's have a drink.

399
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:34,667
Just one drink,

400
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:35,308
okay?

401
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:36,388
Let go.

402
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:39,028
Come on.

403
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:53,388
Did you regret it?

404
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:57,467
Regretting won't help.

405
00:16:59,347 --> 00:17:01,188
Life has already become like this.

406
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:03,867
I'll just make do and go on.

407
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:05,747
After all,

408
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:08,027
I can't get divorced a second time.

409
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:09,507
It's not that bad.

410
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:10,548
Xiaojiao always

411
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:11,427
shows off your love

412
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:12,507
in WeChat moments.

413
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:16,188
Maybe she thinks it's nothing.

414
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,428
But I've been pushed to my limit.

415
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,707
People have a knack

416
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:23,428
for making stupid choices.

417
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:24,508
When I was

418
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:25,588
with Kaixin before,

419
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:27,188
I felt everything was easy.

420
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:29,307
But being with Xiaojiao,

421
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:31,188
my career

422
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:33,787
and life are full of stress.

423
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:34,948
She is just

424
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:36,788
a spoiled princess.

425
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,627
You know? Most importantly,
she and my mom

426
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:39,628
are completely...

427
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,948
Watch out.

428
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:41,987
Those two people

429
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:42,907
are my classmates.

430
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:43,548
I...

431
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:45,548
Well, I could tolerate her when she used

432
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:46,309
to have a temper.

433
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:47,508
But it's different now.

434
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:48,588
My...

435
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,188
my mom is sick.

436
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:56,467
She doesn't have much time left.

437
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,508
I know you all think

438
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:04,787
I'm a mama's boy.

439
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:06,707
But

440
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,388
given the situation now,

441
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:10,627
if I'm still human

442
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:11,987
and have a bit of humanity,

443
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:14,628
I have no choice.

444
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:20,628
Alright.

445
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:23,787
About your mom,

446
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:25,428
just see a doctor if she's sick.

447
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:26,349
Get treatment.

448
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:27,668
Everything will get better.

449
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,588
And Xu Kaixin.

450
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:31,747
You haven't seen her for a while.

451
00:18:31,948 --> 00:18:32,548
Do you know

452
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:33,628
what she has become?

453
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,227
She's cold-blooded, calculating,

454
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,467
and vain.

455
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:38,907
Today she brought

456
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,108
her new boyfriend

457
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:41,028
to show off to me.

458
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:41,628
I don't even

459
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,868
do such a childish thing.

460
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:43,869
My mom

461
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:45,108
is already like this now.

462
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:46,109
She wants nothing else

463
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:47,187
but her grandson

464
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:48,387
to return to our family.

465
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:49,467
Is that wrong?

466
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:50,628
You know what?

467
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,308
Xu Kaixin told me to exchange half

468
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:53,467
of the property for Xiaomi.

469
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:56,348
Impossible.

470
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:57,947
Xu Kaixin isn't that kind of person.

471
00:18:58,027 --> 00:18:58,828
- Right?
- Yeah.

472
00:18:58,908 --> 00:18:59,589
In my memory,

473
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,828
she isn't like that either.

474
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:01,708
But she did

475
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:02,987
tell me that.

476
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:05,828
Who can you blame?

477
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:07,787
Didn't you choose your own path?

478
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:09,427
If you want

479
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:10,109
to find someone

480
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:11,667
with no emotions in marriage,

481
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:13,388
you can only find an inflatable one.

482
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,108
Alright, I'll listen.

483
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:26,428
I'll listen.

484
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:30,348
I held hands with Chengyi.

485
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:33,788
I wanted to slap you on the phone.

486
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:34,907
You held hands?

487
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:35,987
That's gross.

488
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:36,588
Earlier,

489
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:37,428
you despised him.

490
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:39,147
Now you call him by his first name?

491
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:39,987
You gave in fast.

492
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:40,668
Given his face,

493
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:42,108
who wouldn't be dazed by him?

494
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:43,707
As a normal woman,

495
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:45,428
having such thoughts

496
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:46,707
is totally normal.

497
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:47,707
Listen to me.

498
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,787
Come closer.

499
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:51,267
Do you feel it?

500
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:52,789
It's pounding,

501
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:53,908
about to burst out.

502
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,187
You scared me.

503
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:56,667
You really scared me.

504
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:57,828
I can feel it.

505
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,348
I can feel someone's spring

506
00:19:59,428 --> 00:19:59,987
is coming.

507
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:00,948
She's all hormones.

508
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:02,868
What? You believe in love again?

509
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:04,627
Please don't use

510
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:06,387
those vulgar words everyone uses

511
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,507
to insult my pure hormones.

512
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:10,028
And don't just call

513
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,987
our friendship
seeking mutual understanding

514
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,387
as love.

515
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:15,868
Isn't it cliché?

516
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,667
I suspect
you're implying something else.

517
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:19,707
But I have no evidence.

518
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,068
Don't suspect.

519
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:22,227
I am.

520
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,348
As a normal woman,

521
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:26,628
what's wrong with having some thoughts?

522
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:27,948
Nothing is wrong.

523
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:30,108
Tell me, who held whose hand first?

524
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,147
Guess what?

525
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:32,227
Just now...

526
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:35,588
What's going on?

527
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,668
Lower your voice.

528
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:40,668
You used to be called Caterpillar.

529
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:43,067
Look, your hair is still long.

530
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:44,267
Let me pluck it out for you.

531
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:45,668
What caterpillar?

532
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:48,307
Y-You have so much.

533
00:20:57,227 --> 00:20:58,628
Alright, not again.

534
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,788
I'm telling you.

535
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:03,388
If time could go back,

536
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:05,627
I would never

537
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:08,027
divorce Xu Kaixin.

538
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:10,868
We were so deeply in love.

539
00:21:12,987 --> 00:21:15,628
If it hadn't been
for Hu Xiaojiao seducing me,

540
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,588
I'd have a wife and two kids now.

541
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:21,187
My mom would be able to have a grandson.

542
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:22,667
And her uncle

543
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:24,427
wouldn't use a project

544
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:26,547
to keep pressuring me every day.

545
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:28,269
Right now,

546
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:31,188
I'm really more miserable than a dog.

547
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:33,549
Alright.

548
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:34,748
The group has mentioned you.

549
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:36,428
The monitor wants to know if you'll

550
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,147
attend the reunion for the 10th year.

551
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:39,227
I'm not going.

552
00:21:41,307 --> 00:21:42,628
You're right not to go.

553
00:21:42,908 --> 00:21:44,268
You're so wise, you know?

554
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:45,667
With what's among you three,

555
00:21:45,747 --> 00:21:47,188
there'll be a fight if you go.

556
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,148
(Little Kitten)
Here.

557
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:58,788
Your Little Kitten is calling you.

558
00:21:58,868 --> 00:21:59,868
Answer it.

559
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:01,307
Answer the phone.

560
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:03,589
Then I'll answer it.

561
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:04,667
Answer it,

562
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:05,667
my foot.

563
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:06,349
Listen.

564
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:07,987
I get annoyed as soon

565
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:09,868
as I see her or hear her voice.

566
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:15,348
My mom once told me

567
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:17,267
that she's bad luck for me.

568
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,588
That since we got together,

569
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:21,388
nothing good has happened.

570
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:24,268
I told her it's superstition.

571
00:22:24,348 --> 00:22:27,788
But when you think about it carefully,

572
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:28,628
you know?

573
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:29,788
When you think carefully,

574
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:30,589
it really

575
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:32,588
seems like this.

576
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:34,987
(Little Kitten)
She's indeed bad luck to me.

577
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:35,907
Okay, she's bad luck.

578
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:36,667
Answer the phone.

579
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:37,387
Answer it.

580
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:39,467
- Come on.
- Why interrupt when men are talking?

581
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:40,227
Why interrupt?

582
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:42,707
Why interrupt? Why? Why?

583
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,428
(Little Kitten)
What are you doing?

584
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:46,428
Hello, honey.

585
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:47,628
Where are you?

586
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,067
Are you drunk?

587
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:50,948
If you have guts, face her in person.

588
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:52,467
Why are you yelling at the phone?

589
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:54,467
Tell me.

590
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:56,227
Do you love Hu Xiaojiao or not?

591
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:05,387
You're talking about love

592
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,668
with a middle-aged man.

593
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:10,628
Ran,

594
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,787
I'll tell you the truth.

595
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:17,148
Back then,

596
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,667
if it hadn't been for

597
00:23:19,747 --> 00:23:20,668
Hu Xiaojiao's family

598
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:22,588
being richer than Xu Kaixin's

599
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:23,948
and her uncle

600
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,188
(Little Kitten)
being able to help me in my career,

601
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:27,508
I definitely wouldn't

602
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:29,868
have divorced Xu Kaixin.

603
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:33,027
I was just tired.

604
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:35,588
I wanted to take a shortcut.

605
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:36,868
I...

606
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:38,947
I couldn't resist temptation.

607
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:41,668
I'm a worthless being.

608
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:48,628
Get up.

609
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:51,309
Listen to me.

610
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,467
If you were not drunk,

611
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:53,868
I would beat you right now.

612
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,227
Let's go.

613
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:00,707
I really regret it.

614
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:01,427
Let's go.

615
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,507
Come on.

616
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:04,948
You married?

617
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,548
It's okay you're upset.

618
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:08,987
But can you stop poking me?

619
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:10,147
I'm not married.

620
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:10,948
Alright?

621
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:12,467
You ruined it.

622
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:13,588
So don't bring it up.

623
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:15,548
- Let's go.
- It's a good thing.

624
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:18,028
The heavens are warning you.

625
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:19,548
He made me an example for all.

626
00:24:19,628 --> 00:24:21,428
I'm the example, alright?

627
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,187
Alright, you're the example.

628
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:23,789
If you ever

629
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,308
marry Li Xiaoxiao someday,

630
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:26,548
you must not engage

631
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:27,868
with those vixens outside.

632
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:29,068
- You know?
- Okay.

633
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:30,588
You two must be happy.

634
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:31,948
Don't worry.

635
00:24:32,148 --> 00:24:33,029
In my lifetime,

636
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:34,588
I only have to guard against you.

637
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:36,548
You're the biggest bad luck
to me, alright?

638
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:37,228
Be happy.

639
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,428
Alright, Mr. Example.

640
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:39,668
Let's go, okay?

641
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:40,987

How did you do today?

659
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:50,388
Did you trouble Grandma and Grandpa?

660
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:51,349
No, we didn't.

661
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:53,268
Grandma and Grandpa even praised us.

662
00:25:53,348 --> 00:25:55,147
- Really?
- They even said we're smart.

663
00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:56,308
Why did they say that?

664
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,388
It's nothing.

665
00:25:57,547 --> 00:25:59,348
Let them sleep early when you go back.

666
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:01,547
Take these.

667
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:03,348
Mom and Dad, you've worked hard.

668
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:04,428
Well, tomorrow...

669
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:05,627
Your mom and I have

670
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:07,067
had it all ready for tomorrow.

671
00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:08,828
We've got a feast ready.

672
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:10,227
You're welcome to bring her here.

673
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:11,588
Alright then.

674
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,547
What's your girlfriend's name?

675
00:26:14,428 --> 00:26:15,428
Xu Kaixin.

676
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:16,628
Xu Kaixin?

677
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:19,028
This name is quite interesting.

678
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:20,227
Yes, it's quite special.

679
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:21,787
Alright, go back now.

680
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,588
No more playing.

681
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:25,227
- Okay, sleep early.
- Rest early.

682
00:26:25,787 --> 00:26:26,748
Bye, Grandpa, Grandma.

683
00:26:26,828 --> 00:26:27,828
Bye, Grandpa, Grandma.

684
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:28,987
Bye-bye.

685
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:30,028
Bye-bye.

686
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:30,868
Go to bed early.

687
00:26:30,948 --> 00:26:31,549
I'm off.

688
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:33,307
Okay.

689
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:40,148
Xu Kaixin?

690
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:43,787
I wonder
if she'll still be happy tomorrow.

691
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:47,348
We've arrived.

692
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:49,067
Let's keep drinking.

693
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:51,868
No more drinking.

694
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,148
Keep drinking.

695
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:56,908
Here we are.

696
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:58,227
We've arrived.

697
00:26:58,547 --> 00:26:59,868
Have more drinks.

698
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:14,348
Come on.

699
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:16,147
Take off your clothes and shoes.

700
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:18,467
Let's drink together. Keep drinking.

701
00:27:20,227 --> 00:27:21,987
Fine, you win.

702
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:25,067
Drink.

703
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:27,547
Drink.

704
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:42,267
Xiaojiao,

705
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:43,987
Qian Hao is drunk.

706
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,467
I brought him home.

707
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:47,388
Where are you?

708
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,388
Take off your clothes.

709
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:01,148
What did I say?

710
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:02,907
From the beginning, Qian Hao

711
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:03,987
was up to no good.

712
00:28:04,547 --> 00:28:06,067
Now you've learned your lesson, right?

713
00:28:07,507 --> 00:28:09,388
I know I'm wrong, Uncle.

714
00:28:11,547 --> 00:28:13,987
Qian Hao said he doesn't love me at all.

715
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,667
He's with me because

716
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:17,308
I'm better off than Xu Kaixin,

717
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:18,588
and I can help him.

718
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:19,668
He tells me every day

719
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:21,588
that he loves me.

720
00:28:21,828 --> 00:28:23,348
It's all lies.

721
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,668
Even if he kneels

722
00:28:25,748 --> 00:28:27,308
in front of me and begs me,

723
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:28,069
this time I won't

724
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:29,787
be with him anymore.

725
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:32,027
I doubt that.

726
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:33,548
If Qian Hao coaxes you

727
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,627
with some sweet words,

728
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:35,349
you'll forget

729
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:37,227
who your uncle and aunt are.

730
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:39,388
Look at my aunt.

731
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,868
Don't say anything discouraging.

732
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:45,987
People grow through their falls.

733
00:28:47,507 --> 00:28:49,067
Do you think everyone is like you,

734
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:50,028
able to find

735
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:51,108
a good husband like me?

736
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:55,227
Alright.

737
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:56,668
Consider me meddlesome.

738
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:58,108
Don't bother updating me

739
00:28:58,188 --> 00:28:59,068
about her anymore.

740
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:01,388
Stop saying she's upset you and such.

741
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:02,787
I don't care.

742
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:09,108
Xiaojiao,

743
00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:10,747
having a stomachache?

744
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:11,868
It should be the food

745
00:29:11,948 --> 00:29:13,068
I've eaten lately.

746
00:29:13,148 --> 00:29:14,388
I always feel nauseous.

747
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:23,908
Xiaojiao,

748
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:26,428
could you be pregnant?

749
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:34,388
What are you saying?

750
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:36,668
Didn't I tell you that Qian Hao...

751
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:46,908

What are you doing?

758
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:18,427
Why are you up so late

759
00:30:18,507 --> 00:30:19,588
and coming out here?

760
00:30:20,428 --> 00:30:21,787
Mom, something's fishy.

761
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:23,268
I wondered why you

762
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:24,667
always failed your Chinese exam.

00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:26,868
If you say this again,

765
00:30:26,948 --> 00:30:27,987
no more pocket money.

766
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:29,747
Mom, calm down.

767
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:31,507
Why are you staying up late

768
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:32,788
and watching me?

769
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:34,227
I care about you.

770
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,387
Tell me.

771
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,228
Are you in love?

772
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:37,828
Are you trying to find me a stepdad?

773
00:30:39,987 --> 00:30:41,307
You need to have evidence.

774
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:42,547
Or it'll be defamation.

775
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,308
Mom, you're still too green.

776
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:45,828
You can't escape my sharp eyes.

777
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:53,588
Why do you care so much, little brat?

778
00:31:04,668 --> 00:31:05,667
Are you done yet?

779
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:07,987
Mom, do you have a date tomorrow?

780
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:09,789
Wait.

781
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:10,947
Did you

782
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:12,028
leave us behind

783
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:13,747
and go on a date tonight?

784
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:14,947
Why don't you

785
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:16,467
focus on studying?

786
00:31:16,547 --> 00:31:17,387
Want a beating?

787
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:18,227
Huh?

788
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,147
Come here.

789
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:20,667
Stop it.

790
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:21,747
Sorry.

791
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:23,747
Tell me.

792
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:24,947
How did you find out?

793
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:25,947
It's quite simple.

794
00:31:26,027 --> 00:31:27,108
You bought the facial masks

795
00:31:27,188 --> 00:31:28,427
for your birthday.

796
00:31:28,507 --> 00:31:29,029
You won't

797
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:30,428
use them before expiry.

798
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,227
Tonight you used one.

799
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,307
Something's up.

800
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:36,108
What if there's something

801
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,307
important at my work?

802
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:38,309
Come on, Mom.

803
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:39,947
I'm not a toddler anymore.

804
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:40,868
I'm eight already.

805
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:41,788
You can't fool me.

806
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:42,789
Those in the TV dramas

807
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:44,308
who meet their destined one

808
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:45,707
are all like you.

809
00:31:45,908 --> 00:31:46,749
You're not smiling,

810
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:48,188
yet your whole body is laughing.

811
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:49,869
I think you're

812
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,027
poisoned by idol dramas.

813
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:51,828
Listen.

814
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:52,549
I'll get your

815
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:54,148
drama-watching account shut down.

816
00:31:54,507 --> 00:31:56,027
Mom, we can talk about that later.

817
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:57,507
Are there any photos?

818
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:58,868
He could become my stepdad.

819
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:00,028
You'll need my advice.

820
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:01,627
Why do you care so much, you brat?

821
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:02,748
It's not your business.

822
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:03,828
Of course it is.

823
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:05,028
If you choose the wrong one

824
00:32:05,108 --> 00:32:06,108
and we don't get along,

825
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:07,388
won't that be a problem?

826
00:32:07,787 --> 00:32:09,628
It'll be a waste of emotion and energy.

827
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,108
Therefore, for both your sakes,

828
00:32:11,188 --> 00:32:12,427
out of a responsible attitude,

829
00:32:12,507 --> 00:32:14,067
I should oversee it.

830
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:15,988
That's absurd,

831
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,348
yet it strangely makes sense.

832
00:32:17,547 --> 00:32:18,548
Mom, let me take a look.

833
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:19,667
Just one look.

834
00:32:19,747 --> 00:32:21,588
Let me take a look. Please.

835
00:32:21,668 --> 00:32:22,668
Alright.

836
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,227
Go to sleep after this.

837
00:32:24,828 --> 00:32:25,828
I can't believe you.

838
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,856
(Mei Chengyi)

839
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:29,788
Mom,

840
00:32:29,868 --> 00:32:30,548
is there

841
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:31,628
something wrong with him?

842
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:33,588
What's wrong with him?

843
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:38,108
What does he see in you?

844
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:41,707
He has bad eyesight.

845
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:42,668
I have a bad brain.

846
00:32:42,748 --> 00:32:44,148
We're a perfect match, okay?

847
00:32:44,668 --> 00:32:45,667
Go to sleep now.

848
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:47,188
- Got it.
- Unbelievable.

849
00:32:47,707 --> 00:32:48,707
Get out now.

850
00:32:50,747 --> 00:32:51,948
Nothing is wrong.

851
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,707
He's just too handsome.

852
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:58,108
Unbelievable.

853
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:00,227
Then he quickly cut open

854
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:01,707
the belly of the big bad wolf

855
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:03,787
and rescued Grandma
and Little Red Riding Hood.

856
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,947
They weren't hurt at all.

857
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:06,908
Because the wolf

858
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:09,108
swallowed them whole.

859
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,187
Grandma made tea for everyone.

860
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:12,467
They drank tea

861
00:33:12,547 --> 00:33:14,868
and ate the cake
Little Red Riding Hood brought.

862
00:33:14,948 --> 00:33:16,627
They lived happily

863
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:17,948
ever after.

864
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:19,787
Alright, time to sleep.

865
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:20,948
Goodnight, Dad.

866
00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:22,028
Goodnight.

867
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:23,108
Goodnight.

868
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:25,668
By the way.

869
00:33:26,188 --> 00:33:26,948
Tomorrow,

870
00:33:27,028 --> 00:33:28,147
I will bring a lady

871
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:29,868
to your grandparents' place for lunch.

872
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:31,628
Can you behave?

873
00:33:34,108 --> 00:33:35,148
Alright, sleep now.

874
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:38,908
Dad, is the lady our stepmom?

875
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:41,227
Mom is just Mom.

876
00:33:41,307 --> 00:33:42,547
And the lady is just her.

877
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:43,828
She's not your stepmom.

878
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:47,547
Alright, sleep.

879
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:51,707
Goodnight.

Xiaojiao, are you done?

889
00:35:33,948 --> 00:35:35,507
What's going on?

890
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,908
Isn't Qian Hao...?

891
00:35:37,187 --> 00:35:38,948
That means his illness is cured.

892
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,348
Now that you have a baby,

893
00:35:45,428 --> 00:35:47,547
this matter is a different story.

894
00:35:51,948 --> 00:35:53,547
These are two separate matters for me.

895
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:55,668
I need to divorce him even more.

896
00:35:55,748 --> 00:35:57,987
Xiaojiao, your aunt is right.

897
00:35:58,828 --> 00:36:00,187
You are already at this age.

898
00:36:00,507 --> 00:36:02,187
This baby didn't come easily.

899
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:05,748
This matter needs careful planning.

900
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:42,232
(Class Reunion Message)

901
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:47,448
(Li Xiaoxiao: Added as a friend,
waiting for confirmation.)

902
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:16,228
Youyou.

903
00:37:16,428 --> 00:37:16,988
She's not up?

904
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,587
Hurry and get up.

905
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:19,548
Clean the floor

906
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:20,748
and the table.

907
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:22,987
It's so late, and you're still sleeping?

908
00:37:23,948 --> 00:37:24,948
Quickly get up.

909
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:27,268
- It's so late.
- Get up.

910
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:28,907
You don't even like

911
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:30,228
Chengyi's girlfriend.

912
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:31,828
What's with the fuss?

913
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:33,107
Let me sleep a bit longer.

914
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:35,107
Even if we dislike her,

915
00:37:35,187 --> 00:37:36,628
we still can't let her

916
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:37,987
pick out faults in us.

917
00:37:38,268 --> 00:37:39,268
Get up.

918
00:37:39,428 --> 00:37:41,547
Dad, what are you doing?

919
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,427
Can I at least

920
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:43,507
have some privacy?

921
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,547
There's no need for privacy
among family.

922
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:46,828
Get up quickly.

923
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:12,547
Lili,

924
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,868
I'm going out to have lunch.

925
00:38:13,948 --> 00:38:15,228
I'll come back right after that.

926
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:16,668
You're dressed so formally.

927
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:18,228
My mom is dating a handsome guy.

928
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:19,308
A date?

929
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:20,148
Not at all.

930
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:20,947
Nothing's set yet.

931
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:21,947
Don't listen to her.

932
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:22,709
He's so handsome.

933
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:24,107
Even more handsome than my dad.

934
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:25,907
Is he worse than your dad?

935
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:26,548
Lili,

936
00:38:26,628 --> 00:38:28,147
don't talk nonsense to the kids.

937
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:29,148
You two, be good.

938
00:38:29,228 --> 00:38:30,228
I'm leaving.

939
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,107
- Bye.
- Okay.

940
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:32,028
Bye, Mom.

941
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:33,147
Bye, Mom.

942
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:51,427
Well...

943
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:52,948
Get lost, Qian Hao.

944
00:38:57,428 --> 00:38:58,428
What are you doing here?

945
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:04,987
You have quite the nerve to say that.

946
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:06,507
You drank too much last night.

947
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:07,268
I took you back.

948
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:08,149
Xiaojiao wasn't in.

949
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:09,788
I stayed in case something happened.

950
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:11,387
You took me back?

951
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:12,628
Then why are you

952
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:13,748
in my bed?

953
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:15,947
You have the nerve to say that.

954
00:39:16,027 --> 00:39:17,027
Your sofa is so hard.

955
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,107
I couldn't sleep on it.

956
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:21,388
Hu Xiaojiao didn't come back all night?

957
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,147
That's right.

958
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:24,987
Does she often do that?

959
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:33,467
Hello, honey.

960
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:35,067
Where are you?

961
00:39:35,147 --> 00:39:35,908
Why didn't you

962
00:39:36,147 --> 00:39:37,667
come back all night?

963
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:38,748
She's with me.

964
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:39,908
What's up?

965
00:39:41,428 --> 00:39:42,428
U-Uncle?

966
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:44,627
Is Xiaojiao at your place?

967
00:39:45,027 --> 00:39:45,987
Then I'm relieved.

968
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,427
Anyway, she's at home, right?

969
00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:49,388
She can stay as long as she wants.

970
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:51,147
Come over tonight.

971
00:39:51,228 --> 00:39:52,388
I have something to tell you.

972
00:39:52,987 --> 00:39:53,629
Okay, Uncle.

973
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:55,067
I'll come over tonight.

974
00:39:55,147 --> 00:39:56,147
See you tonight.

975
00:39:56,987 --> 00:39:57,987
Qian Hao,

976
00:39:58,788 --> 00:39:59,669
I can see why you

977
00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:01,067
complained to me last night.

978
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:03,788
Alright.

979
00:40:04,388 --> 00:40:04,908
This is

980
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:06,067
our last drink together.

981
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:07,147
It won't happen again.

982
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:08,948
I won't drink with you.

983
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:11,027
Be careful not to get hit by a car.

984
00:40:11,187 --> 00:40:12,187
Don't talk nonsense.

985
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:24,708
Hello, Mom.

986
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:26,187
Son,

987
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:28,067
I want to discuss something with you.

988
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:30,228
It's the thing I mentioned

989
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:32,428
about Hu Xiaojiao being bad luck to you.

990
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:35,228
What's the matter?

991
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,308
Listen.

992
00:40:36,388 --> 00:40:38,268
I have this chat group for patients.

993
00:40:38,428 --> 00:40:40,428
There was a person
who got stomach cancer.

994
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:43,027
Even the doctors all said
he couldn't be cured.

995
00:40:43,147 --> 00:40:44,228
But he

996
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:45,387
found a master

997
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:46,667
to have a fortune told.

998
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,228
And as a result, he was cured.

999
00:40:49,788 --> 00:40:50,548
What's that?

1000
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:51,828
What master?

1001
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:53,147
Son,

1002
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:55,627
I know about my illness.

1003
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,348
Seeing doctors

1004
00:40:57,428 --> 00:40:59,067
won't give me any hope.

1005
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:02,067
But I still want to find some hope.

1006
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,428
Don't say that I'm superstitious.

1007
00:41:04,627 --> 00:41:05,668
That man in my group

1008
00:41:05,748 --> 00:41:07,228
was indeed cured.

1009
00:41:07,908 --> 00:41:09,228
I heard that the master

1010
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:11,067
only sees people with whom he's fated.

1011
00:41:11,627 --> 00:41:13,067
Let's try it

1012
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:15,027
and take me to see him, okay?

1013
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:18,708
When?

1014
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:20,308
I heard that the master

1015
00:41:20,388 --> 00:41:21,868
is practicing nearby.

1016
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,308
Let's go right away.

1017
00:41:23,388 --> 00:41:24,388
Okay?

1018
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:28,268
Alright.

1019
00:41:28,348 --> 00:41:29,189
Let me tidy up.

1020
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:30,587
I'll head out right away.

1021
00:41:41,987 --> 00:41:43,348
Uncle, I can't drink it.

1022
00:41:43,908 --> 00:41:44,789
Your aunt went

1023
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:45,907
to the supermarket early

1024
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:47,228
to buy you a hen and stewed it

1025
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:48,269
all morning.

1026
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:49,907
Look, she's skimmed off all the oil.

1027
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:51,547
You must drink it.

1028
00:41:57,587 --> 00:41:58,947
That's more like it.

1029
00:41:59,027 --> 00:42:00,308
You have to eat something.

1030
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:01,229
Otherwise, the baby

1031
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:02,587
won't get enough nutrition.

1032
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:08,708
Uncle, Aunt,

1033
00:42:09,107 --> 00:42:10,547
I can't have this baby.

1034
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:12,188
If there's a baby involved,

1035
00:42:12,268 --> 00:42:13,748
I can't get a divorce smoothly.

1036
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:16,348
Xiaojiao,

1037
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,107
just while you were in the shower,

1038
00:42:18,187 --> 00:42:19,627
Qian Hao called.

1039
00:42:20,187 --> 00:42:22,107
I told him to come over this afternoon.

1040
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:23,547
Whether you're divorcing,

1041
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,788
you need to talk

1042
00:42:24,868 --> 00:42:25,828
about this baby.

1043
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:28,107
You can't let him know about the baby.

1044
00:42:28,348 --> 00:42:29,348
Why?

1045
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,507
Why can't we let Qian Hao

1046
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:33,229
know?

1047
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:34,627
Exactly. Why?

1048
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:37,348
Isn't having a baby a good thing?

1049
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:40,908
Say something.

1050
00:42:40,988 --> 00:42:42,428
Qian Hao is not the father.

1051
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:44,348
You...

1052
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,428
Then...

1053
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,308
Who is it?

1054
00:42:47,388 --> 00:42:48,708
You must tell that man

1055
00:42:48,788 --> 00:42:50,547
and make him take responsibility.

1056
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:52,067
If you

1057
00:42:52,147 --> 00:42:52,947
get an abortion

1058
00:42:53,027 --> 00:42:53,947
and hurt your body,

1059
00:42:54,027 --> 00:42:54,907
you may not

1060
00:42:54,987 --> 00:42:55,828
have another baby.

1061
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:56,709
Exactly. Tell us.

1062
00:42:56,789 --> 00:42:58,388
Who is that man?

1063
00:42:58,507 --> 00:42:59,788
Stop asking.

1064
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:01,228
I don't know either.

1065
00:43:02,388 --> 00:43:03,507
I was drunk that day.

1066
00:43:03,587 --> 00:43:04,667
He was gone when I woke up.
