Auntie.

Xiaojiao.

19
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:54,824
What happened?

20
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:55,625
You're alone?

21
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,503
Where is Qian Hao?

22
00:01:57,704 --> 00:01:58,704
Auntie.

23
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:01,023
Don't cry.

24
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:01,825
It's okay.

25
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:03,264
I'm here for you.

26
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:05,223
And your uncle will come

27
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:06,423
once he gets off work.

28
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:07,345
Tell me

29
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:08,703
what happened.

30
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,184
Qian Hao's mom was seriously ill

31
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:12,584
and was sent to the ICU.

32
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:14,184
I was in a rush

33
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:15,703
and sprained my ankle.

34
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,064
But Qian Hao didn't even

35
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:19,464
check on me.

36
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:21,744
He even yelled at me

37
00:02:21,744 --> 00:02:22,904
in front of his ex-wife.

38
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:24,103
Calm down.

39
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:25,304
You...

40
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:27,103
As a filial son,

41
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,344
Qian Hao was really worried

42
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:30,184
about his mom.

43
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,943
That's why he neglected you.

44
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:33,185
Xiaojiao,

45
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:35,103
we both know

46
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:36,304
how you got pregnant.

47
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:37,783
Qian Hao will

48
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,703
inevitably divorce you.

49
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:41,263
No man could stand it.

50
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:43,464
I really

51
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,424
can't scold him for that.

52
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:46,503
You..

53
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:47,663
But Auntie,

54
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:48,425
I've tried

55
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:50,783
so hard to make it up to him.

56
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,064
Besides, it was just an mistake.

57
00:02:54,263 --> 00:02:56,663
Qian Hao even attempted solicitation.

58
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,184
Why can't we

59
00:02:58,184 --> 00:02:59,424
call it even?

60
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:00,584
No. 32.

61
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:05,464
No. 32, it's time for your injection.

62
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:09,184
What for?

63
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,144
To keep the baby.

64
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:10,905
She bled.

65
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:12,223
She may lose the baby.

66
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:14,104
No injection.

67
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:15,263
No injection for her.

68
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:17,783
Why keep the baby?

69
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:19,624
It's better to abort it.

70
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:21,943
Let's end this farce.

71
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:24,263
It saves you from having surgery.

72
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:32,391
(Intensive Care Unit)

73
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:37,304
Doctor, how is my mom?

74
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:38,544
She has regained

75
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:39,783
some consciousness.

76
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:41,383
But she's looking for someone.

77
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:42,425
We couldn't figure out

78
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:43,584
what she was saying.

79
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:44,503
So I recorded it

80
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:45,224
to show you.

81
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,543
Maybe she's holding

82
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:48,744
onto something she can't let go.

83
00:03:58,543 --> 00:03:59,823
(My grandson.)

84
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:14,983
Finally gone.

85
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,224
Master.

86
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:27,864
I'll start to ask for leave

87
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:28,864
on Qingming Festivals.

88
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:30,343
In your dreams.

89
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:32,544
We're swamped
during the Qingming Festival.

90
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:33,903
And you want days off?

91
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:35,383
What else can I do?

92
00:04:35,463 --> 00:04:36,703
I can't be seen.

93
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:38,304
We'll see.

94
00:04:38,984 --> 00:04:41,503
I bet you'll figure something out.

95
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:44,664
Actually, I remember

96
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:46,184
your brother-in-law.

97
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,744
Stop bragging, Master.

98
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:49,504
There are so many

99
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:50,664
graves and visitors.

100
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:51,943
You remember all of them?

101
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,143
Of course not.

102
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,343
But some of them are more memorable.

103
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:58,625
I think

104
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,184
it was a few years ago,

105
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:02,383
not long after your sister

106
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:03,383
moved in here.

107
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,184
On a winter day,

108
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,343
he got drunk and clung to

109
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:08,383
your sister's

110
00:05:08,383 --> 00:05:09,383
tombstone.

111
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:10,425
Thankfully,

112
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:11,744
I saw him while patrolling.

113
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,304
Otherwise, he might have

114
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:14,304
frozen to death.

115
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:20,903
Well...

116
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:23,624
Someone's attacking me again.

117
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:25,823
Come on, help me.

118
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:27,864
Come on.

119
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:29,744
Help.

120
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:32,823
Come on.

121
00:05:34,104 --> 00:05:35,903
I'm speechless, Master.

122
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,424
Stop bragging when you're so lame.

123
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:40,343
This way.

124
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:41,143
Let me show you

125
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:42,664
- what I've got.
- That is it.

126
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:43,824
This way.

127
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:45,784
Busy teamfighting at the tower.

128
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:46,784
Yeah.

129
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:48,143
This way.

130
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:49,463
Go around this way.

131
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,225
I know.

132
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,544
Go around this way.

133
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:52,984
You're blocking the screen. Move.

134
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:53,984
Watch

135
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:55,143
and learn.

136
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:56,703
W, then E, and then Q.

137
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,023
Did you see that?

138
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:00,383
Steal their blue.

139
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:01,823
Come on, I'm going for the kill.

140
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:03,263
Look up.

141
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,144
For what?

142
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:05,224
I'm going for the kill.

143
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:06,144
Watch and learn.

144
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:07,463
W, then E, and then Q.

145
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:08,463
Here we go.

146
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,784
(Tianya, How are you today?)

147
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:53,864
Auntie.

148
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:56,903
Auntie.

149
00:06:58,703 --> 00:06:59,703
Auntie.

150
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:02,384
Could you

151
00:07:02,384 --> 00:07:03,943
take a look at the ICU?

152
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:08,984
Auntie.

153
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,463
Xu Kaixin and her kids

154
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:12,463
are there.

155
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,703
Check on them for me, please.

156
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:15,865
I can't just

157
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:17,383
break up with Qian Hao so easily.

158
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,264
Although you

159
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:19,583
want me to get divorced,

160
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,343
I can't do it if there's still hope.

161
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:23,744
What does it

162
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,383
have to do with Xu Kaixin?

163
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:26,144
It's all because

164
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:27,624
of this baby you're carrying.

165
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:29,264
If he didn't

166
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:30,583
want to remarry Xu Kaixin,

167
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,984
why wouldn't he forgive me?

168
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:35,704
How many men

169
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:37,184
are willing to be cheated on

170
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:38,184
in this world?

171
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:39,984
Auntie, just help me

172
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:40,984
one last time.

173
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:45,984
To be honest,

174
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:47,425
I've almost

175
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,984
lost all hope.

176
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:51,784
I just feel
a little reluctant deep down.

177
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,263
Just a little bit.

178
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:55,144
Actually, I've wanted

179
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:56,583
to give up several times.

180
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:57,344
Every time

181
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,784
I was about to give up,

182
00:07:58,784 --> 00:07:59,584
I saw Qian Hao

183
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:00,984
in agony.

184
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:02,105
And I felt

185
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:03,823
that maybe he would be fine

186
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:04,704
once he got over it

187
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:06,184
and things would go back to normal.

188
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:07,785
Besides,

189
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:09,064
he still loves me.

190
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:10,184
He just doesn't

191
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:11,343
know it.

192
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:14,745
It's like

193
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,383
that story of the boots.

194
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:18,143
Once the second boot

195
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:19,304
dropped on the ground,

196
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:20,784
I would be at ease.

197
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:22,343
Then I promise

198
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:24,984
I will do as you say.

199
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:32,424
Fine.

200
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,184
I'll go myself.

201
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:38,623
Fine, I'll go.

202
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:44,743
Both you and your uncle bully me

203
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:45,743
and boss me around.

204
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:47,943
Thank you, Auntie.

205
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:09,623
Well...

206
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:10,943
The kids are asleep.

207
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:12,583
How is she doing?

208
00:09:15,463 --> 00:09:17,024
Tonight is critical.

209
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:18,943
If she makes it,

210
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:20,103
there is still hope.

211
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:23,623
The kids can't stay here

212
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:24,623
all night.

213
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:26,343
We can. But it's too much for them.

214
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:27,463
How about this?

215
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:28,185
I'll get a room

216
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:29,664
in a hotel somewhere nearby

217
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:31,144
for them to rest.

218
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:32,703
We'll rush here if anything happens.

219
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:35,743
I'll go with you.

220
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,103
I have something to tell you.

221
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:38,703
Someone needs to stay here.

222
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,983
My dad is downstairs.

223
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:41,103
He'll fill in for me.

224
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:42,223
I'll get him a room

225
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:43,184
to rest, too.

226
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,145
He's aged

227
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:45,504
and can't stay up all night.

228
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:46,463
Listen.

229
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:47,065
You should

230
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:48,343
take care of Hu Xiaojiao.

231
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:49,583
Spotting in early pregnancy

232
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,743
is not a good sign.

233
00:09:51,863 --> 00:09:53,384
Let her be. It's okay.

234
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:55,743
Settle the kids first.

235
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:09,064
One twin room.

236
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:09,983
One king bed room.

237
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:10,983
Okay.

238
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:12,024
I got it.

239
00:10:12,024 --> 00:10:13,024
I got it.

240
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,144
I wasn't going to pay.

241
00:10:15,424 --> 00:10:16,424
Just getting my ID card.

242
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,343
Thank you.

243
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:24,264
Two rooms for a total of 1,900 yuan.

244
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:25,264
Here's my QR code.

245
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:29,024
Okay.

246
00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:30,024
Alright.

247
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:34,144
Here are the room keys.

248
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:34,704
Thank you.

249
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:35,983
Wish you a pleasant stay.

250
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:39,223
Let's go.

251
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:50,424
This way.

252
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:56,904
Come on.

253
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:04,343
(Isn't she asking for trouble?)

254
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,184
(What a nice family.)

255
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:07,664
(What a sin.)

256
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:12,905
You got on the bed

257
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,223
with your shoes on?

258
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:15,184
Take them off.

259
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:17,583
Mommy, I want to pee.

260
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:18,743
Alright, come on.

261
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:19,743
Let's go.

262
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,064
Dami, cover yourself with the blanket.

263
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:29,064
Don't catch a cold.

264
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:42,905
Mom.

265
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:44,384
Dad is also sleeping here...

266
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:47,064
Let's go next door.

267
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:48,863
Okay.

268
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:54,823
Let's go.

269
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:45,024
Help, Master.

270
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,583
I'm going to patrol with Yiersan.

271
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:50,823
See you.

272
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:56,024
The kid has grown up. Speak properly.

273
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,703
Let's go, Yiersan.

274
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:17,463
Chengyi.

275
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:19,583
Why did you come back again?

276
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:23,703
The writings on your sister's

277
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,703
tombstone...

278
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,463
What do you mean by "again"?

279
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:28,504
So you saw me earlier,

280
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:29,504
right?

281
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,664
No.

282
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:44,983
A large state-owned enterprise

283
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,863
where you manage thousands of people?

284
00:13:48,343 --> 00:13:50,703
Well, I didn't say
whether the people are on the ground

285
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:51,904
or underground.

286
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:53,024
Right?

287
00:13:53,703 --> 00:13:55,264
Look, so many tombs.

288
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:56,504
I manage all of them.

289
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:58,623
Aren't there thousands of people?

290
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:01,384
Besides,

291
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,583
our cemetery is still expanding.

292
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:05,863
Affiliated to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

293
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:07,463
A large state-owned enterprise.

294
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:09,264
I wasn't lying.

295
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:15,024
If it's really so fancy,

296
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:18,463
why don't you tell your parents

297
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:20,184
what you just said?

298
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:24,223
Alright, Chengyi.

299
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,024
If you set me up,

300
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:27,823
I'll complain to my sister every day.

301
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:29,064
You...

302
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:37,223
You left those flowers in front of

303
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:38,223
her tombstone?

304
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:43,024
Chengyi.

305
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:45,223
I really like it here.

306
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:46,264
It's quiet.

307
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:48,264
No tricky human connections.

308
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:49,623
And I'm paid well.

309
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:50,584
I don't have

310
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:51,823
any KPIs to meet.

311
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:53,704
And I can

312
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:55,424
talk to my sister when I'm free.

313
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,983
This is the perfect job

314
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,664
for someone who wants to make life easy.

315
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:02,583
Chengyi.

316
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:04,424
You know

317
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:05,823
I chose to go abroad

318
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:07,784
before my sister's funeral.

319
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:09,863
And I've been avoiding

320
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:11,784
talking about it.

321
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,264
So, I never knew

322
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:14,703
where her grave was.

323
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:16,463
It's right here.

324
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:17,983
It's such a coincidence.

325
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:19,583
I seriously suspect

326
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:21,064
that it was my sister

327
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:23,223
who summoned me here.

328
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,904
Enough, stop right there.

329
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,664
It's getting ridiculous.

330
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:42,024
Your parents say
you're living in the dorm.

331
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:44,064
It's right here?

332
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:46,223
That's my room.

333
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:53,064
What do you think?

334
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:54,463
Isn't it quite nice?

335
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:57,823
How can a young lady

336
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,785
live in a cemetery?

337
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,463
Aren't you scared at night?

338
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:02,103
Should I call you reckless

339
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:03,223
or just bold?

340
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:04,223
It's fine.

341
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:06,223
My master takes good care of me.

342
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:07,145
Besides,

343
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:08,703
there's a security guard.

344
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:10,024
I also have a dog

345
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:11,024
called Yiersan.

346
00:16:15,863 --> 00:16:16,664
Chengyi.

347
00:16:16,863 --> 00:16:18,223
Believe it or not,

348
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,583
I've been an insomniac for years.

349
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:22,024
I sleep better here

350
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:23,424
than anywhere else.

351
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,103
I sleep till dawn.

352
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,144
That was one of the reasons

353
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:29,623
why I chose to work here.

354
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:31,384
An overseas graduate

355
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:33,384
is living a retired life here.

356
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:34,784
What if your parents find out?

357
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,703
How would they

358
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:38,583
find out if you don't tell them?

359
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:43,144
Chengyi.

360
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:46,064
Dear Chengyi.

361
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:48,384
Dearest Chengyi.

362
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,664
Help me out.

363
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:51,463
Enough.

364
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:53,064
Straighten your tongue.

365
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:53,744
Speak properly.

366
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:55,024
Otherwise, I'll call Dad.

367
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:56,024
Mei Chengyi.

368
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:57,343
If you set me up,

369
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,904
my sister

370
00:16:57,904 --> 00:16:58,904
won't let you off.

371
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:01,904
Stop threatening me with your sister.

372
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:06,183
I'll take it as you've agreed.

373
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:08,623
Chengyi.

374
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:10,224
Chengyi.

375
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:40,343
Sorry, I fell asleep

376
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:41,704
and caused you trouble.

377
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:43,143
The kids are asleep.

378
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,863
Hurry back to the hospital.

379
00:17:47,623 --> 00:17:49,103
Can we talk for a minute?

380
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:50,984
You have the mood

381
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:51,984
to talk to me?

382
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:54,383
About what?

383
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:57,304
About Xiaomi.

384
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:06,984
Let's talk here.

385
00:18:09,064 --> 00:18:10,863
Okay, I'll make it short.

386
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:13,103
I wanted to

387
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:15,064
ask you to remarry me,

388
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,704
so that you and the kids

389
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:18,823
could have a home.

390
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:21,504
I also couldn't let go of our past.

391
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:24,584
But now, I realize

392
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:25,704
that you wouldn't

393
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:26,704
remarry me.

394
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:28,985
You finally developed

395
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:30,623
the self-awareness of a middle-aged man.

396
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:32,623
Yeah.

397
00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:34,944
So now, I want

398
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:36,343
to make a fair deal with you.

399
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:38,744
What deal?

400
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:40,264
I'll give back

401
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:44,024
your apartment plus an extra

402
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,704
300,000 yuan

403
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:47,103
and I'll take Xiaomi.

404
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:48,984
Qian Hao.

405
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:50,304
Your shamelessness

406
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,545
has gone beyond

407
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:53,064
my wildest imagination.

408
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:57,024
I know you find it hard to accept.

409
00:18:57,623 --> 00:18:58,863
But you know me.

410
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:00,464
Whenever I want to do something,

411
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:01,504
no one can stop me.

412
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:04,143
My mom is in ICU.

413
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:06,264
Xiaomi is the last thread
of her attachment.

414
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:07,863
Whatever the cost,

415
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,623
I will get my son back.

416
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:17,704
I advise you to accept my proposal,

417
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,464
or you will regret it.

418
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:21,423
I already regret it now.

419
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,944
I shouldn't have brought them

420
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:23,663
here.

421
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,663
Why should I

422
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,304
pay for your filial piety?

423
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:28,823
Even if my mom pulls through,

424
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:30,343
she doesn't have much time left.

425
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,423
I can't let her die with regrets.

426
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:33,863
We have two children.

427
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:35,992
One for you and one for me.
It's only fair.

428
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:38,623
What are you doing?

429
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:39,465
You cheated on me

430
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:40,704
and stole the apartment.

431
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:41,744
How was that fair?

432
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:42,744
You chose

433
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:43,664
to ignore our kids.

434
00:19:43,664 --> 00:19:45,064
How was that fair?

435
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:45,864
You want custody

436
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:47,064
after Lili and I

437
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,065
did everything for them.

438
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:49,423
How is that fair?

439
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:51,143
As I said, Xu Kaixin.

440
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:52,663
Everyone makes mistakes.

441
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:53,704
Why won't you

442
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:54,584
give me a chance

443
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,264
to make things right?

444
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:57,264
Qian Hao.

445
00:19:58,183 --> 00:19:59,863
You won't cherish your child

446
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:00,863
with Hu Xiaojiao

447
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:03,064
and insist on taking my son.

448
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:05,025
Is Hu Xiaojiao

449
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:06,224
carrying

450
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:07,504
someone else's child?

451
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,863
Yeah, you're right.

452
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,103
Hu Xiaojiao

453
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:38,823
keeps saying she loves me,

454
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:40,424
but she's carrying

455
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:42,064
another man's child.

456
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:54,144
Now you know

457
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:55,304
my determination

458
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:56,304
to get my son back.

459
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,505
I advise you

460
00:20:58,505 --> 00:20:59,623
to think it over.

461
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:00,863
Take the apartment.

462
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:02,183
Then Dami and you

463
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:03,663
won't need to rent a house.

464
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,304
You'll have a place of your own.

465
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:06,704
I'm not selling my kid.

466
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:08,183
Also,

467
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:09,383
I have a home.

468
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:11,504
You're the one who doesn't have a home.

469
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:15,544
You lonely soul.

470
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:57,383
What's going on?

471
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:58,903
I'm just telling her.

472
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,784
Once a man and a woman

473
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:01,744
have kids,

474
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:02,465
they can't

475
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,823
possibly sever ties.

476
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:06,704
You didn't see how much Qian Hao tried

477
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:08,024
to cling to them.

478
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,224
You should see for yourself.

479
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:11,225
You must stop

480
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,583
deceiving yourself.

481
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:14,143
Although his mom

482
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,423
is in ICU at the moment,

483
00:23:15,504 --> 00:23:17,464
he has had the mood and time

484
00:23:17,623 --> 00:23:18,984
to take his ex-wife

485
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,504
and kids to the hotel.

486
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:21,984
But he doesn't even

487
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,143
come downstairs

488
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:24,264
to check on you

489
00:23:24,264 --> 00:23:25,464
for a second.

490
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,264
But to be honest,

491
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:30,224
I'd find him weird

492
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,423
if he really came to see you.

493
00:23:33,064 --> 00:23:35,064
Alright, stop nagging her.

494
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:39,823
Xiaojiao.

495
00:23:40,944 --> 00:23:41,785
Your auntie

496
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:43,264
told me everything on the phone.

497
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,784
It's crude but true.

498
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:47,305
No man can really

499
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:48,903
accept the fact that his wife

500
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:50,224
is carrying

501
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:51,383
someone else's child.

502
00:23:52,504 --> 00:23:54,823
It's time to wake up.

503
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,623
He said he wouldn't divorce me

504
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,423
and would treat my child

505
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:02,383
as his own.

506
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:04,903
I didn't force him.

507
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,583
Xiaojiao,

508
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,143
you're a smart girl.

509
00:24:08,143 --> 00:24:09,863
You're just obsessed

510
00:24:09,863 --> 00:24:10,863
over it now.

511
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,823
You know very well

512
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:14,583
why he said that.

513
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:16,623
His mother is seriously ill.

514
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,504
This child is of no use

515
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:20,064
to him anymore.

516
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,623
We should sort everything out now.

517
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:24,024
If this drags on,

518
00:24:24,224 --> 00:24:25,704
it will be harmful

519
00:24:25,823 --> 00:24:27,103
to your health.

520
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:29,464
No way.

521
00:24:29,823 --> 00:24:30,903
No way, Uncle.

522
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,464
We have been together for years.

523
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,344
He definitely

524
00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:35,984
has feelings for me.

525
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,863
I guess he does have feelings for you.

526
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:40,744
But that makes it even harder

527
00:24:40,744 --> 00:24:42,504
for him to accept your betrayal.

528
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:44,304
There is no way out.

529
00:24:47,024 --> 00:24:48,103
Xiaojiao,

530
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:49,944
stop lying to yourself.

531
00:24:49,944 --> 00:24:51,464
Self-deception won't help.

532
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:56,823
What about the child?

533
00:24:57,984 --> 00:24:59,583
If I abort the child,

534
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:01,904
I might not

535
00:25:01,904 --> 00:25:03,264
be able to conceive again.

536
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:13,623
It's up to you.

537
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:16,744
Anyway, we can afford

538
00:25:16,744 --> 00:25:18,064
to raise a child.

539
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:22,264
I don't know.

540
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:25,304
Xiaojiao.

541
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:27,583
I stand by what I said.

542
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,823
Put your hand on your belly.

543
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:33,103
Do you have feelings for this child?

544
00:25:34,224 --> 00:25:35,823
Will you love him?

545
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:41,024
I don't know.

546
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,183
But he ruined my life.

547
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:44,904
I really hoped

548
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:47,064
to have a child with Qian Hao.

549
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:48,305
What does it

550
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:49,823
have to do with this child?

551
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,224
He was involved into this

552
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:53,224
against his will.

553
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,823
You don't love him
and you complain about him.

554
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,583
Why would you

555
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,224
bring him into this world?

556
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,464
Just to suffer?

557
00:26:00,464 --> 00:26:01,823
You can't just give birth to him

558
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:03,064
so that he takes care

559
00:26:03,183 --> 00:26:04,504
of you when you're old.

560
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:08,784
Auntie, you couldn't give birth.

561
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:09,624
Do you also hope

562
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:10,823
that I can never

563
00:26:10,823 --> 00:26:12,663
have my own child just like you?

564
00:26:12,663 --> 00:26:13,984
Hu Xiaojiao, shut up.

565
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:18,224
Hu Xiaojiao.

566
00:26:18,464 --> 00:26:20,103
You're going too far.

567
00:26:21,304 --> 00:26:22,383
Oh my.

568
00:26:22,383 --> 00:26:24,984
I-I just never learn.

569
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,423
When someone slaps me,

570
00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:27,823
I ask for seconds.

571
00:26:27,823 --> 00:26:28,823
Right?

572
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:30,704
Xia Chungeng.

573
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:31,744
If I ever meddle

574
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:33,304
in your family's affairs again,

575
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,304
I'll get hit by a car.

576
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,663
Honey.

577
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:41,143
Honey.

578
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:43,024
You...

579
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:00,143
Honey, calm down.

580
00:27:00,383 --> 00:27:01,184
Calm down.

581
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:02,343
Xia Chungeng, let go.

582
00:27:02,343 --> 00:27:03,343
Why are you pulling me?

583
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:05,504
Honey.

584
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,423
Don't let her upset you.

585
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:08,183
Okay?

586
00:27:08,343 --> 00:27:10,304
She's unruly.

587
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:12,383
I swear we're not going to

588
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:13,464
care anymore.

589
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:15,224
I will stop looking after her.

590
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:18,383
I'll sever ties with whoever

591
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:20,583
hurts my wife

592
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:22,423
even if they're my relatives.

593
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:26,224
Let me call my sister.

594
00:27:44,544 --> 00:27:45,544
Hello.

595
00:27:47,464 --> 00:27:48,623
Are you insane?

596
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:49,465
Why are you

597
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:51,064
calling me in the dead of night?

598
00:27:52,744 --> 00:27:53,744
Sister.

599
00:27:59,183 --> 00:28:00,464
Sister, listen.

600
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:02,464
We can't handle your daughter.

601
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:03,505
Stop telling me

602
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:04,704
to take care of her again.

603
00:28:05,064 --> 00:28:06,264
What are you saying?

604
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:07,985
You're not going to

605
00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:09,224
look after your niece

606
00:28:09,224 --> 00:28:09,824
Hu Xiaojiao

607
00:28:09,824 --> 00:28:10,903
and your sister?

608
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:14,143
Xia Chungeng, why don't you

609
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:16,784
stop looking after Mom as well?

610
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:18,623
Don't stray from the point.

611
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:21,264
Xiaojiao is too unruly.

612
00:28:21,823 --> 00:28:22,824
We were telling her

613
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:24,143
to abort the child.

614
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:25,504
After all, we don't even know

615
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,504
who the father is.

616
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,624
But she insists

617
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:28,984
on giving birth

618
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:31,103
despite her resentment.

619
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:32,504
What's more,

620
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:35,103
she even made
sarcastic comments about my wife.

621
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:36,784
We can't do it

622
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:38,064
anymore.

623
00:28:39,143 --> 00:28:40,984
Xiaojiao did nothing wrong.

624
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:42,903
That's her child.

625
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:44,264
Why would she abort it?

626
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:46,704
Besides,

627
00:28:46,823 --> 00:28:49,064
you can't have a child
even if you want to.

628
00:28:49,903 --> 00:28:51,383
Watch your mouth!

629
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:52,505
Didn't you always say

630
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:53,663
that I was love-struck?

631
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:55,823
So Xiaojiao takes after me.

632
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,664
Besides,

633
00:28:56,664 --> 00:28:58,224
aren't you the same?

634
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,984
You gave up the opportunity to go abroad

635
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,504
when you were young

636
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:04,583
because of your wife.

637
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,704
She couldn't have kids.

638
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,224
You just accepted it.

639
00:29:08,024 --> 00:29:10,863
Our whole family is love-struck.

640
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:12,064
No one gets to

641
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,304
criticize anyone, okay?

642
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:16,504
Fine.

643
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:18,104
I'm telling you.

644
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:19,224
With a mom like you,

645
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,383
no wonder Xiaojiao is having issues.

646
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:23,064
I'm speechless.

647
00:29:23,183 --> 00:29:24,224
Alright.

648
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:26,823
I'm officially done with it.

649
00:29:26,823 --> 00:29:27,863
What?

650
00:29:27,863 --> 00:29:28,584
You can't quit.

651
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:29,823
Who else will look after her?

652
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:31,423
You have to take care of her.

653
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:32,663
I...

654
00:29:34,103 --> 00:29:35,224
I don't care.

655
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:36,663
If you're so capable

656
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:37,583
and so authoritative,

657
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,225
fly over

658
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:39,663
and discipline your daughter.

659
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,024
Dad.

660
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:00,623
Has the doctor come out?

661
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:03,744
No.

662
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:11,423
I almost forgot something.

663
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:15,143
Your mom got up early

664
00:30:15,143 --> 00:30:16,143
and made this for you.

665
00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:19,064
She was going to take it to your place.

666
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:32,383
Well, it does make a difference.

667
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:35,623
You've become a lot more stable.

668
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:36,984
You used to be

669
00:31:36,984 --> 00:31:38,704
on edge all the time.

670
00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:40,823
Turns out

671
00:31:40,823 --> 00:31:41,823
this job

672
00:31:42,304 --> 00:31:44,024
works better than a psychologist.

673
00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:47,224
Maybe...

674
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,224
Maybe it's because

675
00:31:49,704 --> 00:31:51,024
I've never let go

676
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,623
of my sister's death.

677
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:54,784
My sister is gone.

678
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:57,024
But I have been trapped here.

679
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,823
I used to think that

680
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:01,304
she went somewhere terrifying

681
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:02,704
and miserable.

682
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:04,305
But now,

683
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:05,823
I stroll in the cemetery every day.

684
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:06,903
Whenever I miss her,

685
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:08,903
I just go and talk to her.

686
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:12,863
Suddenly, death doesn't

687
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,183
seem so scary anymore.

688
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,143
Didn't you leave?

689
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:25,464
Why did you come back?

690
00:32:27,024 --> 00:32:28,663
I was already at the station

691
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:29,584
when I remembered

692
00:32:29,584 --> 00:32:30,903
that the stele inscription

693
00:32:30,903 --> 00:32:31,785
had faded a bit.

694
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:32,984
So I came back to ask

695
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:33,745
the office staff

696
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,143
to repaint the characters later.

697
00:32:36,823 --> 00:32:37,823
Yeah.

698
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:39,224
You're the most meticulous.

699
00:32:39,343 --> 00:32:40,623
I'll do it tomorrow.

700
00:32:44,944 --> 00:32:48,583
Isn't today a workday?

701
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:50,583
Why aren't you at work?

702
00:32:52,544 --> 00:32:53,704
There might be

703
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:55,383
some changes in my job.

704
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,504
I came today

705
00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:59,064
to share some good news

706
00:32:59,464 --> 00:33:00,784
with your sister.

707
00:33:00,903 --> 00:33:02,343
I promised her

708
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,984
that I wouldn't hide anything from her.

709
00:33:07,464 --> 00:33:09,064
Chengyi, are you

710
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,264
really in love?

711
00:33:14,304 --> 00:33:15,504
To be honest,

712
00:33:16,623 --> 00:33:17,663
I'm in love.

713
00:33:19,903 --> 00:33:21,183
Let's not talk about me.

714
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:22,623
Mind your own business.

715
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:24,663
How can you hide it from your parents?

716
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:25,864
Dad is not

717
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:27,103
a silly old man

718
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:28,103
who's easy to fool.

719
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,064
Then I'll just admit it

720
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:31,583
if I can't hide it.

721
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:32,744
In the worst case,

722
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:33,744
I'll stay at home.

723
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:35,663
We'll see who cracks first.

724
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,024
Be careful.

725
00:33:54,663 --> 00:33:56,224
Qian Hao is so pushy.

726
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,663
Won't you take the kids home?

727
00:33:58,663 --> 00:33:59,863
I won't push him so hard.

728
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:01,264
Qian Hao

729
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:02,863
is really upset about his mom.

730
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:04,264
If anything happens,

731
00:34:04,423 --> 00:34:05,744
and his mom

732
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,464
doesn't get to see her only grandson,

733
00:34:07,823 --> 00:34:09,464
I'm afraid he'll go crazy

734
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:11,623
and do something unexpected.

735
00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:12,984
Then we'll suffer.

736
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:14,264
We'll stay

737
00:34:14,264 --> 00:34:15,424
for one more night.

738
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:16,743
And tomorrow,

739
00:34:16,743 --> 00:34:18,424
if everything is normal,

740
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,544
I'll send the kids

741
00:34:19,544 --> 00:34:20,425
to school

742
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,864
and kindergarten.

743
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:24,344
Aren't you worried that

744
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:25,743
he'll do something to Xiaomi?

745
00:34:25,743 --> 00:34:26,984
Of course, I am.

746
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:28,103
But

747
00:34:28,103 --> 00:34:29,583
we're about to move soon.

748
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:32,464
What?

749
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:36,864
Really?

750
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:39,583
Hu Xiaojiao is carrying other's...

751
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:40,545
Keep shouting,

752
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,663
so the whole world can hear.

753
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,584
I wish the whole world

754
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:43,623
know he was humiliated.

755
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,303
Okay?

756
00:34:44,303 --> 00:34:45,143
I wish I were

757
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:46,024
a celebrity.

758
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:46,465
You know.

759
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:47,783
I'd call all the reporters

760
00:34:47,783 --> 00:34:49,024
and put it on the front page

761
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:50,024
as a trending topic.

762
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:52,024
Qian Hao is a cuckold.

763
00:34:52,183 --> 00:34:54,183
I wish your dream come true.

764
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:55,223
I will benefit from it.

765
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:56,223
Come on.

766
00:34:56,783 --> 00:34:57,545
I shouldn't have

767
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:58,864
blamed Hu Xiaojiao.

768
00:34:58,864 --> 00:34:59,704
Turns out

769
00:34:59,704 --> 00:35:02,024
she's a spy
infiltrating the enemy's ranks.

770
00:35:02,024 --> 00:35:03,143
She struck a fatal blow

771
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,223
at the critical moment.

772
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:06,024
Well done.

773
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:07,663
Let's play.

774
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:08,663
Don't follow me.

775
00:35:11,864 --> 00:35:13,424
Dami.

776
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:15,223
Go away.

777
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,783
Mom, help!

778
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,703
Mom, help!

779
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:23,743
What happened?

780
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:24,464
What happened?

781
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:26,344
Xiaomi, what's wrong?

782
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,344
What happened?

783
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:28,784
Xiaomi.

784
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:30,024
Dami pushed me.

785
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,904
I don't want her anymore.

786
00:35:32,024 --> 00:35:33,183
Why did you push him?

787
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:34,183
It's so dangerous.

788
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:34,944
That's great.

789
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:35,464
If he's gone,

790
00:35:35,464 --> 00:35:36,024
no one will

791
00:35:36,024 --> 00:35:37,024
compete for your love.

792
00:35:37,024 --> 00:35:37,784
Qian Dami.

793
00:35:37,784 --> 00:35:38,984
Stop talking nonsense.

794
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:40,464
How are you as selfish as your dad?

795
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:41,743
Why would you

796
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:42,624
want him "gone"?

797
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:44,464
I hate Dad. I hate you.

798
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:45,425
I hate Xiaomi.

799
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:46,824
None of you like me.

800
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:47,864
None of you want me.

801
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:49,464
I don't want you, either.

802
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:50,505
I'll go.

803
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:52,143
Dami.

804
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:52,825
Are you okay?

805
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:55,583
My head hurts. I hit my head.

806
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:56,743
Let me take a look.

807
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:57,864
Are you alright?

808
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:31,223
(Honey, kisses.)

809
00:36:31,464 --> 00:36:32,464
(Love you.)

810
00:36:32,783 --> 00:36:34,663
(Honey, I miss you.)

811
00:36:35,824 --> 00:36:37,103
(Honey, are you)

812
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:38,384
(coming back for dinner?)

813
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:41,303
(Honey, don't drink too much.)

814
00:36:41,504 --> 00:36:43,064
(I made you some hangover soup.)

815
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:46,344
(Honey, what time
will you finish work today?)

816
00:36:46,344 --> 00:36:47,783
(I'll have dinner with you.)

817
00:36:49,384 --> 00:36:51,544
(Honey, I went shopping today)

818
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:52,864
(and bought you some clothes.)

819
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,864
(Come back early.)

820
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,504
(Honey, I love you.)

821
00:36:57,103 --> 00:37:00,223
(Honey, what are you having for lunch?
Their food is not bad.)

822
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:01,344
(Let's go there one day.)

823
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,344
(Okay?)

824
00:37:03,303 --> 00:37:05,703
(Honey, are you working overtime again?)

825
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:11,904
(Getting off work soon?)

826
00:37:11,904 --> 00:37:13,464
(Nice day for a Blue Mountain.)

Buddy.

841
00:38:15,024 --> 00:38:17,183
You were absolutely right.

842
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:18,104
Patience

843
00:38:18,104 --> 00:38:19,904
is crucial in our line of work.

844
00:38:20,703 --> 00:38:21,703
This fool

845
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:23,783
hasn't replied to me for a long time.

846
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:24,624
But I kept sending

847
00:38:24,624 --> 00:38:26,024
mass WeChat messages to her.

848
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:28,864
And she just told me

849
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,464
that she was getting divorced.

850
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:33,263
There is hope again.

851
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,464
Divorce is good.

852
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:36,424
Women getting divorced

853
00:38:36,424 --> 00:38:38,384
are fragile, sensitive,

854
00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:39,824
and not very sharp.

855
00:38:40,344 --> 00:38:42,223
Perfect.

856
00:38:58,024 --> 00:38:58,464
Dad.

857
00:38:58,464 --> 00:38:59,263
You're back.

858
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:00,104
Mom, Dad.

859
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,424
You came back together?

860
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,408
- What a coincidence.
- I got off work early

861
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,263
and ran into Chengyi

862
00:39:05,263 --> 00:39:06,303
while picking up the kids.

863
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:07,623
So we came back together.

864
00:39:07,623 --> 00:39:09,583
We're having an early dinner today.

865
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:11,464
Let's talk over dinner.

866
00:39:11,464 --> 00:39:12,623
Come on.

867
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:13,263
You're back.

868
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:14,104
Wash your hands.

869
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,303
Rest for a while.

870
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:16,583
Dinner is almost ready.

871
00:39:16,944 --> 00:39:17,505
Good girls.

872
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:18,623
Yeah, wash your hands.

873
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:19,783
Come on. Hurry.

874
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:20,783
Sit down.

875
00:39:21,103 --> 00:39:21,865
So many dishes.

876
00:39:21,865 --> 00:39:23,583
I thought my daughter

877
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,183
would never come back.

878
00:39:25,984 --> 00:39:27,183
I missed you so much.

879
00:39:34,424 --> 00:39:36,120
(Mei Chengyi)
(I suggest you take a shower)

880
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,920
(and get changed.)

881
00:39:37,016 --> 00:39:38,303
(I meant to tell you last time)

882
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,303
(that you smelled like incense)

883
00:39:40,303 --> 00:39:41,384
(and burnt paper.)

884
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:45,183
Honey.

885
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:46,865
What are you cooking

886
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:47,904
on the stove?

887
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,224
Why do I smell

888
00:39:49,224 --> 00:39:50,623
smoke and fire?

889
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:53,024
I don't smell anything.

890
00:39:55,303 --> 00:39:55,864
Yeah.

891
00:39:55,864 --> 00:39:56,663
Well, Dad,

892
00:39:56,743 --> 00:39:58,024
I went to see You Xin today

893
00:39:58,024 --> 00:39:59,263
and burnt an incense.

894
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:01,864
Okay.

895
00:40:02,504 --> 00:40:03,264
I'm all sweaty.

896
00:40:03,264 --> 00:40:04,424
I'll take the shower first.

897
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:05,864
Dinner is almost ready.

898
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:06,425
I'll be quick.

899
00:40:06,425 --> 00:40:07,583
Take a shower later.

900
00:40:07,743 --> 00:40:08,623
Dami didn't mean it.

901
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:09,623
You know?

902
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,824
(Mei Chengyi)
(I'm home.)

903
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:14,904
(Is everything okay?)

904
00:40:15,384 --> 00:40:16,263
(Not at all.)

905
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:17,344
(It's terrible.)

906
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,248
(Xu Kaixin recalled a message.)

907
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:25,384
Dad, I'm going to the bathroom.

908
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:26,384
Okay, go ahead.

909
00:40:35,103 --> 00:40:36,103
Who is it?

910
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:37,783
Mei Chengyi?

911
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:41,904
Xiaomi, come here.

912
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,984
Come on.

913
00:40:43,384 --> 00:40:44,623
Sit down. Be good.

914
00:40:45,464 --> 00:40:46,464
It's okay.

915
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:48,464
Alright, stop crying.

916
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:50,263
Stop crying, baby.

917
00:40:51,143 --> 00:40:52,143
Hello.

918
00:40:53,143 --> 00:40:54,864
You've never sounded so down.

919
00:40:55,223 --> 00:40:56,504
You're having a hard time.

920
00:40:57,024 --> 00:40:57,824
What message

921
00:40:57,824 --> 00:40:58,824
did you take back?

922
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:00,104
I'd hate

923
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:01,623
to dump my bad mood on you.

924
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:03,024
So I took it back.

925
00:41:03,984 --> 00:41:05,984
If you don't even tell me your problems,

926
00:41:07,143 --> 00:41:08,144
what's the point

927
00:41:08,144 --> 00:41:09,263
of being family partners?

928
00:41:12,024 --> 00:41:13,504
My ex-husband is going crazy.

929
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:14,623
His mom is dying

930
00:41:14,623 --> 00:41:15,624
and wants to

931
00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:16,984
pass on the "throne".

932
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:18,143
So he's asking

933
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,464
for Xiaomi's custody.

934
00:41:20,904 --> 00:41:21,703
Where are you?

935
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:22,703
I'll come over.

936
00:41:24,263 --> 00:41:25,263
I...

937
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:27,223
I'm close to the hospital.

938
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:28,623
Don't come over.

939
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:29,784
I don't want you

940
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:30,824
to fight.

941
00:41:31,024 --> 00:41:32,743
Leave this to me.

942
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:33,424
I will tell you

943
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,424
once I sort it out.

944
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:36,623
Okay, then.

945
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:38,025
Call me

946
00:41:38,025 --> 00:41:39,183
whenever you need me.

947
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,464
Alright.

948
00:41:40,544 --> 00:41:41,864
Talk later. Bye.

949
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:04,384
Hello, Ms. Li.

950
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:05,424
Mei Chengyi.

951
00:42:05,424 --> 00:42:06,824
What are you up to?

952
00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:09,143
No one could reach you the whole day.

953
00:42:09,143 --> 00:42:10,544
Show some respect

954
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:11,663
for your job and superior.

955
00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:13,303
Ms. Li, I'm really sorry.

956
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:14,303
I left my phone

957
00:42:14,303 --> 00:42:15,065
at home.

958
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,424
I just came home.

959
00:42:16,783 --> 00:42:17,583
Chengyi.

960
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:19,344
It's a critical period.

961
00:42:19,344 --> 00:42:20,504
Everyone is busy.

962
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:21,783
And you left your phone...

963
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,623
L-Listen.

964
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:24,984
Come to my office

965
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:25,984
tomorrow morning.

966
00:42:26,103 --> 00:42:26,905
Alright.

967
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:28,904
See you tomorrow, Ms. Li.

968
00:42:29,344 --> 00:42:30,344
And...

969
00:42:30,544 --> 00:42:31,544
Hello.

970
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:37,864
What...

971
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:41,624
It's okay.

972
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:42,824
Three, two, one.

973
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:47,183
You told him?

974
00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:48,384
What did he say?

975
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:50,143
He wanted to come over.

976
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:51,263
But I told him not to.

977
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:52,783
He should have come over.

978
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,303
Why did he ask for permission?

979
00:42:54,944 --> 00:42:56,783
He has two kids at home.

980
00:42:56,984 --> 00:42:58,583
Besides, he is busy with work.

981
00:42:58,783 --> 00:42:59,704
It only bothers you

982
00:42:59,704 --> 00:43:01,263
if you think that way.

983
00:43:01,504 --> 00:43:02,144
When did you

984
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:03,344
become so understanding

985
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:04,464
like a love coach?
