I'm here to pick you up.

18
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:01,471
Let's go.

Come on, get off.

20
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:07,351
Dami, get off.

21
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:09,471
I have a lot of homework.

22
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:10,631
I'll head back home.

23
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:12,791
Next time,

24
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:13,671
try to finish

25
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:14,671
your homework early.

26
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:17,592
Okay.

27
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:18,911
Go ahead.

28
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:19,593
Xiaomi,

29
00:02:19,593 --> 00:02:20,791
call me if you need me.

30
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,631
Okay, Mom.

31
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:23,631
Give me a second.

32
00:02:25,432 --> 00:02:26,592
Wait for me a little bit.

33
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:30,432
I know

34
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:31,072
you're not

35
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:32,191
marrying Mei Chengyi.

36
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,832
So I want to ask you one last time.

37
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:36,312
Can we give our kids

38
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:37,232
a loving home

39
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:38,671
with both parents together?

40
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:40,791
In the future...

41
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,511
Qian Hao,

42
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,191
if you keep

43
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:44,791
going crazy like this,

44
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,351
I won't bring Xiaomi over so often.

45
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,552
Xiaomi.

46
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,791
Be a good boy, okay?

47
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,872
Okay, Mom.

48
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:02,592
You blew your chance.

49
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:07,951
You said you didn't want to go.

50
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:09,631
Why are you upset now?

51
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:10,713
Anyway,

52
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:12,152
Dad won't care.

53
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:13,511
You're upset because

54
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,313
you're not

55
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:15,751
receiving fair treatment.

56
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:16,911
You feel hurt.

57
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:17,951
Remember.

58
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:18,912
Always cut your losses

59
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,112
in time.

60
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:20,873
Short-term pain

61
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:22,231
beats long-term suffering.

62
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:23,792
Everybody suffers

63
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:24,911
at some point in life.

64
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,312
But I hope you suffer

65
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:28,112
as little as possible.

66
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:29,112
You know?

67
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,032
Xiaomi is a traitor.

68
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:34,951
See?

69
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:36,511
You're being unfair.

70
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:37,072
No one will

71
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:38,471
always stand by your side.

72
00:03:38,832 --> 00:03:39,911
Not even you?

73
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:41,592
I make mistakes too.

74
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,231
I may do wrong even if I want to

75
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:44,392
stand by your side.

76
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:46,832
Want an ice cream?

77
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:47,832
Yeah.

78
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:48,992
Let's go.

79
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:49,992
Okay.

80
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,111
Come on.

81
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:27,671
Just a photo.

82
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,152
Spread your arms at your side.

83
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:33,911
Fingertips on the ground.

84
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:35,032
(Ms. Li)

85
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:39,551
Stretch upwards.

86
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,072
Very good.

87
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:44,791
Terrific.

88
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,791
Hello, Ms. Li.

89
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,152
Dami, here.

90
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:48,671
Ice cream.

91
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:50,032
Strawberry flavored.

92
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:51,512
Your favorite.

93
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:15,912
Let's talk

94
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:17,272
right here.

95
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:20,432
Your store

96
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:21,911
looks quite nice.

97
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:23,632
You didn't come to

98
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:24,752
praise my store, did you?

99
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:30,232
Qian Hao and I

100
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:32,072
are getting divorced

101
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:34,231
after the cooling-off period.

102
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:37,512
Are you giving him back to me?

103
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:40,952
Now I understand

104
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:43,111
that you see things
more clearly than I do.

105
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:44,193
And you're

106
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:45,431
living a happy life.

107
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:47,832
I find it funny

108
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:50,712
that I went through so much

109
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:52,351
to win over an unworthy man

110
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:54,712
and ended up deeply hurt.

111
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:56,311
I guess it's karma.

112
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,952
I asked you out

113
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:02,911
to apologize to you

114
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:03,911
in person.

115
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:06,431
Once I get the divorce paper,

116
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,032
I might go abroad

117
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:09,152
and not come back again.

118
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:10,952
Your apology is sincere.

119
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:12,632
But I won't accept it.

120
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:15,193
It is too late

121
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:16,952
to mend your ways.

122
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,471
It would be unfair

123
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:20,592
to Lili and the kids

124
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:21,592
if I just decided

125
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:22,592
to forgive you.

126
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:24,592
Meanwhile, it doesn't

127
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,633
cost me anything

128
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:26,791
to hold grudges.

129
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:27,712
After all,

130
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:29,471
this is my life and my choice.

131
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:32,871
I understand.

132
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:38,032
This is for you.

133
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:41,592
To be honest,

134
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:42,592
I still don't

135
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:43,593
want to be an enemy

136
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:44,712
of Qian Hao.

137
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:46,431
In love,

138
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:47,911
I made my own choice.

139
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:49,592
So I don't hate him.

140
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:51,112
But we both did

141
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:52,231
some foolish things.

142
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:53,952
Maybe

143
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:56,471
you will need this.

144
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,272
Let's say I'm atoning

145
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:00,111
for both myself and Qian Hao.

146
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,111
(Be good.)

147
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:21,632
(Be patient. Don't make a fuss.)

148
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:22,753
(I'm so done)

149
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:24,111
(with Xu Kaixin.)

150
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:25,351
(I'm doing this to get)

151
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:26,112
(the apartment)

152
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,311
(after the divorce.)

153
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:28,911
(But I don't care about)

154
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:30,592
(your apartment or money.)

155
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,512
(I just want you to get divorced.)

156
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,471
(I know your family is rich enough)

157
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:35,512
(to sustain you.)

158
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:36,952
(But I'm a guy.)

159
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:37,992
(I need an apartment)

160
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,032
(to marry you.)

161
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:41,512
(She is easy to trick.
Be patient, okay?)

162
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:42,431
(Besides,)

163
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:43,273
(this is also)

164
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:44,671
(my hard-earned money.)

165
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,231
(But Kaixin will raise the kids alone.)

166
00:07:47,512 --> 00:07:49,111
(If you feel sorry for her,)

167
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:50,512
(then let's stop here.)

168
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,351
(I can go back to her.)

169
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:53,351
(No.)

170
00:07:57,871 --> 00:07:58,871
Excuse me.

171
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:00,752
Excuse me.

172
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:03,871
Kaixin.

173
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:04,991
Excuse me.

174
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,911
Coming.

175
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:09,432
Can I help you?

176
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:11,111
Hello, please get me a cake.

177
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:12,471
Alright, just a second.

178
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,471
Okay.

179
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,311
Chengyi.

180
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,991
I know I've let you down

181
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,551
on many things.

182
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:30,671
But after all, I've been your mentor.

183
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:33,671
Give me a way out.

184
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:37,392
This is

185
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:39,431
a bit of compensation to you.

186
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,152
Rest assured.

187
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,472
It won't cause you trouble.

188
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:48,832
What are you doing?

189
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:50,152
I will look down on you.

190
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,872
You did it for some petty money?

191
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:54,591
Is it too little?

192
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,831
Mei Chengyi.

193
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,951
They say, "Teach your apprentice
and you'll starve."

194
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,071
I never believed it.

195
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:01,952
But you're really

196
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,272
pushing me to a dead end, huh?

197
00:09:03,632 --> 00:09:04,992
I tried to stop them from

198
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:05,551
firing you.

199
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:06,312
I really tried.

200
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,711
I've said all I can.

201
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:09,152
But I couldn't stop them.

202
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:10,911
I swear I've said all I can.

203
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,911
Right?

204
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:13,513
I had no choice

205
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:15,032
but to side with them.

206
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:16,392
But they betrayed me

207
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:17,633
and pointed

208
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,152
the finger at me to shift the blame.

209
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,951
Chengyi, listen to me.

210
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:22,033
You are

211
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,632
in the prime of your life, right?

212
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:24,872
You have lots of clients.

213
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:25,872
You can go anywhere.

214
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:26,873
But I can't.

215
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:28,112
My son is studying abroad.

216
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:29,431
Life there is costly.

217
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:30,912
Why would you

218
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,071
make me a delivery person?

219
00:09:33,671 --> 00:09:35,191
I-I never intended that.

220
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,232
Of course, you did.

221
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:37,232
They'll fire me

222
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:38,191
if you stay.

223
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:38,951
Right?

224
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:40,473
The middle-aged executives will be

225
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:42,032
starting to deliver food.

226
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:43,671
Can you bear to see that?

227
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:45,311
Come on.

228
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:45,832
Master.

229
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:46,872
Calm down.

230
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,392
Don't get me wrong

231
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:49,711
or plot against me.

232
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:50,473
Okay?

233
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:51,671
I also have kids

234
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:52,911
to support.

235
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:54,311
Life is hard for me too.

236
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:56,392
Even if I volunteer to leave,

237
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:57,153
what then?

238
00:09:57,153 --> 00:09:58,352
What about next time?

239
00:09:58,352 --> 00:10:00,272
They'll fire you sooner or later.

240
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:01,233
I'm only trying

241
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,272
to get by.

242
00:10:02,472 --> 00:10:03,392
Don't you know

243
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:04,392
what they're like?

244
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,513
You brought me

245
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:06,791
to this company.

246
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,312
You know

247
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:09,191
this company better than I do.

248
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:12,311
I came here

249
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,831
to discuss something with you.

250
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:16,512
I've been looking for a new job.

251
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:17,992
There's a company

252
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:19,992
with good corporate culture,

253
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:21,911
environment, and potential.

254
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:23,512
It's not all messy

255
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:24,512
like this company.

256
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,272
We can be partners

257
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:27,192
and take the team

258
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,831
to the new company.

259
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,512
We'll go to a new place.

260
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:32,352
New company, new market.

261
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:35,272
You'll still be my mentor.
Isn't that nice?

262
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:36,872
We'll root ourselves in the market

263
00:10:36,872 --> 00:10:37,872
and seek development.

264
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:39,831
As long as you let go of your status,

265
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:40,752
we'll work together.

266
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:41,752
What do you think?

267
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:44,791
What do I think?

268
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:45,872
Yeah.

269
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:46,473
Of course,

270
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:47,711
your salary will drop a bit.

271
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,711
But at least the market

272
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:51,232
has great potential.

273
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:52,392
We must take

274
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:53,312
a long-term view.

275
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:54,352
You taught me that.

276
00:10:58,232 --> 00:10:59,311
Mei Chengyi.

277
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:00,951
You're such

278
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,992
a backseat driver.

279
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,752
Do you know how much I make?

280
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:05,153
You're asking me

281
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,431
to take a long-term view?

282
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:07,872
This is ridiculous.

283
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:10,791
Okay, there's no rush.

284
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:12,272
Think it over.

285
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:16,431
Alright, I should pick up the kids.

286
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:17,551
Feel free

287
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,551
to call me anytime.

288
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:26,311
Okay, keep it.

289
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:28,911
And I usually

290
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:30,632
drive in person.

291
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,591
I-I...

292
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:07,872
Let me help you.

293
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:12,512
The kids went to your in-laws?

294
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:14,952
Youyou is back, too.

295
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:16,232
She's taking care of them.

296
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:17,232
So I slipped out

297
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:18,232
to pick you up.

298
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:19,352
Where's Lili?

299
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:20,671
She's home with Dami.

300
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:23,071
Here.

301
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:25,472
I made you food.

302
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:31,152
Thank you.

303
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:39,551
What's wrong?

304
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:41,472
Don't ask.

305
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,872
Let me rest for a while.

306
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:38,071
It's about time.

307
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,711
Xiaomi should leave.

308
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,711
Kaixin is here.

309
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:43,552
It's so late.

310
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:45,632
Just let him sleep here.

311
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,112
Xu Kaixin won't let him.

312
00:13:50,512 --> 00:13:52,032
Don't be in such a rush.

313
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:54,951
Once things are settled,

314
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:56,951
he will stay with you forever.

315
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:17,152
Mom.

316
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:19,191
I gave Xu Kaixin

317
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,352
one last chance today.

318
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:22,232
She didn't agree to remarry.

319
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:23,353
So we have to

320
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:24,392
take Xiaomi away.

321
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:26,711
As soon as we get the visa,

322
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:27,951
we'll leave.

323
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:30,671
Alright.

324
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:00,472
What's with you today?

325
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:07,591
I received a huge gift

326
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,951
which can help me

327
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:10,832
take back

328
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:12,512
my apartment.

329
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:14,033
But it made me

330
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:15,831
feel extremely frustrated.

331
00:15:16,112 --> 00:15:17,112
I don't even know

332
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:18,633
who's been wronged.

333
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,831
The kids or me?

334
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:23,752
It's just that those years of marriage

335
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,191
make me feel disgusted.

336
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,551
Actually, I don't want to

337
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:34,951
meddle with him anymore.

338
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:36,512
I bet Qian Hao

339
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,472
is facing a tough fight.

340
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,272
But I'm reluctant

341
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:43,431
to give up the apartment and let him

342
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,032
get away with it.

343
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,071
Well...

344
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:49,951
Everyone faces

345
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,992
tough choices at some point.

346
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:54,831
But here's what I think.

347
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:55,952
Don't force yourself

348
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:57,112
to decide so soon.

349
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:00,272
Just move forward and think about it.

350
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,192
Maybe time will

351
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,431
give you the answer.

352
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:04,032
I understand that.

353
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:05,472
People

354
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:07,352
who see through everything

355
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,032
tend to get stuck.

356
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:12,872
Sometimes,

357
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:15,632
I really envy Qian Hao.

358
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:18,431
Why?

359
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:19,752
Because he's a good son.

360
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:21,752
I'm sure his mother

361
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:23,551
loves him very much.

362
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:29,352
You know

363
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:31,671
how messy and complicated

364
00:16:32,311 --> 00:16:33,311
my family is.

365
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:34,753
I don't know

366
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:36,152
if my mom truly loves me

367
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:37,191
or not.

368
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:38,671
When I was about to

369
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,032
take the college entrance exam,

370
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:43,551
she saved up to send

371
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:44,312
my half-brother

372
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:45,472
to an elite school

373
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,591
by secretly changing

374
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,431
my college application from a top-tier

375
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,393
university

376
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:50,711
to a teachers' college.

377
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,951
Then she never cared about me.

378
00:16:54,632 --> 00:16:55,632
After I graduated,

379
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:57,272
well...

380
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:58,591
She asked me

381
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:00,071
for money every month.

382
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,351
It's getting more frequent

383
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,472
these past few months.

384
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:07,672
She says she misses me.

385
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:09,872
I thought

386
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:10,992
she was short of money.

387
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:13,992
But last week,

388
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:14,872
my brother

389
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:15,912
called me and said

390
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:17,032
that she was sick.

391
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:18,591
She fell sick.

392
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,791
He asked me to take care of her.

393
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:22,791
I just hung up

394
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,791
without saying a word.

395
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:25,632
I told myself

396
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:26,672
when I left home

397
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,272
that all I could offer her

398
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:29,591
was money to her account.

399
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,072
Do you think

400
00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:33,232
I'm a bad son?

401
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:39,432
No one can forgive
on behalf of someone else.

402
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:41,151
Because they haven't

403
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:42,432
been through it.

404
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:44,871
But whatever you decide to do,

405
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,391
I will support you.

406
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:51,712
Thank you.

407
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:23,672
Come on, that's enough.

408
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:25,192
It's a divorce,

409
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:26,432
not a wedding.

410
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:27,273
Come on, Dad.

411
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,831
Why don't you stay quiet?

412
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:31,472
Don't talk to your dad like that.

413
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:40,192
Look at you.

414
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:42,631
You've been bickering all your life

415
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:44,591
but you're still married.

416
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:47,952
But I'm divorced twice.

417
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:53,672
I'm off.

418
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,591
You came alone?

419
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:21,832
I called you.

420
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:23,351
You blacklisted me.

421
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,752
Will she change her mind

422
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:42,272
at the last minute?

423
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:43,392
Should we

424
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,591
check on her?

425
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:45,672
No need.

426
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:47,712
If she hasn't decided,

427
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:49,952
we can't force her to get divorced.

428
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:52,631
If she has decided,

429
00:19:52,912 --> 00:19:53,952
then Qian Hao

430
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:55,831
can't possibly

431
00:19:55,952 --> 00:19:57,111
win her back.

432
00:19:57,752 --> 00:19:58,831
Don't worry.

433
00:19:58,831 --> 00:19:59,952
My sister is right.

434
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:02,912
Sister.

435
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:04,432
When are you going back?

436
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,351
I'm going to buy Mom a gift.

437
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,032
Are you so eager

438
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:10,391
to drive me away?

439
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,591
No.

440
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:14,712
It's nice for us to be together.

441
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:15,513
It's lively.

442
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:16,791
Absolutely.

443
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:17,591
Really?

444
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,071
Yeah.

445
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:18,832
Since you are

446
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:20,111
so hospitable,

447
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:20,871
fine.

448
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:22,952
I'll stay

449
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,151
for another month or so.

450
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:27,912
For real?

451
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:28,912
I...

452
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,432
That's enough.

453
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,151
I've booked the ticket to leave

454
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:35,311
in three days.

455
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:36,311
Really?

456
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:40,032
For real.

457
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:42,712
Mom told me

458
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:44,472
to give this to you

459
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:46,272
before I leave.

460
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:48,311
Sister.

461
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:48,953
Take it.

462
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:50,752
What is this?

463
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,032
The family heirloom

464
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:54,032
left by Grandma?

465
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:56,111
What...

466
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:56,872
Yeah.

467
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:57,912
Mom said

468
00:20:58,192 --> 00:20:59,232
that you've been

469
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:01,391
married for so many years.

470
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,272
Despite what I did,

471
00:21:03,272 --> 00:21:05,432
I couldn't break you two up.

472
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,472
In that case,

473
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:07,792
Mom and I

474
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,071
will join you.

475
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:10,071
Got it?

476
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:12,472
Xia Chungeng, I'm telling you.

477
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,151
Be nice to Mom.

478
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,151
Take your wife to see her abroad

479
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:16,992
when you're free.

480
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:17,791
Got it?

481
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:18,712
Got it?

482
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:19,912
Darling.

483
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:22,032
My mom finally accepted you.

484
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:23,071
Honey.

485
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:24,192
Darling.

486
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:25,472
Enough.

487
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:26,752
What are you doing here?

488
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,071
Why do you care? Let us be.

489
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:30,391
- Exactly.
- I'm right here. Behave.

490
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:32,952
This is so pretty.

491
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:34,752
Our family heirloom.

492
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:36,432
Let's wait for Xiaojiao.

493
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:37,551
Be quiet.

494
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:48,912
Xiaojiao.

495
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,351
I have one more thing to say.

496
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:57,472
You can say it here.

497
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:00,753
I solved

498
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:01,831
that problem for you.

499
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:04,472
I paid 300,000 yuan.

500
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:06,592
No one can

501
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,912
blackmail you

502
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:10,791
with videos or photos

503
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,672
anymore.

504
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:12,672
Wait, you...

505
00:22:12,952 --> 00:22:13,952
Wait.

506
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:15,591
You paid 300,000?

507
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:17,512
I don't get it.

508
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:19,192
Photos and videos?

509
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:35,112
I'm not trying

510
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:36,512
to earn your appreciation.

511
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:38,152
I just want to tell you

512
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:39,272
that I didn't lie to you.

513
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:42,192
I really love you.

514
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:45,831
Let bygones be bygones.

515
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:48,952
You must live happier than me.

516
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:50,032
Wait.

517
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:51,591
Qian Hao, are you stupid?

518
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:52,871
This isn't me.

519
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:55,151
It's a scam.

520
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:01,111
Come on...

521
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:01,913
You are as smart

522
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,032
as a sly fox.

523
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:04,032
But you

524
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:05,791
got scammed because of me?

525
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:08,791
Isn't this you?

526
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:10,272
It's obviously fabricated.

527
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,272
Can't you see?

528
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:14,672
You've been scammed.

529
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:17,591
This is fake?

530
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:19,672
That wasn't me.

531
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,272
Call the police.

532
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:43,791
Keep going.

533
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:44,752
Are we not there yet?

534
00:23:44,752 --> 00:23:45,551
Keep going.

535
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:46,033
Keep going.

536
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,192
How much further?

537
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,952
Don't worry. Trust me.

538
00:23:48,952 --> 00:23:49,832
Keep going.

539
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:51,151
Where are we? Are we there?

540
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:52,072
Keep going.

541
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:53,432
Turn right.

542
00:23:53,752 --> 00:23:54,513
Okay, we're here.

543
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:55,752
Do you feel it?

544
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:56,512
What is this?

545
00:23:56,512 --> 00:23:57,233
A chair.

546
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,472
Sit down.

547
00:23:58,472 --> 00:24:00,432
One, two, three.

548
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:03,631
What do you think?

549
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:04,432
Pork cracklings.

550
00:24:04,432 --> 00:24:05,072
Yeah.

551
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:06,551
You said you liked those.

552
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:08,032
I succeeded after several attempts.

553
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:08,913
Come on, try it.

554
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,871
You made this? You're amazing.

555
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:12,551
Who else could have made it?

556
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:18,912
It's amazing.

557
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:20,272
Right? It's authentic?

558
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:21,551
Totally.

559
00:24:21,672 --> 00:24:22,672
Come on.

560
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,791
Cheers.

561
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:28,195
♪Long-lasting companionship♪

562
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:31,512
This wine tastes good too.

563
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:33,151
I chose it for you.

564
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:35,272
By the way, my clients

565
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:37,111
gave me a few invitations

566
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:38,151
to the baseball club.

567
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:38,993
It's this Friday.

568
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:40,791
We can have food and play there.

569
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:42,071
Take Lili and the kids

570
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:43,071
with you.

571
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:44,752
This Friday?

572
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:46,752
Xiaomi has to visit his grandma.

573
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:49,232
Then Dami can go.

574
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:51,272
Sure.

575
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,992
What if the kids

576
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:54,992
start fighting?

577
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:56,512
We have to take the first step.

578
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:57,512
Don't we?

579
00:24:58,032 --> 00:24:59,311
Okay, let's do it.

580
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:05,111
Let me have another one.

581
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:08,551
Turns out Qian Hao

582
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:09,713
is honestly

583
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:11,351
in love with Xiaojiao.

584
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:14,311
But don't forget

585
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:15,952
how he ruthlessly

586
00:25:15,952 --> 00:25:17,272
kicked his ex-wife and kids

587
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:18,912
out of their apartment.

588
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:21,111
I just don't believe it.

589
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:24,151
He's as clever as a fox.

590
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:25,513
How did he fall for

591
00:25:25,513 --> 00:25:26,672
such a cheap trick?

592
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:30,672
Could it be a bitter ruse

593
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:32,391
to win Xiaojiao back?

594
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,192
Nonsense. They're divorced.

595
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:38,033
Don't worry.

596
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:39,591
I won't get back with him.

597
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:41,791
Late affection is the cheapest.

598
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,232
That much I know.

599
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:47,351
She's really grown up.

600
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:50,591
But Uncle,

601
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:52,033
after all,

602
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:53,512
Qian Hao got scammed because of me.

603
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:56,391
If he ever gets into trouble,

604
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:57,992
either help him out or at least

605
00:25:58,311 --> 00:25:59,311
don't kick him

606
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:00,831
when he's down, alright?

607
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:03,672
Fine.

608
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:06,232
My husband is so magnanimous.

609
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:07,391
Wonderful.

610
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:08,272
Enough.

611
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:09,232
Stop worrying.

612
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:10,232
Have some.

613
00:26:11,952 --> 00:26:12,871
You too.

614
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,673
No, thanks.

615
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:14,712
Have some.

616
00:26:14,712 --> 00:26:15,791
I've given this to you.

617
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:16,791
Take a bite.

618
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:57,391
Why hasn't

619
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,791
Qian Hao come back yet?

620
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,631
Maybe Xu Kaixin wouldn't let him

621
00:27:02,631 --> 00:27:03,831
bring Xiaomi over.

622
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:06,272
It's better like that.

623
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,831
Then you won't snatch

624
00:27:08,831 --> 00:27:09,753
such a young kid

625
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,791
away from his mother.

626
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:13,591
What are you saying?

627
00:27:13,871 --> 00:27:14,912
He's my grandson.

628
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:16,672
He's supposed to stay with us.

629
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:01,752
Come on, Xiaomi.

630
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,273
Qian Hao, be careful.

631
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:10,672
Daddy will hold you. Okay.

632
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:12,712
Dami.

633
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:22,631
Come on.

634
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:34,631
Say bye to Mommy.

635
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:36,151
Bye, Mom.

636
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:37,831
Xiaomi, be good.

637
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:42,071
I'll take care of him.

638
00:28:43,871 --> 00:28:44,871
Let's go.

639
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:07,512
They're here.

640
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,311
Grandma, Grandpa.

641
00:29:09,992 --> 00:29:10,992
Xiaomi.

642
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,192
Grandma missed you so much.

643
00:29:14,272 --> 00:29:15,151
Oh, my!

644
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:15,992
This is great.

645
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:16,792
We can

646
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:18,272
be together forever.

647
00:29:18,272 --> 00:29:19,272
What do you mean?

648
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:23,712
I've booked a car.

649
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:25,391
It'll arrive in half an hour

650
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:26,432
and we'll leave.

651
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:48,311
Sweetheart.

652
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,591
There's nothing left to miss.

653
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:51,952
Let's leave here

654
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:53,071
and start anew.

655
00:29:54,111 --> 00:29:55,111
You have

656
00:29:55,551 --> 00:29:57,232
a lot of things to do abroad.

657
00:29:57,472 --> 00:29:58,992
You can inherit our family business.

658
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:00,192
And there are

659
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,791
so many handsome guys.

660
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:03,871
Trust me. I will introduce you to many.

661
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:05,391
You'll be so happy.

662
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:06,631
It's time to start

663
00:30:06,631 --> 00:30:08,032
a perfect relationship.

664
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:09,032
Mom.

665
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:10,752
Give me some space, please.

666
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:12,472
Alright.

667
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:23,551
Hello.

668
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:25,551
Honey.

669
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:26,233
Yeah.

670
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,351
(Jiang City to New York)
I'll see you

671
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:28,631
in about 12 hours.

672
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:30,151
I miss you so much.

673
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:31,712
(Jiang City to Riot)
I'm bringing my daughter

674
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:32,312
(Passenger: Qian Hao, Qin Sulan,)
this time.

675
00:30:32,312 --> 00:30:33,391
(Qian Baoping, Qian Xiaomi)
I want you

676
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:34,871
to meet each other.

677
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:36,551
You know?

678
00:30:36,871 --> 00:30:37,872
Okay.

679
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:38,992
I miss you.

680
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:40,871
I miss you.

681
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:42,272
I love you.

682
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Mom, keep it down.

683
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:44,512
I have to talk.

684
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:45,512
Okay.

685
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,192
This place is so lively.

686
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:59,320
(Hu Xiaojiao)

687
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:01,591
See you later.

688
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:02,992
See you soon.

689
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:08,992
Dami, stop playing. We're here.

690
00:31:09,111 --> 00:31:10,111
One minute, please.

691
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:11,111
Qian Dami.

692
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,831
Hello, are you Ms. Xu?

693
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:16,352
Yeah.

694
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:17,591
I'm a staff member here.

695
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:18,111
Mr. Mei

696
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:18,871
has registered you.

697
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:19,871
Please come with me.

698
00:31:19,952 --> 00:31:20,791
Okay.

699
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:21,791
Let's go.

700
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:40,831
I recognize it.

701
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:41,912
You made these cakes.

702
00:31:41,912 --> 00:31:42,631
Impressive, huh?

703
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:43,631
Yeah.

704
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:45,871
You're here. Hi, Lili.

705
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:46,992
Hello.

706
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:49,952
Uncle, I want to play, too.

707
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:52,351
That? Just a second.

708
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:53,551
Mr. Luo.

709
00:31:55,192 --> 00:31:56,071
Excuse me.

710
00:31:56,071 --> 00:31:56,952
Can you teach her?

711
00:31:56,952 --> 00:31:57,233
Okay.

712
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:58,432
Thank you.

713
00:31:58,432 --> 00:32:00,032
Dami, let's go.

714
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:02,831
So insightful.

715
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:04,151
I just knew you wouldn't

716
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:05,391
bring a cap.

717
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:06,512
You're amazing.

718
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:10,272
Thank you.

719
00:32:10,272 --> 00:32:11,311
How is it?

720
00:32:11,311 --> 00:32:12,311
Cool, huh?

721
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:22,672
Yeah, well done!

722
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:25,831
Well done.

723
00:32:26,272 --> 00:32:28,712
Dad, where are we going?

724
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,272
A fun place.

725
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,952
Is it far?

726
00:32:35,272 --> 00:32:36,272
No.

727
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,952
Then why did we bring

728
00:32:39,952 --> 00:32:41,192
so many things?

729
00:32:41,351 --> 00:32:42,912
Why do you have so many questions?

730
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:51,192
Who are you calling?

731
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:52,311
Give it to me.

732
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:53,311
Give it to me.

733
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:54,551
Give it to me.

734
00:32:54,752 --> 00:32:55,472
Give it to me.

735
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:56,311
Qian Hao, come on.

736
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,432
No.

737
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:00,391
Hao.

738
00:33:00,391 --> 00:33:01,273
I told you

739
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:02,391
it wouldn't work.

740
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:03,071
Stop talking.

741
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:03,791
Alright, stop...

742
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:04,591
Come here.

743
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:05,311
Sit properly.

744
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:06,311
Come sit with Grandma.

745
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:07,312
Let me hug you.

746
00:33:07,312 --> 00:33:08,472
Let him be.

747
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:09,673
Xiaomi, come here.

748
00:33:09,673 --> 00:33:11,151
Stop it. Sit tight.

749
00:33:11,512 --> 00:33:12,591
Sit tight.

750
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,591
Stop it. Sit tight.

751
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:16,591
Stop it. Sit tight.

752
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:17,391
Sit properly.

753
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:18,512
Sit tight.

754
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:24,151
Okay, next one.

755
00:33:24,151 --> 00:33:25,311
One, two, three.

756
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:26,831
Go.

757
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:28,311
Come on, next one.

758
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:30,631
Hello, what's up?

759
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:32,232
Kaixin.

760
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:33,871
Is Xiaomi with you?

761
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:34,632
No.

762
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:35,992
He's with Qian Hao.

763
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:37,151
I sent you a picture.

764
00:33:37,151 --> 00:33:38,192
Take a look.

765
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:39,351
Qian Hao and I share

766
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,512
a ticket-booking account.

767
00:33:40,512 --> 00:33:41,433
He bought tickets

768
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:42,831
to go abroad today.

769
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,032
Xiaomi has a ticket, too.

770
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:49,591
What's wrong?

771
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,272
Qian Hao is taking Xiaomi abroad.

772
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:53,831
W-What should we do?

773
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:54,752
Calm down.

774
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:55,673
Lili, please

775
00:33:55,673 --> 00:33:56,752
look after the kids.

776
00:33:56,752 --> 00:33:57,712
Talk to my colleague

777
00:33:57,712 --> 00:33:58,713
if you need anything.

778
00:33:58,713 --> 00:33:59,752
We'll look for Xiaomi.

779
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:00,473
Mom, Lili.

780
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:01,631
Take me to the airport.

781
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:02,648
Stay here.

782
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:03,871
- I want to go.
- I want to go.

783
00:34:03,871 --> 00:34:05,712
I won't argue with them anymore.

784
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:06,712
We'll be friends.

785
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:07,071
Okay.

786
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:07,992
You two stay here

787
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:08,833
and wait for me.

788
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,231
Listen to Lili, okay?

789
00:34:10,472 --> 00:34:11,472
Come on.

790
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:26,432
What are you doing?

791
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:27,993
No matter what,

792
00:34:27,993 --> 00:34:29,191
you can't hurt yourself.

793
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:38,872
(Jiang City Airlines)

794
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:40,952
Hello.

795
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,313
Could you please check

796
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,432
if a kid named Qian Xiaomi

797
00:34:43,432 --> 00:34:44,432
has boarded the plane?

798
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:45,792
His mom is looking for him.

799
00:34:46,392 --> 00:34:47,192
Okay, sir.

800
00:34:47,192 --> 00:34:48,591
We will broadcast it now.

801
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:54,472
It's okay.

802
00:34:55,591 --> 00:34:57,271
There's still time.

803
00:35:00,952 --> 00:35:02,872
Stop it, Xiaomi.

804
00:35:03,191 --> 00:35:04,352
Sit tight.

805
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:04,993
Sit tight.

806
00:35:04,993 --> 00:35:06,071
Sit tight, Xiaomi.

807
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:07,631
Sit. Don't make a fuss.

808
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:09,393
Xiaomi.

809
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:10,952
Xiaomi, stop it.

810
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:12,792
Your dad can't take it.

811
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:13,792
Sit tight.

812
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:14,912
Enough.

813
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:15,472
Okay, stop.

814
00:35:15,472 --> 00:35:16,432
Don't move.

815
00:35:16,432 --> 00:35:17,231
Don't move.

816
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:18,072
Don't move.

817
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:20,591
Hao, I want to go to the bathroom.

818
00:35:20,872 --> 00:35:22,032
You're so much trouble.

819
00:35:22,032 --> 00:35:23,111
Okay, take her there.

820
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:24,392
Alright, we'll be right back.

821
00:35:24,392 --> 00:35:25,191
I'll wait for you.

822
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:27,071
- Go ahead.
- Be patient. He's still a kid.

823
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:27,832
Be good.

824
00:35:27,912 --> 00:35:28,513
I'll be back.

825
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:29,792
Alright, stop it.

826
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:31,191
Stop it.

827
00:35:34,472 --> 00:35:35,191
Hello.

828
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:35,872
Hello.

829
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:36,512
I'm the one

830
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:37,473
who called for help.

831
00:35:37,473 --> 00:35:38,912
A child named Qian Xiaomi

832
00:35:38,912 --> 00:35:39,352
is missing.

833
00:35:39,352 --> 00:35:40,271
Can you find him?

834
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,271
Okay.

835
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:45,071
Urgent. Missing child.

836
00:35:45,231 --> 00:35:46,472
Qian Xiaomi.

837
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:48,071
Qian Xiaomi.

838
00:35:48,071 --> 00:35:48,872
Please go to

839
00:35:48,872 --> 00:35:49,712
the nearest

840
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:50,992
staff member for help.

841
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:52,711
Your mom is looking for you.

842
00:35:53,992 --> 00:35:54,712
Dad.

843
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:55,912
Stop it.

844
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:56,912
Stop it.

845
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:00,353
Be quiet.

846
00:36:00,353 --> 00:36:01,392
What's wrong, kiddo?

847
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,591
What's your name?

848
00:36:02,832 --> 00:36:04,671
Uncle, my name is Qian Xiaomi.

849
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:06,792
I want my mom.

850
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:07,832
I want my mom.

851
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,551
Sorry about that.

852
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:09,393
Don't get me wrong.

853
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:10,512
Here is my passport.

854
00:36:10,512 --> 00:36:11,111
Sorry.

855
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:11,993
He's my son.

856
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:13,071
I'm his father.

857
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:14,192
But the child's mother

858
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:15,472
is looking for him.

859
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:16,392
He's my son.

860
00:36:16,392 --> 00:36:17,392
I had a fight

861
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,952
with his mom.

862
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:19,913
Sorry.

863
00:36:19,913 --> 00:36:20,992
Sorry for the trouble.

864
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:22,231
Do you have any evidence?

865
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:23,711
Look at the photo.

866
00:36:24,071 --> 00:36:25,551
What else do you need?

867
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:26,432
He's my son.

868
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:26,712
Look.

869
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:28,432
Qian Xiaomi. Qian Hao. Same surname.

870
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:29,192
He's my son.

871
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:30,912
Maybe we misunderstood it.

872
00:36:30,912 --> 00:36:33,231
Uncle, he is not my father.

873
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:34,711
He is a human trafficker.

874
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:35,952
Stop talking nonsense.

875
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:36,631
Let go of him.

876
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:37,432
No.

877
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:38,432
He is talking nonsense.

878
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:39,271
Talking nonsense.

879
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:39,872
Stop it.

880
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:40,271
Stop it.

881
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:41,072
Give me my child.

882
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:42,992
Give me my child.

883
00:36:43,128 --> 00:36:43,992
What are you doing?

884
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:44,711
What's going on?

885
00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:45,992
What are you doing?

886
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:47,312
That's my son.

887
00:36:47,312 --> 00:36:48,151
What are you doing?

888
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:49,832
What are you doing? He's my son.

889
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,912
Mom.

890
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:51,751
It's okay.

891
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:52,591
It's okay.

892
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:53,393
Stay calm.

893
00:36:53,393 --> 00:36:54,512
Let go.

894
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:55,872
Mom, it's okay.

895
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:56,872
It's okay, Mom.

896
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:58,432
Xiaomi.

897
00:36:58,432 --> 00:36:59,432
Mom.

898
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:00,551
Xiaomi.

899
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,151
Xiaomi.

900
00:37:01,151 --> 00:37:01,952
Let's wait for

901
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:02,751
the police, okay?

902
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:03,353
Let go.

903
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:04,631
Dad, calm down. It's fine.

904
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:17,512
Xiaomi, come here.

905
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,111
Xiaomi.

906
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,952
Xiaomi, come here.

907
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:33,191
Xiaomi.

908
00:37:33,832 --> 00:37:34,832
Xiaomi.

909
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:35,552
Please come

910
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:36,832
with me to the security room.

911
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:37,832
Okay.

912
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:40,071
Xiaomi.

913
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:25,353
Based on

914
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:26,912
reports from vigilant citizens,

915
00:38:26,912 --> 00:38:28,432
we solved several romance scam cases

916
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:30,432
involving telecommunications fraud.

917
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:32,551
Police officers adopted
synthesized analysis

918
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:34,591
and neighborhood task forces,

919
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:35,393
combining

920
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:36,952
traditional and modern approaches

921
00:38:37,071 --> 00:38:38,512
to apprehend all suspects

922
00:38:38,512 --> 00:38:39,433
in this case

923
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:41,071
and recovered over 4 million yuan

924
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,472
in victim losses.

925
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:45,111
The case has now been transferred
to the procuratorate.

926
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,631
We had such a pleasant talk.

927
00:38:48,512 --> 00:38:49,231
We'll wait

928
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:50,232
to sign the contract.

929
00:38:50,232 --> 00:38:51,591
Alright, thank you, Mr. Liu.

930
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:52,712
My pleasure.

931
00:38:52,712 --> 00:38:53,751
My pleasure. Bye.

932
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:54,071
Bye.

933
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:55,071
Bye.

934
00:38:55,312 --> 00:38:56,432
We made a great team

935
00:38:56,432 --> 00:38:57,591
today.

936
00:38:57,751 --> 00:38:59,271
I'll draft the contract right away.

937
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:00,631
I have something to do

938
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:01,952
and can't work overtime.

939
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:03,832
Go ahead. I got this.

940
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,231
How come you seem younger?

941
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:08,952
It suddenly felt like we were back

942
00:39:08,952 --> 00:39:10,632
in those days
when you were mentoring me.

943
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:12,111
Full of energy.

944
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:12,912
Energy.

945
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:14,271
Energy.

946
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:16,551
Enough.

947
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:17,472
Keep it up.

948
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:18,472
Keep it up.

949
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:26,792
You're closing early today.

950
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:28,512
Yeah, we're expecting some guests

951
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,512
for a celebration.

952
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:30,512
By the way.

953
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,912
Kaixin made this for you.

954
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:34,992
You don't have to.

955
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:36,071
I hope you enjoy it.

956
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:36,551
Thanks.

957
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:37,071
No problem.

958
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:38,071
See you.

959
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,392
Who is Xu Kaixin?

960
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:49,472
It's me.

961
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:51,151
Your delivery.

962
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:51,952
Okay.

963
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:52,671
This one.

964
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:53,111
Thank you.

965
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:54,111
The pickup code.

966
00:39:56,551 --> 00:39:57,231
Alright.

967
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:58,231
Thank you.

968
00:40:09,752 --> 00:40:11,711
(Reply from Jiang City People's Court)

969
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:12,712
The court finally ruled

970
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:14,032
to return my apartment to me.

971
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:15,352
That's great.

972
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:17,392
Bet Qian Hao never expected that

973
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:19,231
he could run to the ends of the earth,

974
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:20,271
but he'd still have to

975
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,711
give back what wasn't his.

976
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:37,792
(The life of
a blended family continues.)

977
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:39,711
(There are difficulties and troubles.)

978
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:41,352
(But the truth of life)

979
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:42,631
(lies in seeking happiness)

980
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:43,832
(amidst troubles.)

981
00:40:46,191 --> 00:40:47,191
The second word.

982
00:40:50,191 --> 00:40:53,591
How do you call this?

983
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:55,751
Favorite food.

984
00:40:56,591 --> 00:40:58,472
"Grab".

985
00:40:58,472 --> 00:41:00,271
- Six.
- Four.

986
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:03,512
Yeah.

987
00:41:03,512 --> 00:41:04,071
Four.

988
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:04,711
Two.

989
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:05,711
Three.

990
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:11,191
Do it again.

991
00:41:15,312 --> 00:41:16,512
Peel the banana

992
00:41:16,512 --> 00:41:17,432
and then eat it.

993
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:18,111
I'll do it.

994
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:19,111
Banana.

995
00:41:20,151 --> 00:41:21,033
You...

996
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:22,551
I haven't even started yet.

997
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:23,033
Grapes.

998
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:24,551
Grapes.

999
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:26,191
That's right.

1000
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:29,432
Awesome.

1001
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,352
Durian.

1002
00:41:33,512 --> 00:41:34,512
That's right.

1003
00:41:38,111 --> 00:41:39,111
Peacock.

1004
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:42,631
Gourd.

1005
00:41:42,631 --> 00:41:43,111
No.

1006
00:41:43,111 --> 00:41:44,671
A gourd is a fruit?

1007
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:48,832
Why do I feel...

1008
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:49,472
Dumpling.

1009
00:41:49,472 --> 00:41:50,472
That's right.

1010
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:51,671
Bingo.

1011
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:53,671
Five words.

1012
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,568
- Hope for gains without pains.
- Hope for gains without pains.

1013
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:01,671
Wish us good health.

1014
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:02,671
Wish us happiness

1015
00:42:02,671 --> 00:42:03,632
and success.

1016
00:42:03,632 --> 00:42:05,352
Come on, dig in.

1017
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:06,712
- Want some beef?
- Okay.

1018
00:42:06,712 --> 00:42:07,792
What would you like?

1019
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:10,271
Auntie, can you reach this?

1020
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:11,271
Yeah.

1021
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:12,152
I can reach it.

1022
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:13,231
Don't worry about me.

1023
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,512
Okay.

1024
00:42:16,472 --> 00:42:18,231
Isn't that broccoli?

1025
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:19,671
We call it differently.

1026
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:20,312
Broccoli.

1027
00:42:20,312 --> 00:42:21,312
Thank you, sweetie.

1028
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:22,793
Thank you

1029
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:24,111
for making all the dishes.

1030
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,312
Stay healthy.

1031
00:42:25,472 --> 00:42:27,191
Take a picture together.

1032
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:32,191
Join them.

1033
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:33,671
Come on, together.

1034
00:42:33,912 --> 00:42:35,231
Dami, hold them.

1035
00:42:35,231 --> 00:42:36,231
Come on.

1036
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:38,751
Three, two, one.

1037
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:40,312
Is the watermelon sweet?

1038
00:42:40,312 --> 00:42:41,312
Yeah.

1039
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:46,071
(Eventually, Mei Chengyi)

1040
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:49,032
(Marriage certificate)
(and I passed each other's tests.)

1041
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:50,191
(We got married)

1042
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:51,751
(and became a real family.)

1043
00:42:52,591 --> 00:42:53,711
(As for Qian Hao,)

1044
00:42:53,832 --> 00:42:54,872
(all the money he had)

1045
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,271
(didn't help save his mother.)

1046
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:57,033
(He no longer)

1047
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,792
(appeared in our lives.)

1048
00:42:59,312 --> 00:43:00,792
(There will be challenges in life.)

1049
00:43:00,952 --> 00:43:02,231
(But Xu Kaixin)

1050
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:03,912
(and everyone who enjoys life)

1051
00:43:04,111 --> 00:43:06,912
(will bravely bloom against the storm.)
