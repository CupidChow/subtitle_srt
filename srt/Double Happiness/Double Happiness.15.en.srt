Wait for me here.

I'll handle it.

19
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:45,067
Okay.

20
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:48,466
I'm really sorry.

It's okay.

22
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:50,546
I apologize on her behalf.

No need. I know her better than you do.

24
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:53,986
She's getting the hang of it.

25
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:54,988
Well, how about

26
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:56,227
I take a photo first?

27
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:57,307
Go ahead.

28
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,136
He's so cool.

29
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:19,986
See, Xu Kaixin?

30
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:20,866
A man

31
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:21,827
is all about

32
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,147
his sense of responsibility.

33
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:23,867
Right?

34
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:25,747
He's calm and responsible.

35
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:26,827
How great it is.

36
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,146
If you can't win him over, let me try.

37
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:31,106
You wouldn't dare.

38
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:32,346
I'll break your leg.

39
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,666
Watch if I dare.

40
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:39,186
Listen,

41
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:40,666
be a bit perceptive in a bit.

42
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:41,747
Go do what you should do.

43
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:43,786
Do what? I have nothing to do in a bit.

44
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:45,347
Wait, Xu Kaixin.

45
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:46,747
You want me to go in this heat?

46
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:47,827
You're way too into him.

47
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:48,507
I won't go.

48
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:49,587
Shut up.

49
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,586
Okay, I've finished.

50
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,986
The insurer will take over.

51
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,008
- Right.
- Okay.

52
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,307
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

53
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:58,546
Okay, I've finished.

54
00:02:58,626 --> 00:02:59,787
You two sit in the back.

55
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:00,867
I'll drive.

56
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:01,906
Okay.

57
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:03,106
Hello, Mr. Mei.

58
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:04,307
I'm Li Xiaoxiao.

59
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,826
We've met before.

60
00:03:05,906 --> 00:03:06,707
I remember you.

61
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,066
She has things to do. She'll go.

62
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:09,587
Hail a cab.

63
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,028
Such a hurry?

64
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,067
She has things to do.

65
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:15,748
That's right.

66
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:16,787
I'll go first, Mr. Mei.

67
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:18,066
- Alright.
- Drive slowly.

68
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:19,147
See you next time.

69
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:20,307
Bye-bye.

70
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:40,786
I'm glad you are fine.

71
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,027
Hello?

72
00:03:57,786 --> 00:03:58,827
Then I'll be leaving now.

73
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:00,747
Don't forget what you promised me.

74
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:02,307
I'll pick up the kids as we agreed.

75
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:03,266
Don't forget what

76
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:04,346
you promised me either.

77
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:14,712
Disgusting.

78
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,106
Did you deliberately annoy him just now?

79
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,426
By fastening my seatbelt?

80
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,528
I'm not a child.

81
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,587
In my eyes, you are a child.

82
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:47,667
But honestly, I need to thank you.

83
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:48,906
Thank you for coming over.

84
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,104
That's it?

85
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:55,866
That's more like it.

86
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,387
That's what Xu Kaixin does.

87
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,187
Actually, I should thank you.

88
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:04,426
What do you mean?

89
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:07,226
My work didn't go smoothly today.

90
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:08,466
At that time, I thought

91
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:09,786
if you were beside me,

92
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:10,906
I'd be better.

93
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:12,027
As expected,

94
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:13,666
seeing you has made me so happy.

95
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:15,226
So you have a great name.

96
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:17,146
Kaixin means being happy.

97
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:18,786
And it's contagious.

98
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:22,067
So are you going back to the company?

99
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,306
I'm not going back.

100
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,267
Picking up the kids?

101
00:05:26,187 --> 00:05:27,146
No need for that today.

102
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,666
I hired a nanny to pick them up.

103
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:30,067
She also cooks dinner.

104
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:30,906
But I have

105
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:31,986
to go back before 7 PM.

106
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:34,428
Does that mean

107
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:35,906
we still have three hours?

108
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,467
How about we

109
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,786
find a place to have some fun?

110
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:42,947
I...

111
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:44,947
My back isn't healed yet.

112
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:45,587
How come you

113
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,067
can't get over that?

114
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:48,507
I was not talking about that.

115
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:50,147
Okay.

116
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:51,426
Alright.

117
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:55,627
Relax.

118
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:56,707
It's a bit cold.

119
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:02,587
Come on, relax.

120
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:10,666
Okay, relax.

121
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:16,426
Don't be nervous.

122
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:21,747
Everything is normal.

123
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:22,827
It's done.

124
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:26,866
Okay, next.

125
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:28,868
What are you doing?

126
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:31,067
So comfortable
that you don't want to get up?

127
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:33,426
Doctor, I'd like to ask you something.

128
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:34,707
If I

129
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:36,386
don't want this child,

130
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:37,627
will he feel pain?

131
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:40,147
He won't feel pain.

132
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,987
But you might never be able to

133
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,666
have another child in your life.

134
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:45,866
I see that your age

135
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,666
is not that young.

136
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:50,747
Once you pass the prime period

137
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,426
and your AMH level drops,

138
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:54,226
your ovaries will prematurely age.

139
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:55,386
Maybe you'll stop ovulating.

140
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:56,627
You need to know this.

141
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,426
So if you're not voluntarily childfree,

142
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:01,108
I suggest

143
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,587
you don't act on a whim.

144
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:03,947
There is no regret medicine

145
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:04,747
in life after all.

146
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:05,827
Right?

147
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:11,187
Thank you.

150
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:17,592
Are you sure we're at the right place?

151
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:18,146
Sure.

152
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:18,747
Almost there.

153
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:19,466
It's over there.

154
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:20,146
Where?

155
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:21,226
Right there.

156
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:32,426
What's that look on your face?

157
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,666
Do you find it childish?

158
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:36,786
No.

159
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:37,786
It could be childish

160
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:38,866
for elementary students.

161
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:41,306
But for me, it's just right.

162
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:43,027
Let's hurry and go.

163
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:44,786

What are you doing?

166
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:00,306
Didn't you say you had something to do?

167
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:01,587
You came too.

168
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:02,947
So why didn't you see me off?

169
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,466
Don't ask such a stupid question again.

170
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:16,760
I will ask you one last time.

171
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:18,627
The very last time.

172
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:23,067
I'll have an abortion

173
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:24,867
and forget hearing

174
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:26,147
what you said earlier.

175
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:27,867
We each made a mistake.

176
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:29,466
Let's call it even.

177
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:31,507
Let's forget all those things.

181
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:47,347
I already told you.

182
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:50,387
Don't ask such a stupid question again.

(A Second Chance)
Ms. Li.

184
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:19,388
Good morning.

185
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:20,627
A big order has come in.

186
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:21,626
Really?

187
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:22,826
- Yes.
- Where is he?

188
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:23,826
Buying coffee.

189
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:24,506
Entertain he.

190
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:25,586
Okay.

191
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:32,946
Oh my.

192
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:34,227
We should charge him more.

00:09:35,426 --> 00:09:37,187
Ms. Li, this is my cousin.

194
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:38,347
He's brought me some stuff.

195
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:39,586
Sorry.

196
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,546
Go ahead.

197
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,666
Cousin.

198
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,066
You're here.

199
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:44,346
Pretty good.

200
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:45,426
Not bad, huh?

201
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:46,467
Thank you.

202
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:47,786
Mom asked me to give you this.

203
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:49,147
Come home often.

204
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:50,227
Got it.

205
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:51,706
I'll see you off.

206
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:52,786
Take care.

207
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:56,147
Mr. Song, you're back just in time.

208
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,306
Come on in.

209
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,186
Let me introduce you.

210
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:03,267
This is A Second Chance's

211
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:04,347
beautiful owner.

212
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:15,987
Are you crazy, Song Ran?

213
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,426
Ms. Li, he's a customer.

214
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:20,987
He's my classmate. Ignore him.

215
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:23,787
B-But he paid

216
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,467
20,000 yuan as a Diamond membership fee.

217
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:27,107
It's 20,000 yuan.

218
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:29,147
Return it to him.

219
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:30,267
What?

220
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:33,666
Li Xiaoxiao, you have improved a lot.

221
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:35,226
When you were with me before,

222
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:35,986
you were stingy.

223
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:36,706
Now 20,000 yuan

224
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:37,786
doesn't even impress you.

225
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:40,547
Why exactly are you here,

226
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:41,627
Song Ran?

227
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,586
What could I be here for?

228
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:45,066
I'm looking for a wife.

229
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:46,627
Are you blind?

230
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:48,147
A Second Chance is only

231
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:49,746
for men and women who want to remarry.

232
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:50,826
Okay?

233
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:51,907
Ms. Li.

234
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:52,987
What?

235
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:55,347
Look.

236
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:00,952
(Divorced)

237
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:16,867
Are you scared?

238
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,826
Are you afraid of heights?

239
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:20,267
I...

240
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,427
I-I'm not.

241
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:22,667
I-I'm not afraid of heights.

242
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,546
There's nothing embarrassing to admit.

243
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:25,948
As a human,

244
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:27,387
you have something to fear.

245
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,627
What are you afraid of?

246
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:29,906
Having no money.

247
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:31,586
Off you go.

248
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,666
Xu Kaixin!

249
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:33,946
Are you crazy?

250
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,826
Mei Chengyi, you're so cool.

251
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:49,786
The spread has increased again.

252
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:52,027
And the speed of spread is very fast.

253
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,786
To be honest,

254
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:00,067
given this situation,
even if you go abroad,

255
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:01,987
they'll only give you painkillers.

256
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:04,786
Everything else is excessive treatment.

257
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:06,028
Radiotherapy

258
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:07,987
and chemotherapy are both meaningless.

259
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,947
Extending life by one

260
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:12,147
or two months
only extends the patient's suffering.

261
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,107
Doctor, I can't

262
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:16,626
accept what you say.

263
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:17,866
My mom's body looks

264
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,027
not that bad at all.

265
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:19,788
At home,

266
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:20,826
she can clean and cook.

267
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,907
She's never complained

268
00:12:21,987 --> 00:12:22,987
about pain.

269
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,387
Don't you often

270
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,347
say medical miracles?

271
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,946
I think my mom is one.

272
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:28,187
A-And I went through

273
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:29,148
so many connections

274
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,226
to get the appointment
with a specialist like you.

275
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:32,706
If you say what everyone else says,

276
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,587
why would I come?

277
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,147
You have to find me a solution.

278
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:36,786
A specialist is not a deity.

279
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,347
If you want to find that kind

280
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:40,506
of con who deceives you
to spend more money

281
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:42,467
and makes your mom suffer more,

282
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:43,626
let me tell you,

283
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:44,867
you've chosen the wrong one.

284
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,946
I've seen it a lot in the clinic.

285
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:54,186
The one who endures the most
is always the mother.

286
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,946
It's not that she isn't in pain,

287
00:12:56,227 --> 00:12:57,347
but she can endure.

288
00:12:57,946 --> 00:12:59,426
She can endure too much.

289
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,427
The pain of late-stage cancer

290
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:04,066
is unimaginable to you.

291
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:05,826
She's sleepless all night,

292
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:06,906
you know?

293
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:08,226
If you don't believe me,

294
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:09,907
go to the ward entrance at midnight

295
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:11,066
and listen.

296
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:13,106
Those who scream and shout

297
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:14,347
are numerous.

298
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,467
Some who can't endure
even jump out of buildings.

299
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:18,226
The windows above the second floor

300
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:19,627
in the hospital are all sealed.

301
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,826
(If you are truly filial,)

302
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,106
(buy her some)

303
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,507
(good painkillers.)

304
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:32,107
(Of course,
she should still take the meds.)

305
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:35,387
(Take her to eat what she likes,)

306
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,426
(visit places she wishes to go,)

307
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:40,507
(and fulfill her unfulfilled wishes.)

308
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:42,787
(That's my best advice)

309
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,387
(as a doctor.)

310
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:16,186
Hello, Mom.

311
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:17,987
Son, come save me.

312
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,267
I'm about to be beaten to death
by your dad.

313
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:28,186
Is skipping work okay for you?

314
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:29,387
No.

315
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:30,747
I'll lose my job.

316
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:32,426
Then I...

317
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:33,666
It's fine.

318
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:36,186
I'll lose my job
whether I skip work or not.

319
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:38,346
I overheard

320
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:39,227
my boss

321
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:40,627
planned to lay off our group.

322
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:44,827
Why did I

323
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,107
tell you the truth?

324
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:47,907
What if you decide to dump me

325
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,346
for minding me being unemployed?

326
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:50,467
Being unemployed is okay,

327
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:51,626
as long as you don't

328
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:52,506
ask me for money.

329
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:53,428
As a woman, could you

330
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:54,746
speak a bit more gently?

331
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,426
Haven't you heard an ancient saying?

332
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,388
Spending money

333
00:14:57,468 --> 00:14:58,666
on men may lead to misfortune.

334
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:00,387
Which ancient person said that?

335
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:01,227
Still shaken

336
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:03,227
from being cheated
by your ex-husband today?

337
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:04,826
The ex-husband today?

338
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:05,908
Does that

339
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,586
mean I have an ex-husband every day?

340
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:09,307
Then my life is really happy,

341
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:10,627
having so many ex-husbands.

342
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:13,786
You can go back and count for yourself.

343
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:17,746
Actually, coming here with you,

344
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:18,826
I'm quite happy.

345
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:21,466
And the unemployment thing

346
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,227
doesn't seem so bad anymore.

347
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:24,188
Actually,

348
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:25,787
I think people have many troubles

349
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,267
because they have many desires.

350
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:28,466
In this world,

351
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:29,466
living simply

352
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:30,107
for a lifetime

353
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:31,867
is already not easy.

354
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:33,428
I heard before

355
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:34,786
an ancient saying

356
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,787
that was especially helpful to me

357
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:37,946
when I was feeling down.

358
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:39,346
Why did the ancient people

359
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:40,387
say so much to you?

360
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:41,666
You might not know this.

361
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:43,226
When a woman is in a bad mood,

362
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:44,987
besides eating and shopping,

363
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:46,427
she likes the inspiring words

364
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:47,786
written by ancient people.

365
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:49,346
Whether they're wise

366
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:50,227
or toxic words,

367
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:52,426
as long as they work,
they are good inspirations.

368
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:53,107
Now,

369
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,346
I will give you the wisdom

370
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:55,426
written by the ancients.

371
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:56,627
The ancients said

372
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:59,306
that unemployment signifies the unknown.

373
00:15:59,706 --> 00:16:01,387
And the best way to predict the future

374
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:03,586
is to create it.

375
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:05,826
I think the ancients experienced

376
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:07,387
unemployment too.

377
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:12,826
It's really comfortable here.

378
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:15,586
How do you know about this place?

379
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:16,788
I often

380
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:18,027
came here with friends.

381
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:18,908
On some weekends,

382
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:20,027
I do charity work here,

383
00:16:20,107 --> 00:16:21,786
like picking up trash on the beach.

384
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,427
Later, this place became

385
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:24,746
our secret.

386
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:26,626
When my kids occasionally feel down,

387
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:27,746
I bring them here.

388
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:29,107
Wait, wait.

389
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:31,666
You said you do

390
00:16:32,387 --> 00:16:34,027
charity work picking up trash?

391
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:36,107
Don't I look like it?

392
00:16:36,306 --> 00:16:37,906
Which ancient taught you that?

393
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:39,067
I'll definitely share

394
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:40,186
his WeChat with you later.

395
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,186
Okay.

396
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:18,840
(You Xin)

397
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:43,907
I've emptied your dorm room.

398
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:45,306
It's right next to the office.

399
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:51,626
Someone you know?

400
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:58,586
My sister.

401
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:03,146
My own sister.

402
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:25,546
Stop the fuss!

403
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:27,667
Can't you stay at home?

404
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:28,747
Why make a fuss here?

405
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:29,627
What's wrong

406
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:30,706
with me dancing?

407
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:31,786
Will someone die from it?

408
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:32,787
You old hag!

409
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:33,907
Listen to me. You're...

410
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:35,027
You hit my mom.

411
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:36,466
I'll kill you.

412
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:37,307
I didn't hit her.

413
00:18:37,387 --> 00:18:38,667
She hit herself.

414
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:40,466
I was dancing.

415
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:41,188
She came

416
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:42,667
and started fussing and hitting.

417
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:43,747
Look.

418
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:44,907
She pulled down

419
00:18:44,987 --> 00:18:45,987
my dance partner's wig.

420
00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:48,707
How am I

421
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:50,187
supposed to dance here anymore?

422
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,267
Look here.

423
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,507
Tooth marks.

424
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:56,786
But you can't hit her.

425
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:57,907
She is sick.

426
00:18:58,507 --> 00:18:59,188
Ask everyone

427
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:00,346
who hit whom.

428
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:01,546
It was this old lady

429
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:02,468
who hit herself.

430
00:19:02,468 --> 00:19:03,667
She hit herself. I saw it.

431
00:19:03,747 --> 00:19:04,787
Yes, as if she went crazy.

432
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:06,266
She slapped herself with her hands.

433
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:06,908
Yes.

434
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:08,506
The old man didn't hit her at all.

435
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:09,347
She hit herself.

436
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:10,616
- She hit herself.
- See?

437
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:12,088
- We all saw it.
- Too outrageous.

438
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:13,226
You old hag.

439
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:15,146
I'll send you to a mental hospital.

440
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:15,986
This son...

441
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,066
Say it again.

442
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:18,586
Try saying it again.

443
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:19,866
What kind of son is this?

444
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:33,208
Too outrageous.

445
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:33,944
Too outrageous.

446
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:35,947
This old lady's family

447
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:37,784
- is 'lively'.
- She is the troublemaker.

448
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:38,427
Yes.

449
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:39,576
Let's go.

450
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:00,120
Song Ran,

451
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:02,027
are you done?

452
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:05,827
You didn't contact me in two years.

453
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:07,107
Now you're acting crazy

454
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:08,587
because you remember me now

455
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,624
that you're divorced.

456
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:10,168
Right?

457
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:12,307
I cut ties with her,

458
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:13,466
or I wouldn't be here now.

459
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,546
Right?

460
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:17,786
Should I praise you then

461
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,707
for being affectionate and principled?

462
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,387
Well, the old Song Ran

463
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:23,667
was indeed a scoundrel.

464
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:25,147
But I've changed.

465
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:26,707
I promise you, okay?

466
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:29,106
Give me a chance.

467
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,266
Can we start over?

468
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:31,506
Okay, I'll give you a chance.

469
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:32,664
Explain again.

470
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,027
Is there some hidden reason?

471
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:35,428
No.

472
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:36,746
At that time,

473
00:20:36,826 --> 00:20:38,330
I was out of my mind,

474
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,428
thinking I found true love,

475
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:40,427
and married her.

476
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:41,866
I regretted it immediately.

477
00:20:43,707 --> 00:20:44,986
Your true love came and went

478
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,267
so fast.

479
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:49,347
Do you know why I blocked you

480
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:50,427
the last time?

481
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,106
Wasn't it because of Qian Hao?

482
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:55,306
I'm not that paranoid.

483
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:00,066
Then why did you block me?

484
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:01,026
As you blocked me,

485
00:21:01,106 --> 00:21:01,828
I was very angry.

486
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:03,107
I went to the bar and drank.

487
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:04,187
Then I met my ex-wife.

488
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:04,947
Song Ran,

489
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:06,267
tell me.

490
00:21:06,826 --> 00:21:08,386
What did you take me for before that?

491
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:14,507
Xiaoxiao,

492
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,506
we've known each other for so long.

493
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:17,107
I thought...

494
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:18,187
You thought?

495
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:20,696
You thought we were buddies
during the day

496
00:21:20,952 --> 00:21:22,027
and a couple at night.

497
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:24,948
That's why I never

498
00:21:25,028 --> 00:21:26,386
appeared on your Moments posts

499
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,348
or got to see

500
00:21:27,428 --> 00:21:29,027
your family, friends, or colleagues.

501
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,427
Even if we met them,

502
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:32,707
you'd only introduce me

503
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:35,346
as your college classmate.

504
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:44,586
Xiaoxiao.

505
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:46,146
Xiaoxiao.

506
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,546
Listen to me.

507
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:51,907
Can I apologize to you?

508
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:52,984
I was immature.

509
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:53,948
I didn't think clearly.

510
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:55,146
You didn't think clearly?

511
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:56,388
And then you

512
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:57,747
married someone else right away?

513
00:21:58,267 --> 00:21:59,626
Like I told you,

514
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:00,867
I just got the certificate.

515
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:02,147
I didn't tell anyone

516
00:22:02,227 --> 00:22:03,346
or have a wedding.

517
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,266
I didn't even tell my parents.

518
00:22:05,346 --> 00:22:07,106
They still think I am single now.

519
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:10,587
Isn't it the same

520
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:11,747
as I had a girlfriend?

521
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:14,786
Have you thought it through now?

522
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:17,428
Yes, I have.

523
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,106
For three years, I've been thinking

524
00:22:19,626 --> 00:22:21,147
about who I want to be buried with

525
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:22,227
if I get old

526
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:23,826
and die someday.

527
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:31,507
Xiaoxiao, it's you.

528
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,507
Don't be such a bully, Song Ran.

529
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:43,987
You know I'm not over you yet.

530
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:47,227
Now you want to find a partner,

531
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:49,306
so you came back to me.

532
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:51,306
It's too late.

533
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:54,106
Xiaoxiao. Xiao...

534
00:22:56,427 --> 00:22:57,587
You know my temper.

535
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,467
I'll stay single

536
00:22:58,547 --> 00:22:59,626
if I can't win you back.

537
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:11,507
Okay.

538
00:23:11,987 --> 00:23:13,267
It's good that they've eaten.

539
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:15,187
I...

540
00:23:15,386 --> 00:23:16,706
Okay, I'll be back soon.

541
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:17,866
- Dad!
- Dad!

542
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:19,667
- Come back soon.
- Come back soon.

543
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,226
Okay, you two behave.

544
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:21,987
Be obedient.

545
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,306
I will be back soon.

546
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:24,907
Alright, I need to go.

547
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:30,867
It's late.

548
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:31,868
Aren't you

549
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:33,187
calling your kids?

550
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:34,546
Lili knows.

551
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:36,147
Don't your kids cling to you?

552
00:23:36,227 --> 00:23:36,987
They do.

553
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:38,866
They cling more before bed.

554
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:40,067
But

555
00:23:40,147 --> 00:23:41,266
my kids

556
00:23:41,346 --> 00:23:42,148
know

557
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:43,866
that besides being their mom,

558
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:45,106
I'm also Xu Kaixin,

559
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:46,586
and I need my own life.

560
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,066
Let's go have a drink.

561
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:51,866
Let's go.

562
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:53,667
I'm not wearing shoes.

563
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:56,667
Come on, I'll carry you.

564
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:01,227
At such an age,

565
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,066
why are you acting like a kid?

566
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:06,306
I really hope

567
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:08,066
I can make up for their mother's love.

568
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:10,467
I pamper them too much.

569
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:13,866
It will take time to slowly change.

570
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:17,386
On the other hand,

571
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:18,867
middle-aged people dating

572
00:24:18,947 --> 00:24:20,266
is indeed more troublesome

573
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:21,346
than young people dating.

574
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:25,227
By the way,

575
00:24:25,586 --> 00:24:26,546
leave your car

576
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:27,667
with me first.

577
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,466
It has a scratch on the front.

578
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:30,227
It's not serious.

579
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:31,347
I've already spoken

580
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:32,427
with the insurance agent.

581
00:24:32,507 --> 00:24:33,507
We'll fix it ourselves.

582
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:34,787
We'll send them

583
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:36,106
the repair receipts together

584
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,266
with your ex-husband's.

585
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:38,987
On weekends, Yu'an and Yule

586
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:39,867
have a class.

587
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:40,787
There are two hours

588
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:41,907
in between when I am free.

589
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:44,066
I'll take the car to the 4S shop
at that time.

590
00:24:44,826 --> 00:24:45,947
Don't worry about anything.

591
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,106
I've arranged everything.

592
00:24:52,027 --> 00:24:53,467
Why are you looking at me like that?

593
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:56,667
I just feel that suddenly having someone

594
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:58,386
take charge of me so domineeringly

595
00:24:58,786 --> 00:24:59,866
feels really good.

596
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:02,066
Can you be a little more domineering?

597
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:03,146
Like this.

598
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:05,746
Xu Kaixin, who told you to sweep?

599
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:06,987
Put the broom down.

600
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:08,267
Xu Kaixin, the kitchen

601
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:09,546
isn't your place.

602
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:10,626
Get out.

603
00:25:10,786 --> 00:25:11,427
Xu Kaixin,

604
00:25:11,507 --> 00:25:12,107
did you eat

605
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:13,187
the fruit I got for you?

606
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:15,427
Isn't it very cool?

607
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,586
Did you forget to take your medicine?

608
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:21,066
Why are you so unromantic?

609
00:25:23,027 --> 00:25:24,066
Okay, it's getting late.

610
00:25:24,187 --> 00:25:24,987
Let's go home.

611
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,146

612
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:28,306

- Thank you.

Quick, have a taste.

646
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:18,507
Not bad.

647
00:27:20,187 --> 00:27:21,546
You two are sisters?

648
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:27,146
My sister is six years older than me.

649
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:30,588
But you looked

650
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:31,987
quite confused earlier.

651
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:34,106
Didn't you know your sister was here?

652
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,227
My parents used to be busy with business

653
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:45,546
and were rarely at home.

654
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:48,066
It was my sister

655
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:49,507
who handled everything about me.

656
00:27:49,707 --> 00:27:50,267
She was only

657
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:51,707
six years older than me,

658
00:27:51,866 --> 00:27:53,346
but she was like a little mom.

659
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:58,066
My sister...

660
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:03,227
My sister...

661
00:28:04,427 --> 00:28:05,866
My sister was like a little sun.

662
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:07,667
She was outstanding.

663
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,747
She was the kind of kid

664
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:13,586
everyone talked about.

665
00:28:15,546 --> 00:28:18,040
My parents were very proud of her.

666
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:19,586
I was not jealous at all.

667
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,226
I also felt very proud.

668
00:28:21,306 --> 00:28:22,306
Of course.

669
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:26,507
Later,

670
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:33,346
when I graduated from college,

671
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,346
she got sick.

672
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:41,907
From diagnosis to her passing,
it was three months.

673
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:48,667
When she died,

674
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:50,947
I didn't shed a single tear.

675
00:28:52,507 --> 00:28:53,880
On the day of her funeral,

676
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:56,346
I got on the plane

677
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:57,987
to study in the UK.

678
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:00,472
That's why I didn't know

679
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,546
where she is buried.

680
00:29:02,947 --> 00:29:03,707
Because of this,

681
00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:05,267
my parents think I'm heartless.

682
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,488
I don't know why.

683
00:29:10,488 --> 00:29:12,066
But I just couldn't cry.

684
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:15,096
I felt like it seemed

685
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,507
if I didn't accept this reality

686
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:19,586
and hid far away,

687
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:22,907
my sister would be alive

688
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:24,948
and be there

689
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:26,386
in the home I couldn't see

690
00:29:27,427 --> 00:29:28,507
with nothing changed.

691
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:34,187
But from that time on,

692
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:36,467
I suffered from insomnia all night.

693
00:29:38,106 --> 00:29:39,106
And I couldn't sleep.

694
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:41,507
Medication didn't help.

695
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:49,106
At first, I was puzzled

696
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:51,267
why I slept

697
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:53,208
so well here.

698
00:29:57,826 --> 00:29:59,267
Today I finally know.

699
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:02,108
It's because

700
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:03,507
my sister is buried here.

701
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:07,187
Actually, many times

702
00:30:08,146 --> 00:30:09,506
when sadness reaches its peak,

703
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:10,587
people can't

704
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,066
shed tears anymore.

705
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:15,106
I've been in this cemetery
for nearly 20 years

706
00:30:15,386 --> 00:30:17,066
and have seen many sad people.

707
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:19,667
But among them,

708
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:21,467
few wail and cry.

709
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:24,386
The true sadness

710
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:25,428
is silent

711
00:30:25,508 --> 00:30:27,147
sometimes.

712
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:28,667
But when you look at that person,

713
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:29,786
you can feel

714
00:30:29,866 --> 00:30:31,187
they seem burdened by sadness

715
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:32,747
to the point of suffocation.

716
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:39,707
Alright, turn grief into appetite.

717
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:41,187
Eat.

718
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:43,306
Your sister is here with you,

719
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:45,507
and she can talk with you.

720
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:46,826
It's quite nice.

721
00:30:51,027 --> 00:30:52,027
Cheers.

722
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:15,706
The chicken is good too.

723
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:18,987
Of course, I grilled it.

724
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:30,707
Uncle,

725
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:32,267
I was wrong.

726
00:31:32,546 --> 00:31:34,786
Please don't ignore me.

727
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:35,466
Besides you,

728
00:31:35,546 --> 00:31:36,388
I really don't know

729
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:38,267
who else can help me.

730
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:42,586
Those were just angry words.

731
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:44,667
You were raised by your aunt and me

732
00:31:44,747 --> 00:31:46,267
since you were young.

733
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:48,346
How could we truly ignore you?

734
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,786
What's wrong?

735
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,826
Did Qian Hao bully you again?

736
00:31:57,507 --> 00:31:58,986
Ever since he knew I was pregnant,

737
00:31:59,066 --> 00:31:59,868
he's been acting

738
00:31:59,948 --> 00:32:01,546
like he's gone crazy.

739
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:08,187
Xiaojiao,

740
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:10,907
as you know,

741
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,386
I don't think highly of Qian Hao,

742
00:32:14,187 --> 00:32:15,947
and I always have him
under my tight hold.

743
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:18,146
But

744
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:22,826
about your pregnancy,

745
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,467
any man would go crazy.

746
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:28,066
I-I know I was wrong.

747
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:29,907
There should be an end
to the punishment,

748
00:32:29,987 --> 00:32:30,987
right, Uncle?

749
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:33,427
I asked for a divorce, but he refused.

750
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:35,147
I suggested

751
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:37,187
I get an abortion,

752
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:38,148
and after that,

753
00:32:38,228 --> 00:32:39,907
we continue living well together

754
00:32:39,987 --> 00:32:41,306
as if nothing happened.

755
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:42,427
He refused that too.

756
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:43,148
He insists

757
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,266
on me giving birth

758
00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:45,506
to the child.

759
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:46,586
He...

760
00:32:47,187 --> 00:32:48,866
Is he out of his mind?

761
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:51,107
This baby isn't his.

762
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:52,467
Why would he want it?

763
00:32:52,747 --> 00:32:53,947
He just wants his mom

764
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:56,386
to have a grandson to care for
while she's alive.

765
00:32:57,546 --> 00:32:59,187
And then after his mom passes away,

766
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:00,907
he will dump me.

767
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:02,907
T-This is too outrageous.

768
00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:03,986
It's too much.

769
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:04,868
Does he think

770
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:06,187
you don't have a family?

771
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:08,386
This is preposterous.

772
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:12,027
Wait.

773
00:33:12,747 --> 00:33:14,346
Doesn't he have a son already?

774
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:16,108
Back then,

775
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:17,627
when he divorced Kaixin,

776
00:33:17,707 --> 00:33:19,386
that boy wasn't born yet,

777
00:33:19,546 --> 00:33:21,546
and he gave up custody.

778
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,667
Now his mother has cancer,

779
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:26,187
and she desires a grandson.

780
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:28,266
Qian Hao wanted to take the boy back,

781
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:29,586
but Xu Kaixin said no.

782
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,427
And he's infertile now.

783
00:33:31,507 --> 00:33:32,307
So now he acts

784
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,066
like he is possessed.

785
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:42,187
About this matter,

786
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:44,747
you need to think clearly.

787
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:51,427
What do you want to do?

788
00:33:53,306 --> 00:33:54,067
Their whole family

789
00:33:54,147 --> 00:33:55,826
is simply unreasonable.

790
00:33:58,346 --> 00:33:59,427
I want a divorce.

791
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,427
What about the child?

792
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:08,827
I don't know.

793
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:12,987
The doctor says it's difficult for me
to get pregnant.

794
00:34:13,226 --> 00:34:14,546
If I get an abortion now,

795
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:15,987
it...

796
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:17,466
It'll be very difficult

797
00:34:17,546 --> 00:34:18,706
for me to have another child.

798
00:34:30,427 --> 00:34:31,427
Xiaojiao,

799
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:34,787
be honest with me.

800
00:34:39,307 --> 00:34:40,746
Do you like kids?

801
00:34:45,427 --> 00:34:47,066
Will you love this child?

802
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:49,146
I won't.

803
00:34:49,507 --> 00:34:50,520
The child ruined my life.

804
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,947
How could I possibly love him?

805
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:05,027
Then get an abortion.

806
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:08,587
If you two

807
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:09,867
continue like this,

808
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:11,787
it will be a tragedy sooner or later.

809
00:35:12,546 --> 00:35:13,546
In the world,

810
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:15,827
there are too many tragic lives already.

811
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,347
We don't need to foolishly

812
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:19,787
create one ourselves.

813
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:24,266
You should

814
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:26,146
give up this child.

815
00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:49,027
Do you want to stay for a while?

816
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:51,907
Um,

817
00:35:51,987 --> 00:35:52,986
maybe another day.

818
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:54,466
My kids are at home with the nanny.

819
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:55,546
I don't feel assured.

820
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:58,027
I'll walk you to the door.

821
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:00,107
Didn't they go

822
00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:01,546
to your parents-in-law?

823
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:04,066
Their help to me is out of kindness.

824
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:05,347
I can't bother them too much.

825
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:06,467
I finish work late.

826
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:07,947
Sending my kids to them every day

827
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,666
would be outrageous.

828
00:36:10,027 --> 00:36:10,828
Besides, my kids

829
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:11,907
are very naughty.

830
00:36:11,987 --> 00:36:12,986
They play favorites.

831
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:14,227
They're well-behaved with me.

832
00:36:14,307 --> 00:36:15,666
With their grandparents,

833
00:36:15,746 --> 00:36:16,787
they're little devils.

834
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:18,226
Over time, it won't work.

835
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:21,186
If you suddenly stop sending them over,

836
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:22,387
will they get used to it?

837
00:36:23,706 --> 00:36:24,827
Want to hear the truth?

838
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,347
Only if you want to say it.

839
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:29,746
Just like you said.

840
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:31,907
Whether or not I send those two kids,

841
00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:33,066
there will be complaints.

842
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:34,467
So I simply

843
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:36,347
have stopped sending them.

844
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:37,788
They always think

845
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:39,986
we can't do without them.

846
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:41,106
And they also suspect

847
00:36:41,186 --> 00:36:42,947
I'm after their inheritance.

848
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:45,066
Isn't that ridiculous?

849
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:47,747
People wrestle with themselves,

850
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:49,307
let alone with family.

851
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:50,546
It's not surprising.

852
00:36:51,387 --> 00:36:52,387
Alright.

853
00:36:52,507 --> 00:36:53,308
So today,

854
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:54,787
we had our date ahead of schedule.

855
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:56,466
I won't go out tomorrow.

856
00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:57,586
I need to be busy at home

857
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,027
with the cake shop's business.

858
00:37:00,146 --> 00:37:00,868
Okay.

859
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:01,907
Then I'll send

860
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,226
the car over to you too.

861
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:04,947
I need to handle work matters

862
00:37:05,027 --> 00:37:05,948
when I go back.

863
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:07,186
I can't just sit and wait.

864
00:37:07,546 --> 00:37:09,026
Didn't you say I need to meet

865
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:10,267
with Lili and your two kids?

866
00:37:10,347 --> 00:37:11,586
You pick the time.

867
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:13,266
Okay.

868
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:15,027
Then...

869
00:37:15,507 --> 00:37:16,586
Go in. I'm leaving.

870
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:20,186
Hold on.

871
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:29,066
Alright. It's not funny.

872
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:30,467
I'm leaving now.

873
00:37:30,547 --> 00:37:31,586
Go ahead.

874
00:37:31,768 --> 00:37:33,347
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

875
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:39,626
A long time ago,

876
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:44,027
there lived a hare and a tortoise.

877
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:48,947
The tortoise was kind and quiet.

878
00:37:49,787 --> 00:37:52,427
But the hare was loud

879
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:54,507
and liked to brag a lot.

880
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:01,586
"I am the fastest

881
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,027
animal of all."

882
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:04,626
He would say.

883
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:07,347
"No one could ever beat me

884
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:08,586
in a race."

885
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,387
Hare bragged so much

886
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:14,506
that no one believed him.

887
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,586
"You talk so much."

888
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:26,586
It's too funny.

889
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:49,546
That's enough.

890
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:52,066
Is it ever going to end?

891
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:53,546
Can you stop for a while?

892
00:38:57,706 --> 00:38:59,347
Youyou called back and said

893
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:00,787
she won't come home.

894
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:02,787
She'll stay in the company's dorm.

895
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:04,707
And Yu'an and Yule also went

896
00:39:04,787 --> 00:39:06,146
straight home after the class.

897
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,466
I suddenly have a lot

898
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,746
of free time.

899
00:39:11,146 --> 00:39:12,427
I'm like a dog

900
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:14,626
whose leash was suddenly removed

901
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:16,707
and instead doesn't know

902
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:17,787
where to go.

903
00:39:20,507 --> 00:39:21,507
Do you know what you are?

904
00:39:23,106 --> 00:39:24,106
Masochistic.

905
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:25,228
You...

906
00:39:25,308 --> 00:39:26,387
When everyone is around,

907
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:27,987
you find it annoying.

908
00:39:28,307 --> 00:39:29,586
When everyone is out busy

909
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:30,666
and you are free,

910
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,146
you're complaining again.

911
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:33,987
Is there anyone harder
to please than you?

912
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:35,666
Why don't you go

913
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:37,027
and pick up the kids?

914
00:39:37,427 --> 00:39:38,427
You can ask Chengyi

915
00:39:38,507 --> 00:39:40,266
to fire that nanny.

916
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:42,626
But don't be pretentious in the future.

917
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:43,827
I can't do that.

918
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:45,626
Wouldn't I be under Mei Chengyi's

919
00:39:45,706 --> 00:39:46,787
tight hold like that?

920
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:48,746
It's like

921
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:51,027
he throws a challenge, I accept it.

922
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:52,466
One showdown, game over.

923
00:39:52,546 --> 00:39:53,546
You know?

924
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,787
I don't believe he can hold on.

925
00:39:58,387 --> 00:39:59,787
And he wants to remarry?

926
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:01,787
No matter how good

927
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,186
that Xu is,

928
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:04,867
two plus two

929
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:06,586
makes four kids.

930
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,186
Who else can help him with them?

931
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:10,626
He needs us to help,

932
00:40:10,706 --> 00:40:12,427
yet he doesn't want to listen to us.

933
00:40:12,507 --> 00:40:14,467
There is no such a good thing.

934
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,026
With one troublemaker in the family,

935
00:40:21,106 --> 00:40:22,266
life becomes unlivable.

936
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:42,626
Is she sure she doesn't want the child?

937
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:44,268
What if

938
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:45,987
she can't get pregnant again?

939
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:48,186
Like the two of us,

940
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,467
wanting but unable to have.

941
00:40:51,226 --> 00:40:52,186
Moreover,

942
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:53,867
if you made the decision for her,

943
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:56,226
what if she blames us someday?

944
00:40:58,787 --> 00:40:59,388
If she wants

945
00:40:59,468 --> 00:41:00,947
the child but can't be responsible,

946
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:02,666
just like my sister,

947
00:41:02,746 --> 00:41:04,066
it's better not to have one.

948
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:08,746
Look how good we are.

949
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:11,066
Even though we don't have kids,

950
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:13,186
aren't we living well?

951
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:14,187
We don't have

952
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:15,427
to compete with them.

953
00:41:16,787 --> 00:41:18,347
Others pamper their kids,

954
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:20,347
and I just pamper you.

955
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:22,787
That's true.

956
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:29,467
But if we grow old,

957
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:31,266
no one will come to visit

958
00:41:31,347 --> 00:41:32,626
if we move into a nursing home.

959
00:41:33,706 --> 00:41:34,867
Rest assured.

960
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:36,226
I will live well,

961
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:38,106
striving to die after you.

962
00:41:38,186 --> 00:41:40,387
This lifetime,
I will take good care of you.

963
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:44,146
If only you were left alone,

964
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:46,186
lonely in this world,

965
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:47,947
I wouldn't be at ease either.

966
00:41:49,186 --> 00:41:50,626
In the nursing home,

967
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:52,546
there are so many old ladies.

968
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:55,947
You... You...

969
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:57,066
How dare you?

970
00:41:57,706 --> 00:41:58,706
Believe it or not,

971
00:41:58,827 --> 00:42:00,227
I'll climb out of the grave

972
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:02,027
and stand by your bed
to scare you to death.

973
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:06,307
You old flirt.

974
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:11,546
Did Xiaojiao really agree?

975
00:42:12,027 --> 00:42:14,387
After being coaxed by Qian Hao

976
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:15,827
all these years,

977
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:18,546
will she divorce him?

978
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:21,746
They have fallen out to such an extent.

979
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:23,546
If she goes back to him,

980
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,347
wouldn't that make her a big fool?

981
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:26,867
That's true.

982
00:42:27,706 --> 00:42:28,827
They turned on each other.

983
00:42:28,907 --> 00:42:30,827
If she can still endure it,

984
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:32,987
wouldn't she be a fool?

985
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:37,586
How about

986
00:42:38,586 --> 00:42:39,586
we do this?

987
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:41,267
Let's help her

988
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:42,107
one more time

989
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:43,586
to get divorced smoothly.

990
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:45,787
I knew

991
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,066
you were

992
00:42:47,146 --> 00:42:48,987
tough on the outside and soft inside.

993
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:51,226
Rest assured.

994
00:42:51,907 --> 00:42:53,347
People learn from their mistakes.

995
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:55,746
This time, Xiaojiao

996
00:42:56,027 --> 00:42:57,626
must have gained some sense.

997
00:42:59,586 --> 00:43:00,626
Hopefully.
