00:01:40,088 --> 00:01:40,848
Hello, Miss.

17
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:41,889
Hello.

18
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:43,848
Yu'an and Yule's dad

19
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:44,649
makes me

20
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:45,889
pick up the kids.

21
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:46,810
Did he tell you?

22
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,129
Yes, he told me.

23
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:49,690
Yu'an, Yule,

24
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,448
your dad has something to do today.

25
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:52,050
So,

26
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,249
go with her please.

27
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:54,249
Okay?

28
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:55,208
No.

29
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,728
She wants to be our stepmom.

30
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:58,169
I don't want to go with her.

31
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,529
I'm just, on behalf of your dad,

32
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:04,648
sending you back
to your grandparents' house.

33
00:02:04,648 --> 00:02:05,448
No.

34
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:06,448
No.

35
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:08,489
Then I'm leaving first.

36
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,384
I'll take you two to eat burgers. Okay?

37
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,288
Chicken wings, fries,

38
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:20,369
and cola.

39
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:25,489
Alright.

40
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:29,489
Let's go.

41
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:30,409
Come, follow me.

42
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:30,608
Go.

43
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,608
Say bye-bye.

44
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:35,929
Three, two, one.

45
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:36,448
Run.

46
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:37,848
Yu'an, Yule.

47
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:39,448
Help me chase her.

48
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:40,448
Okay.

49
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:40,984
Yule.

50
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:41,752
Don't run.

51
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:47,089
Yu'an.

52
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:48,728
Stop.

53
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:52,888
Stop.

54
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,089
Yu'an.

55
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:57,048
Stop.

56
00:02:57,768 --> 00:02:58,888
I haven't seen you for long.

57
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:00,608
Both of you

58
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:01,608
have grown up.

59
00:03:02,288 --> 00:03:03,008
Come on.

60
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,288
Today, I will give you

61
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:06,008
each a red packet.

62
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:07,848
Here, take it.

63
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:08,289
Red packet.

64
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,529
Thank you, Grandpa.

65
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:10,929
Thank you, Grandpa.

66
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:13,929
Grandpa is really nice.

67
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:17,969
Sit here to eat.

68
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:20,089
Xiaomi, so sweet-talking.

69
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:21,288
Last time when you came,

70
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,649
Dami was only

71
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:25,448
not much bigger than him now.

72
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:26,529
She used to ride on my neck

73
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:27,649
and go around.

74
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,568
Now she has grown up

75
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:31,689
and becomes shy now.

76
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:34,048
Come on, eat.

77
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:38,249
Who is it?

78
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:40,409
I'll go open the door.

79
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:47,089
Honey.

80
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:48,608
Why did you come?

81
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,169
Didn't you say

82
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,608
Dami and Xiaomi are coming?

83
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,249
I bought some things to bring over.

84
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:53,729
Xiaojiao,

85
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:54,848
come in.

86
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:55,480
Mom, Dad.

87
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:56,696
- Come on.
- Just in time.

88
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:57,688
Let's have a meal.

89
00:03:57,969 --> 00:03:59,328
Okay, I'll put them here.

90
00:03:59,328 --> 00:03:59,849
Okay.

91
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:01,409
Mei Yu'an!

92
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,888
Stop!

93
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,049
Why are you running?

94
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,168
It's very dangerous here.

95
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:06,529
My stepmom is hitting me.

96
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,409
What nonsense are you talking?

97
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:10,048
This child

98
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:11,048
is so pitiful.

99
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,209
Yes.

100
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,809
I'll step in to teach you a lesson.

101
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:16,888
Where is Yule?

102
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:18,088
I searched all over there,

103
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:19,129
but I didn't see her.

104
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:20,729
Keep an eye on her.

105
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:21,369
Please.

106
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,369
Okay.

107
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:24,408
Where is Yule?

108
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:26,648
Oh, my!

109
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,208
(Mei Chengyi,)

110
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:32,169
(for many years,)

111
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:33,968
(I've seen quite a few talents.)

112
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:35,849
(I can pay your high salary.)

113
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,528
(Anyway, it's just a cake.)

114
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:38,930
(If you want more,)

115
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,408
(then they will get less.)

116
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:43,914
(Xu Kaixin)

117
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,448
Hey, Kaixin.

118
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:51,409
Mei Chengyi, come back.

119
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,528
Yule is missing.

120
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:53,208
What?

121
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:54,369
Where are you?

122
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:08,849
Come on, Xiaomi.

123
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:09,730
I cooked it.

124
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,888
How is it?

125
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:11,569
Qian Xiaomi,

126
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:12,968
why not do it yourself?

127
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:16,888
Xiaomi is still young.

128
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:18,528
Grandma, I'll eat by myself.

129
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:19,929
He's not young anymore.

130
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:21,689
At home, he eats by himself.

131
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:35,049
Dami,

132
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,568
don't you love eating shrimp?

133
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,289
Xiaojiao, you eat more too.

134
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:55,408
The child in your belly

135
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:56,528
must not be neglected.

136
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:57,528
Thanks, Mom.

137
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:02,408
Come on.

138
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:04,809
Xiaomi, come on.

139
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:08,609
Come on, Dami.

140
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:10,448
I feed you.

141
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:16,968
Grandpa is really good.

142
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:19,130
Such a grown girl

143
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,088
still needs to be fed.

144
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,609
I'm willing to make up for

145
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:25,169
all the accompaniment

146
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:26,408
they've missed.

147
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:27,489
Is it any of your business?

148
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:31,448
Come on.

149
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:32,729
Eat beef.

150
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:33,930
Eat more.

151
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,968
This is delicious.

152
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:35,968
Okay.

153
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:36,809
Come on.

154
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:37,176
Come on.

155
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:38,456
- We also have beef.
- Thank you, Grandpa.

156
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:39,288
Have some hairtail.

157
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:42,489
Do you want this?

158
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:43,290
Come on.

159
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,489
We have it first.

160
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,568
We must have it too.

161
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,528
This one is big. Come on.

162
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:49,729
Come and eat.

163
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,129
(Mei Yule.)

164
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,144
(Mei Yule.)

165
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:54,130
(When you hear this,)

166
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,608
(please inform the people around you)

167
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:57,609
(to bring you to
the first-floor broadcast room.)

168
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:58,968
(Mei Yule.)

169
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:00,328
(Mei Yule.)

170
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:01,290
(When you hear this,)

171
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,968
(please inform the people around you)

172
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,888
(to bring you to
the first-floor broadcast room.)

173
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,248
(RC-DSQ)

174
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:09,130
Hello.

175
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,208
I'm here. Where are you?

176
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,369
I am in the monitoring room.

177
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:12,369
I'll come over now.

178
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:15,489
Yu'an.

179
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:16,369
Yu'an.

180
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:17,729
Dad.

181
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,729
Are you okay?

182
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:21,048
What's going on?

183
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:22,369
She was with you for a while.

184
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:23,408
How could she get lost?

185
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:24,408
Don't worry.

186
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:25,689
Let's quickly find her.

187
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:26,490
You can scold me

188
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,768
and even hit me later, okay?

189
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,008
Look,

190
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:29,610
is this girl

191
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,968
in a yellow dress

192
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,129
the child you're looking for?

193
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:34,649
Yes.

194
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:35,768
Take a look. Is it her?

195
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:36,768
Yes, it is her.

196
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:38,008
Where is this?

197
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:39,689
From the playback footage,

198
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,729
she first appeared

199
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:42,888
in the phone sales area.

200
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:45,369
The second time was near the escalator.

201
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,050
The third time

202
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,888
was in the car exhibition area
of the hall.

203
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:50,088
Where was she last seen?

204
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:52,089
The area

205
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,129
where she disappeared

206
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,888
happened to have a damaged camera.

207
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:56,129
Listen.

208
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,249
You look in the lobby.

209
00:07:58,249 --> 00:07:59,096
I'll go upstairs.

210
00:07:59,096 --> 00:07:59,864
- Okay.
- Okay?

211
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:01,328
Dad, I want to go too.

212
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:02,328
No.

213
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,249
Stay with Ms. Kaixin.

214
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,249
Let her follow you.

215
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:08,689
Go.

216
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:11,928
Xiaomi's hair

217
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:13,089
is soft,

218
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:14,129
just like his dad

219
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,688
when he was a kid.

220
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:22,729
Why did you come in?

221
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,808
Get some sleep.

222
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,449
Go sleep in that room.

223
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:26,928
Dami is in that room.

224
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:28,209
Should I sleep there?

225
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:29,688
Don't worry about it.

226
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:30,688
Go to sleep quickly.

227
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:32,209
I'll just lie down for a bit.

228
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,209
No.

229
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:34,729
Don't wake my grandson

230
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,089
up.

231
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:37,130
No.

232
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,489
I'm here. It's okay.

233
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:40,048
Get up.

234
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:40,808
You go.

235
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:42,729
Y-You go over there.

236
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:44,528
Can't I even sleep for a while?

237
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,408
Try to touch my mom again?

238
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:51,528
I didn't...

239
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,569
Okay, I'll go out.

240
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:19,369
Mom.

241
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:20,569
Hao,

242
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,168
it has nothing to do with your dad.

243
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:23,969
I pushed him

244
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,129
and lost my balance.

245
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:37,008
(Dear customers,)

246
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:38,130
(if you see)

247
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,969
(a girl around 7 years old)

248
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:41,129
(with a bun hairstyle,)

249
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:42,808
(wearing a yellow dress,)

250
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,849
(and without any adults)

251
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:44,729
(nearby,)

252
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:45,649
(please help us)

253
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,129
(escort her to the broadcast room.)

254
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:48,209
(Thank you, everyone.)

255
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:50,129
(Dear customers,)

256
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,169
(if you see)

257
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:52,928
(a girl around 7 years old)

258
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:53,929
(with a bun hairstyle,)

259
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,168
(wearing a yellow dress,)

260
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:56,528
(and without any adults)

261
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:57,408
(nearby,)

262
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,449
(please help us...)

263
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:11,888
Look,

264
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:15,288
when rivals cross paths,
the brave will win.

265
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,209
Mei Chengyi,

266
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:18,928
can't hold it in anymore, huh?

267
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:22,129
But I tell you

268
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:23,369
I still won't answer.

269
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:25,408
There is an old saying,

270
00:11:26,648 --> 00:11:27,768
first time strong,

271
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:29,768
second time weak, and third time done.

272
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:31,928
When you call five times,

273
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:32,689
I'll answer.

274
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,008
Then it will be a real victory.

275
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,209
Don't answer.

276
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:38,329
Let me tell you.

277
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:39,928
You're going to ruin my big plan.

278
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:41,688
All my previous efforts will be wasted.

279
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:43,288
Chengyi,

280
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:44,888
what?

281
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,089
Yule is missing.

282
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:47,888
What?

283
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:49,129
What happened to Yule?

284
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:50,130
Yule is missing.

285
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,288
Yule is missing.

286
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:52,569
(Dear customers,)

287
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:53,689
(if you see)

288
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:55,489
(a girl about 7 years old)

289
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:56,648
(with a bun hairstyle,)

290
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:58,209
(wearing a yellow dress,)

291
00:11:58,209 --> 00:11:59,369
(and without any adults)

292
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:00,168
(nearby,)

293
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:01,049
- (please help us)
- Hello,

294
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:02,808
- (escort her to the broadcast room.)
- Kaixin, I'm so sad.

295
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:04,249
- (Thank you, everyone.)
- Talk with me.

296
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:05,569
I have no time.

297
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:06,130
How could you

298
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,768
be so heartless?

299
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,928
I lost one of Mei Chengyi's

300
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:09,609
daughters.

301
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:10,609
I'm worried sick.

302
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:12,688
Go on with your work.

303
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:13,370
Hello,

304
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,768
what can I do...?

305
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,112
Don't panic.

306
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,329
Why won't the seatbelt pull down?

307
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:46,424
What's wrong?

308
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,008
Why won't the car start?

309
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:52,648
Where are you stepping?

310
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,450
You need to press

311
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,609
the brake to start the car.

312
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:55,768
I can't figure out

313
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:56,730
which is the brake

314
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,849
and which is the gas.

315
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:58,768
Alright, get off.

316
00:12:58,768 --> 00:12:59,768
I'll drive.

317
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:01,768
You're not strong at all.

318
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:04,369
You just act tough at home.

319
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:07,729
- Hurry up.
- I'm in a hurry.

320
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:17,560
Alright.

321
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:37,688
Dad.

322
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,048
Are you blind?

323
00:13:39,256 --> 00:13:40,376
Can't you see I'm pooping?

324
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,928
You didn't take off your pants.

325
00:13:43,928 --> 00:13:44,824
I don't care.

326
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,896
Let's talk.

327
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:52,952
Nothing to talk about.

328
00:13:58,392 --> 00:13:59,352
Sorry, Dad.

329
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:11,320
Did you ever love my mom?

330
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:17,784
After years of marriage,

331
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,576
it's not about love.

332
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:22,232
We're not like you youth
with so many issues.

333
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:26,776
If she dies now,

334
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,489
would you be sad

335
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:31,896
or feel relieved?

336
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:33,368
What nonsense are you saying?

337
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:35,689
If I'm not sad,

338
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:36,568
I'd be an animal.

339
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:47,992
But my mom is dying.

340
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:51,256
She'll soon be gone from this house.

341
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:18,008
I know you hate my mom.

342
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:21,928
You two have been tormenting each other
for decades.

343
00:15:23,888 --> 00:15:24,969
It's enough.

344
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:26,768
What do you know?

345
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:30,450
My life

346
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,288
was really ruined by her.

347
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:35,250
I went from being

348
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,168
a respected chief doctor

349
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:38,369
to the whole hospital's

350
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:39,928
laughingstock and scoundrel.

351
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:41,369
It's all her fault!

352
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,249
I was on night duty with a female nurse.

353
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:45,928
She rushed to make a scene,

354
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:48,408
and claim her a mistress,

355
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:49,888
causing a huge scandal.

356
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,089
If I said

357
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:52,049
a few more words

358
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:53,369
with young female patient,

359
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:54,928
she'd go up to scold them

360
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,369
and claim

361
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:58,008
they were seducing me.

362
00:15:58,648 --> 00:15:59,808
We can't live like this,

363
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,008
but we can't divorce.

364
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:02,928
She just

365
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:03,529
causes trouble

366
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,609
everywhere I go.

367
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:06,209
My life

368
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:08,569
was really ruined by her.

369
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:42,809
The doctor said

370
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:44,569
my mom has six months to live.

371
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:48,569
Another six months,

372
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:51,528
you'll be free.

373
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:55,008
So, please.

374
00:16:58,408 --> 00:16:59,768
You can lie to her.

375
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:02,569
Coax her.

376
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:05,609
Treat it like acting.

377
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:09,928
Make her happy

378
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,529
and finish her last part.

379
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,329
Okay, Dad?

380
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:37,129
Now Mei Chengyi's

381
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:37,810
thoughts

382
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,728
are not on children at all.

383
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:41,009
I used to think

384
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,408
quite highly of Xu.

385
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:43,529
But now it seems

386
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,168
with Xu around,
Mei Chengyi is distracted.

387
00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:47,009
They can't be together.

388
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:48,289
You still have the nerve to say.

389
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:50,408
If you had answered phone earlier,

390
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:52,688
would this have happened?

391
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:53,888
I'm because...

392
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:54,888
Shut up!

393
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:01,688
Officer.

394
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:02,168
Yes.

395
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,529
I've already sent the photo over.

396
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:05,728
She's missing at Yong'an Shopping Mall.

397
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:06,968
Sorry to trouble you.

398
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,488
Yu'an, tell me.

399
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:14,488
What's going on?

400
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:15,728
Where is Yule?

401
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:17,968
Stop crying. Talk.

402
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:19,129
Where is Yule?

403
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:21,049
I arranged with her.

404
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:22,248
I run forward.

405
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:23,208
She runs backward.

406
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:23,969
Ms. Kaixin

407
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,129
won't catch us.

408
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:28,448
Ms. Kaixin caught me.

409
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:29,488
I don't know

410
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:30,769
where Yule went.

411
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:31,928
Be good.

412
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:32,570
Be obedient.

413
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,648
Go home with me.

414
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:34,888
Behave. Go back with Grandma.

415
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:36,089
I don't know you.

416
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:37,769
Dad, save me.

417
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:38,289
Dad, save me.

418
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:38,929
Be good.

419
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,009
I don't know you.

420
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,089
- Why are you so disobedient?
- What's happening?

421
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,672
- You were spoiled by your dad.
- Are these the kid's relatives?

422
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:46,849
- Be good.
- You didn't learn right,

423
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,248
stole money, and ran away.

424
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:49,609
You're pretending not to know me.

425
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:50,552
- I'll deal with you.
- I don't know

426
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:51,448
- who you are.
- Alright.

427
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:52,409
- She's young.
- Save me!

428
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:53,569
Let's talk about it properly.

429
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:55,648
Call the police?

430
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:56,688
- I need to think about it.
- Go home.

431
00:18:56,688 --> 00:18:58,609
- Go home.
- Be good. Go home with me.

432
00:18:58,609 --> 00:18:59,129
No!

433
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:00,010
Go home with me.

434
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,569
I don't know you.

435
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:02,584
Go back with me. Be good.

436
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:03,384
Yule.

437
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:10,488
Dad.

438
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:11,569
Yule.

439
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:15,370
Hello.

440
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,504
Where are you?

441
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:18,456
- Here.
- Chengyi.

442
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:19,849
- You found them?
- Where are they?

443
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:20,888
Where's Yule?

444
00:19:20,888 --> 00:19:21,849
Kaixin found Yule

445
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:22,552
on the overpass.

446
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:23,329
I'll go find them.

447
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,289
Help me watch Yu'an.

448
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:24,968
Okay.

449
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:25,369
Go home.

450
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:26,810
Be good, baby.

451
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,928
Hurry up and go with me.

452
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:29,009
Let's go home.

453
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:29,488
Go home.

454
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:30,728
Ms. Kaixin!

455
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:31,290
Yule.

456
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,448
Ms. Kaixin!

457
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:33,529
Who are you?

458
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:35,968
Do you, the mistress, have any shame?

459
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,304
You usually pester my husband,

460
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:38,648
but now you want to get her.

461
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:39,449
Have you no shame?

462
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:40,688
Who's the mistress?

463
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:41,848
You human trafficker!

464
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:42,648
Human trafficker!

465
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,409
What are you doing?

466
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:44,448
Why are you hitting me?

467
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:45,688
Why are you hitting me?

468
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:46,928
Human trafficker!

469
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:49,129
Call the police!

470
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:49,969
Human trafficker!

471
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:51,369
We are not human traffickers.

472
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,369
Call the police!

473
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:55,608
Kaixin, Yule!

474
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:57,648
Where you want to go?

475
00:19:57,849 --> 00:19:58,849
Let me go!

476
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:00,329
Let me go!

477
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,240
Really not.

478
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:02,488
Dear!

479
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:03,209
Yule.

480
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,248
Yule is over there.

481
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:07,610
You are being a hooligan!

482
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,849
Who are you?

483
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:10,049
Move aside!

484
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:12,248
Let me go!

485
00:20:12,408 --> 00:20:13,488
There's hitting going on!

486
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:14,888
There's hitting going on!

487
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:16,569
Let me go!

488
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,009
Let me go!

489
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:24,488
Dad, grab her!

490
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:25,489
- Move aside!
- Don't go!

491
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,648
Don't go.

492
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,129
Catch human traffickers!

493
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:29,688
Catch her!

494
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:30,648
Grab her.

495
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:31,648
Trying to run?

496
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:32,809
Catch her!

497
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:34,409
D-Don't let her...

498
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:35,849
Don't let her run. Grab her!

499
00:20:40,024 --> 00:20:40,824
Don't be afraid.

500
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:42,488
You're meddling.

501
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:46,232
Help me!

502
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:47,992
Are you okay?

503
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:55,960
Mr. Song, take a look.

504
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:57,769
These three

505
00:20:57,769 --> 00:20:58,929
(Zhou Yating, Li Wenwen)
are the best candidate

506
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:00,728
(Jia Yangxu)
we've carefully selected.

507
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,248
This afternoon, you'll be here

508
00:21:02,248 --> 00:21:04,049
to meet the first candidate, Ms. Zhou.

509
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:06,089
Coffee, fruit, drinks.

510
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:07,089
It's all on us.

511
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:08,130
To keep you

512
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,208
from getting fleeced.

513
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,928
This is A Second Chance's

514
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:13,648
diamond VIP treatment.

515
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:15,849
Am I considered a VIP here?

516
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:17,408
Why your boss doesn't

517
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:18,888
come to see me?

518
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:22,049
I called my boss.

519
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:24,448
She has a cold and a headache today.

520
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:25,408
Next time,

521
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:26,208
definitely.

522
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:27,488
It's been so many years.

523
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:28,809
Still the same excuse.

524
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:37,089
Come over.

525
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:39,169
You know,

526
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:40,248
actually, I'm

527
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:42,248
not interested in these women.

528
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,968
Do you know the relationship

529
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:46,289
between me and your boss?

530
00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:57,119
(Public Surveillance Area)

531
00:21:58,009 --> 00:21:59,009
I know.

532
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:01,049
Old classmates.

533
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:02,248
Close buddies.

534
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:03,609
Right,

535
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,529
but not entirely right.

536
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:07,448
Actually,

537
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,488
she was my ex-girlfriend.

538
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:10,849
We were like this.

539
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:12,889
Understood

540
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:14,289
what I'm here for this time, right?

541
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,488
You're here for revenge.

542
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:18,049
You want to infuriate her!

543
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:20,248
You're trying to infuriate me.

544
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:22,009
Why would I take revenge?

545
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,289
Why would I infuriate her?

546
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,009
I'm here to pursue her.

547
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:26,849
The "chasing-wife" deal, you know?

548
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:28,488
Oh my God.

549
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:29,448
No wonder she hired you.

550
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,248
Logic is messed up.

551
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:30,968
You know?

552
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,696
Your logic is truly messed up.

553
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:33,816
Bad man!

554
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:38,648
This way, please.

555
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,208
Mr. Song,

556
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:42,488
here.

557
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:43,130
This one

558
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,809
is our premium female member,

559
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:45,752
Ms. Zhou.

560
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:47,248
Hello.

561
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:47,649
Hello.

562
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:49,728
I am the premium male member.

563
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:51,049
Hello.

564
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,248
This is VIP afternoon tea

565
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:57,408
prepared

566
00:22:57,408 --> 00:22:58,408
for both of you.

567
00:22:58,928 --> 00:22:59,928
Thank you.

568
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:05,769
You guys chat.

569
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:06,769
You guys chat.

570
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:09,369
Have some fruit.

571
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:14,728
Still claiming it's not

572
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:15,888
to upset his ex?

573
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:19,208
The "chasing-wife" deal?

574
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,928
I think it will be an irritating deal.

575
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:22,928
Xiaoxiao is pretty good.

576
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:23,969
She chose the member

577
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,089
with such a high match rate.

578
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:28,089
I think this setup will work.

579
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:29,248
Your conditions are so good.

580
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:30,728
What made you come for a blind date?

581
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:32,408
Your conditions aren't bad.

582
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:33,809
What brought you to a blind date?

583
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:34,770
As for me,

584
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,089
I know the boss.

585
00:23:36,928 --> 00:23:38,089
But don't get me wrong.

586
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:39,809
I'm not a shill.

587
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:41,089
I'm really not a shill.

588
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:43,968
So what expectations do you have

589
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:45,049
for your future spouse?

590
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,248
No specific requirements.

591
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:48,769
I'm just used to being laid-back.

592
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:49,449
You know?

593
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:50,769
What I value is the feeling.

594
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:52,569
If we meet and have feelings,

595
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:53,728
we'll fall in love.

596
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:56,529
What about you?

597
00:23:57,248 --> 00:23:58,369
My requirements?

598
00:23:58,488 --> 00:23:59,769
I think you're pretty good.

599
00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:03,168
Thank you.

600
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,248
You've smiled so much, Song Ran.

601
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:21,689
Let me tell you

602
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:23,248
how we fall in love.

603
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:24,968
Back then,

604
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:25,810
we were there

605
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,936
to support our friends

606
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:27,968
on their blind dates.

607
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:28,968
But in the end.

608
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,090
My buddy and her bestie

609
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,168
stood us up.

610
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:32,168
Since we were there,

611
00:24:32,168 --> 00:24:33,049
we decided

612
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:34,049
to have a buffet.

613
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:35,449
But we weren't

614
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:36,648
very familiar with each other.

615
00:24:36,648 --> 00:24:37,849
Then she

616
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,208
just dug in,

617
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:40,809
piling up her plate so high.

618
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:41,809
So much food!

619
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:42,409
I was thinking

620
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:43,968
she is so cute.

621
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:45,369
I was still pondering.

622
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:46,049
Guess what?

623
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:46,810
What happened?

624
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,049
While she was eating,

625
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:49,569
her eyes started to slowly close.

626
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:50,968
W-What happened?

627
00:24:50,968 --> 00:24:51,529
I called her.

628
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:51,929
I said,

629
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:53,049
Xiaoxiao,

630
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:54,248
Xiaoxiao,

631
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:55,289
Xiaoxiao.

632
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:56,168
There was no response.

633
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:57,169
It scared me.

634
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:58,329
I thought, it's over.

635
00:24:58,329 --> 00:24:59,529
My classmate is overstuffed.

636
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:00,168
What to do?

637
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,569
So I quickly

638
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,648
slapped her face.

639
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:04,329
Immediately,

640
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:04,769
her eyes

641
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:05,809
popped wide open.

642
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:06,809
She looked at me,

643
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:09,208
and suddenly burst into tears.

644
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,248
She insisted that I was bullying her.

645
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:12,009
Got it?

646
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:13,208
Oh my gosh,

647
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,209
she got it wrong.

648
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:15,569
So this is how it is.

649
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:16,863
(Police)

650
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:21,049
Mom, Dad.

651
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,049
How are things going?

652
00:25:22,968 --> 00:25:24,208
Fine, the statement is done.

653
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,208
Everything is clear now.

654
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:28,329
Xu has left.

655
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:30,408
I think she doesn't seem very happy.

656
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,408
Is she okay?

657
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:35,448
She should be fine.

658
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:36,570
You can

659
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,849
take them to the car.

660
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:38,809
I'll give her a call.

661
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:39,049
Okay.

662
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:39,809
Alright.

663
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:40,569
Come on, sweeties.

664
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:41,090
- Go.
- Go.

665
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,329
- Go back, sweeties.
- Go.

666
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:43,329
Okay.

667
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:18,248
(Kaixin,)

668
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:19,609
(I know you're angry.)

669
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:20,609
(It's my fault.)

670
00:26:20,888 --> 00:26:21,888
(I'm truly sorry.)

671
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:23,609
(After settle things done,)

672
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,529
(I'll apologize in person.)

673
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:45,208
Hello.

674
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,208
The kids are found.

675
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:48,569
I'm almost starving.

676
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:50,769
Let's go out to eat. My treat.

677
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:51,688
I can't eat.

678
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:52,570
I'm so angry.

679
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,769
Then let's just have a drink.

680
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:55,168
A drink is fine. Come pick me up.

681
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:56,728
Okay.

682
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:10,529
Yu'an, tell me

683
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:12,249
why you today

684
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:13,569
deliberately teased Ms. Xu?

685
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:19,569
Speak up.

686
00:27:19,728 --> 00:27:21,168
Grandpa said

687
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:22,529
you found us

688
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:23,448
a new stepmother

689
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:25,569
and have no more time to spend with us.

690
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:26,649
He also told

691
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:28,809
the story of Snow White
and the Stepmother Queen,

692
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:30,809
and Cinderella's story.

693
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:32,648
Children with stepmothers

694
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:34,408
will all be bullied.

695
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:36,569
So, we don't like her.

696
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,248
I made an agreement with Yule.

697
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,769
I ran forward, and she ran back,

698
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:41,689
so that Ms. Kaixin

699
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:43,408
couldn't catch us.

700
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:46,168
And you will surely be angry

701
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:47,648
and won't let Ms. Kaixin

702
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:49,408
be our stepmother.

703
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:51,809
I didn't know why

704
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,529
I ran

705
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:55,168
onto the bridge.

706
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:56,968
Those two dragged me

707
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:59,009
and said they were my mom and grandma.

708
00:27:59,408 --> 00:28:00,769
No matter how I shouted for help.

709
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:01,849
No one believed me.

710
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:04,129
Only Ms. Kaixin rushed over.

711
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:06,049
When she saved me,

712
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:07,928
I didn't dislike her anymore.

713
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:09,609
She's awesome,

714
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:11,369
just like Ultraman.

715
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,769
I was shouting "Save me!"

716
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:16,009
She swooped in instantly.

717
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:19,648
I also didn't dislike

718
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:21,408
her anymore.

719
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:24,849
What did I say?

720
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:26,728
Trouble-maker.

721
00:28:27,168 --> 00:28:28,928
You almost got them into trouble.

722
00:28:31,968 --> 00:28:32,770
You clearly knew

723
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,728
they haven't accepted Xu yet,

724
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:36,769
but you insisted
on letting Xu pick them up.

725
00:28:37,168 --> 00:28:38,769
Can they not resist?

726
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:41,809
I know this is inappropriate.

727
00:28:42,728 --> 00:28:44,168
Before that,

728
00:28:44,168 --> 00:28:44,969
I made many calls

729
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:46,408
to you.

730
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:47,809
None of you answered.

731
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:48,850
My work

732
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,049
has big changes.

733
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:52,569
Dad, I have to raise them.

734
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:53,928
I can't always

735
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:54,928
stay by their side.

736
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:56,849
It's all because of you.

737
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:58,248
You wouldn't let me answer. You...

738
00:28:58,248 --> 00:28:58,649
Alright.

739
00:28:58,649 --> 00:28:59,809
Got it.

740
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,648
Get the kids to eat.

741
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:05,769
Come on, Yu'an.

742
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:06,968
Yule, come quickly.

743
00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:09,928
Want me to feed you?

744
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:11,009
Hurry.

745
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:42,168
Quail egg.

746
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:43,408
Okay.

747
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:44,609
Garlic edamame.

748
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:45,329
Okay.

749
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:46,208
Garlic mushroom.

750
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:46,968
Okay.

751
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,168
Roast chicken.

752
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:49,769
Okay.

753
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:50,769
Bread temptation.

754
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:51,809
Steak.

755
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:53,968
A dozen beers.

756
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:54,928
Crazy?

757
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:56,129
Aren't you dieting?

758
00:29:56,248 --> 00:29:57,849
Buying is the only way to feel good.

759
00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:59,208
Then you pay for this meal.

760
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,009
Wait.

761
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:01,009
Wait a moment.

762
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:02,168
Um,

763
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:03,529
just the first two.

764
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:04,489
Okay.

765
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:05,609
Four bottles of beer.

766
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:06,168
Okay.

767
00:30:06,168 --> 00:30:07,168
Just a moment.

768
00:30:12,472 --> 00:30:13,912
- Who speak first?
- Who speak first?

769
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:16,129
- You first.
- I go first.

770
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:17,848
- You first.
- You first.

771
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:24,928
Is it me or you first?

772
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:43,289
Mom.

773
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:44,369
They are asleep?

774
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:47,192
Asleep.

775
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:49,408
Mom, sit.

776
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:54,849
Mom,

777
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:56,568
my attitude towards
my father-in-law was...

778
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:58,408
It's okay.

779
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:06,248
I heard you got angry with Xu.

780
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:08,888
Y-Yes.

781
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:10,904
I was a bit anxious today.

782
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:12,610
I thought

783
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,296
Kaixin lost them.

784
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,409
I didn't think

785
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:16,448
those two little brats

786
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:17,448
did it on their own.

787
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,728
I texted her to apologize.

788
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:20,769
She hasn't replied to me.

789
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:21,888
Probably got angry.

790
00:31:21,888 --> 00:31:23,168
How can she not be angry?

791
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,448
She also has two kids

792
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:26,609
and a lot on her plate.

793
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:28,529
She put in so much effort

794
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:29,769
to come and help.

795
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:32,009
They caused trouble.

796
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,648
And you went off on her without knowing

797
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:34,769
the whole story.

798
00:31:35,448 --> 00:31:36,249
Even so,

799
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:37,408
she held back her anger

800
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,448
and found the two kids before leaving.

801
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:41,529
How sensible she is!

802
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:44,369
Her determination
to protect the children.

803
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,448
That's truly

804
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:46,769
a mother's way.

805
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:48,769
Without Xu,

806
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:50,208
they might have ended up

807
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:52,609
being taken away.

808
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:55,928
Look at the internet now,

809
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,010
there are all sorts of

810
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,369
news about missing children.

811
00:31:58,488 --> 00:31:59,849
It makes my so worried.

812
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:01,248
Mom, I understand.

813
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:02,888
When something happens to them,

814
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:03,888
I panic.

815
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:06,609
I will apologize to her properly.

816
00:32:08,168 --> 00:32:09,688
Then I'll watch them now,

817
00:32:09,688 --> 00:32:11,208
and you go apologize to her.

818
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:12,849
No need.

819
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,169
Right now,

820
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:15,728
I just want to be with them.

821
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:19,369
Let's talk about other things tomorrow.

822
00:32:20,968 --> 00:32:21,968
I'll listen to you.

823
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:24,569
In the future, if you have anything,

824
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,208
just bring them over.

825
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:29,408
Don't argue with your father-in-law.

826
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:31,609
We'll still be like before.

827
00:32:31,968 --> 00:32:35,049
We'll handle the school drop-offs
and pick-ups.

828
00:32:36,408 --> 00:32:37,728
You don't need him this week.

829
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:38,849
Look at him.

830
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,928
He can't eat or sleep properly.

831
00:32:43,968 --> 00:32:45,769
Ever since You Xin left,

832
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:48,968
he and Youyou have changed a lot.

833
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,408
They just can't let go.

834
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:55,769
In our hearts, we see Yu'an and Yule

835
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,408
as the continuation of You Xin.

836
00:32:57,849 --> 00:32:59,609
We can't love them enough.

837
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,648
Besides,

838
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:02,289
you've always been honoring us

839
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:03,408
on behalf of You Xin,

840
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:05,168
giving money and effort.

841
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,329
Your father-in-law knows this
in his heart.

842
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:08,569
He just can't resist speaking.

843
00:33:08,928 --> 00:33:10,968
Mom, this is what I should do.

844
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:12,049
So,

845
00:33:12,248 --> 00:33:14,408
we take care of them for You Xin.

846
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:15,736
It's our duty.

847
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:19,928
Mom, thank you.

848
00:33:20,184 --> 00:33:21,208
Silly guy,

849
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:23,448
we are one family, don't say that.

850
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,129
When your father-in-law acts up,

851
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,609
just think of it as menopause.

852
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:28,809
Don't bother with him.

853
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:31,009
I'll deal with him later.

854
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:42,849
Xin,

855
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:44,968
I saw a sea of flowers

856
00:33:44,968 --> 00:33:46,248
in the woods today.

857
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:47,529
It was very beautiful.

858
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:49,648
I picked a bouquet of balloon flowers.

859
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:52,609
(You Xin's grave)
Its floral language is eternity.

860
00:33:53,168 --> 00:33:54,168
You like it, right?

861
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:57,849
In the future, except going home,

862
00:33:58,168 --> 00:34:00,049
I'll bring you a bouquet
of flowers every day.

863
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:08,808
Today's sunset

864
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:11,529
is extremely beautiful.

865
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,529
I wish you were here.

866
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,609
You liked playing with her too?

867
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:03,208
Xu Kaixin, what are you doing?

868
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:04,609
Can't even focus on drinking!

869
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:06,168
Watching a video.

870
00:35:10,648 --> 00:35:11,929
I'm watching a video.

871
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:13,369
Their first time

872
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:14,360
at Grandma's house.

873
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,736
I'm worried they won't manage.

874
00:35:15,928 --> 00:35:17,049
I asked Qian Hao to send me

875
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:18,049
a video every two hours.

876
00:35:18,168 --> 00:35:19,569
I'm almost done watching.

877
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:22,969
Can you drink a little more?

878
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:24,089
Why not really drink?

879
00:35:24,328 --> 00:35:24,984
Come on.

880
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:26,889
Finish it.

881
00:35:27,129 --> 00:35:28,489
Don't you know

882
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:29,648
your alcohol tolerance?

883
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:30,610
Every time, I

884
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,848
carry you back.

885
00:35:32,168 --> 00:35:33,768
Are we both getting drunk

886
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:34,768
and sleeping here?

887
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:36,969
Really.

888
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:42,248
You and Song Ran both bully me.

889
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,969
Is this liquor or medicine?

890
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:53,208
Why get wild after half a bottle?

891
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:55,489
Tell me,

892
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:56,648
what's wrong?

893
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:03,368
That bad guy

894
00:36:03,368 --> 00:36:04,449
became my super VIP.

895
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:07,009
Isn't that a good thing?

896
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,808
He gave you money.

897
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:10,168
Xu Kaixin,

898
00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:11,449
that's a remarriage studio.

899
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:12,648
Got it?

900
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,049
He got divorced.

901
00:36:15,352 --> 00:36:16,529
That's not right!

902
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,168
When did he get married?

903
00:36:18,168 --> 00:36:19,368
Exactly.

904
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:21,449
Isn't he being shameless?

905
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:22,848
He disappeared

906
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,009
for a few years.

907
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:24,848
Suddenly appeared.

908
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:26,360
Divorced, he thought of me again.

909
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,449
What does he take me for?

910
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:28,609
An old backup?

911
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:31,168
And the funniest part?

912
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:32,889
He said he wanted to chase me,

913
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:33,969
but as soon as

914
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:35,768
my studio introduces him
to a female client,

915
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:37,569
he's all smiles

916
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:38,410
and googly-eyed.

917
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,648
Pretending to be so genuine.

918
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:41,049
I did it on purpose.

919
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:42,409
I deliberately matched him with

920
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,209
a female client

921
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:44,768
with a style like his first love.

922
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:46,168
So how did it turn out?

923
00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:48,449
He just couldn't stand the test.

924
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:49,648
I knew it,

925
00:36:49,648 --> 00:36:50,889
Song Ran is just like Qian Hao,

926
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:52,529
never a good person.

927
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,129
You've gotten me all confused.

928
00:36:59,848 --> 00:37:01,049
For the past few years,

929
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:02,449
whenever you mention Song Ran,

930
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,609
you become very upset.

931
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,248
But when you two were in school,

932
00:37:06,248 --> 00:37:07,609
it was never public at all.

933
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:08,768
Even now, I don't feel

934
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,729
you are... What's

935
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:10,808
the deal with you two?

936
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,808
I don't know it either.

937
00:37:16,248 --> 00:37:17,969
He was the one who approached me first.

938
00:37:19,808 --> 00:37:20,648
But he told others

939
00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:21,808
that we were good buddies.

940
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:23,490
Does a good buddy

941
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,569
call me when he's drunk?

942
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:27,529
Xu Kaixin, don't pretend confused.

943
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:30,368
Wait.

944
00:37:30,368 --> 00:37:31,090
How could he

945
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,168
just walk away,

946
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,409
get married to someone else,

947
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:34,410
and leave me

948
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:35,569
standing here like a fool?

949
00:37:40,648 --> 00:37:41,648
How nice!

950
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:44,168
Where?

951
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:47,368
Many women in their thirties

952
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,570
say they've got

953
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,728
a teenager inside.

954
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:50,848
But I think

955
00:37:50,848 --> 00:37:52,409
those are all fake teenagers.

956
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:55,409
You have a real teenager.

957
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,609
Speak normally.

958
00:37:58,728 --> 00:38:00,129
You're still worrying about

959
00:38:00,129 --> 00:38:01,168
the men

960
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:02,168
from your younger days.

961
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:03,808
It proves

962
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:05,808
you are still the same Li Xiaoxiao

963
00:38:05,808 --> 00:38:07,224
from back then.

964
00:38:07,224 --> 00:38:07,960
Wait.

965
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,089
Don't you and Mei Chengyi

966
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:10,712
also get love-struck
when you're unhappy?

967
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:11,490
How do they differ?

968
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,208
There's a big difference.

969
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:14,929
In the world of middle-aged people,

970
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,529
they have elders and children,

971
00:38:16,848 --> 00:38:18,208
and work.

972
00:38:18,728 --> 00:38:20,168
There's only a tiny bit of space

973
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:21,569
left for feelings.

974
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:23,728
The unhappiness it brings

975
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:25,208
is really just a little.

976
00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:27,049
Not like you,

977
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:28,169
even worries

978
00:38:28,169 --> 00:38:29,768
are passionate.

979
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:35,449
So, I'm still young?

980
00:38:36,808 --> 00:38:37,848
So what?

981
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:38,969
Let's drink to being young?

982
00:38:39,129 --> 00:38:40,328
Let's drink to being young.

983
00:38:48,168 --> 00:38:49,768
But I'm still all confused now.

984
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:50,768
I don't know what to do.

985
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:51,768
Xu Kaixin.

986
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:52,929
Let it go!

987
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:54,529
See how it goes.

988
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:56,768
This life is halfway through.

989
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,529
Why are you fighting with yourself?

990
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:00,449
That's true.

991
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,449
Why am I fighting with myself?

992
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:03,609
Forget about it.

993
00:39:03,728 --> 00:39:04,728
Alright.

994
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:08,409
Done.

995
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,160
(One message)

996
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:20,570
(Mei Chengyi)
(Hello,)

997
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,929
(previously, at A Second Chance,)

998
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,848
(we have connection.)

999
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:24,969
(But you deleted me.)

1000
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,049
(Don't tell Kaixin)

1001
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:27,049
(I add you on WeChat.)

1002
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:28,328
(I just to ask you)

1003
00:39:28,328 --> 00:39:29,609
(what does she like the most?)

1004
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:40,865
(Management Office)

1005
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:49,009
Master.

1006
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:52,529
Master!

1007
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:54,168
Can you speak a little louder?

1008
00:39:54,808 --> 00:39:55,450
Little girl,

1009
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,009
why don't you have any taboos?

1010
00:39:57,288 --> 00:39:58,929
Who yells in the cemetery?

1011
00:39:58,929 --> 00:39:59,969
Are you calling spirits?

1012
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:02,768
I called you and you didn't respond.

1013
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:05,969
Master,

1014
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,609
how old are you?

1015
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:09,609
Over 40.

1016
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:11,688
Why do you always seem so old

1017
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:13,368
like a little old man?

1018
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,049
This is...

1019
00:40:22,288 --> 00:40:23,288
Tai Chi!

1020
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:26,049
It's scary to be uneducated.

1021
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:29,768
This is called Baduanjin.

1022
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:33,208
It's for strengthening
and invigorating the body.

1023
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:35,808
Master, you are really something.

1024
00:40:36,248 --> 00:40:38,409
Goji berry tea,

1025
00:40:38,848 --> 00:40:40,569
prayer beads, and walnuts every day.

1026
00:40:42,248 --> 00:40:43,248
Baduanjin?

1027
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:45,609
My dad doesn't even seem as old as you.

1028
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:54,929
Straighten.

1029
00:40:55,529 --> 00:40:56,529
Master,

1030
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:59,168
the luxury car in our yard

1031
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:01,049
has been there for days.

1032
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:02,728
Whose is it?

1033
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,208
They're rolling in cash.

1034
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:13,768
Right in front of you.

1035
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:16,808
Yiersan?

1036
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:20,569
Stop bragging, Master.

1037
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:22,328
Your

1038
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:23,969
tattered outfit, worn-out shoes,

1039
00:41:24,368 --> 00:41:26,208
and those prayer beads and walnuts,

1040
00:41:26,368 --> 00:41:27,449
can it even be worth 500?

1041
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:29,569
Yet you drive such a nice car?

1042
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,368
Give me a break.

1043
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:42,368
Yiersan,

1044
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:43,569
go.

1045
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:49,368
M-Master.

1046
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,848
Here,

1047
00:41:58,929 --> 00:41:59,969
the soup is here.

1048
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:02,248
Honey,

1049
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:04,368
how could you let a pregnant woman
make soup?

1050
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:05,728
Slow down, Dad.

1051
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:12,208
Why are you so obedient today?

1052
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:13,209
Do whatever

1053
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:14,328
you are asked to do.

1054
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,489
It's rare for Dami and Xiaomi to come.

1055
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:18,490
After we finish dinner,

1056
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,208
I'll take a family photo for us.

1057
00:42:20,328 --> 00:42:21,328
Sure.

1058
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:22,936
How can we take it then?

1059
00:42:22,936 --> 00:42:25,129
For a family photo,
the whole family should be present.

1060
00:42:25,688 --> 00:42:26,490
Especially you,

1061
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,449
with my grandson in your belly.

1062
00:42:29,328 --> 00:42:30,768
Later,

1063
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:32,208
I'll arrange someone her to take it.

1064
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:33,609
Let's take it together.

1065
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:36,049
Thank you, Honey.

1066
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:41,929
Mom.

1067
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:44,248
After finishing the meal
and taking pictures,

1068
00:42:44,248 --> 00:42:45,089
I'll send them

1069
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:46,089
back.

1070
00:42:47,288 --> 00:42:48,929
So fast. Time flies.

1071
00:42:49,129 --> 00:42:50,768
A whole day just passed by in a blink.

1072
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:54,368
Talk to Xu Kaixin.

1073
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:55,848
Let Xiaomi

1074
00:42:55,848 --> 00:42:57,529
stay with me for a few more days.

1075
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,409
Staying with grandma

1076
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:01,328
is only natural, isn't it?

1077
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:02,969
I'll ask.
