16
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:42,828
I didn't expect today

17
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:45,947
it happened quite suddenly.

18
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:54,507
Today

19
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:56,468
was unlucky day for me,

20
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:57,947
and I was really annoyed.

21
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:00,507
When I saw the photo you sent,

22
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:02,947
I felt

23
00:02:03,388 --> 00:02:04,468
much better somehow.

24
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:06,627
And I just wanted to ask you out

25
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:07,707
to chat.

26
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:11,948
Do you

27
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,268
feel much better now?

28
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:18,427
Of course.

29
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:22,427
Let me ask you something serious.

30
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:26,027
Since your ex-wife passed away,

31
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:27,948
have you been in a relationship?

32
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:33,508
I've had a few dates,

33
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:35,189
but it

34
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:36,747
ended up nothing after they knew

35
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:38,467
I have two daughters.

36
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:40,188
I think they might be worried

37
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:42,147
about dealing with them.

38
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:47,948
Here's a question.

39
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:51,403
Have you slept with anyone?

40
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:56,867
You...

41
00:02:57,508 --> 00:02:58,828
That straightforward?

42
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:02,187
Well,

43
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:04,508
yes.

44
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:05,788
Once.

45
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:07,988
Once?

46
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:09,867
And then she ran away?

47
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:11,867
Didn't call the police?

48
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:13,268
Can't the police handle it?

49
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:14,348
Let me tell you.

50
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,947
My son is only four years old now,

51
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,107
but I've educated him

52
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:19,027
to protect himself outside.

53
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:20,188
There are many bad people

54
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,588
out there now.

55
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,188
Especially the pretty boys

56
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:24,948
are too easily fooled.

57
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:28,627
Would you do the same?

58
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,547
How is it possible?

59
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,188
I would take full responsibility.

60
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:34,548
What I'm looking for
is a family partner.

61
00:03:34,707 --> 00:03:36,108
I have a spirit of contract.

62
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:41,427
Speaking of it,

63
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,427
the two of us

64
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:45,747
are just one step away.

65
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:52,307
Right.

66
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:54,348
P-Pretty good.

67
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:57,548
Well,

68
00:03:58,027 --> 00:03:59,468
let's stop chatting.

69
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:01,707
If we keep chatting, it'll be dawn.

70
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,147
Then I'll go take a shower.

71
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,108
Kaixin. Kaixin.

72
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:25,267
What's wrong?

73
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,348
What's wrong with your back?

74
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:29,227
Help me up. Hurry.

75
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:30,307
Alright.

76
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:32,468
- It hurts.
- How come?

77
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:34,307
Where does it hurt? The back?

78
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:35,829
Be careful.

79
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,667
Be careful.

80
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:39,668
Be careful.

81
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:41,187
Be careful.

82
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:42,267
Be careful.

83
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:44,667
I strained my back.

84
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:45,548
Strained?

85
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:46,668
How come?

86
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,148
How come?

87
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:49,787
How come you strained your back?

88
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:50,867
I...

89
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:53,148
Why don't we go to the hospital?

90
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:54,428
We didn't do anything.

91
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:55,867
Why did you strain your back?

92
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:57,708
Be careful.

93
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:01,668
Okay.

94
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:05,108
This happened so suddenly.

95
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:07,108
It's nothing.

96
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,228
Maybe it's because

97
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,108
I strained my back
when I carried two kids

98
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:11,908
a few days ago.

99
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:14,232
And I jumped into the river
to save my father-in-law.

100
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:15,747
This worsened it.

101
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,187
It's okay.

102
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:20,667
I owe you once.

103
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:22,667
- Okay.
- I'll definitely make it up to you.

104
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:23,268
Alright.

105
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:24,227
It's okay.

106
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:25,188
Don't cancel

107
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:26,787
my partner qualification due to this.

108
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:27,948
I won't.

109
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:28,868
Do you need help?

110
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:30,028
It's okay.

111
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:31,908
- Okay.
- Be careful.

112
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:32,787
Alright.

113
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:33,947
Come on, take it slow.

114
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:36,107
It's not what you think.

115
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:37,387
I know.

116
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:38,947
Be careful.

117
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,468
Go down the middle lane.

118
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:44,867
Go, go, go, let's push!

119
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:47,148
Attack the tower.

120
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:50,708
Let's go.

121
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:51,988
Okay.

122
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:53,548
One push.

123
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:54,908
Don't mind others.

124
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:55,988
Just attack the tower.

125
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:03,096
(Won, Continue)

126
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:04,069
I'm logging off.

127
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:05,387
I can't stay up anymore.

128
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:07,267
I'm logging off too.

129
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:08,948
My wife is working late today,

130
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:10,227
so I can play for so long.

131
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:11,268
Otherwise, I would

132
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:12,668
have been slapped.

133
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:14,468
Look at you.

134
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:16,108
Youyou is still online.

135
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,747
Staying up late every night,

136
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:19,187
can you handle it?

137
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,148
I suffer from insomnia.

138
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:22,747
Anyway, I can't sleep.

139
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:24,268
You all go to sleep.

140
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:25,269
Bye-bye.

141
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:26,827

I...

145
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:11,387
I heard someone jumped into the river.

146
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:13,389
And I saw that person

147
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,628
is dressed in the same color

148
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,187
as you,

149
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:19,468
so I just jumped down

150

without thinking.

151

00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,787
I just don't believe it.

196
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,216
(Cemetery Caretaker, Intern, Salary
of 3,000 yuan, Yongshou Cemetery)

197
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:09,875
(Adding request from a stranger)

198
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,912
(Tianya Miserable Fellow, A man secretly
in love with you for years, Accepted)

199
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:30,547
(Hu Xiaojiao)

200
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,547
(Tianya, Yes.)

201
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:36,828
(Who are you?)

202
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:43,267
(It doesn't matter.)

203
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:44,547
(You only need to know)

204
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:46,828
(I've been watching over you for years.)

205
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,667
(If you're a liar, go away.)

206
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,587
(I'm in a bad mood today.)

207
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:45,667
(Don't bother me.)

208
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:48,908
(When at school,)

209
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:49,909
(you often wore)

210
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,108
(a white dress,)

211
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,188
(very beautiful.)

212
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:58,828
(Why are you in a bad mood?)

213
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:00,907
(You can talk to me.)

214
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:13,148
It's okay to tell him

215
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:14,228
as he is a netizen.

216
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:19,947
(I don't get well along)

217
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:21,188
(with my husband.)

218
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:23,267
(He doesn't want to divorce,)

219
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,387
(nor does he want to live a good life.)

220
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:29,547
(He wants to torment you.)

221
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,027
(Right, psychological violence.)

222
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:38,547
It hurts.

223
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:39,627
It hurts.

224
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:40,947
Take it easy, it hurts.

225
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,108
It hurts.

226
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,267
Does it hurt to get a shot?

227
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:45,828
No, not at all.

228
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,307
Are you okay?

229
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:50,068
I'm fine.

230
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:52,108
A muscle injection is a bit painful,

231
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,828
but it's not that painful.

232
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:55,027
Stop being dramatic.

233
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:58,268
Well, I...

234
00:12:58,348 --> 00:12:59,068
Be careful.

235
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:01,228
I've been sensitive to pain.

236
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:03,349
I'll prescribe you

237
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:04,747
some oral medicine.

238
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,667
Okay, okay.

239
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:10,988
Alright, go get the medicine.

240
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:11,748
Alright.

241
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:12,947
- Right away.
- Thank you.

242
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:14,027
Be careful.

243
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:15,468
Well,

244
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:17,267
you are not young anymore.

245
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:18,468
Restrain yourself.

246
00:13:19,988 --> 00:13:20,988
Okay.

247
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,228
Hear that? He's talking to you.

248
00:13:24,348 --> 00:13:24,909
What?

249
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:26,027
Let's go.

250
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:27,948
We'll take your advice.

251
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,707
Turn right.

252
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:32,587
Okay.

253
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,336
Okay, I'm here.

254
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:34,548
- You're here, right?
- Right.

255
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:35,827
Here, I'm not going in.

256
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:36,907
Here's the medicine.

257
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,507
Wait,

258
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,308
you can't just leave

259
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:42,748
because my back hurts.

260
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:43,827
You don't send me off?

261
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:44,908
I can't believe it.

262
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:47,228
No, your daughters are at home.

263
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:49,628
They went to their grandparents' house.

264
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,468
Or how would I dare
come out to find you?

265
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:53,388
Alright.

266
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:54,748
So clingy. Come on.

267
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:55,867
Right.

268
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:01,828
Be careful.

269
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,468
Be careful.

270
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:13,988
Your house is in order.

271
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:14,588
My house

272
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:15,988
is like having two dogs,

273
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:17,228
everything in a mess.

274
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:18,547
It's impossible like this.

275
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:19,509
Well,

276
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:21,907
I am obsessive about cleanliness.

277
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:23,547
Fewer things,

278
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:24,708
less messy your house is.

279
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:26,148
Every day,

280
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:27,908
after Yu'an and Yule fell asleep,

281
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:29,747
I would tidy up for 40 minutes.

282
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:32,507
Go in.

283
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:36,828
Okay.

284
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:40,147
- Come on.
- Wait, wait.

285
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:41,507
I have to wash my face.

286
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:42,468
This bed is so nice.

287
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,828
Let me sleep for five minutes.

288
00:14:44,387 --> 00:14:45,587
Okay, I'll wake you up.

289
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,667
Okay.

290
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:05,147
Kaixin.

291
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:06,507
Kaixin.

292
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,108
Kaixin.

293
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:47,708
(Tianya, Morning.)

294
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,828
(Hope you'll have a good day.)

295
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:40,468
(Oh my.)

296
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:42,068
(Why does this man happen to fit)

297
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,148
(my aesthetic?)

298
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:00,868
(Why is he staring at me?)

299
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,547
(Does he want to kiss me?)

300
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:04,428
(No, I haven't brushed my teeth yet.)

301
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:05,628
(Oh my.)

302
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,187
(I wonder if his eyesight is good.)

303
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:08,307
(We're being so close.)

304
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,947
(The pores and freckles on my face)

305
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:11,427
(must be seen clearly.)

306
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,908
What are you thinking about?

307
00:18:20,107 --> 00:18:21,427
Help me out.

308
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:22,507
Help me up.

309
00:18:23,507 --> 00:18:24,707
Please

310
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,027
help me change the medicine.

311
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:34,988
Come on.

312
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:36,547
Be careful.

313
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:46,267
Why did you get up so early?

314
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:48,947
My daughter is going to look for a job.

315
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,827
The breakfast must be good.

316
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:52,508
I'll go to buy her

317
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:53,747
small steamed buns

318
00:18:53,868 --> 00:18:55,828
and wontons from Longji.

319
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:57,107
She loves them the most.

320
00:18:57,988 --> 00:18:59,148
You used to argue every day,

321
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:00,267
and now you are

322
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,428
doting on her suddenly.

323
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:04,908
You don't understand.

324
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:08,027
Father's love comes with many forms.

325
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:10,188
Don't forget

326
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:11,868
to wake Yu'an and Yule up.

327
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:19,828
Hey, can you help me

328
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,027
put those books in the bag?

329
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:23,228
Okay, okay.

330
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,309
Right,

331
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:31,228
- don't forget the pen.
- Okay, okay.

332
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:32,668
(Experience is the best teacher.)

333
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:33,668
(This night)

334
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:35,107
(finally lets me feel)

335
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,787
(the love of middle-aged people
not like when we were young.)

336
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:39,547
(We are ambitious,)

337
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:40,747
(but with a poor health.)

338
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:42,427
(Every man at a certain age)

339
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,587
(automatically activates family mode.)

340
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:45,708
(It's not surrender,)

341
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:47,027
(but for responsibility.)

342
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:48,588
(At this moment,)

343
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:49,828
(we have no time to mourn)

344
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:51,707
(the hormones gone with the wind.)

345
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:52,288
Not at all.

346
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:53,307
(Because...)

347
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:54,309
Later,

348
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:56,792
I'll go to their Grandma's house
to pick them up for school.

349
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:58,507
Right, I booked a car for you.

350
00:19:58,787 --> 00:19:59,908
Your son and daughter

351
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:00,829
should wake up now.

352
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,668
Right, they will get up soon.

353
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:05,588
Let's go together then.

354
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:06,668
Okay, take it slow.

355
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:07,908
Take it easy.

356
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:08,948
By the way,

357
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:10,428
we need to set a time

358
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:11,827
to talk about the contract.

359
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:14,628
About the family partner.

360
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:16,428
Didn't we agree yesterday?

361
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:19,227
What? Have you changed your mind?

362
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:20,587
I-I am serious.

363
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:21,827
Not at all.

364
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:24,547
What about after signing the contract?

365
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,427
Meet and have dinner with the family.

366
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:28,948
And then, go get the certificate.

367
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:30,948
What certificate?

368
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:33,027
The marriage certificate.

369
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:34,787
Aren't we getting it?

370
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,428
Then it's an illegal partnership?

371
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:37,788
Shouldn't we

372
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:38,508
have some

373
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:39,628
legal protection?

374
00:20:42,228 --> 00:20:43,027
Be careful.

375
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:44,109
(When we first met,)

376
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:45,348
(I once said)

377
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:46,028
(I am)

378
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:48,027
(a person who only marries for love.)

379
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:49,107
(Do I love her?)

380
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:50,868
(Not now at least.)

381
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:51,829
(But I like her)

382
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:53,868
(more than other women.)

383
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:56,548
(However, I want to try)

384
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:57,428
(the family partner)

385
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,068
(she mentioned.)

386
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:00,828
(Xu Kaixin seems to have a power)

387
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:01,829
(that lets me relaxed)

388
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:03,587
(once I see her.)

389
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:06,108
(A woman who can do that)

390
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:07,548
(will certainly be an excellent)

391
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:08,747
(family partner.)

392
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:09,788
(And this)

393
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:10,828
(is also what I want)

394
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:11,987
(in my tired)

395
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:13,628
(midlife.)

396
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,467
I'm not a thief,

397
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:17,668
why am I hiding?

398
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:20,467
Chengyi, you are here.

399
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:21,267
Mom, I'll do it.

400
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,347
Alright, here.

401
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:23,548
Hurry up.

402
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:24,708
- I'll comb your hair.
- Sit.

403
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,508
I'll sit.

404
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:26,788
After you all tidy up,

405
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,508
eat something

406
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:28,948
and I'll take you to kindergarten.

407
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:30,988
I also have daughters,

408
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:33,027
but your dad handles the things

409
00:21:33,107 --> 00:21:35,067
like combing their hair.

410
00:21:35,347 --> 00:21:37,468
The hair I combed
is not presentable at all.

411
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,228
It's okay, I can handle this.

412
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:40,428
Where's Dad?

413
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,747
He went to buy breakfast.

414
00:21:42,988 --> 00:21:43,908
By the way, Chengyi.

415
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:45,388
I'll tell you some good news.

416
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:47,507
Youyou is going to get a job.

417
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:48,587
Really?

418
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,708
Right.

419
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:52,068
If we knew jumping

420
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:53,227
into the river works,

421
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:55,188
I'd kick him down earlier.

422
00:21:57,188 --> 00:21:58,188
You go ahead.

423
00:21:58,507 --> 00:21:59,707
I'll go wake Youyou up.

424
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:01,827
- Okay.
- She can't sleep in now.

425
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,067
Mom, you go ahead.

426
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:07,668
Youyou, I am coming in.

427
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:14,827
Dad.

428
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:15,988
Welcome back.

429
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:21,347
Come on, Yu'an, Yule.

430
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,747
Time for breakfast.

431
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:25,428
Youyou isn't in her room.

Mom.

447
00:24:15,228 --> 00:24:16,547
You came so early.

448
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:19,948
Yesterday, I soaked some soybeans.

449
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:21,028
When I got up,

450
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:22,188
I made soy milk,

451
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:23,507
some pancakes,

452
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,787
and tea eggs,

453
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:26,347
so I brought them over to you.

454
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:28,108
If I didn't come over,

455
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:29,868
you would order the takeout.

456
00:24:29,988 --> 00:24:31,747
Takeout is not healthy.

457
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,468
My grandson's health matters the most.

458
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:37,507
If your wife could get up earlier

459
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:38,987
and make breakfast for you,

460
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:39,707
I wouldn't need

461
00:24:39,787 --> 00:24:41,428
to run back and forth like this.

462
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:45,348
Why did you sleep on the sofa

463
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:46,427
in the living room?

464
00:24:46,507 --> 00:24:48,347
Can you sleep well?

465
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,267
Last night, I drank some alcohol

466
00:24:50,428 --> 00:24:52,027
and fell asleep.

467
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:53,668
Don't drink often.

468
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:56,067
It's fine.

469
00:24:56,188 --> 00:24:57,947
Xiaojiao, you're up.

470
00:24:58,027 --> 00:24:59,947
Look, I have already made breakfast.

471
00:25:00,027 --> 00:25:01,628
Come eat the breakfast.

472
00:25:04,547 --> 00:25:05,347
Hu Xiaojiao.

473
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,787
My mom is talking to you.

474
00:25:07,868 --> 00:25:09,787
Mom, please reimburse this.

475
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:11,708
What's this?

476
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:13,707
Qian Hao got caught
with a hooker last night,

477
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:15,468
and I paid a fine of 5,000 yuan.

478
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:16,948
That is to say,

479
00:25:17,028 --> 00:25:18,348
last night, your son

480
00:25:18,428 --> 00:25:19,428
found...

481
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:20,508
Shut up!

482
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:21,628
What are you doing?

483
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:22,549
W-What are you doing?

484
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:24,628
She is pregnant.

485
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:25,948
I'm okay, Mom.

486
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,787
Just transfer the money to me.

487
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:29,908
After all, this is

488
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,507
not a decent thing.

489
00:25:31,587 --> 00:25:32,109
People think

490
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:33,788
Qian Hao is living off a woman.

491
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:34,328
It's okay.

492
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:36,267
- I'm fine when you're here.
- Hao.

493
00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:37,948
My dear grandson.

494
00:25:41,027 --> 00:25:42,388
Are you doing this deliberately?

495
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:43,348
You are pregnant

496
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:45,908
with another man's child.
Stay out of my business.

497
00:25:45,988 --> 00:25:46,868
I've told you

498
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:47,589
that I just

499
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:48,908
can't do it

500
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:49,988
with you.

501
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:53,347
What? Want to strangle me again?

502
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:54,988
Come on.

503
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:56,667
Go ahead.

504
00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:58,467
If you don't, I'll look down on you.

505
00:25:58,547 --> 00:25:59,547
Strangle me.

506
00:26:13,787 --> 00:26:14,787
Are you scared?

507
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:16,827
Qian Hao.

508
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:18,908
I'm not afraid of you.

509
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:20,508
You think last night

510
00:26:20,588 --> 00:26:21,988
I begged for mercy from you?

511
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:24,948
You're ignoring the good days,

512
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:26,628
insisting on letting me suffer.

513
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:28,428
Then let's suffer together.

514
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:31,107
I told your mom that you went whoring.

515
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:32,388
Do you dare tell

516
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:34,148
your mom
that I'm not carrying your child?

517
00:26:34,747 --> 00:26:35,747
Do you dare?

518
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,267
Honey.

519
00:26:44,988 --> 00:26:46,827
You don't want a divorce, fine.

520
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:49,428
I don't want to leave you either.

521
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:50,908
I have liked you

522
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:52,307
for so many years.

523
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,547
But starting today,

524
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,188
if you treat me wrong once,

525
00:26:58,347 --> 00:27:00,188
I'll revenge you twice.

526
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:03,108
In our wedding vows,

527
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,188
we promised

528
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:06,188
to stay together till the end.

529
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:07,747
Just perfect.

530
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:09,148
Let's just rot to death

531
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,948
in this foul marriage.

532
00:27:12,988 --> 00:27:14,027
Get lost.

533
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:19,148
You lunatic.

534
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:21,107
Honey.

535
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,427
(Tianya, If a man wants to use marriage)

536
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:27,948
(to torture and take revenge on you,
it's not hard to solve.)

537
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,388
(Don't retreat)

538
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:30,587
(or show any cowardice.)

539
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:32,308
(Instead, be like a lion,)

540
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:33,388
(and attack him.)

541
00:28:33,868 --> 00:28:35,908
(He hurts you
with the sharp blade of feelings,)

542
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:37,227
(then you'd seize the blade)

543
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:38,708
(and stab him back.)

544
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:39,948
(In marriage,)

545
00:28:40,028 --> 00:28:42,148
(the brave always win.)

546
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:45,108
Oh, my!

547
00:28:45,188 --> 00:28:47,188
Are you crazy?

548
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:50,547
I just hit you, are you okay?

549
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,747
It hurts, right?

550
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,348
No worries, Mom. It doesn't hurt.

551
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:54,507
I'm fine.

552
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:58,988
Xiaojiao is pregnant,

553
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:00,829
but can't you

554
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,667
just bear it a bit?

555
00:29:02,747 --> 00:29:03,747
Mom.

556
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:06,188
Alright, you don't understand
the whole story.

557
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:07,307
Sorry, no more next time.

558
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:21,267
I'm back.

559
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:25,227
Xu Kaixin.

560
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,307
Stop there.

561
00:29:27,908 --> 00:29:28,908
Where did you go?

562
00:29:28,908 --> 00:29:30,828
A friend got sick,
and I went to the hospital.

563
00:29:30,908 --> 00:29:31,507
Go ahead.

564
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:32,587
Tell more lies.

565
00:29:34,988 --> 00:29:37,027
You stayed out all night,
with phone turning off.

566
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:38,028
Is this

567
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:39,547
how I taught you?

568
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:41,868
Lili. Lili.

569
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:43,308
I really went to the hospital.

570
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:43,947
I stayed there

571
00:29:44,027 --> 00:29:44,829
for the whole night.

572
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,347
And my phone ran out of battery.

573
00:29:46,428 --> 00:29:47,268
Besides Xiaoxiao,

574
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:48,747
what other friends do you have?

575
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:50,427
I'll call Xiaoxiao right now.

576
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:51,588
If you were with her,

577
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:52,747
then forget it.

578
00:29:53,188 --> 00:29:54,188
Stop!

579
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:55,547
Stand still.

580
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,068
Hello, Lili.

581
00:30:06,148 --> 00:30:07,108
Xiaoxiao.

582
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:08,548
Was Kaixin

583
00:30:08,628 --> 00:30:09,948
with you last night?

584
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:12,828
Of course not, Lili.

585
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:14,547
I was working overtime last night.

586
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:17,547
Oh my, Lili.

587
00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:18,747
Xu Kaixin didn't

588
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:19,947
come home all night?

589
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:20,629
You should

590
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:22,107
really educate her.

591
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:24,027
I knew it. Li Xiaoxiao,

592
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:25,148
just wait.

593
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:26,747
Lili.

594
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:27,629
The kids are here.

595
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:29,107
Show me some respect.

596
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:30,028
Respect?

597
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:31,948
It's something you earn it for yourself.

598
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:33,347
Respect?

599
00:30:34,547 --> 00:30:35,547
Today,

600
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:38,267
I have to discipline you well.

601
00:30:39,188 --> 00:30:40,187
Dami,

602
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:42,067
should we save Mom?

603
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:43,668
It's none of your business.

604
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:44,947
Lili is

605
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:46,267
the hidden boss of our family.

606
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:47,628
She doesn't lose her temper.

607
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,108
Now she does, don't mess with her.

608
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:50,548
Just pray for Mom.

609
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:51,667
You would act like this?

610
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:52,628
Help!

611
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,187
I'll break your legs.

612
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:54,988
Help!

613
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:55,908
Believe or not!

614
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:56,629
Wait, wait.

615
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:58,107
Wait, I have evidence.

616
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:02,308
Take a look.

617
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:04,107
The hospital registration slip.

618
00:31:07,428 --> 00:31:08,428
Xu Kaixin.

619
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:09,908
Do you think I'm blind?

620
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:11,547
This is a hotel room card.

621
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,016
(Registration slip)
Check it out.

622
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:27,747
Wait.

623
00:31:28,908 --> 00:31:29,629
Xu Kaixin,

624
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,347
you didn't come home all night?

625
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:34,107
Alright,

626
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:35,507
you're still capable.

627
00:31:35,587 --> 00:31:36,948
Well done.

628
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:57,868
Come on, have some.

629
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:13,708
I'm full.

630
00:32:15,027 --> 00:32:16,027
Qian Hao.

631
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,547
Come on, Xiaojiao.

632
00:32:23,827 --> 00:32:24,507
I'm full too.

633
00:32:24,587 --> 00:32:25,587
I'm going in first.

634
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:27,587
Xiaojiao, Xiaojiao.

635
00:32:27,668 --> 00:32:28,747
What's wrong?

636
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:32,148
Xiaojiao, don't be mad.

637
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:33,668
If you're mad,

638
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:35,347
the child you are carrying

639
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:37,468
won't be healthy.

640
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:39,908
I've already scolded him for you.

641
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:41,908
Besides,

642
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,027
it's no big deal.

643
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:45,028
Otherwise, the police

644
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:46,629
wouldn't have released him, right?

645
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:47,828
Mom, to be straightforward,

646
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:49,068
are you going to pay

647
00:32:49,148 --> 00:32:50,148
the fine of 5,000 yuan?

648
00:32:51,027 --> 00:32:52,107
I'm really pitiful.

649
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:53,747
My husband went whoring,

650
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,307
and I paid the fine for him.

651
00:32:56,787 --> 00:32:57,987
What if I'm in a bad mood,

652
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,067
this child...

653
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:01,267
Here.

654
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:02,668
I'll transfer the money.

655
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:04,027
Well,

656
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:07,747
I'll transfer 6,600 yuan, okay?

657
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:08,388
Okay.

658
00:33:08,468 --> 00:33:09,187
For good luck.

659
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:10,267
Here, done.

660
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:14,747
Received.

661
00:33:14,908 --> 00:33:15,588
It's done.

662
00:33:15,668 --> 00:33:16,267
Thank you, Mom.

663
00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:17,148
Don't be mad.

664
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:18,227
Don't be mad.

665
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:19,307
I'm going in first.

666
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:34,347
6,600 yuan is gone.

667
00:33:38,507 --> 00:33:39,668
(In adult world,)

668
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:41,307
(one of the cruel rules)

669
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:43,908
(is whether you had
a bad day or lucky day)

670
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,468
(yesterday,)

671
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:47,827
(when the next day comes,)

672
00:33:47,908 --> 00:33:49,827
(you must come back to the workplace)

673
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:53,067
(and keep working hard.)

674
00:33:54,747 --> 00:33:55,547
Mei,

675
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,467
here is the manufacturer's
information you want.

676
00:33:57,547 --> 00:33:58,667
- Take a look.
- Okay.

677
00:33:58,747 --> 00:33:59,667
Leave it here, thanks.

678
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:00,747
You're welcome.

679
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:35,587
Mr. Chen.

680
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:37,467
About the thing we discussed yesterday,

681
00:34:37,547 --> 00:34:38,229
do we need

682
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,468
to talk about the follow-up?

683
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,707
Calm down.

684
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:45,667
Yes, go ahead.

685
00:34:46,908 --> 00:34:48,187
Scolding...

686
00:34:48,748 --> 00:34:49,507
I can understand.

687
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,587
I understand.

688
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:51,667
Right.

689
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:56,107
If this happened to anyone,

690
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:58,908
he'd be uncomfortable.

691
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:15,828
Hello.

692
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:18,187
You're not at home?

693
00:35:19,308 --> 00:35:20,547
If you're home, open the door.

694
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:23,388
Alright, I'll go in myself.

695
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,736
(Manager's Office)

696
00:35:44,187 --> 00:35:44,748
Come in.

697
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:46,467
Mr. Qian, Mr. Xia

698
00:35:46,547 --> 00:35:47,547
approved the contract.

699
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:50,707
When did he approve it?

700
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:51,508
Today.

701
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:52,627
I called to urge them,

702
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:53,628
but they politely

703
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:54,828
told me it's approved.

704
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:56,348
And they'd send us the contract.

705
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:02,067
I got it, go get busy.

706
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:14,667
They already knew it

707
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:19,268
and treated me like a fool.

708
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:49,948
Xu Kaixin, you're really something.

709
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:51,067
Be honest,

710
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:51,828
who

711
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:52,908
took the initiative?

712
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:55,789
Can you

713
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:57,587
stop hitting my bottom?

714
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:58,428
My bottom

715
00:36:58,508 --> 00:36:59,868
has suffered too much.

716
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,948
Oh my, Xu Kaixin.

717
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:08,349
I got beaten

718
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:09,788
right after coming back.

719
00:37:09,868 --> 00:37:11,388
Lili just beat me

720
00:37:11,468 --> 00:37:12,188
with the umbrella

721
00:37:12,268 --> 00:37:13,189
recklessly.

722
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:14,507
In front of my kids!

723
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:16,268
I was so embarrassing.

724
00:37:16,788 --> 00:37:18,627
The last time
I got beaten was in high school.

725
00:37:18,707 --> 00:37:20,308
How does she get fiercer as she ages?

726
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:21,707
Wait, wait.

727
00:37:21,868 --> 00:37:23,027
Rewind back.

728
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,388
Between you and Mei Chengyi,

729
00:37:25,468 --> 00:37:27,027
nothing happened?

730
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:29,908
You stayed out all night,
and you told me nothing happened?

731
00:37:30,268 --> 00:37:31,547
This isn't your style.

732
00:37:33,107 --> 00:37:34,268
I see.

733
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:35,507
Mei Chengyi

734
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:37,388
is incompetent.

735
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,828
Not really.

736
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:40,707
I still don't know it yet.

737
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:42,507
Are you sure?

738
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,188
We were about to do that.

739
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:45,748
But he strained his back,

740
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:46,588
so we went

741
00:37:46,668 --> 00:37:48,107
to the hospital.

742
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,748
No matter how young he looks,

743
00:37:50,828 --> 00:37:51,828
it's still useless.

744
00:37:52,388 --> 00:37:53,547
That's true.

745
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,748
It didn't work out,

746
00:37:55,908 --> 00:37:56,868
but...

747
00:37:56,948 --> 00:37:57,789
Finish the sentence.

748
00:37:57,869 --> 00:37:59,428
I'm going...

749
00:38:00,107 --> 00:38:01,107
Go ahead.

750
00:38:01,308 --> 00:38:02,868
- Finish the sentence.
- Stop it.

751
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:04,908
Tell me about it.

752
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:07,268
He told me

753
00:38:08,107 --> 00:38:09,268
he wants to get married.

754
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:10,948
And then?

755
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:14,268
Get married?

756
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,428
Wait, Xu Kaixin.

757
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:19,227
Say it again. Get married?

758
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:22,468
Get married again?

759
00:38:23,227 --> 00:38:25,107
I haven't married once yet.

760
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:27,188
No way.

761
00:38:27,268 --> 00:38:28,468
Yes, it seems like

762
00:38:28,548 --> 00:38:29,507
I'm being impolite.

763
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:30,872
You're so impolite.

764

Why are you so calm?

772
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:41,507
What should I be?

773
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:42,748
This is not ordinary.
