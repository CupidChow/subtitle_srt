16
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,386
Your two daughters' birthdays.

Your ex-wife's memorial day.

18
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:42,225
Each of the daughters' favorite

19
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:44,106
colors, animals, cartoon characters,

20
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:44,986
favorite foods,

21
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:46,186
and allergenic foods.

22
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:47,225
By your standards,

23
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:48,386
you'll have to stay single

24
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:50,106
for the rest of your life.

25
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:51,065
That's too harsh.

26
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:52,466
I think

27
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:54,065
maybe you shouldn't find a wife.

28
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:55,785
Just find a robot instead.

29
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:57,385
Wait,

30
00:01:58,145 --> 00:01:59,065
I think

31
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:00,466
these questions are okay.

32
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:02,826
Since I'm getting remarried,

33
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:03,785
shouldn't being good

34
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:05,346
to my girls be the first priority?

35
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,186
I'll surely treat

36
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:06,945
my stepkids

37
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:07,986
by the same standards.

38
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:10,705
You'll be absolutely

39
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:11,785
impartial?

40
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:14,186
Won't you?

41
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:18,185
If you can't at least

42
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:19,465
be impartial to the kids,

43
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:20,785
why would you remarry?

44
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:22,385
Let's find common ground

45
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:23,665
and keep differences.

46
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:25,905
Being nice to each other's kids

47
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:26,585
will be

48
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:28,066
the common ground.

49
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:29,825
But you can't deny

50
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:30,745
that people favor

51
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:31,625
their own kids

52
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:32,746
to some extent.

53
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:34,546
If we can't be impartial,

54
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:36,146
why should we force ourselves?

55
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:37,546
We can just take care

56
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:38,785
of our own kids.

57
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:40,546
The kids will feel

58
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:41,346
that they have

59
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:43,146
a loving uncle or auntie.

60
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:44,785
Lower your standards

61
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:47,545
so that everyone gets along.

62
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:50,146
Fine.

63
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:52,385
Alright.

64
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:55,106
We don't share

65
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:56,346
anything in common.

66
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,545
Thankfully, it's fake.

67
00:02:58,026 --> 00:02:59,185
Forget it. Let's

68
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:00,346
call it a day.

69
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:01,745
Work hard.

70
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,386
Memorize everything, okay?

71
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:04,705
I'll arrange a meeting

72
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:05,705
with you

73
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,385
to do a mock test.

74
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:09,346
Check, please.

75
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,225
Should we split the bill?

76
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:13,146
It's on me.

77
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:14,385
Cool.

78
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:16,746
T-Thanks.

79
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:40,626
Honey, why are you...

80
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:42,145
Come upstairs with me.

81
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,025
Let me get out.

82
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:44,425
You know I love you, right?

83
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:45,465
You didn't come home.

84
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:46,226
I got worried.

85
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:46,905
That's why

86
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:47,946
I misspoke.

87
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:48,946
Uncle got me wrong.

88
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:50,266
Can you explain to him?

89
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:51,386
- Okay.
- I didn't mean that.

90
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,425
Easy, honey.

91
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:53,826
I can explain to my uncle.

92
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:54,985
He loves me the most.

93
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:56,625
Why are you so anxious?

94
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:57,666
You're the best.

95
00:03:57,746 --> 00:03:58,425
You're the best.

96
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,386
I'll explain to him.

97
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:00,266
He cares for me.

98
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:01,385
You're the best.

99
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:02,985
Let's go. Hurry.

100
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:07,225
Coming.

101
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:09,786
Hello, Uncle.

102
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,025
Uncle, I'm sorry.

103
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:11,985
He said that...

104
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:15,346
Isn't it Xiaojiao?

105
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:16,666
Yeah, it is.

106
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:18,025
Then what are you doing?

107
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:22,346
Auntie.

108
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:23,146
Auntie.

109
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,146
Qian Hao came up

110
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:25,706
to say hello just to be polite.

111
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:26,825
Why's my uncle so mean?

112
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:28,945
Come on, don't talk to Uncle like that.

113
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:31,146
Xiaojiao can talk to me

114
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:31,986
however she wants.

115
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,786
It's fine by me. I don't mind it.

116
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:35,865
Who do you think you are?

117
00:04:35,945 --> 00:04:36,865
Huh?

118
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,345
Now get lost.

119
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:39,346
If you keep

120
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:40,065
being so rude,

121
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:40,906
I will get angry.

122
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:41,546
E-Easy.

123
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:42,666
Qian Hao meant well.

124
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:43,546
We won't come again.

125
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:44,265
Xiaojiao.

126
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:45,986
You're right, Uncle.

127
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:47,586
I shouldn't have

128
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,745
looked after you.

129
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:49,945
You're so love-struck

130
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:52,145
just like your mom.

131
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,825
That's why you're bullied.

132
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,145
You can get lost, too.

133
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,305
Why did you bring up my mom?

134
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:58,865
Qian Hao meant well.

135
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:00,385
Auntie, put in a good word...

136
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,465
Don't be upset, honey.

137
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:07,226
So love-struck, seriously.

138
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,066
Right?

139
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:08,865
From now on,

140
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,345
I won't open the door

141
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:11,986
for either of them.

142
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:13,866
Don't be mad.

143
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:19,585
Let's go.

144
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:29,426
Come on, score.

145
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,625
(When I was in college,)

146
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,465
("Chungking Express" was beyond me.)

147
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:44,305
(The classic lines)

148
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,986
(about the expiration date)

149
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:47,546
(seemed a bit pretentious.)

150
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:49,945
(When I finally understood it,)

151
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:51,546
(it dawned on me)

152
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,265
(that I was no longer young.)

153
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:56,385
Good shot.

154
00:05:56,945 --> 00:05:57,746
(Yeah.)

155
00:05:58,226 --> 00:05:59,666
(Saury will expire.)

156
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:01,705
(Canned meat will expire.)

157
00:06:02,106 --> 00:06:03,746
(Even plastic wrap will expire.)

158
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:06,546
(How can youth not expire?)

159
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,426
(Without even a warning,)

160
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:11,226
(time suddenly accelerated.)

161
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:12,706
(Time had passed)

162
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,905
(before I could even realize it.)

163
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:18,786
Bro, want to join us?

164
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,265
Our guy twisted his ankle.

165
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:21,746
Come on, we're one guy short.

Senior, have some water.

192

Thanks.

00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:51,186
(I long forgot?)

196
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:55,146
Excuse me.

197
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,786
I have to take this.

198
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:58,385
Bye, senior.

199
00:07:59,066 --> 00:07:59,866
Bye.

200
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,265
Hello, Mr. Liu.

201
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,586
I'm almost done with the proposal.

202
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,986
I'll make some adjustments.

203
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:10,745
Listen.

204
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,466
I'll send it to you by tonight.

205
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:13,265
Okay?

206
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:15,705
Alright.

207
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:16,986
Alright.

208
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:17,986
Bye.

209
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:23,385
You leaving, bro?

210
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:24,426
We're one guy short.

211
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:25,466
Stay a bit.

212
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,226
I have to go.

213
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,466
Maybe next time.

214
00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:28,546
Alright, bye.

215
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:29,825
- Bye.
- Bye.

216
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,186
Let's continue.

217
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,466
(The midnight clock chime)

218
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:40,426
(dispels Cinderella's magic.)

219
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,665
(Meanwhile, a casual phone call)

220
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:44,985
(dispels my youthful self.)

221
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,865
(Men's so-called midlife crisis)

222
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:48,706
(probably)

223
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:50,825
(refers to the sudden realization)

224
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,186
(that youth)

225
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,066
(waved goodbye to them long ago.)

226
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:56,466
(They frantically reach out)

227
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:57,386
(to grab it)

228
00:08:58,026 --> 00:08:59,786
(and finally catch a brief moment)

229
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:02,025
(of the good old days.)

230
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:03,265
(Then they're surrounded)

231
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:05,146
(by boundless emptiness.)

232
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,625
Sit tight, I have something to say.

233
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:34,386
Go ahead.

234
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:36,386
Well...

235
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,625
You're in love?

236
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:42,465
What? Be serious.

237
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:50,186
The landlord couldn't find you.

238
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:51,945
He asked me

239
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,786
to tell you he's selling the property
of the cake shop.

240
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,345
You'll get three months' compensation.

241
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:01,106
Take it easy.

242
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:02,025
It's okay.

243
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:02,786
You know.

244
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:04,745
There are plenty of shops.

245
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:05,865
We'll find another place.

246
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:07,026
- Right?
- Are you serious?

247
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:09,225
Yeah.

248
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,386
This is amazing!

249
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:12,745
Wait.

250
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:13,986
Your shop is closing.

251
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:15,266
How is that a good thing?

252
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:17,386
Listen to me.

253
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:19,745
The rent is 5000 yuan per month.

254
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:21,346
The actual income

255
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:22,545
is 6000 yuan per month.

256
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,346
Online,

257
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:24,665
I can sell 8000 to 9000 yuan

258
00:10:24,745 --> 00:10:25,745
per month.

259
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,665
I've been longing to close the shop.

260
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:28,426
I was going to

261
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:29,986
wait until the rent expires

262
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:30,665
this year.

263
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:33,465
But he's offering to terminate the rent

264
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:35,186
with compensation to me.

265
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:36,985
Fifteen thousand!

266
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,025
Isn't it

267
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,465
a great deal for me?

268
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,945
Didn't I get incredibly lucky?

269
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:46,545
If that's how you see it,

270
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,786
it does make sense.

271
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:50,586
How about

272
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,266
we buy some lottery?

273
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:53,106
No, I have

274
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,225
no luck with windfall.

275
00:10:58,426 --> 00:10:59,625
I see.

276
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:02,945
Could it be that Mei Chengyi

277
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:03,985
brings me luck?

278
00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:08,465
You two met today, right?

279
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:09,945
Yeah, just now.

280
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:11,506
That's impressive.

281
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:13,265
Now I am

282
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,345
his contracted girlfriend.

283
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:17,546
I'm meeting his in-laws this weekend.

284
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:20,945
It's for show.

285
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:22,546
Very clever.

286
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:24,545
Although

287
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,426
we only agreed to do it for a week,

288
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:27,505
what if he is

289
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:28,785
impressed by my inner beauty

290
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:29,586
and insists

291
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,585
on marrying me?

292
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:32,666
Listen.

293
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:33,785
I felt

294
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:35,225
his biceps today.

295
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,066
He's the type who looks slim in clothes

296
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,386
but muscular without.

297
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:42,586
How can someone like him

298
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,346
stay single

299
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:44,706
and remain in the market

300
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:45,826
for so long?

301
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:46,505
This is

302
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:48,465
a humiliation to your professionalism.

303
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:49,625
How dare you!

304
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:51,306
I lost the client

305
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:52,386
all because of you!

306
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,625
You two hooked up

307
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:54,946
behind my back.

308
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:55,946
If you get remarried,

309
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:57,826
he must pay me an agency fee.

310
00:11:57,906 --> 00:11:58,905
Don't take advantage

311
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,225
of my man.

312
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:02,306
Xu Kaixin, you...

313
00:12:02,386 --> 00:12:03,426
Why did I become friends

314
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,865
with a woman
who abandons friends for romance?

315
00:12:06,585 --> 00:12:08,345
Because we're birds of a feather.

316
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,786
Fifteen thousand!

317
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,585
Honey, are you okay?

318
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:15,706
Stop bothering me.

319
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:16,865
Your entire family

320
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,466
ganged up to mess with me.

321
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:19,706
How did I mess with you?

322
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:20,786
Are you serious?

323
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:22,665
Were you helping me?

324
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,106
You know your uncle has control

325
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:25,385
over my new project.

326
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:26,226
Shouldn't you

327
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:26,986
appease him

328
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:28,066
to help me?

329
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,665
But you added fuel to the fire.

330
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:30,826
What am I supposed to do?

331
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:32,265
I'll be doomed next week.

332
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:32,865
I'm finished.

333
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:33,985
I-I just can't watch him

334
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,186
speak to you like that.

335
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:36,745
He was rude, so I got angry.

336
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,225
That's why I argued with him.

337
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,586
I'm on your side.

338
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,426
Why are you mad at me?

339
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,306
It's over?

340
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:46,825
- It's over.
- No, it's not.

341
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:48,306
Listen.

342
00:12:48,386 --> 00:12:49,946
My uncle cares for me the most.

343
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,146
I'll talk to him now.

344
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,026
Everything will be fine.

345
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,536
(Xiaojiao)

346
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:09,146
I'll call my auntie.

347
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:10,985
It's over.

348
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,865
Hello, Auntie, you...

349
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:26,745
You traitor.

350
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:28,386
Your uncle is mad at you.

351
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:29,426
Stop calling.

352
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:34,146
She hung up.

353
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:37,546
It's over! It's over!

354
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,625
No, it's fine.

355
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:43,585
My uncle cares for me the most.

356
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,666
I...

357
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,785
Hu Xiaojiao is a smart girl.

358
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:50,785
How did Qian Hao

359
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:52,225
gain control over her?

360
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,745
Qian Hao abandoned his family
for Xiaojiao

361
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:56,945
back then.

362
00:13:57,585 --> 00:13:59,306
He might also

363
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:00,826
betray Xiaojiao

364
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,146
and date someone else.

365
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:08,026
That would be good news.

366
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:13,585
What do you mean?

367
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,306
Qian Hao

368
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:16,945
had a car accident abroad, right?

369
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,066
Xiaojiao asked me to find him

370
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:20,745
a doctor right here.

371
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:23,225
I spoke with that doctor the other day.

372
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:26,745
Is something wrong?

373
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,945
His sexual function
is severely impaired.

374
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:32,386
He may remain like this forever.

375
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:34,225
What...

376
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,945
Does Xiaojiao know?

377
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,585
I'm her uncle.

378
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:42,345
How can I ask her that?

379
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:47,026
She deserves it.

380
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:49,386
Don't be so mean.

381
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:51,625
Back then,

382
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,745
Xiaojiao insisted on cheating

383
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:55,585
with her bestie's husband.

384
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,865
T-That Xu Kaixin

385
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,066
visited us often

386
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:00,385
when she was in college.

387
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:01,865
I quite liked her.

388
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:05,346
And what's her name again?

389
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:06,865
Li... Li Xiaoxiao.

390
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:07,785
Yeah.

391
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,585
The three of them were so close.

392
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:11,706
But Xiaojiao had to cheat with

393
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:12,945
Xu Kaixin's husband.

394
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:14,826
I was totally against it.

395
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:16,666
You accused me of sounding harsh.

396
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,785
She threatened to kill herself

397
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:20,986
and wouldn't eat.

398
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,066
What could we do?

399
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:24,225
Forget it.

400
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:25,386
It's all in the past.

401
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:27,146
Let's not bring it up.

402
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:29,945
The problem is what to do right now.

403
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,865
What can we do?

404
00:15:33,105 --> 00:15:35,266
You reap what you sow.

405
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:36,946
She'll deal with

406
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:38,225
the man she deserves.

407
00:15:38,786 --> 00:15:39,585
Look at you.

408
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:41,145
You don't feel sorry

409
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:42,226
just because

410
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:43,585
she's not your daughter.

411
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:45,466
You're right.

412
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,025
If she were my daughter,

413
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:47,745
I would have

414
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:49,225
broken her leg three years ago.

415
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,705
Mom, I'm back.

416
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,465
You fell asleep?

417
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,426
Mom.

418
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:15,225
Mom.

419
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:17,666
Mom.

420
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:18,905
Mom.

421
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:20,025
Mom, are you okay?

422
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,985
Mom.

423
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:24,066
Mom.

424
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:25,145
Trash can.

425
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:25,785
Hurry.

426
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:26,426
Mom.

427
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:27,986
- Here, Mom.
- Here.

428
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:28,865
Here, Mom.

429
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:31,586
Alright.

430
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,265
It's okay.

431
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:33,066
It's okay.

432
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:38,226
I'm not disgusted by Mom.

433
00:16:38,306 --> 00:16:39,745
It's just instinctive.

434
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:42,306
I-I'll get her a glass of water.

435
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,506
Are you okay?

436
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:47,385
I don't know what happened.

437
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:47,986
Maybe

438
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:50,506
the medicine is too strong.

439
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:52,985
It makes me feel terrible.

440
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,266
You scared me to death.

441
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,945
Mom, have some water.

442
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:56,905
Come on.

443
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:58,505
Have some water.

444
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:59,466
Help me sit up.

445
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:00,306
Come on.

446
00:17:03,745 --> 00:17:04,865
Have some water.

447
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:09,546
It's okay.

448
00:17:09,665 --> 00:17:11,466
How about you take care of Mom?

449
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:12,986
I-I'll go to our room.

450
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:14,345
Go ahead.

451
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:16,865
Mom, call me if you need anything.

452
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:56,025
You scared me to death.

453
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:56,905
Son.

454
00:17:57,665 --> 00:17:58,785
People are

455
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:00,105
really different.

456
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:01,785
Do you remember

457
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:02,905
when I got gastroenteritis

458
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,706
and threw up?

459
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:07,706
Xu Kaixin ran back and forth

460
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,665
to clean up after me

461
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:12,266
and took great care of me.

462
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:13,986
But look at her.

463
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,266
Her despise is written

464
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:19,266
all over her face.

465
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,865
I've been thinking.

466
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:27,066
How did we end up like this?

467
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:29,105
Back when you were with Xu Kaixin,

468
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:31,386
we were so happy and lively.

469
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:32,865
Everything was great.

470
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,466
Why did everything get worse

471
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,186
after you married Hu Xiaojiao?

472
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,266
Look.

473
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:40,746
You had a car accident and I got sick.

474
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:42,746
You can't have kids now.

475
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:43,986
I'm thinking about

476
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:46,185
consulting a feng shui master.

477
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:49,665
Mom, you...

478
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:51,585
I know you don't get along with her.

479
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:53,466
But after all, you and Dad

480
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:55,105
have college degrees.

481
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:57,105
How can you believe in this stuff?

482
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,466
I grew fond of it as I aged.

483
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:00,946
Come on,

484
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:02,626
don't add to my troubles, Mom.

485
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,546
I have too much going on lately.

486
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:05,905
Fine.

487
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:07,466
Alright, lie down.

488
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,666
Lie down.

489
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:09,706
Take a rest.

490
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:12,706
Lie down.

491
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:13,426
I'll get you

492
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:14,786
a blanket.

(Xu Kaixin, get it straight.)

(Things are)

500
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:51,946
(three years ago.)

501
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:52,825
(You got this.)

502
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:57,546

(Because everyone is greedy.)

(What we can't get, what we've lost,)

(The older we get,)

00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:26,785
(it seems that)

00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:28,146
(we regain the ability)

(to find happiness.)

529
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:30,786
(After all,)

530
00:21:30,986 --> 00:21:31,906
(only the middle-aged)

531
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,986
(who are barely getting by like us)

532
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:36,145
(are struggling to be happy every day.)

533
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:37,386
(So,)

534
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,585
(as I said before,)

535
00:21:38,825 --> 00:21:40,746
("Be happy, Xu Kaixin.")

536
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:49,345
The medicine my mom's taking

537
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:50,745
has severe side effects.

538
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:52,546
She threw up again last night.

539
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:53,345
Could you

540
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:54,426
prescribe her something

541
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:55,906
with less severe

542
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:57,066
side effects?

543
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:00,466
According to the scan,

544
00:22:00,546 --> 00:22:02,506
the tumor has expanded again.

545
00:22:04,665 --> 00:22:05,305
But...

546
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:06,065
Didn't the last

547
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:06,825
chemotherapy

548
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:08,066
work well on her?

549
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:10,425
It was only temporary.

550
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:11,905
It's not a cure.

551
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:13,425
Given the situation,

552
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,706
she has to do it again.

553
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,825
However, according to the ECG,

554
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:19,466
your mother's heart

555
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:21,345
is not functioning well.

556
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:22,345
There's risk.

557
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:23,626
Probably

558
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:25,665
a heart failure.

559
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:28,825
So, be mentally prepared.

560
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,585
P-Please help her.

561
00:22:32,665 --> 00:22:33,385
Okay?

562
00:22:34,506 --> 00:22:35,386
Isn't there

563
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:36,386
immunotherapy

564
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:37,946
or experimental drugs?

565
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:39,226
Try those out.

566
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:40,745
I have money, okay?

567
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:42,345
I just want to save my mom.

568
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,306
Money makes the world go round.

569
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:47,905
But unfortunately,

570
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:49,585
it can't necessarily

571
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:51,425
save everyone from serious diseases.

572
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:54,226
You should make her
stick to the treatment.

573
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,105
On the other hand,

574
00:22:55,185 --> 00:22:56,025
see if your mother

575
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:58,026
has a bucket list.

576
00:22:58,145 --> 00:23:00,226
Take her on a trip or something.

577
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:01,145
Enough, doctor.

578
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:02,345
Just tell me

579
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:03,706
how much time she has left.

580
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:07,946
A year or two, I'd say.

581
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:24,426
(See if your mother)

582
00:23:24,506 --> 00:23:26,345
(has a bucket list.)

583
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:28,706
(Take her on a trip or something.)

584
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:35,585
(Just tell me)

585
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,946
(how much time she has left.)

586
00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:40,425
(A year or two, I'd say.)

587
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:44,946
Mom.

588
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:49,345
How did it go?

589
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,746
It went well. All good.

590
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:53,066
They gave you the wrong medicine.

591
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,746
That's why you felt bad.

592
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:56,226
The last chemotherapy

593
00:23:56,306 --> 00:23:57,905
worked particularly well.

594
00:23:58,026 --> 00:23:59,226
Let's do it again

595
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:00,065
to defeat

596
00:24:00,145 --> 00:24:00,984
the disease.

597
00:24:01,176 --> 00:24:01,986
I have to

598
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:04,306
do it again?

599
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:08,425
I almost died last time.

600
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:14,105
I know it hurts.

601
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:16,665
But you're trying to get cured.

602
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:19,425
It puts me at ease

603
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:22,665
if you do it again.

604
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:29,746
Listen, I promise

605
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:31,905
I'll bring your grandson home.

606
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:34,025
Okay?

607
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,665
I will do it.

608
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:37,946
Good.

609
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:39,665
You'll stay healthy

610
00:24:40,026 --> 00:24:41,226
and wait for your grandson.

611
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:46,305
He said I'm doing well, right?

612
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:47,266
Of course.

613
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:48,506
Alright.

614
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,466
(Live broadcast)
Pretty rice dumplings are all the same.

615
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,626
But the interesting ones
are rare to find.

616
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:09,906
In that case,

617
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:11,345
you're one of a kind.

618
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:12,266
(Getting addicted)
Hello, Ms. Li.

619
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,466
(Dumplings)
Add some gift boxes.

620
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,146
Fantastic.

621
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:15,186
More viewers coming.

622
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:15,866
How is it?

623
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:17,185
- How is it?
- Look.

624
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:18,065
Sales reached

625
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:19,466
263,000 yuan.

626
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:20,226
We made it.

627
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,425
Excellent.

628
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:24,706
Alright, thank you, Zhou.

629
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:28,706
Ms. Li.

630
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:31,306
- Ms. Li.
- How did it go?

631
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,785
The preliminary data is great.

632
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,745
The battle is coming.

633
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,506
Alright, let's cut to the chase.

634
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:37,785
Three, two, one.

635
00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:38,665
Not bad.

636
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:40,066
Attach the link.

637
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:42,226
Already exceeding the target.

638
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:44,665
Good, keep it up.

639
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:46,626
We reached 263,000 yuan.

640
00:25:46,706 --> 00:25:47,665
Good, keep it up.

641
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,066
Mei.

642
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:55,306
Today is Friday.

643
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:56,146
We've been

644
00:25:56,226 --> 00:25:57,226
working so hard.

645
00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:58,625
Let's have a drink.

646
00:25:59,506 --> 00:26:00,706
I'm exhausted.

647
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:03,226
Mei won't drink with you.

648
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:04,825
He has kids to look after.

649
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:05,866
Alright, go ahead.

650
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:06,506
I'll pass.

651
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:08,345
Sure.

652
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,625
Wait, what day is it today?

653
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:11,425
Friday.

654
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,746
Any plans?

655
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:18,706
Nothing, carry on.

656
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:41,834
(Mei Chengyi)

657
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:44,986
(Are you free tonight?)

658
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:46,505
(Shall we have dinner)

659
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:47,385
(and rehearse?)

660
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:50,506
(Xu Kaixin: Okay.
I thought you forgot about it.)

661
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:52,585
(But I'm a bit busy today.)

662
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:53,666
(Can you come over?)

663
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:54,265
(There is)

664
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:55,585
(a nice grill place here.)

665
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:56,466
(Dinner's on me.)

666
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:59,506
(Copy that. See you at 6:00 PM.)

667
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:03,466
(Youyou, I asked Xu Kaixin out)

668
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:04,825
(to rehearse this evening)

669
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,746
(so that we get the story right.)

670
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:08,745
(Could you please look after)

671
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:10,425
(Yu'an and Yule with your parents?)

672
00:27:11,786 --> 00:27:12,785
(YOYO: Rest assured.)

673
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,666
(My parents went out for groceries,)

674
00:27:14,746 --> 00:27:16,305
(probably preparing for tomorrow.)

675
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,466
(I'll keep you updated.)

676
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:42,825
We've been

677
00:27:42,905 --> 00:27:44,266
shopping for almost an hour.

678
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,585
You haven't bought anything

679
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,906
except for green onions.

680
00:27:47,986 --> 00:27:49,706
Who hosts guests like this?

681
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:51,746
Tell you what.

682
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:54,345
I'm already overly nice to her.

683
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:56,665
Our son-in-law's girlfriend

684
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:58,785
is our daughter's rival in love.

685
00:27:58,865 --> 00:27:59,746
You know?

686
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:02,026
We know she's an enemy

687
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:04,185
and still have to treat her to a meal.

688
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:06,266
How can I be happy about it?

689
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:07,865
Go home then.

690
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:09,345
We have some vegetables.

691
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:10,825
I'll cook some shredded potatoes

692
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:12,026
and make do with it.

693
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:14,145
Isn't it too embarrassing?

694
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,746
You know it's embarrassing?

695
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,545
Why did you invite her over

696
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:19,865
for dinner then?

697
00:28:21,306 --> 00:28:22,706
You're not happy about it.

698
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,185
And you think I am?

699
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:25,585
You don't have it.

700
00:28:25,665 --> 00:28:27,466
- So don't...
- Don't look for trouble.

701
00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:28,546
I know.

702
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,825
You old fool.

703
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,345
Are you going through menopause?

704
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:32,545
I'm in puberty.

705
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:33,545
Stop being annoying.

706
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:34,665
I'm warning you.

707
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:36,505
Treat her to a proper meal.

708
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:37,186
Or just

709
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:37,946
call it off

710
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,105
and save us the trouble.

711
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:40,105
Get groceries.

712
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,546
Otherwise, I'm leaving.

713
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:45,145
Fine.

714
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:48,266
I'll make her overeat herself.

715
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:06,825
What brings you here?

716
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:08,986
I heard your shop is here.

717
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:09,906
I'm passing by

718
00:29:09,986 --> 00:29:11,345
to bring the kids some fruit.

719
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:13,026
What do you want?

720
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:15,065
You are not welcome here.

721
00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:15,706
Get out!

722
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:16,946
I brought some fruit.

723
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:18,266
Get him out.

724
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:19,265
What?

725
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:20,745
Calm down.

726
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,226
You forgot what Dami said?

727
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:24,466
But this guy has caused us

728
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:25,986
so much trouble.

729
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,425
I just hate him so much.

730
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:29,425
See the big picture.

731
00:29:29,786 --> 00:29:30,665
Think about it.

732
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:32,226
Didn't we get loaded

733
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:33,226
after Qian Hao

734
00:29:33,345 --> 00:29:34,665
and his mom showed up?

735
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,506
What's that look?

736
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:41,345
What you said

737
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,986
finally convinced me that

738
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:43,906
you no longer

739
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:45,345
have feelings for him.

740
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:46,625
Isn't that obvious?

741
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:48,226
Compose yourself.

742
00:29:48,506 --> 00:29:49,825
Watch how I welcome

743
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:51,026
our god of wealth.

744
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,105
What do you want?

745
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:57,746
Are you moving?

746
00:29:58,425 --> 00:29:59,865
The store needs a renovation.

747
00:30:01,306 --> 00:30:02,546
Let me buy you a drink

748
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:03,865
and talk a bit.

749
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:06,466
Okay, give me a second.

750
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:08,546
Alright, I'll wait outside.

751
00:30:08,905 --> 00:30:09,706
Okay.

752
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:18,145
One Blue Mountain for me.

753
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:19,986
One mocha for this lady.

754
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:20,786
Double sugar.

755
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:23,105
- Okay.
- I remember you like sweet things.

756
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:24,905
Single sugar, please.

757
00:30:25,226 --> 00:30:25,786
Okay.

758
00:30:26,105 --> 00:30:26,906
Good memory.

759
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:27,906
But I don't want to

760
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,105
gain weight at this age.

761
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:31,105
Make it single.

762
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:32,905
Single sugar. Okay. Just a second.

763
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:36,986
Alright.

764
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:38,065
I thought

765
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:40,145
you'd imitate the characters in TV shows

766
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:40,986
and tell me,

767
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:42,505
"I don't drink it anymore.

768
00:30:42,585 --> 00:30:44,065
Nobody stays the same."

769
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:44,905
You know.

770
00:30:53,026 --> 00:30:53,865
Four years.

771
00:30:54,746 --> 00:30:55,986
It's been four years

772
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,385
since we last sat together

773
00:30:58,105 --> 00:30:59,265
for a peaceful

774
00:30:59,345 --> 00:31:00,105
chit-chat.

775
00:31:01,746 --> 00:31:05,066
You've changed. You look prettier

776
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:06,946
and more confident.

777
00:31:08,546 --> 00:31:09,506
Thank you.

778
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:11,186
But I think

779
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:12,546
you can do even better.

780
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:14,426
After all, it's tiring

781
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,226
and stressful

782
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,865
to raise two kids alone.

783
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:17,706
Am I right?

784
00:31:18,865 --> 00:31:20,386
Moreover, it hinders you

785
00:31:20,466 --> 00:31:21,865
from finding a new partner.

786
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:24,265
Not many men

787
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:25,226
can accept

788
00:31:25,306 --> 00:31:27,185
a woman with two kids.

789
00:31:28,145 --> 00:31:28,986
So,

790
00:31:29,185 --> 00:31:30,066
I was thinking...

791
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,425
(Mei Chengyi: I'm done now.)

792
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,905
(I'll meet you there, okay?)

793
00:31:42,636 --> 00:31:48,440
(Xu Kaixin: Jiang City Legendary Cafe)

794
00:31:48,905 --> 00:31:49,825
(Do me a favor.)

795
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:52,625
(What is it?)

796
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:55,585
(Pretend to be my date.)

797
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,105
(I'll reciprocate tomorrow.)

798
00:31:57,185 --> 00:31:58,825
(Then we're even.)

799
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:03,145
(Stop beating around the bush.)

800
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:09,185
A-Are you busy?

801
00:32:09,986 --> 00:32:10,625
Just a second.

802
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:16,905
Thank you.

803
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:18,266
I got it.

804
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:20,865
Thank you.

805
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:23,426
(My ex)

806
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:24,706
(is gaslighting me,)

807
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:25,745
(saying that it's hard)

808
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:26,865
(for me to find a date.)

809
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:30,506
(Does it count as gaslighting?)

810
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:32,946
(He is being honest
and stating the facts.)

811
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,025
(In that case,)

812
00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:35,706
(let me think)

813
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:36,986
(about what to do tomorrow.)

814
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:40,306
(He's gaslighting you.)

815
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,905
(Gold shines wherever it is.)

816
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:43,306
(Nothing can stop it.)

817
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:45,385
(Cut the yap. Will you help me?)

818
00:32:47,986 --> 00:32:48,546
(Yeah.)

819
00:32:52,946 --> 00:32:54,146
Who are you texting?

820
00:32:54,226 --> 00:32:55,025
Your boyfriend?

821
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:55,825
Yeah.

822
00:32:58,306 --> 00:32:59,025
(My boyfriend,)

823
00:32:59,105 --> 00:32:59,785
(please bring)

824
00:32:59,865 --> 00:33:00,665
(a bouquet.)

825
00:33:00,986 --> 00:33:01,745
(Make it pretty.)

826
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:03,466
(I like lilies and baby's breath.)

827
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:05,266
(I'll pay for it, okay?)

828
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:09,665
What is all this?

829
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:13,585
She's so high-maintenance.

830
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,306
Right, what were you saying?

831
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,786
I was saying that your boyfriend

832
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:23,345
may be able to accept

833
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:24,986
that you have two kids, right?

834
00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:26,305
But his family

835
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:27,145
may not

836
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,746
be able to accept it.

837
00:33:29,546 --> 00:33:30,426
Aren't you having

838
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:32,506
a problem with the cake shop now?

839
00:33:32,946 --> 00:33:34,585
You'll have to address

840
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:35,746
some financial issues.

841
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:37,186
So I was thinking

842
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,265
maybe I can

843
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:39,506
share your burden.

844
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:41,706
We can discuss

845
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,105
the custody again.

846
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:51,665
W-What's wrong?

847
00:33:52,786 --> 00:33:54,506
Is there something on my face?

848
00:33:57,546 --> 00:33:58,745
How did you become

849
00:33:58,825 --> 00:33:59,865
even more shameless?

850
00:34:04,105 --> 00:34:05,546
Xu Kaixin, you've changed.

851
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:08,065
You used to be very considerate.

852
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,266
Y-You wouldn't say something

853
00:34:10,346 --> 00:34:12,066
so inappropriate.

854
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:14,026
Excuse me.

855
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:15,265
Yes, ma'am.

856
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:17,346
May I have some hot water?

857
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:18,585
Okay, ma'am.

858
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:20,266
Boiling hot, please.

859
00:34:20,346 --> 00:34:20,866
Okay.

860
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:26,866
Why are you drinking hot water

861
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,346
on such a hot day?

862
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:29,665
What are you trying to do?

863
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:31,145
We're in public.

864
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:33,185
D-Don't do anything reckless.

865
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:35,105
What can I do?

866
00:34:35,585 --> 00:34:36,906
I want something warm to drink

867
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:38,265
because it's chilly.

868
00:34:52,026 --> 00:34:53,265
Sir, your flowers are ready.

869
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:54,665
Just a second.

870
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:56,145
Can you hold it for me?

871
00:35:11,466 --> 00:35:12,305
(Is it fine?)

872
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:16,185
(Too small. Add a few more flowers.)

873
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:17,426
(Don't be so stingy.)

874
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:21,866
Well,

875
00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:23,546
could you add five more?

876
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:25,105
Five more?

877
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:26,185
Just a second.

878
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:27,185
Okay, thank you.

879
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:32,665
If you're free,

880
00:35:32,745 --> 00:35:35,866
let's discuss custody.

881
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:39,506
Oh, right.

882
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:41,786
Didn't you come to talk about

883
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:43,506
the custody of Xiaomi?

884
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:45,986
No...

885
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:46,585
Not really.

886
00:35:46,665 --> 00:35:48,665
It's not entirely like that.

887
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:50,946
It's just that Dami

888
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:52,225
is a grown girl.

889
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:53,065
She must be

890
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:54,866
deeply bonded with you, right?

891
00:35:55,026 --> 00:35:55,906
It's easier for her

892
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:57,185
to stay with her mother.

893
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:58,665
Xiaomi is still young,

894
00:35:58,745 --> 00:35:59,866
and he is a boy.

895
00:35:59,946 --> 00:36:01,266
He'll be more manly

896
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:03,505
if he's raised by his father.

897
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:04,585
And rest assured.

898
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:05,986
I'll pay all the child support

899
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:06,946
in one lump sum

900
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:08,386
to cover what I missed

901
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,065
in previous years.

902
00:36:10,145 --> 00:36:12,185
What do you think?

903
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:15,946
There you go.

904
00:36:16,785 --> 00:36:18,105
Hold it again, please.

905
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:35,665
(Good. When will you arrive?)

906
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:42,386
Kaixin.

907
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:45,266
I have let you down

908
00:36:45,346 --> 00:36:46,866
in the past few years.

909
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:48,585
(The flower shop is next to the cafe.)

910
00:36:48,856 --> 00:36:49,545
(Be right here.)

911
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,866
But you must allow me to grow up.

912
00:36:52,386 --> 00:36:55,185
I genuinely feel for you now.

913
00:36:56,585 --> 00:36:58,305
Raising two kids on your own

914
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:00,866
is way too challenging.

915
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,585
Here's what I think.

916
00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:03,386
Although we are

917
00:37:03,466 --> 00:37:05,505
no longer in a marital relationship,

918
00:37:05,585 --> 00:37:07,426
you're the mother of my kids.

919
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:08,025
This is

920
00:37:08,105 --> 00:37:09,785
something unchangeable.

921
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,346
I would like you

922
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:12,545
to give me

923
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,466
a chance

924
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:17,105
to share your burden

925
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:18,906
of raising the kids.

926
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:23,185
That is

927
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,266
the most reasonable and pleasant thing

928
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:26,705
I've heard up to now.

929
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:28,826
How about this?

930
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:31,105
Let's settle the child support

931
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:33,265
you owe me first.

932
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,665
Show me

933
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:35,746
that you will genuinely

934
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:36,906
take care of the kids.

935
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:38,705
Then we can talk.

936
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:42,906
I've been paying
substantial child support these days.

937
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:44,105
You mean

938
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:46,105
Dami's tutoring class?

939
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:48,546
Yeah, my mom also paid a lot.

940
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:52,705
Let's call it even

941
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:54,546
on Dami's tutoring fees

942
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:55,946
this year.

943
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:58,265
I'll do you a favor

944
00:37:59,026 --> 00:37:59,906
and take the money

945
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,065
your mom offered

946
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,986
as child support.

947
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,386
But the biggest issue between us

948
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:08,185
lies in that apartment.

949
00:38:10,386 --> 00:38:11,585
You know what you did

950
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:12,665
to get the apartment

951
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:14,105
registered under your name.

952
00:38:17,265 --> 00:38:18,466
The apartment in Jiang City

953
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,185
is about 30,000 yuan per square meter.

954
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:23,065
Our apartment
is about 130 square meters.

955
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:25,305
It's worth about four million yuan.

956
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,705
The law allows reducing or eliminating

957
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:28,826
the at-fault party's

958
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,705
share of marital assets.

959
00:38:30,946 --> 00:38:32,185
But for our kids' sake,

960
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:33,426
you can keep half of it.

961
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:34,786
You can either

962
00:38:34,866 --> 00:38:35,786
sell the apartment

963
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:36,986
and split the money with me.

964
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:38,466
Or, you can give me two million,

965
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:40,066
which is the market price.

966
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:42,665
Let's settle

967
00:38:42,745 --> 00:38:44,185
the issue before discussing

968
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:45,466
other matters.

969
00:38:45,546 --> 00:38:46,305
What do you think?

970
00:38:48,946 --> 00:38:49,505
Xu Kaixin.

971
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:51,066
You've changed so much.

972
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,185
How did you become like this?

973
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:54,546
You are scary.

974
00:38:54,946 --> 00:38:56,866
How have I changed?

975
00:38:57,265 --> 00:38:57,786
Come on,

976
00:38:57,866 --> 00:38:58,585
how did you

977
00:38:58,665 --> 00:38:59,946
become so materialistic

978
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:00,866
and calculative?

979
00:39:00,946 --> 00:39:03,145
D-Do you even hear yourself?

980
00:39:03,346 --> 00:39:04,946
We're past the apartment issue.

981
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:06,786
We're discussing the future of our kids.

982
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:08,866
How can you mix these two

983
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:09,906
unrelated things?

984
00:39:10,506 --> 00:39:12,145
How can you...?

985
00:39:13,506 --> 00:39:14,705
Something that benefits you

986
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,185
is considered related.

987
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:17,826
Things that don't benefit you

988
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:19,665
are considered unrelated.

989
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:21,025
You still think

990
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:22,305
I'm the fool I was before?

991
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:24,705
Anyway, I don't know

992
00:39:24,785 --> 00:39:26,065
which one of you two

993
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:27,346
is infertile.

994
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:29,665
Your mom is sick.
She wants her grandson.

995
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:30,745
You are anxious.

996
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:32,266
So you ask for Xiaomi's custody

997
00:39:32,346 --> 00:39:33,866
in the name of helping me.

998
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:35,466
How can anyone

999
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:36,785
be so hypocritical?

1000
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:38,545
Tell me.

1001
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:39,826
Let's clear things up.

1002
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:40,426
Neither...

1003
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:41,946
Neither of us is infertile, okay?

1004
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:42,946
If I'm infertile,

1005
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:44,665
how did you give birth to our kids?

1006
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:46,346
Xiaojiao also did a check-up.

1007
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,105
I can show you the report.

1008
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:48,946
She's fertile.

1009
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:50,185
It's only natural for my mom

1010
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:51,306
to want her grandson.

1011
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:52,545
How can you be so petty

1012
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,625
and unfair?

1013
00:39:56,346 --> 00:39:57,145
Hey, there.

1014
00:39:57,386 --> 00:39:58,265
I'm here.

1015
00:39:59,986 --> 00:40:00,746
I'm not going to

1016
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:01,705
waste my time on you.

1017
00:40:01,785 --> 00:40:04,185
When we settle the property issue,

1018
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:05,506
we'll talk about custody.

1019
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:06,705
Wait, you...

1020
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:08,665
You're selling our kid, you know that?

1021
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:12,105
When did I say

1022
00:40:12,185 --> 00:40:13,746
that you'd get the custody

1023
00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:15,585
once you gave me
my share of the property?

1024
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:17,946
You're really something now.

1025
00:40:18,946 --> 00:40:20,105
I learned from you.

1026
00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:27,386
This is for you.

1027
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:28,826
Let's go.

1028
00:40:57,946 --> 00:40:59,065
What are you doing?

1029
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:00,866
My ex-husband is still watching.

1030
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:02,426
Don't act like you're

1031
00:41:02,506 --> 00:41:03,505
upholding chastity.

1032
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:05,105
Or I'll kiss you again.

1033
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:05,906
Why are you

1034
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:07,265
acting like a hooligan?

1035
00:41:07,386 --> 00:41:08,025
No wonder

1036
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:08,906
he can't stand you.

1037
00:41:08,986 --> 00:41:09,866
Give me a break.

1038
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:11,665
He was the one who cheated, not me.

1039
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:13,906
Didn't we agree to act like

1040
00:41:14,066 --> 00:41:15,466
a couple for two days?

1041
00:41:15,546 --> 00:41:17,346
What's wrong with acting intimate?

1042
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:20,025
Look at you,

1043
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:21,266
pulling a long face.

1044
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,185
You'd better behave.

1045
00:41:22,265 --> 00:41:23,705
Or I'll go for your lips.

1046
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:25,105
Come on, ma'am.

1047
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:26,585
The glass of my car is tinted.

1048
00:41:26,665 --> 00:41:28,105
He can't see inside.

1049
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:34,745
Alright then.

1050
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,785
Let's go.

1051
00:41:36,986 --> 00:41:38,866
Let's go for dinner, baby.

1052
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:41,426
He can't hear you.

1053
00:41:41,506 --> 00:41:42,866
Could you please be normal?

1054
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:44,786
I'm just being a good actress.

1055
00:41:44,866 --> 00:41:46,105
I got into my role fast.

1056
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,746
S-So...

1057
00:41:47,826 --> 00:41:48,665
Should I...

1058
00:41:48,745 --> 00:41:49,705
also call you...

1059
00:41:49,826 --> 00:41:50,625
"Baby."

1060
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:02,866
Stop running.

1061
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:04,225
Red light.

1062
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:06,306
Stop, red light.

1063
00:42:06,386 --> 00:42:07,426
My turn.

1064
00:42:07,506 --> 00:42:08,266
It's my turn.

1065
00:42:08,346 --> 00:42:09,105
The traffic rules.

1066
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:10,025
Have some more.

1067
00:42:10,105 --> 00:42:11,065
Finish this up.

1068
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:11,785
Be good.

1069
00:42:12,185 --> 00:42:12,906
Be good.

1070
00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:14,426
I can't manage you two.

1071
00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:15,986
Go ahead and play.

1072
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:20,145
It's so tiring to feed you.

1073
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:21,625
I'm tired.

1074
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:22,986
Play the cartoons

1075
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:24,026
for them.

1076
00:42:24,265 --> 00:42:25,665
Let them play while eating.

1077
00:42:26,105 --> 00:42:26,786
They both have

1078
00:42:26,866 --> 00:42:28,546
insufficient hyperopic reserve.

1079
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:29,665
Chengyi don't let them

1080
00:42:29,745 --> 00:42:30,866
watch cartoons.

1081
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:32,506
Nonsense.

1082
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:34,105
He let them watch cartoons

1083
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,625
when he couldn't manage them.

1084
00:42:39,946 --> 00:42:40,826
It's so late.

1085
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:42,785
Why is he still not home?

1086
00:42:47,585 --> 00:42:48,145
Yeah.

1087
00:42:48,225 --> 00:42:49,506
Why isn't he back yet?

1088
00:42:52,785 --> 00:42:54,466
He's probably working overtime.
