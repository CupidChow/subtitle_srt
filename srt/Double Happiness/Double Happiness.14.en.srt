Hey.

17
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:48,024
Hey.

18
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:50,036
Get up!

19
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:53,198
Are you to work

20
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:54,396
or to sleep?

21
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:55,758
It's been two days.

22
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:57,917
The first thing you do
at the cemetery is sleep.

23
00:01:57,997 --> 00:01:59,077
What is this?

24
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:02,997
I'm sorry, Master.

25
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:04,796
Master,

26
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:07,036
do we have a dorm?

27
00:02:07,436 --> 00:02:08,436
What do you mean?

28
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,796
I suffer from chronic insomnia.

29
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,556
Melatonin, sleeping pills,

30
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:15,796
I've tried all kinds of remedies.

31
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:16,917
Nothing works.

32
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:18,916
Yet, once I get here,

33
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:20,396
I feel particularly sleepy.

34
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,757
I don't even dream.

35
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:24,676
Besides,

36
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:26,396
our cemetery is in the suburbs.

37
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:28,277
It takes three hours to commute

38
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,796
by bus every day.

39
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,316
When I get here,

40
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:33,197
it's natural to be too tired.

41
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:35,396
So

42
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:37,996
if there were a dorm,

43
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,236
I'd live here on weekdays

44
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:40,756
and go home on my days off.

45
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:42,037
You brat,

46
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:43,836
getting all cocky now.

47
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:45,597
At midnight,

48
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:48,077
sleeping at the cemetery,

49
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:49,637
aren't you scared?

50
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,836
Yes, I'm scared.

51
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,197
Why still stay?

52
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:54,077
But chronic insomnia is even scarier.

53
00:02:57,556 --> 00:02:59,197
Alright then, let's talk about it later.

54
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:02,077
Well,

55
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,836
you can sleep another 30 minutes.

56
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:07,957
And then do your work.

57
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:09,037
Go, go, go.

58
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,157
Work.

59
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:16,597
Youyou...

60
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:38,077
Wait a minute.

61
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:40,597
Ms. Li,

62
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:41,836
you're so early.

63
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:46,437
There's a document

64
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,836
on the company's computer

65
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:48,917
that is urgently needed.

66
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:54,757
Why are you here so early too?

67
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:58,316
I just dropped off my kids.

68
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,757
If I went straight back,
it would be too troublesome.

69
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:02,157
So, I just came over.

70
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:19,396
I remember that

71
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,356
next week is your birthday, right?

72
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:24,276
Yes, thank you, Ms. Li, for remembering.

73
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,237
(Millions of clicks)
I don't know what to buy for you.

74
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:28,717
So I bought some gifts

75
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:29,797
for your kids.

76
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,637
You shouldn't have.

77
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,757
I'll give them to you
before getting off work.

78
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:35,557
You've been working hard.

79
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:38,437
Alright.

80
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:40,036
It's what I should do.

81
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,358
No, no.

82
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:52,956
This still hasn't come back yet.

83
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:54,836
It has to go backward.

84
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,516
Adjust it first, and then back.

85
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,036
You move it forward first.

86
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:00,836
Stop, stop.

87
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:02,118
Turn right.

88
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:03,276
No, it's not yet there.

89
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:04,717
Turn right to the fullest!

90
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:05,396
Yes, yes.

91
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:06,436
Good, good.

92
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,237
No, back into that parking space.

93
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:08,997
The next spot.

94
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:10,077
It's already in use.

95
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:10,998
Let me do it.

96
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,117
Let me do it.

97
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:12,756
Let me do it.

98
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:13,836
Hey.

99
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:16,077
Move backward.

100
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:17,797
Yes, turn it to the fullest.

101
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:18,477
Back up!

102
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:19,157
Back up!

103
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,156
- Back up!
- You parked in the middle.

104
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:22,917
In the middle now.

105
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:24,356
Come down, let me do it.

106
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:26,596
Thank you.

107
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:32,597
No, we'll park

108
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:34,276
in this middle spot.

109
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:35,356
Stand here.

110
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,797
Watch closely, learn a bit.

111
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:03,277
Did you see that?

112
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:04,956
This is master-level parking.

113
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:29,877
What is this smell?

114
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:43,917
Let's go.

115
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:44,997
Get the purse.

116
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:01,356
Keep family scandals

117
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:02,836
private.

118
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,716
Take my arm.

119
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,357
Turn on the recording in a while.

120
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:14,516
They might

121
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:15,517
say something that

122
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:16,677
can be used as evidence.

123
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:17,997
We are for the class reunion.

124
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:19,037
Don't make them think

125
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:20,396
we're ruining the party here.

126
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:27,358
They went all out

127
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:28,477
for this 10th anniversary.

128
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:30,437
Yes, there has to be
some sense of ceremony.

129
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:32,237
Why pick

130
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:32,918
this photo?

131
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:34,197
I'm like your big sister.

132
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:36,637
Xu Kaixin,

133
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:37,917
this one is so awkward.

134
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:38,636
The monitor

135
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:39,716
must've picked it.

136
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:41,997
Who have we here?

137
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:43,237
Dear.

138
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:45,557
Long time no see.

139
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:47,356
Are you dating?

140
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:49,036
Is it that obvious?

141
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:51,557
Aren't you already pregnant?

142
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:53,557
I'm just this fat.

143
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:55,836
Why are you two still so sarcastic?

144
00:07:56,596 --> 00:07:57,437
Kaixin,

145
00:07:57,557 --> 00:07:59,156
I'm really happy you could come.

146
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:00,917
But I have to advise you.

147
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:02,276
This ten-year anniversary

148
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,077
is important.

149
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:04,836
So, control yourself.

150
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:06,156
What?

151
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:07,437
That...

152
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:10,036
Are you talking about him?

153
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:11,396
Sister,

154
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:12,877
you know me well, don't you?

155
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:14,436
I won't pick fights.

156
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:15,277
Besides,

157
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:16,677
do I seek trouble?

158
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:19,237
Yes.

159
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:21,276
You two really know me too well.

160
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:22,316
Xiaoxiao.

161
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:23,636
Long time no see.

162
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,756
Everyone, long time no see.

163
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:26,836
Who is it?

164
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:29,476
Where did you come from?

165
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,596
Are you nuts?

166
00:08:31,757 --> 00:08:32,757
Xiaoxiao.

167
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,396
Today's climax

168
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:35,476
is not with me.

169
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:39,716
Understood.

170
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:41,797
Old habits die hard.

171
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:43,236
Be careful.

172
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:49,048
(Ten-year class reunion)
Long time no see.

173
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:50,317
Your health is quite good.

174
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:57,476
Kaixin is here.

175
00:08:57,756 --> 00:08:59,356
Kaixin.

176
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:00,357
Monitor.

177
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:01,318
Hello, everyone.

178
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:02,717
Long time no see.

179
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:03,717
Hello, hello.

180
00:09:03,797 --> 00:09:04,478
Long time no see.

181
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:05,797
Come, sit over here.

182
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:07,036
Kaixin, Kaixin.

183
00:09:07,116 --> 00:09:08,356
Take a seat.

184
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:09,836
Xiaojiao, long time no see.

185
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,636
You just greeted her?

186
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:20,636
I'm the mistress, how could I not?

187
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:22,676
Don't disgrace yourself

188
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:23,717
here.

189
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:24,797
Thank you, honey.

190
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:28,036
Everyone

191
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:28,958
is here.

192
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:30,437
Come, everyone, take your seats.

193
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:32,397
Come on, sit down, sit down.

194
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:33,756
Long time no see.

195
00:09:33,836 --> 00:09:34,836
Long time no see.

196
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:36,517
Bro.

197
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:37,797
Long time no see.

198
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:40,676
Excuse me.

199
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,476
- What's up?
- Can we change seats?

200
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:43,916
You want to sit here?

201
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:44,796
Is it okay?

202
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:45,517
It's okay.

203
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:46,677
Thank you, thank you.

204
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,116
Just sit here.

205
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:49,437
Let's chat for a while.

206
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:50,517
Then...

207
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:52,796
It's okay, sit here.

208
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:53,796
- I'll sit there.
- Sit.

209
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:54,876
Come on.

210
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:55,957
How about it?

211
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:56,916
You haven't changed.

212
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:57,876
Five years.

213
00:09:57,956 --> 00:09:58,636
You look good.

214
00:09:58,716 --> 00:09:59,716
You look in good spirits.

215
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,276
Putting on a show.

216
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:02,116
What you up to?

217
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:03,996
Oh, me? This and that.

218
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,157
It's a hit!

219
00:10:06,277 --> 00:10:08,236
- Great!
- The stock isn't even enough!

220
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:11,237
Contact the manufacturer right away.

221
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:13,077
Ask him how much inventory
there would be

222
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:14,556
if they work overtime for a week.

223
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:15,396
- Alright.
- Yes.

224
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:16,077
Hurry, hurry!

225
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:16,916
That mistake

226
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:17,838
has been compensated.

227
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,396
The sales have multiplied.

228
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:20,476
Of course.

229
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:21,756
By the way, Mei,

230
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:22,636
given such a boom,

231
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:23,637
isn't our bonus

232
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:24,837
secured as well?

233
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:25,437
Yeah.

234
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:26,517
In your dreams.

235
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:28,836
Let's see if it can offset the mistake.

236
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,756
Right, almost forgot about this.

237
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:31,836
Hello, Ms. Li.

238
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:33,237
Hello, Ms. Li.

239
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,156
Hello, Ms. Li.

240
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:35,277
That's really good.

241
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:36,598
Mei's birthday

242
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,996
is coming up soon.

243
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:38,838
So

244
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,077
on his birthday,

245
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:41,437
I'll treat you to a meal.

246
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,358
- Okay?
- Okay.

247
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,717
Thank you, Ms. Li.

248
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:44,476
Okay.

249
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:45,957
Continue with your work.

250
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:47,037
Alright.

251
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:48,556
Keep it up.

252
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:49,437
Keep it up.

253
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:51,036
- Keep it up.
- Keep it up.

254
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:52,116
Happy.

255
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:53,357
Happy, happy.

256
00:10:53,437 --> 00:10:54,836
- Okay.
- Happy.

257
00:10:56,437 --> 00:10:57,797
Ms. Li is interesting today.

258
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:02,357
(Ten-year class reunion)
Everyone, calm down.

259
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:03,996
Let me say a few words.

260
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,556
Today is the 10th anniversary

261
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,756
of our graduation.

262
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:10,276
Although it's not a weekend,

263
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:12,036
many classmates

264
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:13,876
have made a special trip back.

265
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,836
As the class monitor, I am very touched.

266
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:16,958
Good.

267
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:19,756
Alright.

268
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:22,756
What does this mean?

269
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:24,717
It shows

270
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:26,157
our friendship is priceless.

271
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:27,477
So in order not to destroy

272
00:11:27,557 --> 00:11:29,077
this priceless friendship,

273
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:30,876
before we start,

274
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,797
let's first set some temporary
class rules.

275
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:35,676
Today, whether you are a big boss,

276
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:36,876
or an employee,

277
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:38,276
a leader

278
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:39,996
or a housewife,

279
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,236
we should adhere to

280
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:42,437
three principles.

281
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:43,437
No pandering,

282
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:44,556
no feeling inferior,

283
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,556
- no showing off.
- No showing off.

284
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:48,636
Today, we just enjoy this.

285
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,797
A drink represents
a lifelong friendship.

286
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:51,996
Okay.

287
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:58,397
I looked quite good back then.

288
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:03,077
Can we still find you?

289
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:04,677
The change is too big.

290
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:22,636
Why use this photo?

291
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:23,916
How about it?

292
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:24,916
Hit by the love

293
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:25,916
of the past?

294
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:26,917
Want to go back

295
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,197
and wake this fool up?

296
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:31,197
Even bombers couldn't wake me up.

297
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:32,517
Back then I was

298
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:34,557
so deeply in love.

299
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:37,476
Love-struck.

300
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:38,916
Though silly,

301
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:40,236
I was quite cute.

302
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:41,996
Still cute now.

303
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:43,917
Sadly, no one loves it.

304
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:47,157
My love is here.

305
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:48,437
Who said no one loves it?

306
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:49,996
Okay.

307
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:56,156
Don't sneak a look at my phone.

308
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:57,557
I know who it is.

309
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:21,304
(Mei Chengyi)
(Why is there only half a picture?)

310
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:25,957
(An honest guy.)

311
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:26,958
(Xu Kaixin)
(The point)

312
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:28,636
(is I'm super beautiful.)

313
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:34,517
(I'm at work.)

314
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:35,756
(Can't talk much.)

315
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:36,557
(This weekend,)

316
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:38,557
(do you have time for a date?)

317
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,116
(What about your kids?)

318
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:42,437
(The back doesn't hurt?)

319
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,276
(I'm just concerned)

320
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,356
(about your health,)

321
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:46,636
(no other intent.)

322
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,556
Go eat.

323
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:05,437
Why are you looking at me?

324
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:08,516
(Indeed,)

325
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:09,876
(you only care about my back.)

326
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:16,956
(No.)

327
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,636
(Tomorrow they have interest classes,)

328
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:22,317
(mostly at Xinghuan Building.)

329
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:23,477
(I just)

330
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:24,118
(take them)

331
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,237
(to different classrooms.)

332
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:26,396
(Moreover, the art class)

333
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:27,476
(is two hours long.)

334
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:28,437
(If you're fine,)

335
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:29,037
(we can meet)

336
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:30,236
(in the afternoon.)

337
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,437
(The back hasn't recovered.)

338
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,277
(So don't overthink it.)

339
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:36,077
(It's just a simple date.)

340
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:40,317
(Okay.)

341
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:47,476
Begins to cloy now.

342
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:50,157
Can you focus

343
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:51,476
on your own situation?

344
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:53,957
Song Ran. It's been a long time.

345
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:54,756
Everyone,

346
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:56,717
today, we've also invited a few

347
00:14:56,797 --> 00:14:58,397
of our teachers.

348
00:14:58,716 --> 00:15:00,237
They are already retired

349
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,317
Ms. Sun.

350
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:03,357
Hello, Ms. Sun.

351
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,237
Hey.

352
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:06,317
Ms. Sun.

353
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:09,037
Mr. Chen.

354
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:14,876
And our Vice Principal Lin.

355
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:16,037
Hello, Mr. Lin.

356
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:17,236
Hello, everyone.

357
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:19,716
Hello, Mr. Lin.

358
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:23,716
Monitor,

359
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,677
can I say a few words?

360
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:26,636
Sure.

361
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:27,996
Come, Ms. Sun, come on.

362
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:30,357
Ms. Sun, come on.

363
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:31,437
Please go ahead.

364
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:35,396
It's fine, I can handle it.

365
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,476
Take it slow.

366
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:41,756
Hello, guys.

367
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:43,677
Hello, Ms. Sun.

368
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:46,676
Last time,

369
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:48,477
when I saw you,

370
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:51,397
it was at the class reunion
five years ago.

371
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:54,636
In these five years, I have grown old,

372
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:56,277
yet you are all still young.

373
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:57,756
You're not old.

374
00:15:58,236 --> 00:15:59,397
May you live long.

375
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:01,197
I hope next time,

376
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,677
when you do this,

377
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:05,996
I can still come see you.

378
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:07,836
May you live long.

379
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:09,596
May Ms. Sun live long.

380
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,277
That would be like a monster.

381
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:14,957
Ms. Sun has been so humorous.

382
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:16,037
Yes.

383
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,356
That

384
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:21,356
Qian...

385
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:24,996
Qian...

386
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:25,956
Qian Hao.

387
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:27,596
Yes, Qian Hao.

388
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:29,517
Xu Kaixin.

389
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:31,996
You two are the perfect couple

390
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:34,037
in our class.

391
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:37,476
Your kids have grown up, right?

392
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:39,556
But why are you

393
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:41,276
sitting

394
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:42,797
so far apart?

395
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:56,677
Why is that?

396
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:57,996
That's not good.

397
00:16:58,356 --> 00:16:59,357
Come on, sit over there,

398
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:00,756
a little closer.

399
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,277
A little closer, right?

400
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:05,077
Yeah, Qian Hao.

401
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:07,636
Come sit over here.

402
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:12,797
You're a man now.

403
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:13,917
Man up.

404
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:14,997
Stand up.

405
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:16,396
Come over.

406
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:17,596
Get closer.

407
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:21,797
Qian Hao.

408
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:26,317
Come here.

409
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:27,316
Sorry.

410
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:27,917
It's okay.

411
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:28,797
Come on, here.

412
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:30,477
That's right.

413
00:17:31,436 --> 00:17:32,557
Closer.

414
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:47,997
This is too awkward.

415
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:48,756
She doesn't know.

416
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:49,717
She doesn't know.

417
00:17:49,797 --> 00:17:51,116
- Yes.
- They don't know.

418
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:56,916
Well,

419
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,037
thank you

420
00:17:58,117 --> 00:17:59,836
for your care towards us.

421
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,157
Let's continue the party.

422
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:02,958
Later,

423
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,397
we will follow the order

424
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:05,356
to toast to teachers.

425
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:05,957
Is it good?

426
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:07,037
Good.

427
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:10,557
Drink up.

428
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:11,797
Here come the dishes.

429
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,156
Serve the dishes.

430
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:34,717
What is the company thinking?

431
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:36,556
I agreed with the layoff, right?

432
00:18:36,636 --> 00:18:38,037
But why lay off the whole team

433
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:39,997
and decline their bonuses?

434
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:41,957
Taking labor protection laws

435
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,237
not seriously, right?

436
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:46,516
Yes, Mei Chengyi is amenable.

437
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:47,238
But we can't

438
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:48,756
always pick the easy targets.

439
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,396
Their team encountered issues.

440
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,077
But their sales were the highest.

441
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:53,437
Laying off sales champion?

442
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:54,757
Never heard of it.

443
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,037
Ridiculous.

444
00:18:56,117 --> 00:18:57,157
Other companies

445
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:58,596
would laugh their heads off.

446
00:18:58,836 --> 00:18:59,836
Ms. Li,

447
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,557
don't argue with me.

448
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:03,797
What does arguing with me accomplish?

449
00:19:04,037 --> 00:19:05,076
This is my uncle's idea.

450
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:06,436
What can I do?

451
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:07,636
Is it right?

452
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:09,317
I certainly

453
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:10,997
understand you.

454
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:13,477
After all, Mei Chengyi
is your apprentice.

455
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:14,556
And you brought him

456
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,037
to this company.

457
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,157
But my uncle

458
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:17,918
still hopes

459
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:19,637
you can have some personal stance.

460
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:20,557
Like me, to put

461
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:21,796
the company's interests

462
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:22,917
first.

463
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:23,717
Think about

464
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,556
the bonus for these veteran employees

465
00:19:25,636 --> 00:19:27,316
and the layoff compensation,

466
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:28,158
the company

467
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:29,557
will cost much.

468
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:31,277
Short-sighted.

469
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:33,316
Is the company short of this money?

470
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:34,237
No.

471
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:35,316
But this is also

472
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:37,077
a big amount of working capital.

473
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:38,317
Listen,

474
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:39,556
I look good in this outfit,

475
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,957
not because of this suit.

476
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:41,597
It is because

477
00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:42,836
I'm good-looking.

478
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,116
That their team performed well

479
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,477
doesn't have to do with them.

480
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:46,117
It's because

481
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:47,876
of our platform.

482
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:49,237
Listen to me.

483
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:50,636
Lay off the entire team.

484
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:52,317
You'll find some

485
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:54,316
new blood, right?

486
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:55,237
The salary will be

487
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:56,116
only a third.

488
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:56,998
Then you save on

489
00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:58,637
bonuses for the old employees.

490
00:19:58,717 --> 00:19:59,957
How much cost can be saved?

491
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:01,636
Ms. Li, you know better than I do.

492
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:02,677
Right?

493
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:03,756
I certainly know.

494
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:04,757
This is hard

495
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,277
for you as their leader.

496
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,836
But we are the workers.

497
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,237
We must perform our duties

498
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:12,356
and put the company's interests

499
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:13,757
first.

500
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:16,116
I understand that.

501
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:17,676
But we must not

502
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:18,917
underestimate it.

503
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:19,678
Listen up.

504
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:20,877
We mustn't alert them.

505
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:21,676
Okay?

506
00:20:21,797 --> 00:20:22,717
Right now,

507
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:23,957
it's not completely finished.

508
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:25,316
Whoever you hire

509
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:26,516
really can't handle it.

510
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:27,637
Moreover, this time,

511
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:28,717
the results are great.

512
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:29,836
There are several projects

513
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:30,917
assigned to their team

514
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,156
with separate coordination.

515
00:20:32,237 --> 00:20:33,276
My suggestion is

516
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:35,156
a smooth transition to a good ending.

517
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:36,277
Secure

518
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:37,636
the new projects now.

519
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:39,636
Otherwise,
the consequences will be serious.

520
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:00,317
Come on.

521
00:21:00,797 --> 00:21:01,877
Fill up the glasses.

522
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:03,876
Guys.

523
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,717
Let's celebrate our gathering today.

524
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:07,756
Let's raise our glasses

525
00:21:07,836 --> 00:21:09,677
and wish us a happy tenth anniversary.

526
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:10,477
Cheers.

527
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:11,077
Come on.

528
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:13,156
Cheers.

529
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,117
You really

530
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:20,717
dare to come over and sit.

531
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,277
Look at Hu Xiaojiao's face.

532
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:27,116
Aren't you afraid she'll come after you?

533
00:21:27,477 --> 00:21:28,636
Why care about her?

534
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:31,036
Ms. Sun is getting old.

535
00:21:31,116 --> 00:21:32,636
I've heard she has Alzheimer's.

536
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:33,998
She still thinks

537
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:35,356
we are married.

538
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:36,756
If she were humiliated,

539
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:37,997
we'd all be embarrassed.

540
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:40,916
I don't feel embarrassed.

541
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,077
You should feel embarrassed.

542
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:49,238
Isn't this dress

543
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:50,596
from when we graduated

544
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,876
ten years ago?

545
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:53,717
Good memory.

546
00:21:55,477 --> 00:21:56,797
Still looks so good.

547
00:21:58,997 --> 00:22:01,077
Kaixin, how come you can still fit into

548
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:03,276
clothes from ten years ago

549
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:04,437
after giving birth to kids?

550
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:05,237
Xiaoxiao,

551
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:06,516
if you could go through

552
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:07,717
a failed marriage,

553
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:09,196
you'd fit into it too.

554
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:11,876
Drink up.

555
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,077
Come on, drink up.

556
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:18,516
Please don't do this

557
00:22:18,596 --> 00:22:20,237
in front of so many people.

558
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:21,516
I think you

559
00:22:21,596 --> 00:22:22,438
shouldn't be here

560
00:22:22,518 --> 00:22:23,916
and humiliate yourself.

561
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:26,517
Just go back.

562
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:32,556
I said don't worry about her.

563
00:22:32,636 --> 00:22:34,517
I'm just here to find some memories.

564
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:52,237
Finding memories comes at a cost.

565
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:56,637
I can't pay attention to you now.

566
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:57,836
I'm going to the restroom.

567
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:03,156
Song Ran,

568
00:23:03,237 --> 00:23:04,237
aren't you hungry?

569
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,037
No, no, I'm thirsty.

570
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:07,876
Come on, let's drink.

571
00:23:07,957 --> 00:23:09,027
- Come on.
- Another.

572
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:09,836
- Here.
- Oh, you.

573
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:10,916
Long time no see.

574
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:16,440
(Ten-year class reunion)

575
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:25,477
Not seizing the opportunity?

576
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:27,196
No wonder you are still single.

577
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,076
Wishing you good health.

578
00:23:30,156 --> 00:23:31,797
Okay, may you become more handsome.

579
00:23:40,156 --> 00:23:41,156
Xu Kaixin.

580
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:42,596
Ms. Sun, to your health.

581
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:43,676
Okay.

582
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:46,036
Kaixin is a good girl.

583
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:47,276
When she was studying,

584
00:23:47,356 --> 00:23:48,756
she was my class representative.

585
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:50,396
She worked diligently and responsibly.

586
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:51,916
After graduation,

587
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:54,356
every New Year and holiday,

588
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:55,277
and on my birthday,

589
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:57,116
she calls to greet me.

590
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:58,836
She even sends me cakes.

591
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,756
She is truly kind and loyal.

592
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:01,836
Yes.

593
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:02,997
Kaixin, come here.

594
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:04,396
Let me give you a hug.

595
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:05,836
Okay.

596
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:11,436
My class representative

597
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,396
must never be bullied.

598
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:21,596
Ms. Sun,

599
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:22,997
thank you, Ms. Sun.

600
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:24,077
Okay.

601
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:28,556
Please sit down.

602
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:29,636
Okay.

603
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:31,237
Ms. Sun,

604
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:31,917
a toast to you.

605
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:32,797
To your good health.

606
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:34,116
Okay, thank you.

607
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:35,117
And to you as well.

608
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:36,397
Come on, cheers.

609
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:37,717
- Come on.
- Come on.

610
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:38,876
Ms. Sun.

611
00:24:47,797 --> 00:24:48,856

I'll text you

632
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:28,796
her phone number.

633
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:29,437
Thank you.

634
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,077
- I'll leave first.
- Okay.

635
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:35,797
What are you doing?

636
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:36,637
Stay away from me.

637
00:27:36,717 --> 00:27:37,597
Life is short.

638
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:39,396
What the heck?

639
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:41,796
Li Xiaoxiao blocked me

640
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:42,917
because of us.

641
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:44,116
Don't you know?

642
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:45,237
If she sees

643
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:45,917
us together,

644
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:46,997
what will she think?

645
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:48,316
What am I here for today?

646
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:49,237
Don't you know?

647
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:50,317
Leave me be.

648
00:27:51,557 --> 00:27:52,836
No, you are...

649
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,717
Annoying.

650
00:27:57,517 --> 00:27:58,997
Girls over bros.

651
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:03,717
I'm betrayed by everyone.

652
00:28:16,037 --> 00:28:17,477
This tea is for you.

653
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:20,517
Just be straight.

654
00:28:26,676 --> 00:28:27,836
Afraid I'll harm you?

655
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:29,596
That's not it.

656
00:28:29,757 --> 00:28:31,116
I'm afraid you'll harm yourself.

657
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:32,836
And then frame me.

658
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:33,757
Xu Kaixin,

659
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,596
you've watched too many dramas.

660
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:37,116
That's true.

661
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:37,918
Back in college,

662
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:39,596
all we watched were those dramas.

663
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:41,157
In a blink, it's been

664
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:41,958
over ten years.

665
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:43,836
Forget reminiscing about the past.

666
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:46,436
Get straight to the point.

667
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:52,317
I want to return Qian Hao to you.

668
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:53,918
Are you dumb,

669
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,397
or am I deaf?

670
00:28:55,477 --> 00:28:56,997
I'm serious, Xu Kaixin.

671
00:28:57,717 --> 00:28:58,638
I've regretted it.

672
00:28:58,718 --> 00:29:00,677
It has nothing to do with me.

673
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:01,517
You won.

674
00:29:01,597 --> 00:29:02,876
What did I win?

675
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:04,197
Qian Hao can't forget you

676
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:05,036
and the two kids.

677
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:05,998
He married me,

678
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,676
only due to my family's good conditions.

679
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:09,237
Isn't it ridiculous?

680
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:10,997
I tried every means to

681
00:29:11,156 --> 00:29:12,517
get close to you and Qian Hao.

682
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:14,556
From the beginning,
he was gaslighting me,

683
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:16,277
making me think he really loved me too.

684
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,636
I made all sorts
of concessions for love,

685
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:21,317
especially to his terrible mother.

686
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:23,077
And the result?

687
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:24,238
He broke

688
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:25,517
my heart.

689
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,717
Now I am completely

690
00:29:28,797 --> 00:29:29,916
enlightened.

691
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:31,997
I've given up.

692
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:34,397
You must feel

693
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:35,477
relieved, right?

694
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:36,797
If this

695
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:37,957
were in a drama,

696
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:38,997
the audience would feel

697
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,077
especially relieved.

698
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:41,437
I'm not like that.

699
00:29:41,517 --> 00:29:43,316
I sincerely hope that you two

700
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:45,036
can be together

701
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,636
and live well.

702
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:47,597
Xu Kaixin,

703
00:29:47,677 --> 00:29:49,317
I was love-struck.

704
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:51,196
But what I want is true love.

705
00:29:51,517 --> 00:29:52,357
He does not love me.

706
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:53,997
You two have two children.

707
00:29:54,077 --> 00:29:55,836
Dami and Xiaomi
can't be without a father.

708
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:56,997
Hu Xiaojiao,

709
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:58,077
now you remember

710
00:29:58,157 --> 00:29:59,836
our two kids have a father.

711
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:00,997
What do you take me for?

712
00:30:01,077 --> 00:30:02,116
Garbage recycling?

713
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:03,356
I recycle and reuse?

714
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:04,156
Is that it?

715
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:05,356
I find it very strange.

716
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,357
How come Qian Hao

717
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,077
can be

718
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:09,157
dumped by you

719
00:30:09,237 --> 00:30:10,117
just like that.

720
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:11,436
And I have to catch him?

721
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:12,636
Besides,

722
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:14,277
aren't you pregnant?

723
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:15,557
How can it

724
00:30:15,637 --> 00:30:16,676
not have a father?

725
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:20,436
An unwanted child

726
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:22,237
doesn't have to be born.

727
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:24,836
In any case, Xu Kaixin, I mean well.

728
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,116
I know I wronged you back then.

729
00:30:27,196 --> 00:30:27,878
So now I want

730
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,516
to try to make up for this mistake.

731
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:30,717
Let me put it this way.

732
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:32,517
I definitely don't want him.

733
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:34,637
But if you feel sorry,

734
00:30:34,717 --> 00:30:36,076
return the house to me.

735
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:37,477
Then I will gladly accept.

736
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:38,717
Because you swindled

737
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:39,596
the house away.

738
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:41,237
That was supposed to be mine.

739
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:43,357
Naturally, both

740
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:45,076
will be returned to you.

741
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:46,156
Have some tea.

742
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:49,077
Xu Kaixin.

743
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:51,277
Xu Kaixin.

744
00:30:52,156 --> 00:30:53,156
Xu Kaixin.

745
00:30:53,997 --> 00:30:54,878
What are you doing?

746
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:56,237
Be careful, you're pregnant.

747
00:30:56,676 --> 00:30:57,478
There are cameras.

748
00:30:57,558 --> 00:30:59,116
I didn't do anything to you.

749
00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:01,196
Think it over again.

750
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:08,077
This is not a celebrity.

751
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:09,517
This is my boyfriend.

752
00:31:09,957 --> 00:31:10,957
Handsome, right?

753
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:11,997
Xiaojiao,

754
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:13,116
I sincerely hope

755
00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:13,718
you can

756
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:14,997
live well with Qian Hao.

757
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:15,837
Please do not

758
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,077
disturb my life.

759
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:51,477
Are you dancing?

760
00:31:54,116 --> 00:31:55,438
Li Xiaoxiao, I'll dance for you

761
00:31:55,518 --> 00:31:57,116
if you like, okay?

762
00:31:57,517 --> 00:31:58,517
Is that okay?

763
00:31:59,237 --> 00:32:00,436
Satisfied?

764
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:02,356
You're sick.

765
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:04,196
Xiaoxiao, where are you going?

766
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:09,916
Li Xiaoxiao,

767
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:12,077
why do you keep avoiding me?

768
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,436
Are you afraid I'll eat you?

769
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:46,636
I've added you.

770
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:48,836
Don't delete it this time, okay?

771
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:52,797
Did you hear me?

772
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:05,717
Such a fuss just to add me on WeChat.

773
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:14,557
Coward.

774
00:33:20,436 --> 00:33:21,436
Everyone.

775
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:23,077
Everyone, everyone,

776
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:25,477
let's take another photo.

777
00:33:25,557 --> 00:33:26,237
Okay?

778
00:33:26,317 --> 00:33:27,317
Okay.

779
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,116
I suggest we

780
00:33:29,196 --> 00:33:30,037
recreate this photo

781
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:31,116
from ten years ago.

782
00:33:31,196 --> 00:33:32,196
Okay.

783
00:33:32,356 --> 00:33:33,316
Everyone, come on.

784
00:33:33,396 --> 00:33:34,396
Come on.

785
00:33:36,196 --> 00:33:37,196
Stand there.

786
00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:40,477
Come, come, everyone.

787
00:33:40,557 --> 00:33:41,197
Everyone, come.

788
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:43,077
Just stand in the same place as we did.

789
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:44,556
You step aside.

790
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:45,356
I'm right here.

791
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:46,436
I'll stand over here.

792
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:50,237
Kaixin, go in the front.

793
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:56,797
Come, make way, make way.

794
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:58,037
Thank you.

795
00:34:02,237 --> 00:34:03,596
Move a bit closer.

796
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:04,717
Look here, look at me.

797
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:06,276
Okay, everyone, smile.

798
00:34:06,356 --> 00:34:07,556
Just like the past.

799
00:34:07,636 --> 00:34:08,156
Alright.

800
00:34:08,236 --> 00:34:08,917
Ready,

801
00:34:08,997 --> 00:34:10,556
three, two, one.

802
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:11,837
Cheese.

803
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:13,478
Another one.

804
00:34:13,558 --> 00:34:15,236
Three, two, one.

805
00:34:15,316 --> 00:34:16,437
Cheese.

806
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:18,077
Alright, thank you.

807
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:32,557
Ms. Li.

808
00:34:32,756 --> 00:34:33,597
Chengyi, come here.

809
00:34:33,677 --> 00:34:34,917
I was about to talk to you.

810
00:34:34,997 --> 00:34:35,997
Sit down.

811
00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:40,316
I saw you went out at noon.

812
00:34:41,357 --> 00:34:43,037
Yes, I had an appointment with a client

813
00:34:43,596 --> 00:34:45,236
and scheduled a luncheon meeting.

814
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:47,756
It's been so tough lately.

815
00:34:48,077 --> 00:34:49,156
Your team pulled off

816
00:34:49,236 --> 00:34:50,477
a beautiful turnaround battle.

817
00:34:50,877 --> 00:34:51,637
Many things

818
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:52,837
haven't wrapped up yet.

819
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:55,037
The compensation agreement contract,

820
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:56,997
fund turnaround and payment reminder

821
00:34:57,077 --> 00:34:58,437
have not been finalized yet.

822
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:01,397
I saw in the daily report,

823
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:02,877
there are a few follow-up projects.

824
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,236
Exactly.

825
00:35:05,477 --> 00:35:07,437
Alright, we need to hurry.

826
00:35:08,037 --> 00:35:10,037
The company will hold
a quarterly selection.

827
00:35:10,397 --> 00:35:12,636
The winning team
will get a quarterly bonus.

828
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,676
The team leader will likely be promoted.

829
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:16,156
The base salary

830
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:17,557
should increase by this much.

831
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:19,958
A great chance.

832
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:21,076
I'll make sure you get it.

833
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:22,317
We are good friends,

834
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:23,357
right?

835
00:35:23,437 --> 00:35:24,117
Of course.

836
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:25,676
We still need to rely on performance.

837
00:35:27,636 --> 00:35:29,276
Yes, I understand this.

838
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:30,517
Thank you, Ms. Li.

839
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,316
But this time, our team's bonus...

840
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:39,037
The bonus

841
00:35:40,517 --> 00:35:41,517
can't come that quick.

842
00:35:41,877 --> 00:35:42,677
I think

843
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:44,277
it will be given out with

844
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:45,357
the next quarter bonus.

845
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:47,517
As for these projects,

846
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:48,797
I'll work with you

847
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:49,957
and help you.

848
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:50,796
Is that okay?

849
00:35:51,037 --> 00:35:52,357
You handle the middle tier,

850
00:35:52,437 --> 00:35:53,636
and I handle the upper tier.

851
00:35:53,877 --> 00:35:55,076
We two work together.

852
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:56,156
How about it?

853
00:35:58,276 --> 00:35:59,276
Of course, no problem.

854
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,156
Alright then.

855
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:01,676
You can organize meetings,

856
00:36:01,756 --> 00:36:03,276
and invite them leaders

857
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:04,397
to have a meal together.

858
00:36:04,877 --> 00:36:06,437
I'll also get to know them, right?

859
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:07,517
I'll prepare the gifts.

860
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,556
Okay then, I'll go arrange it.

861
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,837
- Good.
- Okay.

862
00:36:13,077 --> 00:36:14,077
Good.

863
00:36:14,477 --> 00:36:15,477
Chengyi,

864
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:17,316
we're old partners.

865
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:21,877
Keep it up.

866
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:24,516
Okay.

867
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:25,437
I'm off then.

868
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,517
Good.

869
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:44,716
All done.

870
00:36:44,796 --> 00:36:45,796
That's great.

871
00:36:46,557 --> 00:36:47,557
Hello, Mei.

872
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:49,196
Please look at

873
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:49,957
this proposal.

874
00:36:50,037 --> 00:36:50,997
Also give that to me.

875
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:52,236
Yes, I'd like to check on

876
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:53,596
whether the numbers

877
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:54,676
are correct.

878
00:36:54,957 --> 00:36:56,357
Yes, and also this week's

879
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:58,276
back-end data for this week.

880
00:36:58,877 --> 00:36:59,557
Yes, yes.

881
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:01,236
Then the next is three.

882
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:20,957
Take me to the hospital for a check-up.

883
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:22,636
I'm busy.

884
00:37:22,716 --> 00:37:23,797
I'll drop you off ahead.

885
00:37:23,877 --> 00:37:24,877
Go on your own.

886
00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:27,156
Then give me the money.

887
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:28,236
No.

888
00:37:28,437 --> 00:37:29,676
Don't you have money?

889
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,437
Can it be the same?

890
00:37:32,837 --> 00:37:34,116
You want this child.

891
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:35,877
I don't want it.

892
00:37:36,077 --> 00:37:36,997
It's not my child.

893
00:37:37,077 --> 00:37:38,516
Why should I pay?

894
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:40,116
Alright, I'll go

895
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:40,878
get rid of it.

896
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,477
I don't want to keep this child.

897
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:51,717
What are you doing?

898
00:37:51,797 --> 00:37:53,037
Can you slow down?

899
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:54,477
Qian Hao, slow down.

900
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:56,316
Slow down, slow down.

901
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:58,316
Can you stop it?

902
00:37:58,636 --> 00:37:59,516
I don't want money.

903
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:00,318
I don't want it.

904
00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:01,716
Slow down!

905
00:38:10,877 --> 00:38:11,877
Qian Hao.

906
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:13,837
I only wronged you once.

907
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,397
You've wronged me for four years.

908
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:16,037
Do you

909
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:17,596
really want to kill me that much?

910
00:38:17,676 --> 00:38:19,437
Yeah, let's die together.

911
00:38:19,517 --> 00:38:20,278
- Okay?
- Fine.

912
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:21,676
- Die.
- Die.

913
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:23,757
Come die with me!

914
00:38:23,837 --> 00:38:24,837
What are you doing?

915
00:38:30,997 --> 00:38:32,037
Rear-ended.

916
00:38:32,316 --> 00:38:33,116
Xu Kaixin.

917
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:33,877
An accident

918
00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:34,957
on your first day.

919
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:35,958
Because you were

920
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:37,477
talking about gossip.

921
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:39,276
But take a look.

922
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,156
Who have we got here?

923
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:44,877
Those two.

924
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:47,716
No need to panic.

925
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:50,676
Let me post a feed first.

926
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:52,517
You still in the mood for that?

927
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,716
(Xu Kaixin)
(The first rear-end collision in life)

928
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:40,877
I didn't expect to see you
again so soon.

929
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:42,517
Is she okay?

930
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:43,716
Should we call an ambulance?

931
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:44,917
It's fine.

932
00:39:44,997 --> 00:39:46,276
It's nothing.

933
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:47,636
How about you?

934
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:48,877
I don't...

935
00:39:48,957 --> 00:39:49,837
There is a call.

936
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:51,357
Sorry, I need to take a call.

937
00:39:53,077 --> 00:39:53,798
Hello.

938
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:55,036
I just saw your Moments.

939
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:56,116
Are you okay?

940
00:39:56,636 --> 00:39:57,358
I guess

941
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:58,477
I was just so excited

942
00:39:58,557 --> 00:39:59,636
that I rear-ended

943
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:01,636
my ex-husband's car.

944
00:40:01,957 --> 00:40:03,437
His wife happens to be pregnant.

945
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:06,036
Where are you? I'll come over.

946
00:40:06,116 --> 00:40:07,236
No need. Don't come.

947
00:40:07,316 --> 00:40:08,077
Yes, come.

948
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:09,477
Well, we're

949
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:11,116
at the crossroads of Longwen Road

950
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:12,716
and Yunxiu Road.

951
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:13,797
Thank you.

952
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:14,758
Alright, got it.

953
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:16,077
I'll head over right now.

954
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:17,596
Okay.

955
00:40:18,837 --> 00:40:20,276
Mei, where are you going?

956
00:40:20,437 --> 00:40:21,437
To meet a client.

957
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,556
I'll take a look.

958
00:40:23,636 --> 00:40:24,636
Go ahead.

959
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:30,757
Are you okay?

960
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:31,636
I'm fine.

961
00:40:31,716 --> 00:40:32,397
You aren't hurt?

962
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,676
This is my responsibility.

963
00:40:33,877 --> 00:40:34,676
Should we take her

964
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:35,556
to the hospital?

965
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:36,237
No.

966
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:37,756
It's a minor accident, no worries.

967
00:40:56,477 --> 00:40:57,397
Really okay?

968
00:40:57,477 --> 00:40:58,477
It's fine.

969
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:05,716
Go take a look.

970
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,596
It's fine.

971
00:41:06,676 --> 00:41:07,438
It's nothing.

972
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:08,957
Look, it's just a little scratch.

973
00:41:09,037 --> 00:41:10,316
Just claim it through insurance.

974
00:41:10,756 --> 00:41:12,477
Xu Kaixin, aren't you disgusting?

975
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:13,157
Hey, wait.

976
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,236
I said I'd give him back.

977
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:15,397
You didn't want him.

978
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:16,596
Now you're playing dirty

979
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:17,757
to harm the child

980
00:41:17,837 --> 00:41:18,358
in my belly?

981
00:41:18,438 --> 00:41:19,477
Don't talk nonsense.

982
00:41:19,557 --> 00:41:20,676
Nonsense?

983
00:41:20,756 --> 00:41:21,357
Get in the car.

984
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,358
I will never

985
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,477
get in your car again.

986
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,116
Hu Xiaojiao, I...

987
00:41:26,357 --> 00:41:27,477
What are you doing?

988
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:28,596
Are you crazy?

989
00:41:29,037 --> 00:41:30,037
Stop messing around.

990
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:31,128
Get lost.

991
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:36,277
Hu Xiaojiao.

992
00:41:36,357 --> 00:41:37,357
What...

993
00:41:56,077 --> 00:41:56,877
Sorry.

994
00:41:57,077 --> 00:41:58,636
Women are all like this when pregnant.

995
00:41:59,156 --> 00:42:00,477
But listen.

996
00:42:00,557 --> 00:42:01,917
I really didn't mean to.

997
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:02,797
How should

998
00:42:02,877 --> 00:42:03,877
we handle this?

999
00:42:11,276 --> 00:42:12,276
Kaixin.

1000
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:13,756
You're here.

1001
00:42:16,837 --> 00:42:17,636
Are you okay?

1002
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:18,757
I'm fine.

1003
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:19,837
You must be scared.

1004
00:42:21,316 --> 00:42:23,557
This is truly a historic moment.

1005
00:42:24,596 --> 00:42:25,516
Uh, hello.

1006
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:26,277
We met last time.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,357
I am Mei Chengyi,

1008
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:28,557
Kaixin's boyfriend.

1009
00:42:28,917 --> 00:42:29,716
I am her ex...

1010
00:42:29,796 --> 00:42:30,877
the father of our kids.

1011
00:42:31,276 --> 00:42:32,797
Uh, did you call

1012
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:33,877
the insurance company?

1013
00:42:34,037 --> 00:42:35,556
I was in shock just now.

1014
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,837
I haven't had the time yet.

1015
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:37,997
I'll call them.

1016
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:39,077
Get in the car first.

1017
00:42:41,997 --> 00:42:43,276
How careless of you.

1018
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:46,636
Wait in the car.

1019
00:42:46,716 --> 00:42:47,437
I'll handle this.

1020
00:42:47,517 --> 00:42:48,517
Okay.

1021
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:51,917
I'm really sorry.

1022
00:42:51,997 --> 00:42:52,637
It's alright.

1023
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:53,997
I apologize on her behalf.

1024
00:42:54,077 --> 00:42:55,716
No need. I know her better than you do.

1025
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,437
She's just learning to drive.

1026
00:42:57,517 --> 00:42:59,676
So, uh, let me take a photo first.

1027
00:42:59,756 --> 00:43:00,756
Go ahead.

1028
00:43:03,077 --> 00:43:04,997
