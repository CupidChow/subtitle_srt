Honey,

22
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,034
do you want to join me?

23
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,034
I'll go make breakfast for you.

Dami, you're back.

00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:52,034
You're back.

26
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:53,235
Sleep by yourself.

27
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:54,315
Go to your own bed.

28
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:56,274
I want to be with you.

29
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:02,355
Get up.

30
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,114
Alright, come over.

31
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:12,795
Dami,

32
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:15,154
did you stay at Dad's place?

33
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:16,595
Yes.

34
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:18,834
I stayed in the home when I was little.

35
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,114
I still remember it.

36
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:24,515
Then why can't I remember?

37
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:25,874
Because you're dumb.

38
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:30,635
Dami, is Dad's place fun?

39
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:32,794
It was fun when I was little.

40
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:34,915
It's not fun anymore.

41
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:36,434
I won't go back there anymore.

42
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:38,554
Why?

43
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:40,676
Because Dad's place

44
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:42,475
doesn't have my room anymore.

45
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,274
I can only sleep on the couch there.

46
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,035
Why can you only sleep on the couch?

47
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,315
Is it because Dad
doesn't have money to buy one?

48
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,635
No, Dad has a lot of money.

49
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:55,794
But he seems

50
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:57,035
to not love us anymore.

51
00:03:57,635 --> 00:03:58,834
Whatever.

52
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:00,874
Anyway, I don't love Dad either.

53
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:02,434
I only love Mom.

54
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,035
No,

55
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:07,035
I also love you, Great-Aunt,

56

57
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,475
I think what you're saying makes sense.

58
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:13,755
I won't love Dad anymore either.

59
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:16,154
Forget it.

60
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:17,714

Excuse me.

141
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:36,874
What's going on outside?

142
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:38,675
Didn't we agree

143
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:40,034
to turn the small west bedroom

144
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:41,315
into a kids' room?

145
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:42,955
That's my walk-in closet.

146
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,234
You can't change it.

147
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:45,595
I've thought for you.

148
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,674
Look, our bedroom space is large.

149
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:49,434
This cabinet will be moved out later.

150
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:50,554
I'll convert the wall

151
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:51,435
into a huge closet.

152
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:52,794
All your stuff will fit.

153
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:54,114
No way. I don't agree.

154
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:56,195
Quickly, make them stop.

155
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,554
That's my walk-in closet.

156
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:58,235
So what?

157
00:08:58,315 --> 00:08:59,154
After my son comes,

158
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:00,034
he won't have a room

159
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:01,114
and will sleep with us?

160
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,394
That's unacceptable.

161
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:03,794
You don't accept either way.

162
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:04,874
You tell me what to do.

163
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:08,475
Don't you have a study?

164
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:09,555
My study?

165
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:11,115
Then I'll do all my future work

166
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:12,035
at the company,

167
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:14,114
and I won't come back
no matter how late it is

168
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,354
until I finish.

169
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:16,234
You can't do that.

170
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:17,754
Then give me a solution.

171
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,555
So it seems I have to make sacrifices.

172
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:25,795
I feel like my life

173
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,754
is being eroded bit by bit,

174
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,434
honey.

175
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:30,076
We are

176
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:32,596
facing a problem, right?

177
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,714
The solution is simple.

178
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:36,554
All non-essential things

179
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:38,675
must make way for essential things.

180
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:40,795
You're so smart.

181
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,114
You can figure it out.

182
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,195
Good girl.

183
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:53,034
So I am

184
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,435
a non-essential item?

185
00:09:57,714 --> 00:09:58,714
Forget it.

186
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:00,714
It's just a walk-in closet.

187
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:02,754
I let you down once.

188
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,634
Now you're letting me down once.

189
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,354
We're even.

190
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:10,315
Mom, I like this car.

191
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:11,155
I have a toy car

192
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,114
exactly the same as it.

193
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:15,795
Kaixin.

194
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,955
I still think that one is better.

195
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:20,195
Lowest in price,
best in cost performance.

196
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,595
The salesgirl just said

197
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:23,875
we can do interest-free installments.

198
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:24,675
In this way,

199
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:27,154
the monthly payment
is just over a 1,000.

200
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,555
It's perfect. Let's buy it.

201
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:30,596
But I think

202
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:31,874
this car is quite good.

203
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:33,595
Look, this model is streamlined.

204
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,514
And this color is quite good.

205
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:36,475
Dami,

206
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:37,395
which do you prefer?

207
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:38,955
Mom, I like this one.

208
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:40,755
Mom, look.

209
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:43,035
It has such a big sunroof.

210
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:43,956
At night,

211
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:45,514
we can watch the stars from here.

212
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:46,754
When it rains, we can

213
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,354
watch the raindrops fall from above.

214
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,195
This is Mom's spot.

215
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,354
Lili can sit here.

216
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,315
Xiaomi, let's sit here.

217
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,476
I also want

218
00:10:55,556 --> 00:10:57,275
to put my favorite bear toy here.

219
00:10:57,514 --> 00:10:59,754
Xiaomi, you can also
put Mr. Dinosaur here.

220
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:01,794
I want this one.

221
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,634
I want Mr. Dinosaur.

222
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,514
It's too expensive and over budget.

223
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:07,874
It's more than 200,000.

224
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:12,155
Let's do as Dami says.

225
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,034
Mom, you are the best.

226
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:15,434
- Let's do the paperwork.
- Okay.

227
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:16,355
First, pay the fees

228
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:17,356
and get a temp plate

229
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:19,195
with the driver's license,
ID, and bank card.

230
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:20,514
The official license plate

231
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:21,715
takes three days.

232
00:11:21,795 --> 00:11:22,554
We'll deliver it

233
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:23,634
to your home.

234
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:25,315
I need a driver's license?

235
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:28,995
It's okay. You can still buy a car

236
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:30,075
without that.

237
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:30,836
Later,

238
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,274
we'll drive the car to your place.

239
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:33,474
Then you can get a license.

240
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:34,754
- Okay.
- Okay.

241
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:35,754
Since we're

242
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:36,515
all hyped up,

243
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,915
we're getting this car. Let's go.

244
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:39,874
This way.

245
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,595
You're happy now, aren't you?

246
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:42,675
Yes.

247
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,994
Let's go.

248
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:48,834
Turn over.

249
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:57,155
Move.

250
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:01,275
Okay, stop. Here we go.

251
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:01,996
Okay, keep up.

252
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:04,075
Up, okay. Down, good.

253
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:08,514
Okay.

254
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:18,914
Okay. Go in quickly.

255
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:20,994
Quickly. Excuse me.

256
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:24,474
Okay, all stand up.

257
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:27,634
Stand at attention.

258
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,195
Hands clutched and waists in.

259
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:32,075
Now punch.

260
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,155
One.

261
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:34,594
Two.

262
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:36,114
Three.

263
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:37,355
Punch twice.

264
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:38,435
One.

265
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,075
Two.

266
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:41,754
Three.

267
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:43,594
End pose.

268
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:45,474
Salute.

269
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:48,915
Hands clutched and waists in.

270
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:50,554
Punch in sequence.

271
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:51,634
One.

272
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:52,955
Two.

273
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,315
Three.

274
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:55,554
Punch twice.

275
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:56,634
One.

276
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:58,195
Two.

277
00:12:58,955 --> 00:12:59,955

278

Here you are.

279
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:05,994
Here, wipe your hands.

280
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:09,395
Wipe your hands.

281
00:13:10,474 --> 00:13:11,474
Here.

282
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:24,354
Come on and eat.

283
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:35,395
Is it tasty?

284
00:13:57,315 --> 00:13:58,315

285
00:13:58,915 --> 00:13:59,915

286
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:02,488
Okay.

372
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:06,835
were overexcited today.

for them to fall asleep.

00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,435
She said at Qian Hao's place,

383
00:20:30,554 --> 00:20:31,675
she slept on the sofa.

384
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:33,276
Because Dad's place

385
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:35,034
doesn't have my room anymore.

386
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:36,795
I can only sleep on the couch there.

387
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,435
But you know

388
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:38,875
what she told me?

389
00:20:38,955 --> 00:20:39,955
It's all good.

390
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,634
I'm staying in my old room.

391
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,275
My dad will come over to tuck me in.

392
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:44,355
It's comfortable.

393
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:45,795
She told me she stayed

394
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,035
at her dad's place,

395
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:48,595
and it's spacious and comfortable.

396
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:51,234
That place has three bedrooms.

397
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:52,276
How could there

398
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:53,875
not be a bed for his own daughter?

399
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:56,474
Qian Hao is such an awful person.

400
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:57,875
I know

401
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,554
Dami feels disappointed inside.

402
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:00,555
But

403
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:01,395
I can't stop her

404
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:03,035
from going to her dad and getting hurt.

405
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:04,275
But if she does get hurt,

406
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:05,554
it hurts me even more.

407
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:07,195
So,

408
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:08,075
today,

409
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:09,795
I just wanted to cheer her up.

410
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,714
Whatever she wants.

411
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:11,516
No matter what,

412
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:12,675
she has to be happy.

413
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:13,994
That's right.

414
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,155
As long as Dami is happy
and you are happy,

415
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:17,994
it's worth spending any amount.

416
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:34,355
(Mei Chengyi)
Hello, Ms. Xu.

417
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:35,595
Well...

418
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:42,635
Hello, Ms. Xu.

419
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:44,034
Well, that day I...

420
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:46,474
I'm really sorry. I...

421
00:21:58,794 --> 00:21:59,755
Ms. Xu,

422
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,155
I'm really sorry.

423
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:02,356
That day,

424
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:04,234
my attitude
was indeed a bit over the top.

425
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:10,994
I-I said some

426
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:12,675
rather unpleasant words.

427
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:14,994
Please don't take it to heart.

428
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:25,275
There's another thing

429
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:27,395
I-I would like to ask you for a favor.

430
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:28,674
If you're available

431
00:22:28,754 --> 00:22:29,475
tomorrow night,

432
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:31,195
maybe we can meet again

433
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:33,875
and talk it out in person.

434
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,274
We can meet at the same restaurant.

435
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:37,754
What do you think?

436
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:12,474
Hit tower. Not him.

437
00:23:12,554 --> 00:23:13,554
It's a tower.

438
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:17,435
Move.

439
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:21,635
Dad, why haven't you gone to bed yet?

440
00:23:22,314 --> 00:23:23,994
If you refuse to sleep on time,

441
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:26,754
at least drink a cup of this every day.

442
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:28,754
It can detoxify the liver.

443
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:31,955
And don't forget the vitamins.

444
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,034
It's boring.

445
00:23:49,635 --> 00:23:50,794
It's so boring.

446
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,474
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

447
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:40,116
You mean the scumbag

448
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:41,194
re-added you as a friend

449
00:24:41,274 --> 00:24:42,314
and wants to meet you?

450
00:24:42,474 --> 00:24:43,116
Can you

451
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:44,714
stop calling him a scumbag?

452
00:24:46,794 --> 00:24:48,195
Just a slip of the tongue.

453
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:49,276
I suddenly

454
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:50,835
saw his messages this morning.

455
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:52,674
Could it be

456
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:54,355
that he suddenly realized

457
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:55,835
that I'm actually pretty good

458
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:58,034
and wants to get to know me better?

459
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:02,914
Xu Kaixin,

460
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:03,794
do you know

461
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:05,595
what I envy the most about you?

462
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:06,516
I think you'll

463
00:25:06,596 --> 00:25:08,074
never say anything nice.

464
00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:09,796
Do you still remember

465
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:10,914
our college counselor's

466
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:12,635
comment about you?

467
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:15,395
It is valuable for a person
to have self-awareness.

468
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:17,754
Bye-bye.

469
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:19,234
You're annoying.

470
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:32,115
Xu Kaixin.

471
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:34,395
Okay, Xu Kaixin.

472
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:35,634
Playing tough, huh?

473
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:37,155
You blocked me.

474
00:25:39,034 --> 00:25:40,195
You little...

475
00:25:50,794 --> 00:25:51,475
Time to eat, Mei.

476
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:53,395
Mei, let's have lunch together.

477
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:54,754
You guys go ahead.

478
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:56,115
The client proposed

479
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:56,756
a new request.

480
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:58,074
I need to finish the plan.

481
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,515
Okay, we'll go ahead.

482
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:01,234
- We're off.
- More work is coming.

483
00:26:01,675 --> 00:26:02,675
Can I get you anything?

484
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:03,994
Cold noodles.

485
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:05,395
Okay, sure.

486
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:07,754
Mei wants to eat cold noodles.

487
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:09,195
Cold noodles.

488
00:26:09,754 --> 00:26:10,754
Add some more chili.

489
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:13,208
(Xu Kaixin)

490
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:18,754
(Xu Kaixin: Okay, same time as last.)

491
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:23,115
(Mei Chengyi: See you.)

492
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:32,556
- A good location.
- That's right.

493
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:33,835
So after all these years...

494
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:34,914
Hello, Mr. Qian.

495
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:35,795
I'll introduce you.

496
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:36,395
This is

497
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:37,875
the owner of your mentioned shop.

498
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:38,556
His shop

499
00:26:38,636 --> 00:26:39,994
is now in a leasing status.

500
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:40,755
Hello.

501
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:41,336
Hello.

502
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:42,514
- Sit.
- Please sit.

503
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:43,876
I'll make it short

504
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:45,074
so as to save your time.

505
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:46,355
A major investor

506
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:47,356
of my company

507
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:48,795
really likes this street

508
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:49,714
and wants to rent

509
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:50,556
a shop there.

510
00:26:50,636 --> 00:26:52,554
The investor happened
to fancy your shop.

511
00:26:52,714 --> 00:26:53,875
If you are willing,

512
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:54,674
our investor

513
00:26:54,754 --> 00:26:55,675
is very willing

514
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:57,355
to offer 1.5 times the price.

515
00:26:57,435 --> 00:26:58,435
What do you think?

516
00:26:59,155 --> 00:27:00,275
Well, the thing is,

517
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:01,315
my place's

518
00:27:01,395 --> 00:27:02,515
original lease

519
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:03,474
hasn't expired yet.

520
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:05,274
If you drive the tenant away,

521
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:06,835
you'll have to pay them a penalty.

522
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:08,595
Yes.

523
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,394
Maybe I didn't make it clear.

524
00:27:10,474 --> 00:27:11,595
I'll repeat it again.

525
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:13,435
My investor is very generous.

526
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:15,036
If you are willing,

527
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:16,555
he can pay the penalty today

528
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,795
as a deposit to you

529
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,835
and pay the full amount in one go.

530
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:22,274
What do you think?

531
00:27:23,314 --> 00:27:24,674
If that's the case,

532
00:27:24,754 --> 00:27:25,914
we can make a deal.

533
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:26,954
Then it's a deal.

534
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:27,714
Deal?

535
00:27:27,794 --> 00:27:28,755
Deal, then.

536
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:29,434
Okay.

537
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:30,276
Wise choice.

538
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:32,355
Make sure to pay that deposit promptly.

539
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:33,194
I have to tell

540
00:27:33,274 --> 00:27:33,994
the tenant, right?

541
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:35,074
Rest assured.

542
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,355
We're back.

543
00:27:43,754 --> 00:27:44,674
Tell Mom we're back.

544
00:27:44,754 --> 00:27:45,914
- Mom.
- School's out?

545
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:46,635
School's out.

546
00:27:46,715 --> 00:27:47,794
Put down your backpack.

547
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:49,675
Lili,

548
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:50,474
later,

549
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:51,475
send Xiaomi back first.

550
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:52,595
I need to go out.

551
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:53,555
After that,

552
00:27:53,635 --> 00:27:54,914
take Xiaomi over directly.

553
00:27:54,994 --> 00:27:55,555
Okay.

554
00:27:55,635 --> 00:27:56,275
Also,

555
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:58,275
tomorrow is my first day
at driving school.

556
00:27:58,355 --> 00:27:59,155
I have to get up

557
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:00,315
a bit earlier than usual.

558
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:02,274
I will bring the cakes over first.

559
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:03,595
You get up

560
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:04,596
early enough already.

561
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:05,754
Does it have to be earlier?

562
00:28:05,994 --> 00:28:07,194
You want money more than life?

563
00:28:07,274 --> 00:28:08,955
The early bird catches the worm.

564
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,075
By the way,

565
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:13,154
Xiaoxiao called me and said

566
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,355
you blocked her.

567
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:15,435
What's going on?

568
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:16,994
I'll unblock her.

569
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:17,795
I forgot.

570
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:18,754
I'm leaving now.

571
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:20,434
Listen to Lili. Got it?

572
00:28:20,514 --> 00:28:21,315
Alright, just go.

573
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:21,954
Bye-bye.

574
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,034
Be careful.

575
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:25,274
Let's go inside.

576
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,835
Wait a moment.

577
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:37,675
We're renovating.

578
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:38,875
I can't hear you at all.

579
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:41,554
Did he ask you or not?

580
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:44,994
He did?

581
00:28:46,314 --> 00:28:47,275
That's impressive.

582
00:28:47,355 --> 00:28:49,074
Luckily, I talked to you in advance.

583
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:53,675
No, there's nothing going on between us.

584
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:54,994
I...

585
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:57,154
I went out for drinks.

586
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:57,796
I feared

587
00:28:57,876 --> 00:28:58,994
he'd be mad if he found out.

588
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,195
Thank you.

589
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:03,635
Make sure

590
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:04,994
you don't slip of the tongue.

591
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:07,155
Love you.

592
00:29:07,235 --> 00:29:08,635
Love you, my bestie.

593
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:14,394
Mom, you scared me.

594
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:15,674
What are you doing here?

595
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,795
You were talking so loudly
and said something

596
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,835
like 'don't slip of the tongue'.

597
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:21,395
What were you referring to?

598
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,275
The noise outside was really too loud.

599
00:29:25,355 --> 00:29:26,875
You must have misheard.

600
00:29:27,155 --> 00:29:29,154
I was talking to my bestie on the phone.

601
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,116
She said she bought

602
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:32,154
a set of pretty expensive tea ware.

603
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:33,954
I told her to be careful

604
00:29:34,034 --> 00:29:36,554
not to burn her tongue when using it.

605
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:41,115
Mom,

606
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:43,315
the renovation outside is so noisy.

607
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:44,715
You're not feeling well. Come on.

608
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:45,795
Please go back and rest.

609
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,355
I must keep an eye on it.

610
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,634
They're renovating my grandson's room.

611
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:51,074
I must oversee it.

612
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:53,034
Some people

613
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:54,515
are just penny-pinching.

614
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:55,994
If they use inferior materials,

615
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:57,914
there will be a problem

616
00:29:57,994 --> 00:29:59,395
with my grandson's future health.

617
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:03,554
I'll keep an eye on it.

618
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:05,034
Go ahead.

619
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:25,435
Please sit.

620
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:27,515
Please sit.

621
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:28,595
Thank you.

622
00:30:33,835 --> 00:30:35,234
(He gets more handsome)

623
00:30:35,314 --> 00:30:36,994
(every time I see him.)

624
00:30:39,074 --> 00:30:40,195
Hello, Mr. Mei.

625
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:43,794
Hello, Ms. Xu.

626
00:30:46,274 --> 00:30:47,795
Is there anything you need from me?

627
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,554
Just say it directly.

628
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:53,195
Well, the thing is,

629
00:30:54,554 --> 00:30:55,235
I...

630
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:59,034
I'd like to ask you to be my girlfriend.

631
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:02,634
(Did I mishear it?)

632
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:03,714
(Too good to be true!)

633
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:07,155
Don't get me wrong.

634
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:08,474
I haven't finished yet.

635
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,194
It's temporary.

636
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:11,875
You need to act as my girlfriend.

637
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:12,756
I can pay you

638
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:13,795
by the hour.

639
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,395
I won't waste your time at all.

640
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:17,474
(With pay?)

641
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:19,595
(And I can be close to a handsome guy?)

642
00:31:20,274 --> 00:31:21,595
(It's too good to be true.)

643
00:31:22,474 --> 00:31:23,835
(With so many scams nowadays,)

644
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:25,754
(is this a romance scam?)

645
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:29,034
Ms. Xu?

646
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:33,435
Well,

647
00:31:33,915 --> 00:31:35,474
l-let me make it clearer.

648
00:31:35,554 --> 00:31:36,076
Perhaps

649
00:31:36,156 --> 00:31:37,754
it can ease your concerns.

650
00:31:38,435 --> 00:31:40,274
My wife had a younger sister

651
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:41,754
who used to be abroad.

652
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:42,994
She's back in the country.

653
00:31:43,074 --> 00:31:44,515
She's been single and unemployed.

654
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:45,595
My father-in-law

655
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:46,316
tried

656
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:47,675
to make her and me be together.

657
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:48,796
Of course,

658
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:49,954
to them,

659
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:50,914
if I marry her,

660
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:51,675
my two daughters

661
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:52,875
will never be bullied.

662
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:54,674
But I would never agree.

663
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:55,316
So I lied

664
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:56,394
to them.

665
00:31:56,474 --> 00:31:57,914
I said I have a girlfriend now.

666
00:31:57,994 --> 00:31:59,875
But by chance, when we met that day,

667
00:31:59,955 --> 00:32:01,074
my father-in-law's friend

668
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:02,754
took a picture of us.

669
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:04,435
They took a picture?

670
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:05,954
That's exactly the point.

671
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:07,115
He now wants to evaluate

672
00:32:07,195 --> 00:32:08,195
my girlfriend.

673
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,755
So, to prevent him

674
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:11,074
from matchmaking wishfully,

675
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:13,395
I want to ask you
to help me put on an act.

676
00:32:13,554 --> 00:32:14,835
Do you understand

677
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:15,955
what I said?

678
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:17,154
I understand.

679
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:17,994
Good.

680
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:18,635
How about it.

681
00:32:18,715 --> 00:32:20,074
You help me with the act,

682
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:21,274
and I'll give you 500 yuan?

683
00:32:21,395 --> 00:32:22,395
Is that okay?

684
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:29,955
But I have a question.

685
00:32:30,994 --> 00:32:32,355
When I'm acting

686
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:34,195
as your girlfriend,

687
00:32:34,835 --> 00:32:35,516
do we need to be

688
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:36,714
very close to each other?

689
00:32:36,794 --> 00:32:37,515
Of course.

690
00:32:37,595 --> 00:32:38,395
If you're far away,

691
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:39,474
my father-in-law

692
00:32:39,554 --> 00:32:40,754
won't believe we're a couple.

693
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:44,274
How close should it be?

694
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,274
Like this?

695
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,195
Well, maybe a little closer.

696
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:51,474
This close?

697
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:53,074
A little closer.

698
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:55,274
Like this?

699
00:32:56,635 --> 00:32:57,674
It needs to be closer.

700
00:32:57,754 --> 00:32:58,914
Anyway, we're just acting.

701
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:00,234
My father-in-law will...

702
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:01,514
Wait.

703
00:33:01,635 --> 00:33:02,635
Sorry about that.

704
00:33:05,074 --> 00:33:06,435
We won't go that far.

705
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:07,995
Rest assured.

706
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:09,554
I won't take advantage of you.

707
00:33:09,835 --> 00:33:10,475
We'll hold hands

708
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:11,835
or put an arm on the shoulder

709
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:13,075
if the plot requires it.

710
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:14,595
I...

711
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:17,395
Let me put it this way.

712
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:18,635
I am

713
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:20,395
very professional.

714
00:33:20,714 --> 00:33:21,556
If I agree

715
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:22,754
to be your girlfriend,

716
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:24,275
I'll definitely get

717
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:26,115
fully into character in this process.

718
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:27,474
If the plot requires it,

719
00:33:27,554 --> 00:33:29,035
when it's time to be intimate,

720
00:33:29,115 --> 00:33:30,714
I won't back off.

721
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:31,596
Our goal

722
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,634
is to fool your father-in-law.

723
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:34,714
Do you understand?

724
00:33:38,195 --> 00:33:40,675
Okay, that's good.

725
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:43,955
Waitress, we'd like to order.

726
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,274
Xiaojiao,

727
00:33:46,595 --> 00:33:48,155
has Qian Hao been behaving lately?

728
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:50,876
Without his mother,

729
00:33:50,956 --> 00:33:52,234
we're pretty good.

730
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:53,754
When it involves his mother,

731
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,635
then it's certainly all my fault.

732
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,395
He is a typical mama's boy.

733
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:01,754
Haven't I always told you?

734
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:02,995
Qian Hao

735
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,955
is just a pretty facade,

736
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:06,794
with 'cunning' written all over him.

737
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:09,395
With your little wit,

738
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:10,554
he will chew you up

739
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:11,875
until not even bones are left.

740
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:14,994
Listen to me.

741
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,674
Divorce him quickly
and back out while you can.

742
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:19,835
Otherwise, you won't have good results.

743
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:21,755
Aunt, did you hear that?

744
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,394
My uncle is bringing it up again,

745
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:24,994
advising me to divorce Qian Hao.

746
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:27,195
Don't listen to your uncle.

747
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:28,554
He shouldn't have said that.

748
00:34:29,074 --> 00:34:29,796
Since old times,

749
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:31,795
people have advised reunion,
not separation.

750
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:34,554
I think Qian Hao is not a bad guy.

751
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:36,594
He is quite good to Xiaojiao too.

752
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,755
He is only good because of the money.

753
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:39,594
Hadn't Xiaojiao

754
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:40,674
had me as her uncle,

755
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:41,875
who could make him rich

756
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,194
and make things easier for him,

757
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:44,634
he'd have been different.

758
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:48,395
I've seen many people like him.

759
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,954
Qian Hao

760
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:52,074
is just an empty shell who is good

761
00:34:52,514 --> 00:34:53,755
at sweet-talking women.

762
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:54,835
Uncle.

763
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:56,994
Even if you dislike it,

764
00:34:57,074 --> 00:34:58,074
I will say it.

765
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:03,194
How about this?

766
00:35:04,554 --> 00:35:06,194
I have an idea.

767
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:07,674
Let's make a bet.

768
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:09,514
What bet?

769
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:11,875
Go back and tell Qian Hao

770
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:14,994
that I made a mistake at work

771
00:35:15,275 --> 00:35:17,554
and I might be disciplined
or even fired.

772
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:18,994
So for now, I can't help

773
00:35:19,074 --> 00:35:20,875
with his company's matters.

774
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:23,154
You have to act convincingly.

775
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:24,994
If he still

776
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:26,434
coaxes and indulges you,

777
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:27,994
I lose the bet.

778
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:29,594
I won't bet.

779
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:30,795
Why not?

780
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:34,955
What if I lose?

781
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:36,515
You are

782
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:38,634
sowing discord between us as a couple.

783
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,875
Uncle, you're not doing the right thing.

784
00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:42,235
Look at you.

785
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:44,154
You're clear-headed.

786
00:35:45,715 --> 00:35:48,154
For a marriage like yours

787
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:49,356
with such a man,

788
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:51,034
what's worth clinging to?

789
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:54,594
I just can't be without him.

790
00:35:57,715 --> 00:35:59,074
As the old saying goes,

791
00:36:00,114 --> 00:36:02,275
you can never wake someone
pretending to sleep.

792
00:36:03,154 --> 00:36:05,034
Now you're not even pretending.

793
00:36:05,594 --> 00:36:07,795
With open eyes,
you have three words on your forehead:

794
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:08,915
I am willing.

795
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:11,074
I am willing.

796
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:15,275
Ms. Xu, how about this?

797
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:17,315
About the specific details,

798
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:18,795
let's find another time

799
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,634
to rehearse in advance.

800
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:21,595
So now,

801
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:23,635
we need

802
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:24,356
to know more

803
00:36:24,436 --> 00:36:25,955
about each other's information.

804
00:36:26,795 --> 00:36:28,435
My father-in-law is an old sly fox.

805
00:36:29,715 --> 00:36:30,236
Well,

806
00:36:30,316 --> 00:36:31,674
I don't mean that as an insult.

807
00:36:31,994 --> 00:36:33,795
He is a lovable old sly fox.

808
00:36:34,395 --> 00:36:36,154
That is, he's not easy to fool.

809
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:37,114
He always asks

810
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:38,594
some weird questions.

811
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:40,795
We need to rehearse
the answers in advance.

812
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:42,554
Is that okay?

813
00:36:42,674 --> 00:36:43,875
Sure, no problem.

814
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:45,315
Then...

815
00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:48,634
The first question.

816
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:50,074
A brief introduction

817
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:51,795
about your parents.

818
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:53,554
I don't know.

819
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:56,835
I haven't told you, have I?

820
00:36:57,235 --> 00:36:57,876
I was raised

821
00:36:57,956 --> 00:36:59,074
by my aunt.

822
00:36:59,154 --> 00:36:59,676
I've never

823
00:36:59,756 --> 00:37:01,034
met my biological parents.

824
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:02,075
I'm sorry.

825
00:37:02,155 --> 00:37:03,715
I didn't know that.

826
00:37:03,795 --> 00:37:04,434
I'll tell

827
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,434
my father-in-law

828
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,236
not to ask those.

829
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:07,955
What's the big deal?

830
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,155
Being raised by my aunt, Lili,

831
00:37:10,235 --> 00:37:11,875
is a very happy experience.

832
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:13,755
You haven't met her yet, have you?

833
00:37:13,835 --> 00:37:14,395
She is

834
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:15,635
a very lovely old lady.

835
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:16,435
Is that so?

836
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:17,715
She is still single now.

837
00:37:17,795 --> 00:37:19,755
I'll make sure you meet her
if there's a chance.

838
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,554
That's good.

839
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:23,836
You're so open...

840
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,355
No, so cheerful.

841
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:25,955
She must be

842
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,395
a very lovely old lady.

843
00:37:28,994 --> 00:37:30,154
Then, the next question.

844
00:37:31,235 --> 00:37:32,994
D-Do you have property and a car?

845
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:36,676
Sorry.

846
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,154
For such a private question,

847
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:39,235
you can lie.

848
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:41,554
We're just rehearsing in advance.

849
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,316
You can answer

850
00:37:42,396 --> 00:37:43,434
without being so truthful.

851
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:44,994
I won't lie.

852
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:46,196
A lie

853
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:47,315
takes more lies

854
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:48,276
to be covered.

855
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:49,435
I can't do that.

856
00:37:49,674 --> 00:37:50,475
I intend

857
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,034
to tell the truth directly.

858
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:53,156
During the divorce,

859
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:54,795
my ex swindled away my place.

860
00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:56,355
I recently bought a car.

861
00:37:56,435 --> 00:37:57,594
I'm trying to get a license.

862
00:37:58,875 --> 00:37:59,835
Well...

863
00:37:59,915 --> 00:38:01,994
That's good.

864
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:03,755
Okay. And then...

865
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:04,554
One more important

866
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:05,316
question.

867
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:06,955
My father-in-law will surely ask you.

868
00:38:07,355 --> 00:38:08,634
Why you love me.

869
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:11,395
Pretty face.

870
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:15,554
Pretty good.

871
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:17,994
P-Pretty good.

872
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:24,994
It smells so good.

873
00:38:25,474 --> 00:38:26,474
You're back, son.

874
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,514
Mom, you're here.

875
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:28,474
I've finished cooking.

876
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:29,355
Let's eat.

877
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:31,554
Hu Xiaojiao, come out and help Mom.

878
00:38:31,715 --> 00:38:32,994
She left as soon as I came.

879
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:34,154
She went out.

880
00:38:35,674 --> 00:38:37,154
How can she be so thoughtless?

881
00:38:37,355 --> 00:38:38,194
It's okay.

882
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,594
I don't want to see her either.

883
00:38:39,715 --> 00:38:41,195
It's much more peaceful with just us.

884
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:42,275
No, Mom.

885
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:43,196
It's about rules.

886
00:38:43,276 --> 00:38:44,275
We must teach her

887
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,594
what being obedient is.

888
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:47,034
It's okay.

889
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:47,636
No.

890
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:49,034
Everything else is negotiable.

891
00:38:49,114 --> 00:38:49,755
Mistreating you

892
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:50,835
has crossed the line.

893
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:54,808
(Dear Husband)

894
00:39:03,355 --> 00:39:05,474
Xiaojiao, it's Qian Hao's phone call.

895
00:39:06,154 --> 00:39:07,554
Please answer it for me.

896
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:15,235
Hello, Hu Xiaojiao?

897
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:16,835
Where are you?

898
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:18,434
You left as my mom came.

899
00:39:18,514 --> 00:39:19,514
Why is that?

900
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:22,074
I'm just born to toil.

901
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:22,836
It's okay.

902
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,634
I can't stand being waited on.

903
00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:26,755
Hu Xiaojiao,

904
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:28,554
I'm telling you, hurry back.

905
00:39:28,795 --> 00:39:29,954
Overseeing our renovation

906
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:30,594
has tired Mom.

907
00:39:30,674 --> 00:39:31,674
Be more understanding.

908
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:32,914
Don't throw tantrums

909
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:33,716
at me all day

910
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:35,034
because you have your uncle.

911
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:36,236
Your uncle

912
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:37,675
is an old man about to retire.

913
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:38,955
How long can he protect you?

914
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:41,074
Think clearly about it.

915
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:43,474
The future is ours to live together.

916
00:39:43,554 --> 00:39:45,155
I've told you many times.

917
00:39:45,235 --> 00:39:46,554
If you disrespect my mom,

918
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,955
get out early.

919
00:39:53,795 --> 00:39:55,074
Say something. Don't play dead.

920
00:39:58,114 --> 00:40:00,195
I told you I ate too much.

921
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:00,876
You and Aunt

922
00:40:00,956 --> 00:40:02,594
kept putting things in my bowl.

923
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:03,955
Still on the call?

924
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:07,795
Hello, honey.

925
00:40:08,395 --> 00:40:09,674
What? You miss me?

926
00:40:15,554 --> 00:40:16,554
Where are you?

927
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,355
I'm at Uncle's place.

928
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:19,075
You know what?

929
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:20,434
I ate a lot today.

930
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:21,994
I just came out of the bathroom.

931
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,154
Weren't you the one

932
00:40:25,395 --> 00:40:27,474
who answered the phone just now?

933
00:40:29,034 --> 00:40:30,795
I was in the bathroom.
How could I answer?

934
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:32,434
Uncle answered it.

935
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:33,514
Didn't he tell you?

936
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:37,915
Hello?

937
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:40,235
Honey? Honey?

938
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:45,114
Uncle.

939
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:48,235
What's wrong?

940
00:40:48,955 --> 00:40:51,355
Qian Hao is very good. Especially good.

941
00:40:51,435 --> 00:40:52,194
Tell him

942
00:40:52,355 --> 00:40:52,995
I'm going

943
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,634
to give him a big gift next week.

944
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:57,355
Honey, did you hear that?

945
00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:58,795
Uncle is praising you.

946
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,474
He said he would give you a big gift.

947
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,835
Why did he hang up?

948
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:06,474
What's wrong?

949
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:07,594
Mom, I need to go.

950
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:08,994
Why are you leaving?

951
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:09,995
Has Xiaojiao

952
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:11,355
bewitched you with a potion?

953
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,074
A potion?

954
00:41:12,154 --> 00:41:12,876
If I mishandle it,

955
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:14,154
I'll have to eat poison.

956
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,514
You...

957
00:41:19,074 --> 00:41:20,355
What's going on?

958
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:22,074
He's so unpredictable.

959
00:41:27,594 --> 00:41:28,235
Ms. Xu.

960
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:28,955
Take a look.

961
00:41:29,035 --> 00:41:30,315
I've sent you the file.

962
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:31,676
- Okay.
- It's clear.

963
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,074
Let's not waste time.

964
00:41:33,235 --> 00:41:34,074
It basically covers

965
00:41:34,154 --> 00:41:35,035
the details missing

966
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:36,235
in my blind date profile.

967
00:41:36,355 --> 00:41:37,835
There are also the questions that

968
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:39,074
my father-in-law may ask,

969
00:41:39,154 --> 00:41:40,594
along with the standard answers.

970
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:41,276
You just need

971
00:41:41,356 --> 00:41:42,355
to memorize them well.

972
00:41:42,435 --> 00:41:43,435
Wait.

973
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:44,954
Why do I need to know

974
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:46,554
where you went to elementary school?

975
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:48,074
I was asked back then.

976
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:49,755
Fortunately, my wife anticipated.

977
00:41:49,835 --> 00:41:51,275
It's said to be about the depth

978
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:53,275
and breadth
when assessing a future spouse.

979
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:54,635
Before my father-in-law

980
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:55,515
retired,

981
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:57,474
he was in HR
in a state-owned enterprise.

982
00:41:58,634 --> 00:42:01,235
He is always
at the forefront of the times.

983
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,196
Since he retired,

984
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:03,434
he's upgraded himself yearly

985
00:42:03,514 --> 00:42:04,514
with the tricky questions

986
00:42:04,594 --> 00:42:05,994
in HR recruitment

987
00:42:06,074 --> 00:42:07,275
and even learned online.

988
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:08,475
Back then,

989
00:42:08,555 --> 00:42:10,074
when I first visited him,

990
00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:11,394
he asked me questions

991
00:42:11,474 --> 00:42:12,074
far beyond

992
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:12,914
the scope

993
00:42:12,994 --> 00:42:13,875
of the file you saw.

994
00:42:13,955 --> 00:42:14,594
But

995
00:42:14,755 --> 00:42:15,914
I'm not his son.

996
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:16,555
He won't

997
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:18,474
ask you those extreme questions.

998
00:42:18,795 --> 00:42:21,034
I just want you to be a cover

999
00:42:21,114 --> 00:42:23,235
so he can quit being the matchmaker.

1000
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:24,835
Look at these questions.

1001
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:26,755
Your two daughters' birthdays.

1002
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,114
Your ex-wife's memorial day.

1003
00:42:28,194 --> 00:42:29,514
Each of the daughters' favorite

1004
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:31,394
colors, animals, cartoon characters,

1005
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:32,276
favorite foods,

1006
00:42:32,356 --> 00:42:33,674
and allergenic foods.

1007
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:34,716
Listen to me.

1008
00:42:34,796 --> 00:42:35,914
By your standards,

1009
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:37,074
you'll have to stay single

1010
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:38,795
for the rest of your life.

1011
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,154
That's too harsh.

1012
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:41,514
How about this?

1013
00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:42,634
I think

1014
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:44,155
maybe you shouldn't find a wife.

1015
00:42:44,235 --> 00:42:45,875
Just find a robot instead.

1016
00:42:46,674 --> 00:42:47,674
Well,

1017
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,156
I think

1018
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:50,554
these questions are okay.

1019
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:52,914
Since I'm getting remarried,

1020
00:42:52,994 --> 00:42:53,876
shouldn't being good

1021
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:55,435
to my girls be the first priority?

1022
00:42:55,554 --> 00:42:56,275
I'll surely treat

1023
00:42:56,355 --> 00:42:57,034
my stepchildren

1024
00:42:57,114 --> 00:42:58,114
